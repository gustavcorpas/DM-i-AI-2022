4,Sept 20 Update:  I still like this speaker but noticed two issues that annoying busy signal (think phones) sound when the charge is running low ... I dont mind a beep or a tone as long as it's every so often (not like every 10 seconds .... not saying this speaker does THAT ) .... but this is a LOUD tone and it has waken me up out of a dead sleep it's so loud ... I rather a low tone and if the battery goes below a certain level ... it JUST shuts off or something.The other issue ...admintting I got mine used-like New is that from time to time it disconnects for no reason it seems and/or a odd ... I dont know how to describe it ... but ... hit your desk with your fist ... not hard but ... if you do you hear the occasional sound it make from time to time ... like a random "thump" in the middle of anything your listenhing to ... again MAYBE that is just mine .. the audio still plays and sounds good ... but I am not sure what is going on with this sound that I ADMIT doesn't always happen but it has happened "enough" to make me know it's not a one time only thing.One other thing I have noticed is that when i move this speaker (not like I move it when it's connected to something often) .... it's like it starts to disconnect even if it's VERY CLOSE to what it's connected TO ... none of my Tribit or my one Oontz speakers do that.  It USUALLY doesn't lose the connection entirely ... but it does cut out a bit when this third issue I just remembered happens-------------Update after a little bit more usage - I have to say mainly using this at night at lower to medium volumes at most and alot for listening to some relaxing genres of music ... the details of the lows mids and highs all get lost at really low but audible volumes but I'd expect that with any speaker.Comparing this to the Tribit XSound Surf and my Oontz Angle 3 Ultra ... there is NO "Boomy" base but sometimes that is not a bad thing ... If i turn the volume up from say low to a low-medium level and then even say to a medium level the details come up more and ... well if you are a "Bass head" you may want to look elsewhere if you listen to alot of bass heavy stuff and need that "extra thump" that something else may offer.  There IS bass dont get me wrong and for the genres I always was planning on listening to this speaker most with ... there is a good balanced sound including bass.Not to get too off topic but it's like a "dish" (food) with your favorite ingredient in it ... even if it IS your favorite there is a "too much" level.  SOME other speakers can even reach that level (ingredient in this metaphor = "bass") where the bass muddies up the mids and highs.  While MAYBE I wish there was a touch more bass by default .. I rather it sounds like it does with a little "too little" and I can try to EQ a little more back in.I am not saying no other speaker sounds this balanced or clear but ... if you get this DOSS Soundbox ... you are getting a clear balanced good sounding speaker.  One more thing ... i said this in my review and i still mean it.  The bass is best when you are at least generally in front of the speaker at while at most at a medium volume level ... I cant say this is the case for full volume but sometimes say if you are in the back of the speaker or the speaker is really low compared to your head ... the bass can sound even lower than if you are more level with the speaker.  I did notice this with the Soundbox Touch but to a point most ... especially "non-360 degree" speakers (typically round with a speaker inside facing in each direction) ... probably have this same "issue"One more thing I forgot to mention (I think) is that late at night while i am glad I do not have one of the Soundbox Touch's with the voice prompts just say tones and whatnot ... I noticed that unlike some other speakers like when it turns on and it makes that sound signifying it's conected .. that is "loud" ... during the day it's no problem but like i said late at night it can seem a little bit loud and it doesn't seem to be tied to what volume level you have set on the speaker (I know i dont have it close to full blast.So right now I'd say my "Cons" with this speaker are the (A) lights not having a time out before the go off (say 20 seconds or something would be fine by me ... I am not picky or anything... I dont care if i even control it ... heck .. if i am listening for awhile 1 "full minute" may seem like a little too long but really even that'd be fine ... they are nice lights I just wish to say save battery and use it late at night that there was an option to turn them off while you dont need to see them... and (B) the prompt noises while better than video revies I have seen of the voice prompts the earlier models may have had ... seem loud all the time ... I'd say at least make them tied to the speaker volume for instance ... if you have your speaker at 25% volume you dont have a "100% volume" audio notification that you are connected.Really these two things CAN be improved but overall (still haven't say fully ran the battery down and recharged it so i cant speak on battery life) I am VERY happy I bought this speaker.  If i really want to be nice to DOSS I can say those two issues are me "nitpicking" .. even if it could use a touch more bass at times I will not even include that in MY "con" list overall now ...The look and feel (say with the touchpad lights) I dont see on other brands and ... I do like the overall look and functionality.  Still glad I purchased this.... if the lights always being on is not an issue for you (it's just bright depending on your use-case ... that's all) ... and if you are not a "bass head" that loves tons of extra bass in EVERYTHING ... I still say so far I'd TOTALLY recommend this speaker.I too have noticed that just like one of the "top reviewers" said ... when the battery gets low the speaker makes a loud buzzing sound similar to a landline phone (non-wireless i mean) busy signal ... it's pretty loud and woke me up out of a dead sleep yesterday ... i dont even mind the sound per-say but the volume was set low (listening to light jazz at night here) and the buzzing was REALLY "loud" when it started.  this is annoying.  nothing that makes me "hate the speaker" but this should at LEAST  be equal to the volume level the speaker is set to ... out of nowhere hearing a loud notification buzz like that is jaring to wake up to.Tip: I knew this already but somehow tricked myself ... I knew due to other reviews ... when charging the red "led" is UNDER the cable .... the LEDs in question are NOT the lights on top... i just went to charge mine and didn't see any light and somehow forget I read about the red led being under the charging port.------------Original review (below):Background: I have a few BT speakers now including a LFS (ASIN: B07BPXJYQY) Item model number 180; a Braven BRV-1 and three speakers new to me which include a DOSS Soundbox Touch a Tribit XSound Surf and an Oontz Angle 3 Ultra.What I value (even knowing this is in the budget range and even just in video reviews I know some higher end speakers say some JBL’s are overall better at this) is sound quality and really balanced sound.  I don’t mind a good thump to the bass of a track when it’s suppose to be there but I am not a fan of headphones/speakers that add an extra thump when it’s not suppose to be there (say Smooth Jazz or Classical music that sounds like it has a subwoofer-like rumble for no reason).-------------------------I also have to note that I have given this speaker a few days and listened to a few different random genres and tracks I’d normally listen to while testing but I have not even had this speaker long term.Without spoiling this review right at the start I will summarize by saying even with “Con” or two…. This speaker was one I saw pop up a great price and I wasn’t initially planning on getting but what I see of the maybe $25.99 to $27.99 “regular price’ on Amazon … IT IS worth even that if you ask me.Pros:- Build Quality – I am not going to act like I opened it up and looked at the circuitry and all of that but this just feels “heavy” (vs sometimes you get a tech product and it feels like there is nothing to it…they could be tricking me somehow but everything on the outside and that little weight it has … I feel like the company DID NOT cheap out on stuff trying to just save $$- Sound Quality – OK I have to admit I am impressed with the sound quality of this speaker though I have to admit anyone considering themselves a “Bass head” may be disappointed.  I have seen some reviews on this and even one video review comparing this to a JBL Charge 3 (a speaker that in every video test/review I have seen the JBL Charge series seems to be the best when put against almost anything in this lower price range…. I mean it was not really a “fair” fight)Bass wise I value balance but at FIRST I thought this speaker lacked bass but not anything terrible … something you could “EQ” back in.  I then used an EQ app and it has an extra (separate from the EQ itself) “Bass Boost” slider that is basically like a half circle.  I got to about 1/3 of the way up before I didn’t like the sound as much… the extra bass I added sort of made the mids and highs not as clear… so then I turned the bass boost off and just used EQ settings I’d use with any other headphones or speakers … and honestly I thought “This IS tuned just right bass-wise already”.IF YOU really need that extra “thump” more than a more balanced sound… than maybe out of the speakers I have I’d say look at the Oontz (even if not the Ultra).Bass wise I also noticed something else…. With the speakers facing forward if my head is not say somewhere near being “in front” of the speaker… say the speaker is on a low coffee table vs where I am sitting … the bass seems lower … if I am SOMEWHAT on the same level as the speaker… the bass  like I said a paragraph or two ago still isn’t what is in some other speakers … but the bass levels in my testing are “just right” at that point …. balanced enough anyway.Mids and Highs I will not say are clearer on the DOSS Soundbox touch than the others but I will say they are balanced and clear .. RIGHT where I like them.  Other than the Oontz Angle 3 Ultra which is not “bad” but does sound like the bass radiator is trying to be too “boomy” sometimes (remember what I said about say Classical and Jazz) which makes the Oontz one of my least favorite that I have for sound quality alone … This DOSS is on par with any of the others but like I said so far I am not saying I can say one of those others is “better” than another.Actually I can also say this not only about the DOSS but the Tribit Xsound Surf and the Oontz too…. I LOVE the sound quality of the LFS Speaker.  It was my first BT speaker really however an issue it has is why I started to look for a replacement/alternative ….especially when connected to Bluetooth my speaker makes a medium volume electrical hum/buzz sound … PERHAPS my LFS is defective but whatever that is not the point.  At lower volumes if I listen closely to say this DOSS Soundbox or the Oontz I can hear a faint “hum”/”Buzz” but I REALLY have to listen close… meaning this is no problem to me in these speakers. (I have least experience with the Tribit so I excluded it there but I am sure it’s the same).If anything like I said the Soundbox could use a TOUCH more bass but in my view … TOTALLY “EQ”-able (Equalizer).- Light (Pro and Con)I really like the lighting and I’d say it’s mostly a PRO… they are bright and clearly easy to read.  The ONE reason I mention “con” is just a suggestion to DOSS and a note to anyone thinking of buying this considering certain use cases.  The lights on the top DO NOT turn off when the unit is on .. now in a dark room this can even perhaps add ambience or something but I would just like to see a timeout.For example have it go out after maybe 15-25 seconds and have sensors (even if not the entire way across the top) where if you have your hand SOMEWHERE near the buttons the lights come on so you can see what you are pressing in the dark.  I cant say how much this may effect the battery life with the lights always on and after looking into it others have asked the same question wanting the lights to go off at some point.Not to get off topic but apparently in I think some earlier releases of the Soundbox Touch there was a voice prompt when doing certain things and I saw some say “I rather not have that” or “I wish I could disable that” .. and on my unit there are more beeps or tones and no voice.  I say all of this to note that I think DOSS takes feedback from people … so in maybe a “next gen” Soundbox Touch there will be a light time out sort of feature.  I do give credit to DOSS for this.- ButtonsSo far I’d say the buttons are all REALLY responsive without being too sensitive.  For example with the volume … I found that if my finger is going clockwise or counterclockwise and “slips off” the blue… the controls still work… I don’t have to lift my finger up and make sure it’s always on the blue…. It’s like “yeah I know you still want to raise or lower the volume .. .no problem”.  Not counting once where I carried the speaker while it was playing having my hand cover the entire time hence where all the touchpad buttons are … I have not had mis-clicks where something happens when I don’t want it to nor have I had issues where I have to hit any buttons repeatedly because it didn’t recognize the press.- TF Card slot – Other than the Braven and the LFS with the buzz/hum issue … The Oontz and the Tribit Xsound Surfs do not have a TF Card (note: old name for a micro SD card that you can buy “everywhere” … that is what TF Cards are I see some users are confused if they are some old propriety  card or something .. nope .. just another name for microsd cards).  This is not a make or break think for me but while I can hook up one of my mp3 players and use it’s battery up too with a 3.5mm to 3.5mm cable to these speakers … the fact I could just put a microsd card with music I have on it already directly into the speaker… I really like that feature.- Bluetooth – I cant say this is the best BT or anything but for me once it’s recognized by any device I tested and paired up it connects fast after that… just turn the device on … speaker on and it’s seen/connects pretty fast in my view .. .no problems there.----------------------Summary – I would note again “bass-heads” should look elsewhere but if you have your expectations set right (aka this is a budget level speaker)…. You want good “bang for your buck” balanced sound and even a speaker that has features and a look (say the lit touchpad controls) that I have not seen in other speakers at this price range… I totally recommend this speaker.  I think even with all of my comments on the bass… overall quality wise … this speaker “punches above it’s price range” even if it cant be on the same level as say a JBL Charge … though I have to note you ARE paying a bit more for the JBL in that case.Again … I totally recommend this speaker even at say $25.99 to $27.99 regular price (more than I paid for mine for the record)----Addition when posting review to Amazon – Sound quality I gave this a 5 out of 5 stars but really I’d say my true rating is a 4 to 4.5 out of 5 (because of that above 4 part I bumped this up to 5)… I say that just to note this is not “the BEST SOUNDING SPEAKER EVER” … don’t get me wrong… I LOVE the sound but some positive reviews I think overstate how good some of these speakers in this price range sound.  They just go a tad overboard to me and that may make some people feel let down when it’s not “perfect” sound when they get their product based on the reviews they read.
5,I love the size if this speaker..The sound quality is amazing & I listen to my music loud..It connects beautifully The first time & automatically every time afterI love the SD card option..Thats an amazing addition to a speaker in this price range..The battery doesnt last as long as Id like but I run my speaker for 7-8 hours at times..Thankfully it works while plugged in & there is no difference in sound quality...Ive had many Bluetooth speakers at a wide range of prices..You do not need to spend hundreds of dollars to get a great sounding speaker..This one does not have a strap or case so I cant say it would be the best for portability like camping etc..I use mine at home and for that its perfect..Ive also taken it with me when I stay in a hotel & its the perfect size & shape for packing & with the sd cardthe music doesnt depend on anyones cell phone!
5,First off the product is great - performs as advertised.  But that's not what I found surprising.  In today's world there is essentially no customer service - long wait times having to hear that "their menu has changed" and employees most often located across the world in a country that barely uses English.  Well not at Doss.  I experienced a minor difficulty and called them but realized their service department didn't open for another hour.  To my shock April a bright and courteous young lady called me back (I didn't request this) to see if I needed help - before they opened!  Solved my issue in two minutes and off I went.  April was outstanding and I will go out of my way to recommend Doss for quality products but mostly for exceptional customer service.
5,Not good!  Here we go again!!  Have this since 2019 and i biught my second one because the same thing happened.  I didn’t return or complain because I just thought it wore out!  I had to write!  The piece wear you charge it seems to wear out! So it cannot be charge! No red or green light! Loose and not connecting.  Insane and not good. I am not buying another and I really feel I should be compensated!!!  Such a shame because it was a very nice sounding product!
4,First of all for the price the sound from this speaker is great. I wanted a speaker that had an SD Card Slot Bluetooth and good battery.The 'plus' is the Aux Input.The 'minus' is it's not waterproof.What I didn't know I wanted (kind of assumed it would have but didn't think of) is shuffle mode. Every time I turned it off and on it would play the same songs...in the same order. That's all well and good for long listening sessions but I use this for outdoor work grilling kitchen cooking...usually no more that 40 minutes at a time.But reading other Amazon reviews they indicated that you can email the company for a firmware update to offer shuffle play. It wasn't on their website and the downloads there didn't install...but reaching out to the company (support@dossav.com) did (with a couple back and forths) get me the info needed (firmware attachment and instructions) and it worked well.All that said BIGGEST CONTINUING GRIPE: So with the firmware update it does play my songs shuffled...but it still always starts with the same 5-6 tracks. It's still recent enough that I haven't figured out the pattern but my hope is that this would play my SD Card tracks shuffled and not revert to the first  track (of the albeit shuffled tracks) every time I restart it...I want to hear my music without having to have a 3 day-straight listening session.Overall with that for the price and with this audio quality it's worth it (if it was an $80 speaker it'd be 3 stars).It would be even better great if:-You could have it default to playing SD card (or bluetooth) as you'd prefer...but now when you turn it on it defaults to bluetooth which is not my preference-It would not repeat songs when turning off and back on...just keep playing (I point to my Anker Soundcore Mini which is fantastic at this and really what I'm going for with this device)-It was waterproof. Yeah that'd cost more but it'd have everything...it's difficult to find a good speaker that plays SD cards and is waterproof.
5,I love this speaker!  First of all great color so pretty but more importantly it's a terrific speaker.  It's easy to use and I have not yet been able to wear out the battery; not that I am trying - I'm just surprised that it lasts so long.  I was painting my bedroom the other day - six hours - and the speaker was on the whole time.  Really really like this little dynamo.
4,Good styling and looks nice. Sounds not so great. This is sufficient for use in the classroom but I wish it had more bass tones. Not a bad purchase for something to keep at school but if I were buying for home I would spend a little more and get something nicer.
5,Nice speaker BUT...it poops out after a year. I don't recommend it. I'm now purchasing from another company 11 months later. It refuses to charge. Useless speaker now. Very disappointed 😞 I'd give it all 1 stars but I did enjoy it random times during the 11 months I was able to use it. Save your $30 and buy cheaper!
5,Well this is my 2nd. Like another review mine went wonky after 3.5 years. It would not turn off or connect. It would just beep. We could not figure out where the sound was coming from since it was inside its case. It just came on my itself. It was a big mystery for a while. Aliens?? Ha!!  There had been no problems before.  Because the sound quality is so absolutely AWESOME!!! I just order another. For 29.99  I just had no choice.  That is pretty cheap for 3 years. Buy it!!! I got  the bright turquoise blue again. Still gorgeous.
4,I bought this unit 3.5 years ago and until four months ago it was fine. Now the device never turns off and constantly tries to connect to Bluetooth devices. Even after I hit “Forget this Device” the DOSS still wants to connect which makes the which makes whatever I’m listening to stop playing . The speakers go so far as to  stop my car’s radio playing as the car decides which device to connect to. Also the speakers do NOT TURN OFF. They will stay on until the power runs out. I hold down the power button which makes the lights blink and it makes the on and off bleeps repeat over and over BUT it never turns off. For 3.5 years the speakers were fine for listening to news and podcasts at home. Alas no longer. This DOSS speaker was fine while it lasted.  Time to get something new.
5,this boy is mad impressive I’ve had it for 6 years and used it a lot and still works like new. quality isn’t on par with UE Boom but def gets the job done. great go-to speaker
5,I did some research for the best Bluetooth speaker under $20 (as of Nov 2020). Finalists (that I bought) were:- DOSS SoundBox- Anker Soundcore- OontZ Angle 3 (3rd Gen)The DOSS SoundBox and Anker SoundCore were comparable in max volume. However the DOSS SoundBox had a better bass due to its larger size. The Angle 3 did not compare at all in terms of volume or bass.The best rugged speaker would be the Anker SoundCore. It has a sturdy compact build with little room for water or dirt to make its way inside. It also has nice tactile buttons. Bluetooth connectivity is great with very little "hiss" during quiet parts in songs.The best bass-y speaker is the DOSS SoundBox. It packs great volume and decent bass (for its size and price range). The battery life is great. I've never run out of battery even after playing music for 5+ hours.Moving on to the Cons for the DOSS SoundBox:It has a noticeable "hiss" during quiet parts of songs but that's if you are listening closely. It also has a habit of shutting off momentarily during silent parts of songs (probably to save power) which cuts out the audio for a bit. If these are things you can't have go for the Anker SoundCore.Overall I rate this a 5 stars because it's the best Bluetooth audio speaker I could find for the price.
5,I am a serious audiophile fan very picky on speaker sound. I have used/tested 7 or 8 Bluetooth speakers and DOSS is my choice. It produces very clear balanced sound and when needed it can be reasonably loud. It just beat every other brands I have tested straight up. Also this company have excellent after sale service. My 3 years old DOSS ran into some issues and the company responded promptly and solved the problem for me (Thank you Joey!) I would recommend this product and this company without any hesitation.
5,I bought this during COVID ‘20 and needed to give a very honest opinion. So here I am in Sept. 2022.Two years later and this speaker STILL WORKS as if it was the first day I bought it. I don’t remember the price I bought it for but whatever it was I 100% think it’s worth it now. Clear sound love the touch volume adjustment connects with my Bluetooth devices no problem and best part of it all extremely portable. When the battery is low it makes the loudest dial tone. Truly a tiny yet mighty speaker!!!I love this speaker and would definitely recommend to anyone and everyone.
5,This little box is surprisingly loud. I use it in my classroom and frequently have to turn it down! The sound fills my room! I’m not sure about battery life because every time I use it it’s plugged in.
5,This thing is amazing. It's lasted forever. The sound is great and it's very durable. Great for the beach or river. The battery does not last as long as I'd hope but I still get at least 3 hours out of it.
5,This is a power box in little packaging! I’m so excited to say that sincerely it’s very awesome tho as said you need to use the volume from your Bluetooth device it’s not an issue!! Love the size and quality! Nothing is more great than a buy I love!! Get one if you’re looking for a good smaller one you won’t be disappointed I know!
5,Little guy packs a punch! Perfect for the kitchen or bathroom. Super easy to connect with your phone and the buttons are quite sensitive as well. I could see this being used in a dance studio or on the go in the office. Would recommend
5,Bought this speaker because the one I previously had was hard to hear. I drive a truck with a reefer running all day (very noisy) I was very happy with the volume this speaker could reach. My coworker also wanted to know where she could get one. Surprised at the reasonable price.
4,I love itbut it can be a little louder
5,The speaker sound was great everything is good just the battery dies kinda quick
5,Really great sound quality and easy to hook up to. No complaints here!
5,I had been looking for a nice blue tooth speaker and when i ordered this product I wasn't really expecting much but this product is wonderful. I highly recommend it. It is light weight I bring it out with me when I'm working in the garden the heat doesnt seem to drain the battery. I love the design look sound and light weight. I recommend it.
4,Good sound. Hooked to iPhone and tablet.
5,I'm 60 years old with limited knowledge of what is considered a good product.  I actually love this speaker. It's very simple to use  the charge life is fantastic.  The only minor issue I have encountered is the connection.  Sometimes it is slow to connect.  It's portable light weight and easily stored. The charging port is compatible with my phone charger. I actually purchased for myself after my hearing my daughter's DOSS therefore I recommend.
4,Overall its okay
4,Speaker connected easy enough.  The volume is good but u need more for a party.
5,Needed a speaker for my phone for tunes while playing in the garage. Read a lot of reviews and this guy stuck out. It's sound is great for my needs and can easily be heard over my work and it's compact to move around anywhere. The battery seems strong so far as I have not had to recharge it as yet. So far quite pleased.
5,I LOVE THIS SPEAKER. I WAS NERVOUS TO BUY IT AS YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU ARE GETTING. THIS SPEAKER IS AMAZING. WE WENT CAMPING FOR 5 DAYS AND USED IT ALL THE TIME. THE BATTERY DIDN'T NEED CHARGED UNTIL WE GOT HOME. THE RANGE ON THE BLUETOOTH IS GREAT. SPEAKER IS LOUD AND CLEAR.
5,My daughter has used this little speaker for years now and it’s still working perfectly
5,Astonishing sound for such a small form factor.
4,The speaker wasn’t bad but lasted only 2 short years. Try to pair it with several devices recently only to find out the speaker wasn’t working. Email the company and they provided suggestions but to no avail and since the warranty was up that was the end of communication.  Needless to say went with another brand. Too bad they didn’t offer a discount for a new one - their loss!
5,Goldilocks sound not too much treble not too much bass.  Very clear sound.  Also the battery life at our listening volume is incredible - took two months to run it down to 20% on the first charge.
5,I like how well the sound is
5,Best speaker I’ve ever had
5,My husband absoluloves this speaker.
5,The speaker is very easy to use. It looks nice in any setting. And it is easy to use everywhere. It was well worth the price and it’s a must have if you like to listen to music on your phone.
5,I bought this speaker to work from home and love it. Great sound clear and good battery life. I've been known to turn it up loud if I'm cleaning & it sounds great with no distortion. Would buy again!
5,Portability. User Friendly
5,Truly a marvelous speaker for your personal time
5,It is the best speaker we have bought it is small practical to carry everywhere it sounds good good volume excellent acquisition totally recommended
5,I love Doss speakers I had bought one about 2 years ago and it is still going strong.  I had to buy another one for work.  I highly recommend this product it is inexpensive and works just like the real thing Boss so don't miss out on it.
5,It was a nice little speaker I had originally purchased for my classroom. We watch videos depending on the lesson. Turns out my little speaker was stolen by one of my students when I was out for surgery. Nothing was done about it. So far school will purchase a speaker but no this one. One from staples. However they never got back to me so they probably won't. Not sure if I should get another speaker. I'm done spending money on students just to have things stolen! Other than that it was a great little speaker.
5,Cool speakers
5,I was a Lil doubtful about the speaker. I bought the red color fabulous. The sound is clear and loud! You can also adjust the sound on the speaker aswell which is cool. The charging is good it'll give you a green color when it's done👍🏻. I definitely recommend it!
4,so far seems like a quality product at a competitive price
5,It's sounds better than I expected and louder.  It's easy to setup and use as well.
5,It sounds great!
5,
5,Tech stuff drives me crazy but I set this up in 2 minutes. Good sound. Easy directions. Automatically pauses music and rings for an incoming call. Press a button and talk. And a good price.
5,I use it to listen to music podcasts radio stations etc.  Battery life is pretty long.  I charge it about once a week after using for 1 1/2 hour everyday.  If you subscribe to Apple Music you can use the app to use the equalizer to improve the sound.  If you are used to premium quality speaker like Bose don't expect the same.  But for my purpose this is great.  Note:  You do need a USB-C cable to charge this speaker.
5,I bought this 5 years ago.  It's been used on road trips by the pool camping around the house.  Been dropped multiple times by my 1yr who loves to hold the music and dance.The sound quality is solid.  The Bluetooth connectivity has never had an issue.  And the battery still holds a charge.  That's more than most electronics can say after 5 years.
3,in general I've been wanting a speaker replacement and this fits my needs for now. it came fast and for 33 dollars its really decent with good battery life and on top of that it has USB-c to charge it up which is great to charge if you're on a rush or on the go. the sound it sounds great with a bit of EQing but if you arent EQ'ing the treble is more present than the bass but generally the bass it's still audible  but my guess for the treble being louder has to do with the speaker being loud enough in a outside setting which is a win but overall it sounds good but it can sound a bit better with a 3rd party eq app (sorry apple users EQing in this format wont work for yall so disgreard EQing as a whole). the speaker can handle about 5 db of extra bass without it sounding distorted at around 310 Hertz. once it does I turn on a limiter and it sacrifices a bit of loudness but thankfully through bluetooth it gives me a lot of headroom for volume loudness so at the end of it I'm not sacrificing loudness with EQing. Aux wont work the same unless theres a powerful dac involved to increase loudness. now to talk about a dent on this product not only it came in 2 boxes it somehow has a dent? not sure if this is meant to show where the charging port is but everyone should know how a usb c port looks like. 4/5
5,Excellent value and surprisingly good sound. Thinking about ordering a second one.
4,I love it so far
5,sounds really good 👍🏼
4,Good buy. No regrets
5,This is a great little speaker. We love it. Sound quality is great. Battery charge is excellent.
5,too new to rate battery life.  User friendly and great sound for the money.
5,Excellent sound quality (bass and volume) for a small speaker. Very easy to connect to Bluetooth. Bought it for some outdoor workouts we are doing.
5,I've had mine for a few years (I bought in 2018 - now 2022) so I shouldn't probably complain too much about the battery life getting shorter. It's easy to recharge with miniUSB to USB cable.Cons:1) The back button got pressed too hard and it never behaved well after that (it takes a lot of maneuvering to get it in pairing mode.) Could be a little more rugged.2) The interface on the top is a bit cryptic - especially when you haven't used it in a while.3) It says it's an outdoor speaker but... No.Overall a great speaker for the price.
5,This little speaker has great sound. Pleasantly surprised by the quality of construction and the sound. Would recommend. The phone feature works great also!
5,It's a very good speaker for it's price I wish the sound had better bass but for it's price I think it's pretty a decent sound
5,
5,I didn't expect much but was surprised by the fullness and quality of the sound
5,when it comes to any speaker under $50 i’m skeptical but since the day i got it it’s been my favorite speaker the battery life is insane it’s went multiple days without a charge and the sound quality has always been top tier the bass is loud but not loud enough to ruin the sound in any way i used this as a replacement for my beats speaker and has outperformed not only my expectations but my experiences with the beats (at least for the price)
5,This small  speaker has big soundThe sound is incredible you definitely get a lot more for your money what a great bargain.
5,Great little speaker to use with my cell phone.
5,I accidentally knocked the speaker off my counter and into my dog’s water bowl. I was happy to find out that the speaker is waterproof. It still sounds amazing. Best speaker I’ve ever had in a while.
5,Absolutely love this little power house! Great sound quality and easy to connect to my devices!
5,Super cute. Doesn’t take much space and sounds good for its size. No problem with connection and the functionality is 💯
5,Love it
5,Excellent and powerful sound easy to connect volume / track control on top with finger touches or swipes along with other connection options. You wouldn't be disappointed!
5,Easy to use and great sound! Pretty loud for how small it is.
5,This is a great product for the price offering personal music for all your playlists on your iPhone
5,Good speaker.. the only issue is the battery dosen't seem to last as long as it should other than that its worth the money for sure
5,This was easy to connect and has really good sound for a small speaker.  It is very convenient and doesn't take up a lot of space.
5,I bought this four years ago and it sounds as good now as day one. It's small so it travels well and it's sound is bigger/better than I expected and I don't think I've ever taken it past fifty percent volume which is plenty loud. It's a take anywhere unit that has resided in my one car garage/mancave from the beginning but my wife and I also enjoy it on the backyard patio and now anywhere we take our camper. This is my first venture into the world of Bluetooth technology and with so many products to choose from I can happily say I got it right the first time. Are there better products at a higher price? sure but for my needs and likes this one does the job and better than I expected. I enjoy this speaker so much I bought a second which arrived today and is currently on its initial charge. So in conclusion I consider this an intimate use speaker to be used while I relax reading or visiting with friends or just enjoying music I have not used this in a party setting requiring a lot of volume but I imagine it would do just fine.P.s. The box it came in is pretty sturdy so I plan on using for transport purposes.
5,Works great in my wood shop great value for the price
4,As stated the LED light that shows charging status does not light up.. I have no way to tell if it's received a full charge.. Sound is OK for a 30$ speaker and Bluetooth connectivity is spot on.. Just received it so I will update if things change...
5,Well true to the reviews this one is a huge WIN.  My wife and I are both musicians and love listening to music when we have the time. I have bought several Bluetooth speakers and will compare this one to the venerable older Jam Plus [the good blue one that people hunt for] and the Oontz Angle which I bought shortly after this one.  The short answer is that in this price range I don't know of anything that will do a better job than the DOSS with its well-reviewed shortcomings.  To do substantially better you need to spend substantially more.The Jam is great because it works everytime is easy to pair has good-enough battery life and makes a lot of noise no matter where you put it. It has warmth which a LOT of smallish BT speakers flat don't have.  The very good Oontz Angle sounds great and is very simple: much simpler than the DOSS - it has no volume control so nothing to mess with there to confuse you. The Oontz fooled me - when tested by itself you would swear it is the best sounding mini-sized speaker on the market at the price range. But when I A-B'd it side by side with the Doss Touch the Doss is clearly more capable. It is louder than the Oontz given the same source feeding both. It is almost too loud too efficient in that if you want it very very quiet you'll be very glad it has that touch-volume control on the top.  The Oontz is not as Big sounding but is very warm because of the good design with a downward-port as well as the face port so sound reflects the surface it is placed on.  In an Automobile/Truck as many Oontz reviewers have said you can plop the Oontz in the windshield-dash "V" and it will make a lot of noise!  Perfect for that if you need it.  If I had not had the Doss I would have been thrilled with the Oontz - can't go wrong either way.  But the Doss starts off clean and crisp and has great "transparency" of fidelity. Run the volume up high and it remains clear - Absent a signal so strong that it would "clip" at your iPad or handset or whatever the Doss does not fade or break up.  If you are looking for a Boom-Box this isn't it [the ones that are are expensive and often uni-dimensional not hi-fi].I personally listen to Classical Music when I am working on computer or just busy around a room - the Doss is sublime for that type of music format. If you set it on a table in a spot where there is no under bracing just a wood top it is really in  its element. Though not 'down-firing' in design it moves that table like a diaphragm and the rubber feet and mass of the unit keep it well-planted. I sometimes place it in a "hutch" we have... one of the old fashioned kitchen keeper hutches with a raised top and open area at the middle. The sound from back in that chamber is magic.Like other reviewers I don't like the audible signals from the Doss - very annoying when someone is sleeping and you flip it on but Doss has provided firmware switching so if you are even partly competent at downloading and installing the patch to a micro-SD you can switch off the audible signaling [and more... see their support site].  The Jam by the way is also annoying in that respect but we've put up with it 'cause it is a good speaker that "just works".Bottom line: BUY IT.
5,Excellent speaker for the price. Love the color shape and portability. The sounds is good not high end but definitely worth the money. I love that I can take it anywhere to play music and not have to worry about being overly careful with it. It feels sturdy. Only negative is that you can only control the volume from your phone but you get use to it and given that you are more likely to have your phone with you it is easy and becomes second nature.
5,It’s small and simple to connectCharges really quickly!Great purchase and great price
4,Others I bought would connect to my TV set and at times x object to my neighbors. This one for the price has features we all would use. Battery life is great. But too much bass
5,Most speakers are trash in this price range.  This one sounds great! Lots of bass and easy to use!  Would definitely recommend.P.s. i am not a bot....ROLL TIDE
5,All in all an excellent little speaker. I will use this in my classroom where space is at a premium. I can't really evaluate the battery life because I haven't had the speaker very long. The sound does get a little fuzzy at really high volume but I never need to have it that loud. The sound fills the classroom and that's what I was looking for.
5,This speaker has been GREAT! The sound is beautiful the battery lasts for a long time (I play for hours at a time without running out) and it hasn’t disconnected once. For the price this is a steal
5,I really like it is good quality and perfect for my room
5,This is an amazing speaker for $30! Best sound quality in any little Bluetooth speaker I’ve ever bought. Years ago when I started getting Bluetooth speakers I spent $100 or more and they didn’t have enough durability for the $ so I started buying them around the price i paid. for this one but this one is far superior!  Even though this was like 14% off or something I’d pay full price. Unless it poops out on me in less that a year or something I would buy again.
5,I’m using this speaker with my Mac. Wish I could use both the wireless & the Mac’s speakers together.
5,Good speaker to play my music on.
4,I used this in my work truck today and was nicely surprised at the quality of the sound. Nice little speaker for a small area.
5,I've had mine since 2018 and still works like new no issues. Really great quality loud has great base touch pads work well easy connection perfect size. Battery lasts a long time even with hour's of use. Highly recommend!
5,Loud little speaker easy to use great quality for the price
5,I purchased a black Doss speaker about 3 years ago and throughly enjoyed using it. Great sound and easy to operate.  But out of the blue it started to come on and connect on its own. I would shut it down and it would be quiet.  A week later it started to sporaticallly come on and then shut down all on it own.  This kept up until it would turn on and immediately shut down and turn on and shut down and would not stop....I finally had to throw it in the dumpster because there was nothing I could do to get it to stop.  Very annoying listening to that!  I am going to purchase another since I was so pleased with it to begin with.  I hope this was a fluke and this one will last.
5,Posted 6/8/2020I recommend getting some magnetic USB charging tips for this speaker.  It makes it so much easier to charge the speaker without fumbling with the micro-USB connection especially in the dark.  You can use a single charging cable and charge iPhone USB-C and USB-micro connections - just get the plugs and cord near each other and they magnetically connect.Pro's - Capacitive touch for volume adjustment and play/F-FWD Rewind and Pause.  Great if you are using the speaker in the dark. - The buttons listed above are lit by LED's so you can see them in the dark easily without fumbling around by memory or guessing at what button you are pushing. - Great depth of sound! - Projects sound farther than you would think! - Very nice looking speaker.Neutral point - With these great touch buttons it is easy to hit a wrong button while laying in bed and trying to flip the speaker down to muffle sounds when it gets immediately loud.This is on the larger side of Bluetooth speakers but they used that to their advantage in adding bass to the speaker and it lays exceptionally well.  I was working outside in the yard and connected this to my phone to play music while working in the lawn.  I turned the volume up about 75% and that was plenty then walked out and worked in the lawn a little not far from the speaker.  Then the mail came and I was about 60-75 feet from the speaker and it sounded almost as loud as when I was 10 feet from the speaker.  I was shocked at how well the sound projected then I felt bad because I was sure at that point that every one of my neighbors could hear the music whether they wanted to or not so I turned it down.We also use this primarily in our bedroom for watching TV.  It allows us to watch shows like "The Walking Dead" with the TV turned all the way down and with the speaker close to us the nightmarish sounds do not bother our daughter down the hall.  However as I said this speaker projects so we still need to close the door or turn on a fan in her room to totally block out sound.I love this speaker and if it holds up well I'd definitely buy it again.  Right now we've had the speaker about 2 weeks now.  I haven't really tested the battery longevity but so far I'm very happy with this speaker.  If I have bad results I'll update the review.
3,Affordably great at $24.99 discounted a bit overpriced at $36.00When I hit the road and want a speaker to 'throw in the suitcase" I use my trusty Satechi Divoom (now out of print) or something like this:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01E738RUK/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1There's always that longing however for what I call the "Plunk It Down Instant Party" STEREO speaker box.This is 6.5" LONG  2 & 5/8" DEEP (thick front to back)  2 & 3/4" TALLIt has some heft / weight to it.  I will probably think twice before throwing it in my suitcase for a traveling light trip.  I'm going to guess it weights 12 oz to 1lb.  If anyone has bothered to weigh it let me know.PROS:  I had the DOSS at 100% internal volume and my FIIO X3 MP3 player at 85% volume it got substantially loud in an uncarpeted 14 X 14 office room.  I did not hear any major clipping or speaker breakup.  It has enough bass that you can feel the top half of the deep synth snarl in Coldplay's "Army Of One".  It did not walk around on the table during that test - stayed put.CONS:  The highs are fairly directional.  It took me a few minutes to realize the midrange is * slightly * nasal / veiled / smeared.  Unlike my son-in-law's Foxx (brand) speaker which I covet the highs and the mids on this Doss are not as effortlessly "rich" or clear.  The mid / high frequencies are certainly perfunctory / presentable if a bit ...dry?  This is an initial impression.  BUT REMEMBER - IT'S A THIRTY DOLLAR ITEM.  What do I expect?  (Everything!  but let's not go there...)On the other hand the Foxx speaker my relative has was probably more expensive.(His model is out of print it's a bit smaller than this unit but correspondingly probably has less bass).SUGGESTION:  If you buy this put it in a corner shelf about 4  to 4.5 feet off the ground.  You'll get the optimum bass "oomph" out of it and gain more audible high frequency output.My saga of eternal torment:  So I buy this on a "discount" at $30.99 and 2 days later it drops down to $24.99.  Auuugh!INTANGIBLES:  I own a lot of stereo equipment.  Part of the appeal with this was:  I was thrilled to NOT have to buy another black box with square corners audio (or anything!) device.  So yeah they got me with the cute little blue speaker.OTHER FEATURES:  Water Resistance if real is nothing to sneeze at - a Plus.  I have yet to test that.  The TF (MicroSD) card reader - meh it's a frill but hey it's free for those who want to hassle with it navigating songs with no display.  It has a beentsy charge indicator light but it won't be obnoxious in a dark room.ACCESSORIES:  DOSS provides in the box a Micro USB cord  a 3.5 mm stereo audio cord and a dark charcoal colored faux leather drawstring pouch for the whole shebang.DISCLAIMER:  I tested with the 3.5mm cord.  I personally never use bluetooth as there's always some compromise in either sound or your sanity.  I'm old skool OK? Unapologetic.  It's simpler for me to just plug the damn thing in.BOTTOM LINE:  It's a decent value at $24.99.  It's an "OK" buy at $30.99.  It's a bit overpriced at $36.00  It's not a BEOLIT neither is it crap.  It's a perfunctory product with some style brought in at a price.  I rate the sound quality at 3.0 the value at 3.5 stars.  Music will fill your roomspace at a moderate to decent volume and it will have semblance of bass.  Expect perfunctory but presentable midrange and highs.  Like I said placement can improve the high dispersion.  You could use this as a quick background speaker for an impromptu party - I just wish the highs and midrange output were a bit more...artsy?  (That's my audiophile craving speaking.  I own Celestion and ELAC speakers at home.)  At $24.99 you probably can't go wrong for what you are getting here.  It can always be a second "in a pinch" system.UPGRADE SUGGESTION:From the reviews I have read if you have more like $80 to spend and want something at the next level consider the JBL "Flip 3" or "Flip 4" speakers.
5,I love this little speaker. High quality design and works great.
4,Very good products highly recommend! Good quality for the value and the speaker has a really long battery life. Very happy with my purchase!
4,I purchased this speaker primarily as a computer speaker to play music while working and listen to podcasts or news. The sound quality is good but it really seemed to lack depth. Music was fairly flat but voices were fine. I won’t knock down the points too much but the sound range seemed to be more for movies news and occasional music. So I ordered the Anker soundcore 2. In a side by side test the sound is similar but the depth of sound was better with the Anker. What do I mean by depth of sound. Well some speakers sound as if you were in the middle of a concert when playing music and others sound like you are in the bathroom down the hall and the music echoes off the walls. The Doss isn’t the bathroom sound but more like walking down the hall towards the concert where the music sounds nice but distant. The Anker is not quite inside the concert hall but standing just outside the door where the music is clear crisp and has better depth including Bass and the depth and clarity of voices. I returned the Doss and kept the Anker. It’s not a bad unit it has a good sound quality. The Anker was better for my purposes
5,I use this speaker inside my apartment for my computer and phone and I love it.
5,The sound quality is exceptional.  It is easy to connect to bluetooth and you are in business faster than you removed it from the box.  I love this speaker.
5,Using as am echo device speaker very easy to connect sounds great
5,Excelente artículo
5,I bought 2 and we love em. Great for folks with hearing loss. We use them on our tv’s.
4,Good speaker for the price.  A lot smaller than I thought.  Not very loud.
5,I bought this expecting it to be cheap but it’s actually really nice I’ve used it with a projector and even on the boat and working on the truck.
3,I am a cheer coach & use this speaker at practice. Initially I was really happy especially since it wasn't terribly expensive. I've had it about a year now. The volume used to be great but is controlled by the phones volume. It's inconvenient to have to adjust it every practice but not something I can't work with. By March no matter how high I turn up my volume it just isn't adequate. I don't blast it so it isn't blown. There isn't any staticy sound. Over the summer my husband connected his phone to it to play music while we were in the swimming in the backyard. Now it won't connect to my phone at all. I've reinstalled it but it's still a no-go.I'm disappointed to say the least.
5,Sounds great for the price. Well worth buying.
5,I purchased this speaker five years ago and it still works perfectly. This speaker has been left outside during rain snow 100 weather and still works like an absolute beast. Beyond impressed ordering one for my little brother and another one for myself just because!
4,I just really liked it! Perfect for space and loud enough to dance.
4,Nice room-filling sound with various types of music. A bass/treble adjustment would be welcome and voices could sound more clear.
5,Worth the price and does a great job putting out load quality sound.
5,Good sound easy setup
5,Muy bueno excelente sonido
4,Good speaker. Like being able to change songs from the speaker
5,Really hits all the needs of someone wanting to just listen to great quality music!
5,Love this speaker sound is great would buy it again
5,I use this box daily. Today as I reached for it I wondered if I had ever reviewed. *gasp* I had NOT! Checking the date I purchased this Doss sound box on a deal of the day 3 years ago this month!It has a long battery life. Has paired quickly and easily with a lot of devices in that time. Has been beat around a bit with no ill effects. But... the sound! THE SOUND!!! Audio books to classic rock the sound quality is so rich so clear!  I've had other boxes which all got donated. Once you experience this box you won't be able to stand to listen with another.  Just buy it!
5,When purchasing my recent TP Link I neglected to realize just how many connections I needed for my home network.  This did the trick!
5,This littlr speaker sounds really good for the cost. Good bass and highs. I like that I can put my music on an sd card and not use my phone. But the bluetooth is super easy to pair. Distance from the phone is not far. Maybe 6 to 10 ft. Im going to get another.
5,Oh
5,Great product. Thanks!
5,I originally purchased an Anker Soundcore for use in my RV (2018 Forest River Grey Wolf 29TE Patriot) because the A/C is so loud when it's on that we couldn't hear the TV.Backstory:We like to watch movies in the evenings when bugs prevent us from enjoying the campfire. For some reason my RV is wired for DVD/HDMI but only the video. No matter what I tried I couldn't get the audio from the DVD player to play on the built in speakers. The audio comes out of the TV fine  it's not very loud (rear speakers) and the A/C drowns it out when it's on. To solve this problem I purchased a TaoTronics Bluetooth 5.0 Transmitter. Using an optical cable it transmits the audio via bluetooth to the built in receiver...perfect! I finally had sound from the TV coming through the built in speakers. Well that was great until we lost our RV in a flood. We ended up getting a 2020 version of the exact same RV but this one had a different built in receiver. Unfortunately it doesn't perform the same way as the old one. This one will connect to the transmitter but it's very weak and choppy.I decided to try the Anker Soundcore and it connected to the transmitter flawlessly and sounded great but it was slightly delayed from the TV and there was an echo. I turned down the TV and that solved the echo problem but you could clearly see/hear the audio lagging behind the video. Unfortunately this did not work but I've decided to keep the Anker speaker because it's a pretty good speaker and I'm sure the kids will like having it.I decided to try the DOSS Touch speaker which is at the same price point as the Anker and it worked perfectly. No echo and the audio matches perfectly. I've since ordered a second one and have them both connected to the transmitter at the same time. The speakers are in different spots in the RV and gives a cool surround sound affect. I have one of them a good 20 ft from the transmitter and the connection is very strong.To expand on the debate between the Anker Soundcore and Doss Touch they both sound good but in different ways. The Soundcore has lower bass mids and trebles while the Doss has less bass and slightly higher mids and trebles. So I guess it really depends on the type of music you listen to. If I had to choose one for normal situations I would probably choose the Anker. It just sounded slightly better to my ear with the type of music I like. But both are great speakers and the Doss worked better for my situation.
5,I like that it’s small but loud enough to take to the beach. Very easy to use and charges quickly.
5,Easy to work. Quick connection. Good sound.
5,I have my kindle read aloud while I’m doing something around the house. Work well!
5,Great Bass response Easy to move around Nice sound Built in music by Doss didnt like their selections.
4,I bought this speaker several years ago and I used almost in a daily basis. Now that I am working from home I connected it to my PC so I can hear some music. Also I use when I make some work out in my home. The only negative thing is that when I have to connect the speaker to the USB so it could recharge the battery you can hear some static of course is very low and the moment you play the music you will not hear it any more but it seems like a minor flaw for me. For the price I think that little issues like this are expected.
5,It’s so perfect in my opinion. The color is beautiful exactly what I wanted and it gets loud enough for me as well. Happy I picked this Bluetooth speaker
3,I keep in my office plugged in it's pretty annoying that it turns itself off all the time. So I can't just connect and party I have to flip the thing over to get to the rear tiny power button. If you're gonna have it turn off all the time why not have a power button on the top with all the other controls so it's easy to get to. I could see this helping if it was on battery power but not while plugged in pretty lame.
5,Amazing little speaker thrilled with it!
5,This is a great specker it has great sounds and the light on top of the specker come and off when you trun it on and when you trun it off
5,It was very difficult to find a speaker that didn't automatically turn off after 15 minutes. You can get a firmware update to this speaker that lets you turn off auto shutoff and it works. I wrote to support@dossav.com. They responded within a day and asked me the order ID and a picture of the label on the speaker so they know which version to send. After I emailed the info I immediately received an email back with the firmware file attached. Here are the instructions they sent to upgrade the speaker:1. Please copy and paste the .TU2 file onto a micro SD card (of 32 GB or less capacity).2. Please insert the micro SD card into the TF card slot on the back of the speaker first，and then turn on your speaker. (the SD card goes in upside down).3. The speaker should automatically update the firmware with flashing green quickly. Once the update is complete the speaker should be "click" and shut itself down.This all worked as promised and it now stays on. The sound is very good and the bluetooth connects easily. The only problem that I have with it is the flat touch controls. Give me knobs any day. I had a hard time getting it to work with zoom at first because there's a mode control but you have no way of knowing what mode you're in because it toggles through 3 different modes ... bluetooth wired and play an sd card. Between getting the zoom settings right and finding the right mode it wasn't easy at all and I almost sent it back. I finally got it working but found that it worked best using the speaker for sound out but my pc speakers for microphone. Once I got the setting right it works perfectly. I just turn it on and there's nothing else to do. The sound is much louder than other small speakers that I've purchased so overall I'm very happy with it.
5,Bluetooth works well sound is great.
5,I have had the speaker for years now and I have been so pleased with it! I have used it every single day for years and it's still perfect! I would buy it again but I don't need to because it's absolutely wonderful!
5,Had to read the reviews before buying :)Love it love it !! I really recommend it you won’t regret it.
5,Really surprised how nice this sounds for such a low price on a small speaker.
5,The sound is amazing! It's sleek and unobtrusive wherever it's placed. Totally worth the reasonable amount of money I spent. Yay!
5,UPDATE!!! I've had this speaker for several months now and find it my "go to speaker of choice".  The overall sound is pretty good with a high volume output without distortion. One of the greatest speakers features is the TIFF card mode. I have one inserted (16Gbs)  and it plays music ALL DAY!!! I even dropped this onto the concrete which created a very small chip of the end that hit the concrete first however no rattles or indication of any damage whatsoever other than the chip which you have to look for.. I'm thinking of buying another one in the color of red to compliment the color of my laptop. Update!!! I had customer service rep. contact me to find out what problems I was having with the unit. I was sent a new DOSS speaker which arrived a day after it was mailed! That was fast and very impressive!  Okay so here we go.  I charged the speaker until the indicator turned from red to green then I proceeded to blue tooth the connection to my iPod which it did without any problem whatsoever (unfortunately the original one that I received was having problems connecting to my iPod) so the new DOSS passed the connect process and I played music for several hours and it never shut itself off (which the original did) The detail in sound is pretty impressive for a unit so small and it is loud (folks be sure to turn your blue tooth transmitting device iPod iPhone Android etc. to full volume) Then I adjusted the volume of the DOSS to FULL! (the volume in the first one started to not being responsive when adjusting using the blue ring) So after listening to it at full volume for a minute or two I turned the volume down to the level I normally listen to music with which is about halfway.  The sound is REALLY great with details of crisp treble full and smooth vocals and bass that has a punch without sounding boomy like some other blue tooth speakers do. I'm thinking about buying and giving some of the DOSS speakers to my relatives or friends for birthdays and/or the Holidays. SO forget about my bad review of the first one that I received which failed miserably however the second DOSS works very well with the overall design features sound and impeccable customer service was very exceptional and worth the price!I was expecting to be blown away with all the positive reviews but was left disappointed.  EVEN with AUDIO connected and flowing this unit would turn itself off every 15 mins.  I read the reviews about this problem but thought that it was a auto 'off' IF NO SIGNAL IS PRESENT.  That was clearly not the case as every 15mins. while listening to my tunes IT WOULD SHUT OFF! Not cool! Also there were problems with the volume control which is a cool design but mine was not working properly. Going clockwise to increase the volume or counter clockwise to decrease the volume it was sketchy at best. Nonetheless I'm returning the speaker for a refund.  I really wanted to like this but mine had too many problems for a blue tooth speaker for me keep this. BTW the sound was great!
5,I was searching high and low for a Bluetooth Speaker to use with my existing Stereo System. I wanted to keep the AMP Turntable CD Player but ditch the Wired Speakers.  To this end I also purchased a Bluetooth Transmitter (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00P20TFWM).  I narrowed down the choice to the DOSS Touch and one other similarly priced speaker with similar specs.  The DOSS was a bit cheaper and was 12 watts instead of 10. I planned to put it in a fairly large room (approx 17'x 19' living room  open to a similar size dining room).  I received my package and immediately tried pairing the speaker to my phone directly and playing some music.  Totally smooth pairing and VERY GOOD BIG sound from the small speaker!!  Easily filled the space.  Then I attached the really tiny little transmitter to my Amp's headphone jack and held my breath while it paired seamlessly with the speaker.  I put on a vinyl album and got good sound (crackles and all) through the speaker. Very loud room filling sound. As expected BASS was a bit lacking and quality wasn't that great at higher volume. If I could I would probably subtract 1/2 Star for this but balancing the AMP volume control and SPEAKER volume control yielded pretty good sound at the sweet spot and I was more than happy.Next I put a CD in the CD Player  and sound was better.  Old vinyl old needle probably responsible for some of the problems.  My old AMP was also being a little recalcitrant about the response from the equalizer. Still Room Filling and satisfying and VERY LOUD.Then I tried the TAPE OUT from the AMP  to the Bluetooth Rx/Tx box. As expected the AMP volume control didn't have any effect but by controlling volume on the speaker itself I could get what seemed like better sound probably due to the TAPE OUT having some pre-set levelling.Net result: SUCCESS!  Of course I would have preferred the separation of real stereo speakers (could have spent more on a pair of Bluetooths...) but the little Speaker that Could provided very good life for legacy Vinyl and CD's with the added benefit of ultimate portability of the battery powered speaker. What a concept! I could move the speaker almost anywhere (Living room dining room kitchen) and have great sound!Overall sound was BETTER when streaming music from the iPhone than from Vinyl or CD's. I guess pure digital vs. Analog wins unless you have much higher end components than I do!!The DOSS Speaker was even better than expected but of course not as good as the SONOS  PLAY:3 or the PLAY:1 speakers I have for all other Music needs. Had I never experienced SONOS I probably would have been totally Blown Away by the DOSS Touch.  Certainly given the Price differential between the $29.99 Bluetooth Speaker and the $200-300 SONOS I think I got pretty good BANG for the BUCK.Very happy with my purchase! Only worrisome thing is that when I charged it it was on the charger for more than 2 hours and the red light never went out.  Seems to work OK and I don't expect to run it for HOURS at a time but I hope it is charging correctly.Item was delivered quickly (PRIME!) and was well packaged and exactly as described.
4,It's a great little speaker. I use it daily at work great sound quality. I like the compactness of it and how easy it is to connect.
5,My husband and I purchased this for when we are doing fix-it projects around the house. We both have been impressed with the sound quality of this little speaker. The only issue that we have run into is if we both have Bluetooth turned on on our phones the speaker does not always allow the right phone to connect. The easiest fix is for one of us to turn off the Bluetooth on our phone while the other connects to the speaker.
5,I bought this for music I listen to on my ipad. It is awesome! Base is just enough it sounds like a huge stereo system. I can easily take it anywhere  it is small and light. I bought one for a friend I love it so much. She loves it too!  Highly  recommend.
3,My main need for a speaker was to be used as a microphone for virtual calls. This does not do that. I've tried on multiple different calls and no one was ever able to hear me. Speaker seemed fine otherwise but for this use it isn't an option.
5,Awesome speaker for outdoors and indoors etc. Sound quality is nice!!!!
3,Good sound for the money but has some quirky issues:- Micro SD card (ie "TF Card") is very finicky and sensitive on several fronts: I would write this feature off as a throw away feature- Random Bluetooth disconnects (that should not be related to battery or distance)Details:SD Card Issues:- Initially I bought a 32GB Silicon Power micro SD card off Amazon opened it up fresh out of the box copied some mp3 to it shoved it in the back of the speaker switched modes to the card and the speaker blinks for a few seconds then shuts down did this several times same result.- Googled the issue support claims you need to have this formatted as FAT32.- Shoved the micro SD card back in the computer checked the format yeah its FAT32 which just about every micro sd card would be formatted with out of the box.- Did some more Googling I found frustrated users swearing they had a FAT32 formatted card and it was not working met by the support department taking the attitude it was a user error if there is an issue it must be because the user does not understand what it means to have a FAT32 formatted SD card.- Being knowledgeable in this area I started to hypothesize that the problem maybe a little more nuanced there are different versions of FAT32 embedded devices aren't like full blown OS'es and can't necessarily handle all the different versions.- I took a look at the partition table of the Micro SD card and the first thing I noticed was there was a small amount of leading unformatted free space before the FAT32 partition an embedded device might get thrown off by that.-  I decided to blow away the partition table and reformat the SD card.- Using Ubuntu 16.04LTS (a linux operating system) I reconstructed the partition table as an MS-DOS table with a single FAT32 partition no leading unformatted free space all new FAT32 formatting.- Copied the same mp3 files back on to the freshly formatted SD card put it in the back of the speaker switched mode and viola music playing from the SD card!- OS maybe important here because the FAT32 format from a Linux OS can vary from the FAT32 format produced by Windows I am not saying a Windows produced format can not work in this speaker it might be fine or it might work with one version of Windows and not another (I am by no means testing this product to figure out what works and does not).  Also it may have been that unformatted free space was throwing off the speaker not sure.  However it is definitely more nuanced then "make sure you card is formatted with FAT32"- Now with music playing off my SD card new problems arose.- First up some mp3s it would play at like half or quarter speed but most at normal speeds.- Second sometimes you hit an mp3 it refused to play and it would just shut down so you would have to delete those mp3s or re-encode them.- Which brings me to my next problem its sensitive to mp3 encoding as well.- I eventually wrote this feature off as worthless just decided to play mp3s off another device and Bluetooth the sound output over to the speaker.One little nicety I didn't really think about was this speaker was it has a microphone built in and Bluethooth phone controls I actually started making a conference speaker out of this since its louder and clear then built in laptop or phone speakers/microphones.  However I get random Bluetooth disconnects when I do that from time to time so it is not very reliable.It has worked out well for playing music over Bluetooth but that is it so far.
4,I bought this speaker to watch movies on my iPad and it’s my first time buying a quality external speaker so I don’t have a lot of experience in that area. I’ve up till now used the very low cost ones. I think the sound is great while watching movies. However even at full volume I wish it went a little louder. The battery life is fair but the more hours I watch it seems to need charging more often. The price was good so if I get a few years life out of it I’ll be happy. No problem at all with Bluetooth or switching between devices.
5,I love this product the best!!!
5,I actually used this little speaker for my wedding reception music and it worked great!!! I had about 70 guests to give you an idea of the room size. I connected to my wedding album on my Spotify list. We did not do a dance but Guests enjoyed it!
5,I love this speaker it lasts for hours
5,Only drawback is it doesn't hold a charge well while not in use. I always recharge it before use. Upside is it charges relatively quickly.
4,Good little unit
5,Speaker can be easily connected to laptops/phones. Great for outdoor and indoor usage.
5,I now have 2! One for outdoor beach or pool music or inside to expand my movies ! Great speaker !
3,Connects and plays via BT with my phone easily enough however I couldn't get it to play directly from a memory card.
5,Nice sound great quality really cute
5,Strongly recommend this device. Easy to connect to smartphone. Great sound and small enough to fit anywhere in your residence.
5,I opened the box removed the speaker and plugged it in then opened Bluetooth on my phone and connected in a heartbeat.  Listened to music all afternoon.  This product is easy to use and has good sound for it's size and price.  I heartily recommend this speaker!
4,Haven't used the Bluetooth feature but the card works great for what I need it for.
5,Ideal UserAs a person who has her music playing all day whether it be doing homework just relaxing getting ready in the morning or getting ready to go out. This DOSS Bluetooth speaker has kept up with everything. If you are someone who enjoys having music on to start your day or get you pumped for a party purchasing a speaker like this would be great. If you need study music on to keep you focused or music to keep you sane this soundbox is perfect for that. Going back to school this year I knew I wanted a Bluetooth speaker however; I did not want to spend a fortune on one either. The DOSS Soundbox was a great option because if its superior price ($29.99) and all the features it comes with. So if you are someone who wants a high-quality speaker and is on a budget this speaker is the one for you.DesignOut of the four colors the speaker comes in I chose the black design. The size is perfect to just slip in a backpack or any bag you have. The sleek and modern design easily fits into any environment and looks more expensive than it actually is. The speaker also has touch sensitivity that allows you turn the music louder or softer on and off etc. The touch has worked smoothly and I haven’t run into any problems.Sound QualityThis speaker has clear tone and can get VERY loud as you start to turn it up. The speaker sounds great in small rooms or larger living spaces so you can easily use it on your bedroom or in larger open areas when you have guests over. The bass is also incredible for the speaker’s small size and portability. I’ve had the speaker for almost a year now and the sound has not cracked once since using it. The battery life is long lasting; you will be able to use the speaker all day without having to worry about it shutting off. If the speaker does need to be charged all that is needed is a micro USB which does come with the speaker.ConnectivityI haven’t had any trouble connecting to this speaker and not once have I needed to connect my phone with a cord. So if you just want to set you phone in one room and have the speaker in another it is no problem at all. It is easy to connect the speaker to many other phones and all you have to do is disconnect your own phone. Also there is a mode setting on the speaker so you can to connect other things such as a laptop to the speaker as well.All in all this speaker is wonderful and you will definitely be happy with this purchase if you make it hopefully your search for the right speaker ends here!
5,Love it easy to connect and the battery charge lasts a long time the built-in mic is great when I have it connected to my phone..
5,I am impressed with the sound quality of this small speaker. It picks up Bluetooth very quickly and the battery lasts a very long time I still have not had to change this and I use it about every day now for about three weeks since I first received it. The bass is just right and nothing ever sounds tinny or off Very happy and I will be purchasing again.
4,Pretty good speaker. Very very loud. Louder than any other speaker I have. Every so often the sound just randomly goes really quiet then back loud. Also you have to be pretty close to it for it to connect to your phone. Probably about 10 feet. Also the sound when it’s about to die is very loud and abrupt. But when it’s working (95% of the time) it’s great!
5,I received my DOSS Touch Wireless Bluetooth speaker on May 13th 2019.  My only complaint in nearly four months of use is that the Battery Status Indicator was completely inoperative out of the box—and still is.  This has not been a problem for me maybe because none of my other Bluetooth devices have this feature.  So far as I can tell it does not detract form normal use.  I have heard the “low battery; busy signal” only once because I deliberately ran the battery down to see what it sounded like.Admittedly it is not in league with Bose Bluetooth speakers I have heard… but it did not cost $150 - $600 either.  For my use the fidelity of this speaker is totally adequate.  It has amazing bass for it’s size—which makes it very portable; very handy.I especially like the Micro SD card capability.  My current 24 mp.3 songs use 71.5 MB (About 3 MB / Song).  According to a layman’s rough calculations my 32GB card would hold about 10000 songs.  I can’t imagine needing more than that.  It would be nice if it had a “real” mp.3 player with play lists artists genre etc. capability.  If I decide I really need those features I can always go to Bluetooth mode and play them from my phone.Another Plus is the battery endurance.  I am not a “daily” user and my normal volume level is very likely considerably below average.  I have no idea how many hours I get form one battery charge but whatever it is I am happy with it.  I think I have charged it about once a month.Before I purchased the speaker I was a little apprehensive about the “complicated” controls pointed out by some.  One purchaser even claimed the controls; especially the volume control confused his 80 year old father.  I am 80+ years old and I fail to see how the controls could be more simple or straight forward.  If you have ever used any kind of music player the control functions are obvious—maybe excepting the volume control which should not need to be explained more than once.Yes.  I recommend it to my friends.  And hopefully their battery condition indicator would work.
5,Update #2After the first bad experience with this speaker which was made right with DOSS I ordered another one because once the problem was corrected I liked the speaker!  I liked it so much I order another one for use at work!  The second works as good as the first (second one)!  Sounds good easy to setup and works fine!  Good speaker for the price!UPDATE!!!After a poor experience with the speaker Chelsea with Doss customer service reached out to me to discuss and make good on the problem.  It appears that the software to update the bios that keeps the speaker turned on passed the minute minute mark may have been damaged or corrupted.  She was/is a very nice person and went above and beyond to send me a new speaker with the software already installed and updated!  Kudos to DOSS for customer support.  I can report that I haven't used the speaker very much yet due to other things going on; however I have used it enough to know that it works perfectly and is more than i expected it would be!  I can now recommend buying this speaker!  I'll be buying another one at some point to use at my office!!I got the speaker.  I realized after I got the thing 1) It easy setup and connects quickly!  2) Sound is very good in my opinion.  3) The problem is that it turns off/disconnects after 15 minutes and you have to re-setup.  The manufacturer says this is a built in feature designed to save the battery.  They also say if you don't want this to happen you can do a software update/flash to stop it.  I followed the instructions by the manufacturer and completed the update.  I re-connected to my device and guess what....update didn't stop the problem!  It still disconnects/turns off after 15 minutes!  If this doesn't bother you then it's a good solid sounding speaker.  I HATE having to reconnect every 15 minutes...it's pain!  Just know the software upgrade they suggest...may or may not work......in my case it did not!!!  Disappointed for sure!!!
5,It takes some time to get a full charge but it will last most of the day. I bought another one so when  one charges I am using the other one.Jim J
5,For the price it is well worth it
5,Great sound and loud for the size of the speakers. Highly recommend and would buy again.
3,Why do I have to constantly keep pressing the “on” button on the back of the speaker to keep it on? 15 or so minutes after you stop playing music you have to go to the speaker and turn it on again. I paired it with my computer and wanted to keep it on a high shelf but I can’t because I’m constantly having to turn it on. And then there’s the issue of using it on a second device. Whatever device you want to play it on you first have to retrieve the previous device and disconnect the speaker from its Bluetooth. But the sound quality is great which is why I still have it! LOL!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Love it! Have Onn brand speaker same color size watt shape but more 3 expensive. And it DOES NOT begin to compare to Doss. Sound and clarity are far better. Also like the touch control features. Had Doss on my counter while cleaning one day and could feel the bass on the floor! My house is 3000 soft and I can hear this throughout.
3,There were a lot of good reviews so it was kind of like when you go see a movie that has a lot of really good reviews so you get excited but when you see it in person it's not "all that" so your dissapointed. That's this speaker. It sounds like it's playing out of a tin can or something. My echo show which I got it for is better. I put it back in the box and returned it immediately.
5,It has pretty good sound and is actually loud for the price it’s small enough to fit in my work bag I use it work sometimes. Battery life has been really good compared to some other Bluetooth speakers we have had. It is almost as good as the BOSE $120 speaker.
5,I've had this Bluetooth speaker for almost 2 months now and use it every night after work for at least an hour sometimes up to a few before bed. I've only had to charge it twice in the 50 or so days I've used it. The battery lasts for quite a few days and the Bluetooth is super quick with connecting once paired. I really love the sound that comes out of this speaker as well very crisp and clean not big reverb sounds or static noise like some BT speakers and the connection works all over my apartment (other speakers I've owned got messed up connections sometimes just in the next room) The only thing that would make this better would be higher volume....its pretty dang loud for its size and price though so really I'm not complaining. It's also a lovely color and the touch buttons are nice and easy to use!
4,Used for about 6 months already because a review of something that just arrived is pointless.Great sound quality great connectivity. It is small and looks great kind of stylish.I am not giving it 5 starts because once it shut off by itself with full battery but only once. Also the panel gets dirty easily but it is acceptable. At the price very good speaker.
4,The only interactive button for power and bluetooth syncing will be unresponsive sometimes but that's fixed by just releasing and holding again. Doesn't do this a lot but has happened a few enough times to be annoying. Maybe just a learning curve thing or getting used to the eccentricity? I'm sure all electronic devices have their own personality. Could even be dependent on what the software is thinking.Would be a 5 star if they just separated the power from the button made it a switch and made the button for syncing only. Otherwise GREAT. Good volume. It is louder than my bathroom fan so I can shower and listen. The mobility and sound quality are a great compliment. Don't let my criticism scare you away it's a good speaker. Just remember to try again with the button if you don't get a reaction the first time. Simple.
5,I can’t say enough good things about this speaker and the experience I had with the vendor’s customer service.The sound quality is amazing. As others have said if you control the volume from your phone you can really get it cranking. Also very crisp and full sound. Gone are the days of big cabinet stereo systems but this little guy fills that gap perfectly.After about nine months I started getting a single “busy signal” beep every two or three minutes. The speaker was fully charged - plugged in in fact. I did some research and it sounds like the battery dies for some people. Some folks replace it themselves but accessing the battery is not easy.Amazon put me in touch with the vendor since it has been so long since I bought it. I emailed them and told them what was happening and they replied and told me to make sure it was charged; I told them that it was and it was still doing the beeping sound. I also told them how much I loved the speaker and really hoped I could get it fixed.So a few days went by and I didn’t get any response from them and I really wasn’t too worried about it. Next thing I know I get a brand new speaker in the mail! If works perfectly with no beep! I was past the warrantee window and they replaced it anyway. So top notch customer service to say the least.I’ve had had one or two other experiences with vendors replacing a faulty product. You really can’t ask for better than that when it comes to customer service.I gave it two stars for the battery because well the battery in the first one started dying after a few months. If you happen to experience that problem reach out the vendor (if it’s past the Amazon return window) and they should take care of you.
4,I love my speaker its awesome. The only thing I dont like and its the only reason I didnt give it a five star is if i receive a call and disconnect the speaker from my phone I cant just reconnect it remotely. I have to get up and re-pair it or turn it off and back on. I know this sounds lazy but i usually use it in my garden and if my hands are filthy i dont want to have to touch it lol
5,Sound quality
5,Great speaker and love the purple color.  It maybe small but it has great sound.
5,Utilize frequently in my office on friday morning's when I typically have time to think and do my own job.  Has held up fantastic... had now for about 4 years.  Have lost the charging chord and am in search of another but fortunately the battery lasts so long I know I've got time.  This isn't a $10000 home theatre system but it sounds great and will fill a room.  No brainer would purchase again.
5,So far so good! I've had this speaker for about two months and I really like it. Easy to connect sound quality is good for both music and podcasts (but I'm not an audiophile) and the max volume actually goes higher than I need. (I was looking for a small portable speaker with good volume.) I only use it each morning for less than an hour; with that usage it was quite a while before I got the low-battery signal (which sounds like a phone's busy tone) and recharged. Overall I'm very pleased with this purchase!
5,Really like the size and color
4,It needs a much better base  good sound volume.
3,Not impressed
3,Was thrilled with it at first and didn't think the 15-minutes of inactivity causing it to disconnect would be much of a problem but yes. Turns out it is. AND it would randomly disconnect even WITHIN that 15-minute period while people in the meeting were speaking so it's not as though there was no sound coming through the speaker! It would also intermittently emit a really loud buzzing noise causing me to have to disconnect and reconnect it during meetings. Way too labor intensive. I might've gotten a bum unit.
5,So far I have nothing negative to say.  I received my speaker as a gift more than a month ago (I'm not going to go figure that out for writing a review... too tired for that after a long day!).  Anyhoo I will never go back to listening to media without speakers all because of this little guy.  I am listening to a lot more music now and watching Dr. Who is more exciting with the great quality of sound exuding from the speaker.  I couldn't take the speaker down to the garage from my laptop on the second floor of my house -- but that's okay because It's a laptop and a portable speaker I was synching.  As long as the speaker and I stayed on the same floor of the house as my source I can enjoy the crisp clear sound be it songs symphonies or people speaking on television.I also love the weight and durability.  I feel like if I drop it -- I am only 5'5" -- it would not do any damage.  Now I'm not suggesting that you try dropping it from your windows or rooftops though I imagine it would probably be okay and still work fine because there are no knobs or levers to deal with it's all touch sensitive!Lastly and most importantly I love the sound quality the bass and the treble seems perfect - though I'm just an ordinary girl not a musician or anything -- and I have never heard any tinniness or scratchiness to it and no static.  When I ventured to the garage that one time the music just dropped when out of range instead of getting scratching like driving down the road listening to the radio... and that is a huge plus in my book as I hate that scratchy noise.So in conclusion the value soars way above the price.  Get it you'll love it too.P.S.  It fits in your carry-on bags or large purses (I had it in my computer bag with my laptop and a large hardback book and a bunch of other stuff too so it's definitely great for taking on vacation to Uncle Buck's over the summertime!
5,This speaker is the bomb!!! For a little speaker it’s loud lol! It’s so good I bought more than one. I love it for when I take showers or when I’m cleaning and listen to podcasts. I even bring it to the beach when I travel hiking etc. it holds battery for SO long. I haven’t charged mine in over 3 weeks (no lie) and it has not died. I use it for about 45-1 hour a day and it has legit not died on me once. It will warn you when it’s about to die. I’ve had all the fancy speakers and honestly for the price this one is just as amazing if not better! It’s so tiny lightweight and what I love about it is that it looks sleek and modern. Really simple to use. Comes in nice packaging with protective plastic. Really cool speaker and you really can’t beat that price. I wish it was a tiny bit louder but the bass and sounds come out very crisp so I can’t really complain. Highly recommend. Oh and I forgot to mention; the first one I bought wasn’t working properly (it wasn’t charging) and the seller immediately shipped a new one. I think some people that leave bad reviews genuinely have nothing better to do with their time or lack the proper problem solving skills to resolve their minor first world problem issues. It’s as simple as either calling customer service or messaging the seller guys... the seller 100% will make it right. So if you see some people saying don’t buy it don’t listen to them. Take it from someone who never leaves reviews but this product is so worth it that I had to go on a rant. The seller was sooooo sweet and so responsive. Sometimes it’s as easy as asking!
5,I don't know why we need to have 2 distinct little jingles played whenever the speaker connects. Wouldn't people know that their speaker is connected when the audio from the connected device starts to come out of the speaker? I'm very susceptible to ear worms especially as I start to get tired and wind down for the evening and their little jingles get stuck in my head. Some nights we pause our Netflix viewing several times at which time the speaker disconnects; on those nights we get to hear the jingles repeatedly. I would buy a second one of these speakers because it works well connects well and has a long battery life. But instead I'm going to look for a different speaker that doesn't play jingles.
4,My laptop speakers are trash so I picked this up and it's really great sound for the price. A decent amount of bass and a strong bluetooth connection. I charged it the day I got it and it hasn't run out yet. It'd be fantastic if that giant blue circle on top was the power button so I could just tap it and have it connect to my laptop. Instead it's a small button on the back. I have to take it off the shelf every time I want to use it. It's not a big deal but it's an annoying inconvenience and confusing design choice. Every other button is on top to be easily accessible.
3,Sound quality is . . . okay. Granted it's not a $130 JBL portable speaker. I had hoped the sound would be a little cleaner and the bass a little deeper and the volume a little louder. For sitting close to it's not bad and the price is right!
4,Little speaker that does the job...Had to purchase an adaptor from Lightning [iPhone] to 3.5mm connection to allow my recent model iPhone to deliver the audio. To connect to the speaker a 3.5mm cable (male on both sides) is also needed [not [provided]...Older phones that have an earphones (3.5mm) connection work great as well.Did not test the Bluetooth function (yet)Should include an actual charger (5V). The charger cable provided is a propriety type on the amplifier side. If you loose it you are in trouble. This connection should be micro-USB type so 'standard' cable can be used (in case that the supplied cable is lost...)
5,It stays in my truck so I can use it wherever I go. The battery lasts for hours and hours.
5,The DOSS SoundBox is a small portable speaker that allows connection via Bluetooth or 3.5mm line-in jack (audio connector included).  It incorporates a MicroSD slot (32GB max) which is a fantastic feature as it allows the unit to perform as a self-contained music player.  The unit also functions as a hands-free speakerphone when paired with your cellular phone.The SoundBox has a classy design with a smooth matte finish top control panel that avoids fingerprints.  The cabinet is wrapped with an attractive 360° aluminium grille.  The SoundBox feels solid & well constucted.  On top are touch controls for playback mode & call control.  These illuminate white whenever the unit is powered on.  The central ring is the volume control which is controlled by sliding your finger around the ring clockwise to increase volume & counterclockwise to decrease volume.  A tone sounds to indicate max volume.  The volume control illumination doubles as the Mode indicator - Blue for Bluetooth Green for MicroSD  & Red for line-in.  On the rear of the cabinet are a power button line-in jack MicroSD slot & a Micro-USB charging port (Micro-USB charging cable included).  The charge indicator is a tiny difficult to see LED beneath the Micro-USB port that lights red while charging & changes to green when fully charged.Audio from the dual 6-watt speakers is very nice with surprising base for a unit of this size & no noticeable distortion even at max volume.  Bluetooth pairing is simple & reconnection is fast.  Range is better than average & I experienced no drop-outs or loss-of-connection issues.  The speakerphone function works well automatically pausing playback when accepting a call & providing clear audio from the caller.  I am told it sounds good on the outgoing end as well.  By default the unit automatically powers off after 15 minutes of inactivity but you can contact DOSS Support for a firmware update to disable the auto-off for use with something like an Echo Dot where you want the speaker to remain powered on.I did two runtime tests with the battery lasting 10 hours during playback from a MicroSD card.  Volume was on the high end during these tests.The SoundBox is a very capable portable speaker that looks good & sounds good.  The inclusion of a MicroSD slot is a great benefit.  It certainly comes in at a good price.* Buyers should note the control illumination is bright & always on.* For DOSS - It would be nice to use the volume ring as the charge indicator.  Maybe flash red while charging & turn off when full?  Would be much easier to see than the tiny LED on the back.  Also an app where users could adjust things like auto-off button illumination shuffle play on/off  would be a handy addition.
5,I have found that there can be a cause and effect relationship between the size of a speaker and its sound. That is the case with the DOSS SoundBox Touch Portable. For a portable speaker it is on the large size – 6.6 x 2.7 x 2.9 inches but the sound is remarkably good. The lows are full and the highs are clear.My intention was to use this speaker as my main sound output for my desktop computer. I planned to set it up with Bluetooth and a USB connection for a power supply. It paired immediately but even with the USB connection it powered down after about 15 minutes without input. When I checked the manual it said to contact their customer service to disable the auto-off function.When I tried their website to download the firmware update it said “Coming Soon” but with an active link to contact their customer service. I did contact them via email and within a day they sent me a firmware file that is loaded into the Micro SD slot. I didn’t have the required GB size of SD card so they sent me a free SD card with the firmware file on it. After following the instructions for loading the firmware the auto-off function was disabled. Now once turned on the speaker stays on until it is turned off – exactly what I wanted.I have to turn the speaker on when I turn on my computer but it connects via Bluetooth automatically and is selected as the primary sound source. After turning my computer off I also turn the speaker off.It is well-built with a full rich sound. In my experience DOSS’ customer service is top-notch. I enthusiastically give this product 5 stars.
3,This speaker seemed well-made and it was packaged nicely. I liked the sound it was perfect to amplify my Alexa while I played music or news. It did have to be turned on every time I used it as the Bluetooth does not auto connect. Then suddenly tonight I’m listening to NPR and the speaker just turned off while my Alexa continued on. It would not turn on with the power button so I unplugged it and plugged it back in and it came on… for about 15 seconds. Then I could not get it to come back on at all. It just died. Randomly and out of the blue. So is the $28 price tag worth two years and nine months of service? I expected it to last quite a bit longer. Warranty ended in September 2021.
4,Good sound for the price long battery
4,I charged this unit installed the SD card from my previous player and could not get this player to select memory card mode. Plus there is no mode for shuffle so I'm guessing it would start with song #1 every time you start playing. It looks simple and rugged but without a screen for feedback it's actually complicated to use.
5,Great sound quality! Easy connectivity.  Super battery life.  Truly a bang for a buck!  Great deal!
5,I love this thing!! I teach music and use it everyday; it holds its battery charge for DAYS is painlessly easy to connect to and the sound quality is insanely good the price / size. I’ve subsequently bought three more of these as gifts.
4,Bought this speaker to use in my truck for longer drives because my vehicle speakers don't work well anymore. Turns out this was a terrific Bluetooth replacement. The sound quality sure isn't what you're used to from system speakers but is totally acceptable. I am able to play music from playlists through my phone and it also allows you to talk on the phone as well. It was super easy to set up in a minute or two. It is not a top of the line kind of speaker but the sound is acceptable and the portability is great. Well worth the price! I don't like spending a lot of money on electronics but like the functionality of today's gadgets. This one may not have the best sound but gives me the ability to play sound that is certainly better than my phone speaker. It is rechargeable so it doesn't need batteries and portable so it doesn't need to be plugged in to use.
5,Es mi altavoz favorito en lo que sonido y portabilidad se refiere. Ojalá me dure mucho tiempo.
5,April 30 2020 UPDATEOk I bought this speaker the end of June last year. If you read below you can see that I had a problem with it almost out of the box. But the problem seemed to be remedied (see UPDATE below). However again I haven’t used the speakers very often in the interval (it’s winter and I was indoors so used my big speakers). But the weather has turned nice so I am outside again. But the problem is back. But this time the same left speaker is “working” but it can barely be heard. I tried the reset but not much changed except now the paper clip goes all the way in and apparently the reset has been moved or something. I sure hope it is still under warranty but I bet not... sigh. Going to try the company again and see what they say. Later...UPDATE:I posted a review a few days ago. But after contacting the device "Support" they were able to fix the problem. They had me use a paperclip and RESET the device. Ah HA!!! The speaker sounds perfect now and BOTH speakers are working!!!! So I am changing my review from 1 to 5. It is a nice set of speakers for the price.I recently bought this speaker and haven't used it very much because I was going to use it while I had to do long drives and just before I bought it the necessary drives ended... sigh. So I haven't really had a need to use it. Then the other day we were taking a long drive so I thought I would use it for that. But when we played mp3s that used both the let and the right speaker individually it was obvious that the speakers left speaker wasn't putting out any sound. This speaker is basically brand new so there shouldn't be anything wrong with it. The sound from the one speaker was great but stereo that uses each speaker individually is basically non existent. So my rating is ZERO for this device.
5,Great looks easy to use we love it.
3,This is a nice little speaker with reasonable instructions and it was easy to reach and talk to customer service.  However the speaker has one big negative - its microphone.  I purchased this to use with an iPad for FaceTime calls with my grandkids to get better sound quality.  It worked fine to hear them but when it Bluetooth connects to the iPad it not only serves as a speaker but takes over the mic as well.  No longer are you talking thru the mic in the iPad but instead using the mic in the speaker.  Even if I put my mouth to the speaker (obviously inconvenient and not doable longterm ) my family at the other end did not like the sound quality compared to the iPad's mic.Customer support was easy to reach and suggested a few fixes (make sure the speaker was fully charged and use the reset button) but that did not solve the problem.  Possibly I had a defective unit.  Customer support was uncertain.  Apparently there is no way to Bluetooth connect it and disable its mic in favor of the iPad mic.  I decided to return it and move on.
5,I did get this on a gold box deal so I didn't pay the full price on this page. When the package arrived it did seem a little small smaller than what I expected. But when I turned it on the sound was NOT small at all. It was loud. I liked that it had an SD card slot on the back I have not yet tried it.The sound: The overall sound was not up to the quality of the Bose mini which is 300% more money so it's not a fair comparison.The high-frequency range was very good the mid-range sounds thin and there is a subwoofer function which adds some low end when you are close enough within 4 feet you can hear the lower frequencies. but much further than that the low end is not really a factor. What you are left with is a tinny-sounding mid-range that gets quite loud.To be fair I am a somewhat critical listener but not that critical since Bose equipment does dominate my home listening environment. So you can probably ignore my comments. You'll probably like it just fine. And really what more can you expect for the price.The battery life is very good and it does have an Aux-in jack in the back that's a big advantage. I have not tet tried a phone call through the system I hope it works ok since that's a very good use for this for me.Overall I recommend you get one see if you like it then send it back if you don't. But if you need a nice small pretty good Bluetooth speaker that won't break the budget def give it a try!
5,I read the reviews so I ordered it. The reviews were spot on. Great little speaker.
4,I will agree with previous reviews on this product in that if you're an audiophile looking for high-quality sound you won't find it here but for what you pay for you're getting a solid product! The blue-tooth connectivity is quick and reliable the build quality is solid doesn't feel like a cheap piece of .... The sound quality is decent with the bass not being thunderous but adequate. The mids and highs all sound pretty decent. The only drawback is you cannot adjust any of these levels via the speaker itself volume control only.What's never mentioned in any other review that I have read on this product is the latency of the Blue-tooth. The big reason for me buying this is for video editing on my laptop and I am happy to say the latency is pretty much zero! IDK if that's the Blue-tooth 4.0 or what but latency is none-existing!
5,We love this speaker! We deliberately got one that could be used for wires because we have had so many problems with gadgets that drop the Bluetooth connection. So at first we only used this with a wire. Then one day we tried it with Bluetooth just for interest. Shock and awe! It works PERFECTLY with Bluetooth - so perfectly it is kind of shocking. Gosh now we constantly listen to podcasts and music with the Bluetooth connection. I get very irritated by technology that does not work which is why I try to avoid Bluetooth. But with this I just switch on the speaker it makes a nice chime and then a few seconds later it just kind of grabs the signal from the iPhone and takes over as the speaker. I don't have to do any annoying work such as going to the Bluetooth settings on my phone and selecting the speaker. I really love how easily it operates. Then when I stop listening I usually forget to switch it off but the speaker switches itself off. That's a bonus. This is most likely why this speaker never seems to run out of battery power. Once in a blue moon I remember to charge it with the USB cable but not often yet it has never once been out of battery power.Even when I am streaming Youtube on my phone I like to have the sound coming out of this speaker. To be clear it is not super loud. But it has a much better tone than my iPhone and is significantly louder. So it sounds like a quality sound not a tinny phone. My husband researched which speaker to buy and was tempted by the very expensive one. Now we are so happy we went for this budget solution that works SO well.To be fair: we live in a small space. If you are in a giant space you probably want more volume than this delivers. But when we are in our kitchen or living room together this is just about perfect for us. We have even started listening to it in bed in the morning while we are having our morning coffee.Definitely one of the best things I have bought in a long time.
5,I got this and charged it on the 1st for 24 hours. Today the 10th is the first day I’ve had to charge it since then and I use it every single day. Never seen anything like it. What on earth is the battery made out of vibranium?Besides that (if you needed any other reason to buy it) it’s cute and compact and I love that you can either manage the volume with your device or switch modes and do it straight from the speaker. It gets pretty loud for such a small thing but the clarity is A1.For context I listen to podcasts and classical music all day…and the voices are are crisp as the instruments. I’m gonna buy more for the rest of my house.
5,this is such a great speaker and the sound is loud & clear. the bluetooth connects immediately. the touchscreen buttons are an awesome feature. my speaker will last for 2 days before i charge it again. i love it ! :)
5,I have nothing but good things to say about this speaker. I have put this thing through absolute hell it has been left out in the rain countless times and dropped. Although not waterproof this speaker has lasted. The sound is to be expected from a $30 speaker if not better. The battery life on this thing is incredible I haven’t used this speaker in about 7 months and it just turned on for use.
5,This product is a good compact size that does not take up a big area on a small chair side table. It has great sound for my use as a TV speaker that is so easy to control with a touch  for volume for ease of TV watching without the volume use on the TV itself. You will need a Bluetooth transmitter if you do not already have one. I found that if you turn mute the sound on the TV it is much better because there is a slight time difference or echo effect when using the speaker. The volume for the speaker can be at a much lower setting since it is right next to you. My wife and I love it since it is so easy to touch control instead of looking for the TV remote to adjust the TV volume. It connects right up with the transmitter when first paired up and the battery has lasted us through 3 movies.
5,Have 2! Both work great
4,nice mint green color very easy to use (literal plug and play style). turning volume down was hard to figure out at first but otherwise good. you have to touch and drag your finger counter-clockwise / clockwise around the top middle button to go up and down and its VERY SENSITIVE. don't expect it to blast your neighbors walls in but is good sound for the price.
5,My 16 year old grandson loved it.  Sizesound battery life!  He gave it all 5 stars!
5,I purchased this Speaker 1/5/22 it was working perfectly until a week ago I thought that maybe there may have been a short in the charger cable so I purchased two new. Today it has been charging for hours and I tried playing music with it plugged in twice. The first time it shut down and died just over two minutes & the 2nd time I got about a minute and a half before it died. Overall I felt it was a really good speaker and it worked incredibly well before it’s death. Unfortunately I won’t ever buy it again because it lasted just under three months!😭😔
4,Great speakers works as described. I just don't like that it picks up the first Bluetooth device it discovers. Share with my sister and if she's paired and uses before me it links to her phone. I guess that says how good it works. Definitely should buy. Very compact for mobile use.
5,This speaker was perfect for the backyard tv projector.
4,Good
3,Overall I love the speaker is really pretty and tiny and cute but the battery life sucks it says that it's 20 hour play time when in reality for me it's like 3 hours I had my speaker charging all night and I took it off my charger early in the morning i fell back to sleepand woke up tried to turn it on to start cleaning  and it was already dead.. at this point I had to buy another speaker
4,I like the size and that it’s waterproof.  Use it on my kayak.
5,I received this speaker today I actually bought it to take it with me at work. I gave it a try here at home and I’m think buying one more for my bedroom. Clarity and great sound! I’m very happy with my buy!
3,This was purchased to be used with an Androdoid phone and the volume was too low to be useful.  I tried it out for my iPhone and it worked great.  As I needed it for the androdroid phone I had. to return it.
3,Check the headline.
4,I bought this two years ago and it still works fantastically. It is one of the louder ones believe it or not size doesn’t matter.
4,No issues so far.  Light and easy to carry in the backpack
5,My review has a few different aspects:1. Ease of Use2. Aesthetics3. Sound Quality4. Customer Service1. Ease of Use: You power it on and hold the power button to begin pairing.  Find the unit on your smartphone (or whatever you are trying to pair it to) and-you're done.  It retains the setting and links as soon as you power it back on.Volume controls are intuitive as are the back and forth buttons.2. Aesthetics: It is a very handsome unit.  Unobtrusive with sleek lines.3. Sound Quality: A powerful little guy with a nice punch.  A little lacking in its depth of sounds but in its price-range it functions very well (if you are looking for Sonos sound then you will have to spend Sonos money).4.  Customer Service: HERE is where I need to write and this is why I would and will purchase again.I purchased this unit to support a multi-dot setup with an "everywhere" group.  I simply wanted to use this unit to boost the sound in my kitchen while continuing to play music on the everywhere group.I found this did not work with the DOSS.It links well to my kitchen unit.Everything is fine until I ask the dot to play the music on the "everywhere" group.When I try this I get no sound from the DOSS.I have tried multiple configurations and it has no worked.Since then I had emailed the company and received a very prompt response from "Lu."I'm not sure Lu's position but he was very courteous very detail-oriented and very persistent (not pushy-persistent).When I told Lu it was not meeting my needs Lu heard my concerns and asked that I keep the unit for a bit until his team could work on a solution.After a few days Lu and  I spoke on the phone.At this time he listened attentively to what I was trying to do and realized that at this time the unit does not perform this function.Lu asked that I accept a refund for the unit but also keep it.He was gracious and customer-focused as well as solution-focused while noting the limitations of the technology offered.I will be looking for more products by this company based upon their tech but mostly because of my experience with the company itself and especially Lu.Thank you.Namaste~
4,Sound quality is loud and clear and the low end surprised me. I'm not picky about bass but this speaker definitely has some boom boom to it. I couldn't even set it down on some awkward places at work cuz the bass will make this speaker bounce around and nearly fell a couple of times. You certainly have to put this on a table and the rubber feet on the bottom of the speaker practically grips the surface which makes it impossible to slide it around. The speaker is hefty in weight which makes me feel that I got my money's worth in quality.  I know this is a bluetooth speaker but I was really disappointed that the AUX port seems to have a loose connection. It takes me a few tries of plugging in and kinda rotating the line-in cable jack to get the sound playing correctly and it's really bumming me out cuz I like to use my headphone amp at work. It's got a volume knob that's very handy to adjust in a hurry. I also use it a lot for movies; cuz although the Bluetooth function is very loud movies are still limited in terms of volume. The headphone amp and line-in cable helps remedy this but I know it's just a matter of time when the AUX port will just stop working at all. At $30 maybe it's not such a big deal and I can just buy another one but the plastic AUX port is loose and an odd choice of cheap material when the rest of the speaker has a metal looking build and feels high quality.Tip: rubbing the control volume clockwise or whatever works the quickest and is the most responsive when your finger is almost tracing the blue LED ring. Having your finger closer to the center of the ring is awkward and sometimes doesn't register as quickly. I love the responsive touch controls though.
5,Great soundno crackling in the speakers or sound drifting....great product for the $$$$
5,I bought two of these because I thought I had read  in previous reviews  that you could connect two speakers via an aux cord. When I got them I saw that each only had an input jack no output.  So I couldn't connect one with the other.  My next thought was to use my splitter.  It plugs into my phone's headphone jack then splits so that two people can plug in headphones and listen simultaneously.  I could have used aux cords from the splitter to each speaker the same way.  BUT... I HAVE A NEWER ANDROID PHONE and it has a media setting that allows me to hook up multiple Bluetooth devices and send the signal to all of them.  I can even adjust the sound of each speaker independently.  So great little speakers! I listened to Fleetwood Mac Doobies Miles Davis  John Coltrane  etc. I tried each speaker by itself first then together.  The sound was crisp  the bass was good and the volume was impressive.  Two of these on my patio will be more than enough for parties.
5,I also have a Bose which is about $150. It is about 4 years old however DOSS sound is just as good if not better. Also what I like is if I am not using it and it is on it will automatically turn off.
4,I bought the larger Doss box a year or so ago and it has much better sound quality. If you want a small box that works well but compromises on sound this one is fine.
5,I'd purchased this "stereo" speaker primarily because of the available option to play my music via the SD card slot. Less hassle not having to use my phone. As luck would have it the unit that I received was defective in that one option. It would not play via the SD card. I e-mailed their tech support and received a reply within an hour. I tried several different size SD cards formatted with FAT & FAT32 and trying a specific song they had me download the SD card still would not work. It worked fine via bluetooth and even the AUX connection. So all within a couple of hours of e-mail exchanges they determined it was defective (hey it happens) and immediately shipped me out a replacement. Couple days later I received the replacement and the SD card in this one worked fine. THANKS to Milla for the great tech support!!! Ok after using the speaker I can highly recommend it! It has very good sound for the price. I wish I had this when I still worked and had a small AM/FM/CD radio to listen to. For it's size it's got some hefty weight to it. The controls are "BRIGHTLY" illuminated and responsive. It has 4 rubber feet on the base that if it's placed on a smooth surface it will practically stick in place and not slide should you push it. It can play very loud and in my use the loudest for my liking is half volume. It comes with a water proof drawstring pouch for storage/carrying both an AUX cable and cable for USB charging either via PC or phone charger. I am currently playing it at my desk as I write this review where I used to play music thru my PC. Using the SD card for music when you shut off the speaker it remembers where you left off in the cue or mid song next time you turn it back on. If you like the convenience having the SD card & not dealing with your phone/tablet via bluetooth this is soooo convenient. Edit: Someone asked this so FYI songs play by title alphabetically from the card. I'd never even noticed and assumed it was random until I checked to respond to the question. As for the option to answer your phone with this I haven't tested it and quite frankly can't see using it if you're among others like an outdoor barbecue or the beach where all can hear your conversation.
5,I am very impressed with this small speaker.  It gives fine sound better than my other similarly sized speakers though of course the very lowest bass notes are not well picked up because of the limited size of the speakers.  Frankly I didn't really notice this until I tested it with a track I use for testing the lowest bass a Celtic musical piece with extremely deep-toned drum accompaniment.  I could barely detect those drums but everything else sounded clear and balanced including voice and various kinds of music.I was also pleased by the very efficient reproducible Bluetooth pairing a process which has often been an annoyance with my other speakers.  And then there is the slot for a micro SD card for solo music playing without a streaming device -- great idea though I haven't tested it yet.  Also better than average though as yet untested is the claimed 12 hour battery life.  The fact that it turns itself off after 15 min idle is a good idea too.  The charging was fast.All around I am very happy with this purchase especially at the sale price and recommend it.  If I have issues later I will update this review.UPDATE July 27:  Speaker is still great. I am updating to report that I have compared it with the very popular Anker Soundcore and except for the reported battery life (12 vs 24 hr) the DOSS speaker is clearly superior.  The sound is so much richer and less shrill even my husband asked what was wrong when I secretly switched from the Koss to the Anker in the car.  Easier to operate too.  I will add more including photos later on.  I defy anyone to see what they are doing on the all-black Anker (contols also black) in a dark room while controls on the Doss are clearly marked and illuminated.  The Doss is larger and I think its speakers must be larger and better designed.UPDATE OCTOBER 2020:  the original Doss speaker I reviewed here is still working perfectly including the battery and instant Bluetooth pairing despite over 3 years of very heavy use.  This is the best small speaker I own with excellent sound and functionality for its size.  So now seeing the same model on sale for just $20 it was an instant and enthusiastic decision to buy a second one.  Both will be in steady use.  A truly excellent product at any price.
4,I’m biased towards the JBL flip speakers but I bought this for work (knowing I wouldn’t use it very much- the price was right). Sound quality is okay- if this is something you truly care about go higher end. It does the job and gets pretty loud.
5,This bad boy has been my pal now for over a year. I've used it EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. And I love it. Music movies games all on my laptop and phone (Galaxy S7).THE CONTROLS are touch based. The only physical buttons are the power button. It's fine the touch controls are very responsive.THE SOUND is solid Nice bass and overall tone.I used to wear headphones everyday and veg out on my computer with music and webbrowsing.  Instead of my $120 headphones now I use this. Having the sound  in the room with you and not just in your head feels great and you can freely move around and come and go. Also great for showers :DTHE BATTERY LIFEIs very suitable I've had music playing all night and still gotten a few more hours of usage from it after that. It lets you know it needs a recharge with a little tone.THE ONE COMPLAINTis that it has connectivity issues. This is not a huge deal as once its connected it stays connected but if you switch back and forth with laptop phone and other very often you may have some issues. Mostly I've had them connecting with my PC (7 years old laptop) it can take up to 20 seconds to fully register and connect which is crazy but then it works great. With my phone it seems to work mostly perfect.NOTE I have seen some sporadic behavior with it where it will disconnect and turn off right after attempting a connect with phone or laptop this doesn't happen very often but I've simply turned it back on and it connected fine.ALSO if it's struggling to connect try holding down the "hangup" button for phone calls and it can help "reboot" the connection.PROS: Hundreds of hours of enjoyment with a great sound gets nice and loud.CONS: Occassional sporadic issues with connecting and may not work as well with older hardwarePS. The only way to alter the firmware on the speaker is with a microSD card and a way to move files onto it from your phone or computer. The USB port on the speaker cannot transfer data
5,I use this primarily in my small 15 foot boat. I live in south florida. This little speaker puts out big sound for size and price. Even with a 50 HP motor directly behind me I can still hear it over my 4 stroke yamaha engine. On New Years eve we had an outside fire and I used this speaker. Set at 1/2 volume it was plenty loud enough. The sound is crisp and clear at almost all volumes except for full volume. It does get a bit distorted. As far as bass goes it's about what you'd expect for a small speaker. It's not very punchy. My favorite feature is the micro SD card slot. I can load up many of my favorite artists on a 16 GB micro sd card and I don't have to drain my phone using bluetooth. I like to stream Pandora but in the boat there are times I lose the cell signal. The micro SD card solves this issue and actually sounds better than bluetooth.Finally yesterday after a day on the water i mistakenly left the speaker in my boat while I hosed it down. I absolutely drenched this speaker. It wasn't until this morning that I discovered the still soaking wet speaker in my boat. I shook the water out of it and dried the outside. I then went to work and left it to dry for 6 hours. I didn't turn it on until I got home. I'm pleased to say it still sound great. I would highly recommend this item. If I had killed this item with my "bath" I would have purchased another one.
4,Easy to use and easy Bluetooth connection. I don't like how quickly it disconnects from Bluetooth when its idling. I do like the size and shape a lot. The pink is the perfect shade for me. Not too pink and not too light resembling pastel. The sound quality is good for what I need it for. I'm not sure about battery life as its always plugged in when I use it. I use it for backup noise while cleaning and reading. Its working well so far.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             So this little Doss speaker is definitely the speaker that can.  Like the rest of you I'm a Amazon bargen hunter for less the $40 this little speaker has great sound and battery life. I have had mine for 6 months now and use it every day with zero issues. Range is amazing with zero quality lossNow is going to create world peace or emotionally change my life? .. maybe. But in Michigan during falling Leaves 🍂 season it differently helped keep my sanity when I was out side Raking leaves.  As a combat vet I'm not a fan of earbuds as it takes away my situational awareness so I'm always on the look out for a good compact Bluetooth speaker.You won't be disappointed in this one. I like Red as any Marine should and Bluetooth  Connectability is easy.  I have a very large ranch house so I installed a bunch of #echoflexe (10 total) and can carry this speaker in any room and connect and get great sound.My goal is to purchase a few more but it's snow season right now and without a shock protection casing I really don't want to take it outside.If they make an all weather version I would strap it to the tractor for snow season and continue living the 80s big hair rock dream. Don't pretend you don't jam out as well....
5,Have had this speaker for 10 minutes but was able to connect almost immediately with my Windows 11 laptop.  I was NOT able to connect same laptop with my Comiso Bluetooth speaker for reasons that I don’t know.Sound is not bad either IMHO.
5,I love this little cutie. The color is great the sound is great I’ve never had a problem connecting it to anything I’m using it with and it seems to last me several days. I listen to music constantly so I’m pretty happy with that. I only knocked a point off for sound quality because I wish I could get it to be just a little softer at times I think the lowest volume before muting the sound is still a smidge louder than I would expect. But I love the touch sensitivity on the top panel. I also love the auto-off feature. Great buy for me.
5,This was a deal I couldn't pass up - I needed a new Bluetooth speaker so badly and not a ton of money to spend. I got this sale / deal for cyber Monday making it only $22-$23 and out of that price range this one seemed to be the best choice. The package came faster than I anticipated (one day earlier than it said on tracking) and it was absolutely the easiest set up ever. Im far from tech savvy and I got it figured out in no time! The sound quality is great! This is a small little speaker but it can get loud!  I am glad I got this one! It worked for hours of listening for me last night and theres a timer automatically set up to shut off after 6 hours and it did for me. (Which I appreciate) you can turn it back on if you still want to listen to music of course. I would recommend this one for anyone on a strict / tight budget or a gift to someone in a low price range (they would think you spent 5 times that amount i bet!)Only con i would like to add in is this sounds like high treb n lower bass. Ther are not adjustments to change that that i am aware of. I found quickly that setting it in a shallow box improved the bass aspect of the music.  That is not a deal breaker for me but it could be for others so I thought I'd let you know.
5,Does what we bought it to do.
4,For the money you won't find better sound from a bluetooth speaker. So with that out of the way this is why I knocked off a star.Touch interface: while the basic buttons are fine I despise the volume control - there is no feedback to see if you are doing anything or swiping correctly - if you could see something indicating the overall volume while swiping it would be totally fine.Lights - they never turn off. I use this speaker at night while going to sleep and I'd love an option to turn the lights off. I had to place the speaker higher up to not be distracted by the LEDs.Everything else is exactly what I wanted - stereo sound for a monitor I use in my bedroom combined with something I can pack up and take with me. Sounds better than a similar Jam box (HX-P215) I have with more visible controls (which I wish could be dimmed at the very least).
3,Not sure what happened here but the volume now isn't much louder than the volume on my laptop itself if it is at all. This happened about a week ago after six months of use. It worked well until then. :/
5,Love the speaker great quality for the price.  Fast shipping.
5,From the moment I felt how heavy this little speaker was in the box I knew this was it was probably going to sound pretty good and I was right! It's AWESOME! It fills my entire living room and sounds great all the way to the master bedroom on the opposite side of my apartment. At first I was just looking for an upgraded speaker for my Echo Dot Mini and purchased the Oontz which was $4 less. I was hating the sound quality of that one because it was a downgrade not an improvement. Sounded tinny and irritating.  I was looking for a good little speaker for my small living room (not the pool area) and liked the controls on this speaker so to give it a try and boy was I impressed. This has a more balanced sound and decent bass. It's not super boomy bass it's just right for my small space. This speaker paired instantly with my phone computer and Alexa! The other speaker did not pair with Alexa at all. If you're on the fence about speakers under $30 I'll save you the trouble of wasting time and money by wholeheartedly recommending the Doss Touch.----Update----I purchased the the 20W Sounbox Pro but later found out  it doesn't connect with this model for TWS. My attempt to add that speaker messed up the ability of my Doss Touch Sounbox to reconnect with Alexa. I emailed customer support and they contacted me within an hour and were incredibly helpful. They are replacing the speaker and told me I can keep the original one which still connects to my phone's with bluetooth. I am so impressed by this company and this little speaker. Doss really stands behind their products!
5,Has a great sound good Bluetooth connection that was easy setup battery last a while and it’s a hefty little speaker with built in touch controls for volume etc. Recommend anyone to try it out
5,Hope this doesn't appear twice...my first review disappeared.I ordered this from amazon last week but then I also bought a $99 unit a Sony portable cylinder blutooth speaker at Best Buy. I did get to test it there but they offered only loud bass pop music to preview...would loved to have spoken voice or classical. Anyway I knew it was loud which I need with my hearing loss.So today I got both speakers going a bit puzzling getting bluetooth to hook up on my laptop but ok on the smartphone. The Doss is heavy built and rugged as is the Sony. The Doss offers the jack to hook up a nonbluetooth sound source with a cable. Cables included. The manual for this is very tiny but you can download the pdf of it from the Doss website and read it on your laptop. You can answer phone and talk using this (have not tried that yet) but not make outgoing calls via the speaker.This sound balance is better on this than the sony which has extra bass (which is what they touted about it).Yep would buy this again. even over the Sony. The sony offers ability to pair two of these to make stereo bluetooth... and apparently has the ability to sync other blutooth speakers in the area so they all are on the same wave length...one would use that for party situations.So well worth the $27...but I'd spend another few bucks to get a colored one.
5,This speaker is great pretty good sound for the money. It does not have Bose or JBL sound but it doesn't cost $120 - $200 either. I read so many reviews that talked about the auto shutdown and voice prompts. And several more about Bluetooth connection issues.  I took this out of the box plugged it in and it connected right away not at max volume either. Don't hear any voice prompt and it didn't shut down or skip to next song. Listened to it on battery for 8 hours and it is still going strong. Either Doss fixed the issues or the other reviewers were reviewing some other product. I am going to buy another one for my desk at work.
4,The battery life is great .  Charging is fast  It connected to my phone super easy .  The sound is ok. For what you pay  it is a great deal  If I get 3 years out of it  I will be very happy.  I use it at work  Happy  customer.  I gave it 4 stars because of the sound
4,The bass is kind of weak but the battery lasts for hours and the Bluetooth connection is good. It’s quite loud and the controls are easy to use and convenient when you’ve got wet hands.
5,Packs a good sound
4,Not a flemzie feel weight sturdy good balanced for the weight. Once you find a place for it in your car it works fine. I use it for my "Alexa Auto". I used it on a Cellphone 📱 call and it worked although you should be conscious surrounding noise.I will test how it sounds to me on the receiving side.
5,I bought this for some music by our pool and I am thrilled with both the sound quality and volume.  :)Worth it.
5,Fabulous sound! Simple to use and bluetooth set up was a breeze.  Great bang for your buck.
5,Took it on a 6 and a half hour drive up to Rochester NY. Sounded great all the way there even at half volume which was loud enough for us in the car. The battery held up during the entire trip--recharged it overnight for the return trip just to be sure. A bit heavier and bulkier than I originally was looking for but those qualities just add to its overall playability and durability. I'm very satisfied with it and would happily recommend it for anyone looking for an inexpensive but sturdy portable speaker.
5,Love it
5,I love how loud it is
5,Worked great in the beginning then after 2 months it just quit...shut itself off and won't turn back on.  Won't be buying this again or recommending it to anyone.
5,I've had this speaker for years without any issues whatsoever. The main thing I love is how consistently solid it is regarding performance. Connectivity is great and the materials are durable. I have left it outdoors on the porch overnight a couple of times exposed to the elements and it keeps on tickin'. Perfect little size with a big sound. If you want a good sound with reliability this is your jam! Very satisfied customer!
5,Great price sound easy to use.
4,My daughter has the oontz angle I liked it so much I thought I would get one for myself. But then I saw the reviews here about non distortion. I figured 700+ people can't be so wrong so I bought it. Here are the pros and cons if you are choosing between the two:Size: Both grade AOontz : is very small and easy to transport.Doss : is about 1/2 as much larger (still small easy to transport)Sound: OOntz grade D/ Doss Grade AOontz: The unit shakes when played at louder decibels. Enough that it vibrates right off the table top. Very annoying to have to keep running after it. There is a LOT of base distortion (example: the song SAIL cannot be played very loud at all).Doss: No shaking and this unit can be cranked up loud enough with no vibrations except the good ones you get from listening to it. (Okay I had to go there corny as it is.)Dials: Oontz grade D/ Doss grade BOontz : Again super annoying small buttons that are very hard to turn the unit on and off by I guess because of the waterproof rubber exterior. Major pain.Doss: I have not played it enough to turn it on and off a lot but so far so good. The dials seem to be fine although the volume on the unit itself doesn't seem to be very happy and gives me a hard time so I just adjust the volume from my phone.Appearance: Both grade AI personally like the Doss better because I feel it is less of a statement. It's more classic and sits quietly out on my balcony railing or in my office without taking much space or drawing attention. But I can see where the teenagers think the triangular speaker by Oontz is a cooler look.Waterproof: OOntz grade A/ Doss grade FOontz water resistant my daughter showers with it on the counterDoss not but that's ok I can put it right outside my bathroom and hear it perfectly fine.Exterior: OOntz A+/ Doss Grade CBoth were simple to pair. Both are black. But the Oontz is really made to take abuse it has thick rubber capable of saving the unit in an accidental drop or getting it near water.
3,My iPhone sounds about as good.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Easy to set up decent sound nice aesthetic. let's see how long they last. SO FAR? I feel I made a good purchase. I WILL COME BACK IF IT FAILS.---- UPDATE 1 ----This THING disconnects and FORGETS to stay in sync with the device you choose + for example you have 2 devices (phone and laptop) this thing needs to be paired every time.IF YOU HAVE A PHONE AND A LAPTOP YOU WILL HAVE TO DISCONNECT MANUALLY THE DEVICE YOU DONT WANT to be CONNECTED AT THE MOMENT THIS THING EVEN WITH THE LAPTOP SLEEPING OR CLOSED REFUSES TO PAIR YOUR PHONE... is annoying!!! you have to manually disconnect the laptop and THEN pair the phoneANOTHER ISSUE:Let's say you paired with your laptop it will stop being paired because you stopped listening to music or audios for a moment it turns OFF AUTOMATICALLY  (even while being charged or full of charged)ANOTHER ISSUE:If the laptop is sleeping or off and you want to use this thing with your phone WELL you have to pair ONCE AGAIN because the thing won't recognize or connect to the device that is active or ON at the moment.---- BESIDES THAT: it still sounds great IF YOU WANT IT JUST FOR ONE DEVICE: is great!! Otherwise be ready to jump between devices pairing over and over again -----
3,I love the sound and it was so easy to set up.  No problems with bluetooth or different size cards.  However the company No LONGER offers the firmware upgrade to make the songs shuffle as was listed by previous reviewers:  A 128gb card full of music limited to playing each album in sequence gets very Frustrating!
5,Esta es la segunda que compro por que me salio muy buena la primera se me perdió y con esa tenia 3 años
4,For the price this is a great speaker. It gets super loud sound quality is great and the bass is decent for a small speaker. If I’m blasting it at full volume (phone volume & speaker volume) it tends to get a little staticky/cracky but just one notch down and it’s good and still incredibly loud. I plan on getting some more for around my house.
5,Works perfect
4,The sound quality on this box is nice. Its range extends to maybe 5m though this is anecdotal and factoring in walls. It will disconnect the sound when out of range and give a blink until you come back in range and then it will reconnect.I am giving it 4/5 stars because the sound it makes when the battery is low is very very annoying akin to those traditional alarm buzzers. When the battery is low the speaker will dim the audio and make a dial-up tone to alert you that the speaker is low on battery instead of opting for a simpler visual method.Otherwise the volume control on the ring is neat if you're not already controlling your music through speakers. Battery life is solid but that tone will get to me man.
4,One of my first and favorite Amazon purchases love this little gem. This speaker is quite amazing for the size and price. It's a steal really. The sound is louder than expected so don't let the size throw you off. But it's the bass that caught me off guard. I found it hard to believe the amount of bass this little thing was pumping out. In fact be careful where you place it if you play it loud enough the bass will make it spazz out basically and if it's by an edge it is bound to fall off I had a close call a few times. It's also the best looking speaker I've come across in this category. The nice elegant touch along with the neon style light allows it to blend in anywhere whether at your desktop beach patio and so forth it simply looks good wherever you place it.The reason it's missing a star is due to connection issues when using it for phone calls. Although my focus buying this was to play music it became a great extra benefit. At first the connection is perfect and the quality is clean and crisp. However less than a minute into each phone call the receiving party starts having problems understanding you as it starts gradually cutting off getting so bad it's pointless to continue the phone call unless you switch from this device. Given that I don't have the same issue and doesn't cut off for me listening it seems that the source of the problem is the microphone in the speaker. It's possible that it might be faulty just in mine though.I'm still loving it for the music just a bit disappointed with the faulty microphone as it turned out to be more handy than I realized for calls. Regardless I'm impressed enough with the listening quality that I still consider it a good deal for that price and I'll still consider DOSS for future speaker related needs. I'm not worried about it it's a reputable company.
5,Doss Touch Wireless Bluetooth Portable SpeakerI recently purchased the Doss Touch Wireless Speaker and I’m very satisfied with this purchase. This speaker is very versatile and user-friendly for all ages. It’s lightweight has great sound and very easy to travel with.Distinguishing CharacteristicsThe Doss Touch speaker has several characteristics that make it stand out against other speakers. The sound quality is top-notch and can be easily heard throughout my home if desired. The sound quality in the basement is the same as when you’re in the same room as the speaker. This speaker also has a very long battery life. Since I received it a few weeks ago I’ve only charged it once and I use the speaker almost every day.A quality about this speaker that truly distinguishes it from others is it comes with a micro SD card. You can load songs onto this micro SD card so you don’t have to connect your phone and waste your phone battery. The sound quality is still the same and allows you to listen to music even when you’re in an area without any cell reception. You are most definitely getting your money’s worth with this speaker especially since it’s a high quality speaker for only $33.User CompatibilityThis speaker can work for anyone that has an electronic device that has Bluetooth capabilities and even if you don’t have Bluetooth there’s the micro SD card to load music onto. Once a device connects once to the speaker it automatically reconnects the next time your device is near the speaker. This speaker can be used by anyone ranging from 13 years old to 80 years old. It is very easy to navigate with its touch controls and clearly labeled buttons. The Doss speaker works in a variety of situations it can be used as a music source during a gathering or even out on a boat ride.DesignThe Doss speaker is built to be user friendly. It weighs just over one pound and is compact enough to be carried in a backpack or a purse. Its sleek features really push it over the top when comparing it to competitor speakers.I would recommend this speaker to anyone who is looking for a portable speaker; it fits a variety of lifestyles and has great sound quality!
3,The instruction provided in the box don’t say anything about the blue and red colors that appear as soon as you power it up. It also shuts down automatically after 15 minutes.I contacted the manufacturer and there was an email thread asking for numerous pictures of the device so they could send me the proper Firmware update. Oh and THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT it could only be applied if it was saved to a MicroSD disk and inserted into the speaker. The MicroSD disk also had to be formatted as a FAT partition (normal for 32-bit applications and definitely NOT 64-bit).Also the flashing blue light never stops trying to pair with a device. I’m using this with my laptop for work so I can hear all of the sounds that come in with new email chat requests etc..Once all of that was completed the firmware update was applied and the device started working and NOT shutting down on it’s own (gremlins).I don’t like the touch display because it never actually tells you what you are connecting to except that a red light means it’s coming from the audio cable. Toggling through it leaves you vaguely wondering which Bluetooth connection you toggling over because you won’t know unless there is sound playing. Once it’s connected then you are still left with a bright red light that never dims or goes away. I only gave it a 3-star rating because the speaker is solid and clear. The rest is electronic junk. And at that it’s overpriced.
5,Looking for a really good portable speaker? THIS is the one you need in your life. I was and am impressed with everything about this little device from the iPhone quality box it came in to the amount and clarity of the sound. Somebody went through a ton of computer simulations to come up with this little bad boy. I got it because I wanted to be able to hear music in my garage while I work on my cars and other stuff was hoping it would be loud enough to hear over a box fan running I use to keep my garage cool. Well it will do that AND I can hear it running over my other shop fan and it’s a big one from Home Depot designed to cool an entire auto body shop. The sound is amazing as far as I’m concerned im a quasi audiophile and I can tell you it sounds good and clear and loud for such a little box. Even the bass wich isn’t going to rattle your windows but for the types of music I listen too is a definite impressive feat. (Im into anything from Punk to old Haggard type country) And it sounds good didn’t think it would be loud enough to worry about neighbors but I find myself walking outside to check and make sure I’m not disturbing anyone Nextdoor it’s that loud.Will update with a photo later although I guess it really doesn’t need one but I’m doing it anyways. That’s it for now. Thanks for reading my review.OH Bluetooth range is pretty good about 30 yards I would guess I keep it plugged in on my workbench with my phone charging next too it so really haven’t tested range or battery life.
3,Speaker worked perfectly for about a year until yesterday.  Battery decided it didn’t want to charge anymore.  Tried several times charging light turned green for fully charged as soon as it was unplugged speaker died.  Now unable to use unless it is plugged in which totally defeats the purpose.
5,This Doss speaker is amazing. The quality of sound is great. I returned one that didn’t have the quality this one does. Definitely happy with the 12 watt output. Definitely worth the money !!!
5,I brought this to work everyday actually don’t know if my machine was just too loud or the speaker wasn’t loud enough.. worked 10 hr days and would have to plug it in on my breaks or it would die.
5,The Doss BT speaker really packs a punch for its size. In the picture I added I have it sitting next to a tv remote for size comparisons..the other pic is of the instructions pamphlet showing what is supposed to be enclosed. I put this in there cause there were so many reviews saying they didn’t get an AUX cord I got it in mine but mine didn’t have the carry case it said was in there. That doesn’t really concern me as I bought a storage case for it it’s kind of a hard case w/ storage for AUX & Charger cord.U can have it paired to several devices but only 1 at a time. I paired it to my Fire Stick & have it sitting on my headboard it makes it sound almost like the theater when laying in bed.Other reviewers mentioned they don’t like the “auto off” after sitting unused for a bit of time 15 minutes I think. I like this it can be a minor anoyance but what I like is if I have it hooked up late at night I can cut off the tv or the BT on my phone & it’ll shut down to save energy & I don’t have to wake all the way up to shut things down. It holds a charge for quite awhile & signals you when it’s running low on the charge. It does pump a lota sound for as small as it is.If your listening to music from your phone it plays on Spotify & Amazon Music plus bought songs off the App Store on the IPhone but you’ll hear it ring when it starts out then on my phone the options pop up do I want to continue using the Doss IPhone or phone speaker. (It works w/ android phones too)There’s a slot on the back for a TF card this can be used to put music on making it an all in one no need for music off your phone or the company can install “fixes” on a card & you just insert it & it’ll boot into repair mode.Overall I don’t think I can beat it for the price!
5,Bought for my daughter. Sound is great and louder than I had originally thought it would be. Would recommend!!
5,This little speaker is perfect.
5,Got great sounds and bass 👍😁
4,So far so good it requires a rather long 12 hours to charge and it does not come with a charger luckily I had one to charge it overnight.  It can charge from a USB port for me charger was easier.  This puppy pairs quickly with newer devices and tablets but has a few glitches pairing with older PCs.Unfortunately both the Playback speaker and the Microphone were enabled causing feedback and echoing.  To eliminate the echo when using on laptop you'll have to disable the Bluetooth Microphone so that only the Bluetooth Speaker is enabled.  Having both enabled causes echoing and feedback.Fastest way to sync to your device:  When you turn on DOSS SoundBox the companion file called "DOSS SoundBox should pop up on your computer.  The DOSS SoundBox pop up window helps you CONNECT and DISCONNECT the speaker.It can get glitchy if it doesn't connect or disconnect when you wish then turn speaker off and on again or close the DOSS SoundBox file and reopen the file.  Moving the speaker closer to the device will boost the signal strength.If you can't find the file then search your computer for the Start Menu folder:  Windows\Start Menu\Programs\BT Devices\DOSS SoundBoxAlternate way to sync to your device:Right click the Sound icon select Playback Devices.  Right click on Speakers Bluetooth Audio Device and select the Recording tab.  Right click on  Bluetooth Microphone and select "Disable."When idle for 10 minutes it turns itself off but then it often won't pair correctly if you turn it back on.  The fix for that on the PC is to open the DOSS SoundBox pop up window and click "DISCONNET" then click "CONNECT" to get it to pair correctly.Longer way is to go to Bluetooth Settings; Manage Bluetooth Settings; click DOSS SoundBox; then "Remove Device."  Turn your PC's Bluetooth off and then on again if it doesn't unpair the DOSS SoundBox.  Once it's unpaired then turn the DOSS SoundBox on again the PC go back to Bluetooth Settings; Manage Bluetooth Settings and on the DOSS SoundBox item click "Pair" to sync the speaker back to your PC.
4,If you're thinking of getting this speaker for your latest Echo Dot hoping it'll make it sound better than the latest 2nd generation Echo then you'll be very disappointed.  While this is a decent inexpensive bluetooth speaker that sounds better than most laptops and monitor speakers it can't compete with other higher end Bluetooth speakers (JBL Sony Sonos Bose etc...) despite the product claims.When I compare this to the 2nd generation Echo it sounds like a tin can with feeble bass.  However it's not bad compared to many other Chinese knockoff bluetooth speakers sold on Amazon also with inflated review ratings. I bought this on a sale for less than 30 bucks after reading many Amazon reviews and consistently seeing it as a top seller but I feel that this speaker is popular for the low cost rather than its true performance claims. You can connect this to the Echo Dot using the Aux port or Bluetooth and keep it plugged in as long as you occasionally drain the battery if you care to salvage the wireless power. Beware of the top led lights which is annoyingly bright at night and can't be dimmed nor turned off if you plan to place it in your bedroom. I ended up placing one of my Echo Dot directly on top to cover it up or you could place a piece of cardboard or a thick paper as a workaround.If you're an audiophile and hoping for a worthwhile inexpensive upgrade for the crap speaker of Echo Dot to avoid having it hog your home entertainment system then the big brother Doss Soundbox XL 32W speaker also sold here on Amazon is definitely worth the consideration which is actually surprisingly good for the cost/performance factor.  I considered rating this 3 stars because I almost contemplated returning it after hearing it for the first time. However for an everyday mid-low volume listening I'm going to be generous and give this 4 stars for the affordability and an easy upgrade for most laptops and tablets.
5,This turned out to be the perfect little speaker. The battery life on it is great the sound is really good and it can get loud! I take this fishing with me all the time to listen to tunes while I relax. I tried another smaller one and the battery lasted 4 songs and it wasn't loud at all which made me appreciate this one even more. I've had quite a few people tell me they liked it and that they'd order one.
4,Impressive sound from a compact speaker user instructions could be improved.
4,Great speaker good quality batterly life is great..
4,Much better sound than speakers on a TV across the room. I sit it by my chair or by my pillow in bed and can get great sound without much volume . Very easy to connect via Bluetooth and easy to move room to room.
4,I like the radio. No bass. Well.....not a lot and not impressed at all. However my use is mainly to listen to talk radio and podcasts. Connecting is easy. If your even just a little bit of an audiophile this is NOT your speaker. This would be more for people who are tone deaf or don't know the difference. I have 7 BTS's and I rate this as a tolerant 5 outta 10.A VERY BIG PLUS about this speaker is the company allows for a simple firmware upgrade that allows you to disable the 'auto off' feature which I do not like at all. You'll find it on the company's website under 'Downloads'.  Be sure to follow the instructions to the letter or you may have a paper weight.  But really if you have been around the web and PC use for a while you should be able to handle it.**UPDATE**I decided to test battery life. It states 12 hrs. I'm assuming that's with music with audio leveled at between 50-70%.  I listen to talk radio just about all day. So I put it on started the timer had audio at approx 20-40% it varied throughout the test. Well color me impressed the battery low tone (a phone busy signal which fooled me three times...I couldn't figure out where the heck that was coming from and it was louder than the radio volume hence my confusion) I let it play another half hour before I got tired of the 'busy signal' and plugged it back in power. Grand total? .......wait for it...........26 1/2 hours!!!!  That's impressive.  This speaker is perfect for talk radio podcasts and low level music.
5,I am a tech dummy (by choice mind you). I own an almost 7-year old Toshiba laptop and an inherited ASUS tablet.  I have no smart phone.  I wanted a way to enjoy my carefully and lovingly compiled Amazon music playlists.  I chose this unit based on reviews and because it was one of the first portable speakers that displayed when I searched.  I repeat I am a tech dummy.  However I had no difficulty getting this unit to play music from my tablet.  It does require a 12-hour charge before first use (connected to a plugged in device; I used my laptop for the initial charge).  Once I figured out how to get the Amazon Music app on my tablet I put the charged speaker near the tablet and it paired within seconds (after I remembered to enable the Bluetooth on the tablet doy).  I chose a playlist using the app on the tablet and music flowed from the speaker.  It could not be simpler.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the sound given the low price and small size.  I purchased it listen to music when I'm home alone but I wouldn't hesitate to use this for quiet non-instrusive background music for a cocktail or dinner party.  I can also envision taking this on a trip to listen to music at the cottage in a hotel room or outdoors.  The only non-intuitive feature (for me) is the volume control but fortunately I read a helpful review before purchasing which included a short video and eliminated any perplexity.  I can't speak to battery life as I've only used it for a few hours so far.  According to the instructions after the initial 12-hr charge subsequent charges take 2-3 hours.  As a low-tech person I do wish it included a traditional electrical charger to connect the speaker directly to an electrical outlet rather than charging through another device.  But for most people who have constant charging devices lying about their homes and lives this is probably a non-issue.  Overall I am pleased with this purchase.  I will continue to grow my playlists now that I can finally listen to them easily and enjoyably.
4,Fairly good sound. Sound is OK not as good as my old iHome speaker. Nice little compact size! I will look forward to using it outside when the weather gets better.
5,Quite the little package for the price! I was very impressed with the quality of the product.
5,I was very skeptical when I saw this. I wanted the Marshall speaker but didn't have Marshall money. This speaker is amazing - easy set up great sound battery life is freaking incredible. I was blown away. I recommend it to ALL my friends who are looking for a blue tooth speaker. I also recommend grabbing the little zip up protective cover. Over all 15/10 stars recommend everyone have one. Thank you for coming to my tedtalk.
3,Works ok but larger then I expected
5,The Good:I've owned this bluetooth speaker for nine months and it is by far my favorite portable bluetooth speaker I own. It emits sound that is very crisp and clear without any distortion even while in motion. It has a solid bottom base with a hefty but manageable weight to it. It also seems to naturally adapt to the song or voice frequency that is playing. By this I mean: bass and treble are resonant and defined when the song is a dance song voices are adapted true to reality when it is a person speaking during a podcast.The Better:Being portable I've carried it to different areas of my home with split floors without ever loosing connectivity. In addition I've also used it inside my SUV while driving to test it's performance when outside and during movement. (I placed it atop my dashboard with velcro) It performed just as well even while I drove at high speeds. Again no distortion even at 70+ miles an hour on the freeway. I personally love the speaker's automated voice (British male) which reminds you when the speaker is connected to a bluetooth device when in auxiliary mode and more importantly when battery is running low. In a British accent the voice simply says "low battery please recharge." I Loooove this feature! The speaker also turns itself off when there has been about 10 minutes of inactivity so that power is not wasted unnecessarily.The Best:Battery life is excellent!! I use my speaker to listen to both music and podcasts and a single charge lasts a very long time. Of and on during one week I've calculated about 10.5 hours of use time before I heard the voice reminder to recharge. (Note: there is still power left after you hear the voice reminder) The initial charge when out of the box took about half a day to complete but now it takes less than two hours to get a full charge when the battery is depleted.The Verdict:Highly recommended. For the money paid I think the performance makes it a steal. Sound quality is tops durability and longevity seem to be on track and as of the writing of this review I've had no technical difficulties from the device whatsoever. Five stars are definitely warranted.
5,I'm actually pleasantly surprised by this little speaker. The last time I purchased speakers for my laptop they were very "muted" sounding but I kept them since it was a good brand. I moved to a different state and got rid of those old speakers but then recently my MacBook Pro speakers started to sound rattle-y and terrible! After reading the reviews I decided to order this speaker. It was smaller than I thought it would be so I wasn't expecting much. The directions were very clear and it easily connected to bluetooth. I played something from my itunes and the sound was great! It's clear and can get pretty loud -- but I think it also depends on what you plan to use this for. I don't need it for anything crazy like a loud party but it plays music and videos with good clear quality sound and it also works great for my online classes. Will the sound blow you away? Prob not but it's perfect for basic needs. Be sure to plug it in to charge every few days. It does make a beeping noise when the battery is getting low and it happened to do that in the middle of an important Zoom meeting I was in which was a little frustrating but lesson learned! Overall I'm very happy with this purchase. I love the wireless bluetooth option. I can leave my laptop in one room and bring the speaker with me as I'm doing chores etc.
5,I bought this as a gift for my daughter who listens to a lot of podcasts. It's compact yet delivers big sound.I currently use a soundbar with my tv but will be ordering one of these for myself because of how convenient it is. It's a sturdy little unit that can go literally anywhere.
5,Bought this speaker because the built-in speakers in my 8+ year old laptop weren't very good for watching movies and I wanted something both louder and with better sound.  These definitely fit the bill.  While there is a bit of distortion at full volume (something I don't normally need) they sound pretty good otherwise.  Yeah they're not Bose but for 10% of the cost they're really not bad.  I'm also impressed with the battery life.  Binge-watched most of a season of a TV show without needing to recharge.  The Bluetooth signal seems to work well too; I've left my phone in the bedroom and carried the speaker all over the rest of the house with me without losing the signal.So far I haven't experienced any of the charger cord connection problems other people have mentioned.  If I do I'll come back and update my review.The only negative thing I have to say about this speaker is that it's a bit larger than I was expecting.  I was thinking it'd be about the size of say a package of cream cheese but it's easily 2-3 times that size.  That's not a deal-breaker for me though; it just means that I can't toss it into my laptop bag for travel.  Still fit in my suitcase just fine!FOLLOW-UP:  In a set of unfortunate circumstances the tote bag containing my original DOSS speaker fell out of our rental minivan in a hotel parking lot without our noticing and was (we think) run over.  The front grill of the speaker was squished in at least and we can't think how else that could have happened.  When we realized the bag was missing we came back to the hotel and retrieved it.  Much to our surprise the speaker still works and sounds as good as ever.  It just doesn't look quite as pretty!  I still highly recommend this product.  We love it enough that we bought two more.
4,This is okay it works connects fine sound is a bit... lacking with volume and depth but does get the job done. I am using it in a kitchen.Originally the speaker kept shutting off automatically but I reached out to the manufacturer and they gave me an update to follow and now it stays on until I turn it off! Great support.
5,I have had my speaker for going on 6 years now and let me tell you it is going strong. I have had this thing on the beaches of Thailand wet rocks on river banks in Japan and even in my shower (not a good idea but it’s held up perfectly not under the shower obviously). I don’t usually write reviews but it dawned on me how long this has been by my side and I felt no better time. In full disclosure and honesty on one drunken and emotional occasion it was underhand tossed about 10 feet across a living room into a wall and it kept on playing. My only constructive criticism is that I don’t like the low battery alert. It shouldn’t intermittently interrupt the music for the final 30 minutes of its life I think it should warn once then just flash the external red led or something I know it’s dying let me enjoy my final minutes of music in peace haha. Seriously though I love this speaker and it has stood up to an unreasonable amount of abuse and elemental exposure! Highly recommend to anyone who wants to play music anywhere.
5,Great sound at a great price
5,Working perfectly out of box. really nice sound quality.
4,I bought this as a cheap and disposable speaker to take to the beach with me where I can preload the SD card with songs instead of having to use my phone for Bluetooth. Well to my surprise the sound is powerful and can be alarmingly loud the quality is great and all functions work perfectly.My only complaint and the reason this doesn't get 5 stars is there is no control to how the songs play from the SD card. It appears to shuffle them. Some people say it plays in alphabetical order the company says it plays based on date stamp of the song file... but neither of these seem to be the case. One review said they had to get a firmware update from the company but the company said they don't do this anymore and thr built-in software doesn't support updates or rewrites. Nothing i have tried allows me to set a play order. This isn't a huge deal I guess but it is confounding.Overall a fantastic speaker to take places with you to enjoy good sounding music without a hefty price tag!!
4,My daughter jams out to this every time she showers and the sound it good and loud.  We haven’t had any problems with the sound or battery life.  The color is great on it too fun light purple.
5,Owned for about 3 months now and I use it for music in my showroom during business hours. Great sound quality in an open 3000sf no issues with connectivity. Very good value. On the weekends I take it home and use it for trips to the beach or listening to audio books at home.
4,This is the second DOSS soundbox that I have owned.  It is high quality and easy to use.  Has great sound.  It is a step up from the previous one that I had (that lasted for several years). The only complaint I have and the reason for not 5 stars is that it needs a battery indicator.  There is nothing to tell you that the battery is getting low until it is about to go out.  There is no light that tells you that it is connected to the power source when charging nor when the battery is fully charged. The battery indicator would make it perfect!
4,I love the color and the sound quality.
5,Love it and easy to use
5,2nd one I have bought great value
4,This review is for the DOSS Touch Wireless Bluetooth V4.0 Portable Speaker with HD Sound and Bass (Black) had this speaker for almost 2 months now. This is my take.Looks wise the speaker is very appealing. The touch buttons at the top of the speakers are great. I hardly have to press them for them to become responsive (Careful turning the volume up with your fingers you might turn it all the way up by mistake is really loud) So far there has been no need for me to have the volume all the way up.After pairing it with my phone and my Amazon echo this speaker has had no trouble connecting to either. To some the sleep function can be annoying for Alexa purposes since the speaker might disconnect from Alexa when going to sleep. However there are times when the speaker remains on with Alexa altogether. Not shutting off. I'm guessing is because the echo is somehow keeping the speaker busy with something. A couple of times I have left the speaker on by mistake and came back hours later to a speaker that was still connected to my echo. Might be glitch. It doesn't matter in my case since I mostly use this speaker with my phone to listen to music.The only reason I'm giving it 4 starts instead of a 5 is because the power button can be a bit hard to push. When turning on and off I really have to press the button deep in order for it to work. I would have loved it if the power button was at the top of the speakers. Also when charging the speaker there is a light that indicates when is charging and when is not. That light is very hard to see because the charging cable constantly blocks the view. I have to pick up the speaker to check whether is done charging.If they would have thought out positioning for those two issues it would have been a solid 5 starts from me.
4,Honestly it's a 3 star item but the price point gets the 4th star.Note: My use is watching tv on my tablet untested with much music use.The build is solid feeling like you could knock someone out with this thing and it wouldn't have a dent.The battery lasts surprisingly long as well I did about a week of using it a few hours a night and it was at like 60%.The Bluetooth will auto connect to paired deviced every time as long as your device is on before the speaker is turned on.The sound however is where the praise ends. Yes the levels are all good and will get the job done better than your built in device speakers but you can definitely tell it's just a pair of cheap desktop speakers inside. My closest equation would be like the cheapest set of Logitech desktop speakers you could find. Expect some light pops or crackling thankfully not enough to ruin your entertainment completely but you'll hear them. It also suffers from the same thing most cheap speakers do where certain frequencies will cause that annoying speaker cone vibration. This happens more often for me than the crackling.So yeah it's not the best and most of my review leaned negative but again I think for what you get it's priced perfectly.
3,I bought this one in particular because it wasn’t supposed to make a lot of extraneous noise like other speakers with blue tooth.  Occasionally it starts reading out the titles and artists of songs (not sure why) which is irritating and hard to get it to stop.  The touch sensitive “buttons” should just be regular buttons.  The wheel on top to adjust volume often doesn’t work and you have to do 1-2 full 360s before you can get the volume to change at all.  I wouldn’t get this again I really just wanted something with an AUX line to plug into for use as a white noise machine and this is too fiddly.  That being said the sound itself is nice.  It just takes too much time and effort to get it to play.
3,The sound quality is ok but not real great. What I expected for the price though.
5,Love this speaker!! Great sound quality and super easy to connect to devices.
5,For a Bluetooth speaker of this size price weight etc. It's excellent! Great sound pleasant on-off/connection/low battery notice tones (some brands have very annoying or over-loud sounds or robo-voices) overall great. The one issue I've noticed is volume control at lower volumes can be a little jumpy. Hard to find that "sweet spot" at lower levels that's not too loud or too quiet. That's a very minor issue and may be the sending device/phone. All in all a great little speaker that does the job!
5,This is a great little speaker! It's easy to charge and the battery life is great. I love that it announces who is calling when you get phone calls and the controls on the top are easy to see and control. The volume control is a little weird being a circular capacitive control but it works pretty well. My only concern is durability for the long term vs physical buttons/controls.This speaker can get a little tinny with hollower sounds (I listen to podcasts and on higher volumes the incoming calls to the show can sound tinny) but overall the volume and sound quality is impressive for this inexpensive speaker. I also love that this one has some water resistance.For the price all these features and the build of this speaker this is a good option if you want a budget speaker that doesn't break the bank.
4,So far the quality seems great. I am not a music "geek" so don't worry too much about bass treble etc.. Volume is plenty loud and it sounds good. Using  the touch control on the device seems finicky so I use the sound control on the phone which is easy. Not so easy on the laptop.When I connected this via my laptop the connection seems to go in and out but I am going to blame that on my PC. I used the stereo cable to connect and it works great.The Bluetooth is the bigger issue. Although it was easy to pair to two devices you can't seem to connect them at the same time. I wanted to connect to two devices listen to music but have the phone ready when a call came in. I have to disconnect from one device before connecting to another.I haven't used it without have it being plugged in so I can't speak to the battery life just yet.Still satisfied and would recommend it for its sound and portability.
5,Great item in TV
4,Better than I could've ever thought
5,Pros:1. Excellent build quality. Touch interface looks and works great.2. Pleasantly heavy and feels sturdy.3. The aluminium grill is aesthetically satisfying.4. Exceptionally good sound quality not for the price but among most portable speakers under $100 range.  4.1. It delivers surprisingly accurate sound in any range but especially mid/high range. I played a symphony once and every single instrument is pronounced. With songs vocals sound clear and crisp.  4.2. I always disliked "powerful" "breathtaking" bass in portable speakers. They just sound dumb and usually muff high range response without enhancing overall sound quality. This speaker is an exception. Bass is there but neither overpowers nor interferes with other sounds.  4.3. Loud enough to fill a reasonably large indoor space.Cons:1. Not waterproof.2. With full volume tiny distortion may be sensed. Understandable considering its size.3. It charges only through a micro USB port. No fast-charging.4. Battery capacity is decent not great.5. Can't be used as a speakerphone.DOSS Soundbox Touch does not have all the trivial extra functions you can find in other "affordable premium" speakers like JBL Flip Charge and Sony XB23. However in terms of sound quality this speaker does not lag behind at all if not better. Hands down the best portable bluetooth speaker under the $100 price range.
5,I bought this to have at my desk at the office. It's the best bluetooth speaker that I own! Great size great sound quality and an amazing battery life. I use all day and am still at 70% by Friday.Definitely a must-buy! I love this color too!
5,I have to say that when I purchased this product I never imagined it would exceed my expectations os a $30 speaker. The sound is amazing clear and crisp not too heavy on the bass. The speaker is well manufactured and has a solid feel to it. One thing that makes this speaker exceptional is the company that stands behind it. I originally purchased this to use as a speakerphone for my office so I don't have to wear a headset all the time.When the speaker arrived I immediately charged it up and connected it to my Amazon ECHO the music sounded fantastic and I liked that the volume controller was a touch slider and not mechanical. After listening to music I paired the speaker with my phone and made calls. I could hear the people very clear on the other end but they reported a buzzing sound on their end. I loved this speaker so much I decided not to return it to Amazon and instead contact DOSS the manufacturer. I reported the issue and dealt with a great customer service rep (Lu) who guided me through the steps of resetting the speaker. Unfortunately that didn't work so I emailed Doss to let them know the reset didn't work. Lu emailed me right back to let me know a new speaker was on the way to me. 5 days later it arrived. I immediately charged it up and connected it to my phone. I am happy to report it works perfectly and the people I call tell me the call quality is superb for a speakerphone. I Use my SOSS speaker every day whether it is for calling or playing music and I am so glad I purchased it. If you want a quality Bluetooth speaker or speakerphone and don't want to break the bank trust me this is your product. Thank you DOSS and Lu for making this a great speaker and providing me with a wonderful buying experience I will be purchasing more of your products. Thank you again!
4,If you are looking for portable speakers this will do. It has an ALEXA/Google Dot quality sound do not expect bass out of it.
5,This is a VERY impressive speaker.  The packaging is excellent- safe neat the instructions are clear and both aux and charging cables are included.  Milla from DOSS support was extremely helpful in providing me with both firmwares: the alternate one without the auto-shutoff feature and the original one (there ARE times when I would like the auto-shutoff functionality).  She also clarified something for me that I questioned while updating the firmware- when I updated it at first I had put the micro-SD card in before turning on the speaker (I don't think I've ever had to insert firmware media with a device powered on).  After a few minutes the speaker made a few tones and I thought the update had been successful save for one thing- the speaker did not turn itself off as the instructions had said they would (please note that this has nothing to do with the auto-shutoff functionality of the speaker... it only has to do with the process of updating the firmware).  Milla said to insert the micro-SD card with the unit already powered ON.  She also clarified for me that the original firmware WILL shut off automatically regardless of being powered by its battery or by USB-supplied power.  The alternate firmware WILL NOT shut off automatically regardless of being powered by its battery or by USB-supplied power.This speaker is really an amazing bargain- I paid a little more than twice as much for a speaker that I had bought a few months ago.  I saw this one when I was looking for an additional wireless portable speaker.  The other brand has only SLIGHTLY better bass- certainly not enough to justify its higher cost.  I'm not saying that the bass in this speaker is lacking- it is definitely capable of producing clear unmuffled bass.  I even bought a second one of these and will buy more as needed.  I use them with these little round hockey-puck devices that play music when I ask her uh I mean it to ;-)
5,Easy to Hook up to the Bluetooth on the phone sounds great
5,It's as advertised works well. Product came a day early too.
5,I bought this speaker 3 years ago. Every single day I use it for about 30 minutes over the last year and for the first 2 years it was used for about 4 hours per day while plugged in. I only have to charge it once every couple of MONTHS. Excellent battery life. I use it every day in the shower and it is NOT waterproof (just excellent quality). Recently this speaker was dropped in a 105 degree hot spring and continued to play music for 90 seconds. After this it was dried out and was able to continue playing with no problems until unfortunately being dropped into a campfire. While in the campfire this product was able to continue operating for about 45 seconds of direct contact with a 600 degree flame. Although bluetooth contact was lost after 45 seconds noise continued being produced by the speaker for another 60 seconds. The batteries did explode in a brilliant display of light and cancer producing gases so a campfire is not a recommended operating position for this device nor is a hot spring. 10/10 I am going to order another one and probably not take it camping next time. Great price too.
3,Super cute box but not enuf bass (disappointed) and sounds like a “tin can”
3,Have only had this thing up and running for a few days so take all of this with a big fat grain of salt Sally.  Assuming (and this is a big assumption these days) I can get this lil’ blue tooth devil to last me three years before it croaks then for my $28.00 (plus no shipping cost via Amazon Prime) I will consider my yearly “rental” of said product at $9.00 plus change worth it.PROS:  Hey it sounds OK for a tiny box with small speakers covered in plastic. Not great not bad but OK. The laws of physics dictate that you can only cram so much high-fidelity into a tiny box with small speakers covered in plastic that costs about $28 bucks at retail. Period.Anyone who tells you otherwise is bordering on senility stupidity or both. Or has a last name spelled T-R-U-M-P which is basically the same as the previously mentioned mental deficiencies. (Sorry for the humor if it offends the faithful of Fearless Leader i.e. der Führer ).For what it is it sounds fine. No big complaints. Look. No you ain't gonna get any great highs or great big booming bass or any other sound for that matter that sounds like it is coming from a speaker 10 times that size that costs 5 times as much. Ain’t gonna happen. If that’s what you expect then grow up and go get a job.CONS: Not crazy about the fact that it appears you cannot (easily at any rate) replace the battery so that aspect seems to be planned obsolescence. Meaning the product appears to be engineered to die at some point ergo my comments in the 1st paragraph about getting it to last just three years.So there ya go. You’re welcome. No need to thank me for taking my valuable time to do this.
5,I got this little box a few months after going into quarantine and started working from home.  It’s been over a year now and it definitely doesn’t disappoint.  The battery charge lasts for DAYS and the sound is great. I’m back to order another because I’m working in 2 different locations now and honestly I just want to make sure I get another one before they disappear or something.  I’ve tried 2 other brands and they don’t even compare to this one.  Also the charger is your basic USB port. The other 2 I got had their own kind.  I like how universal this charger is.
5,I love this Bluetooth speaker.  It connects very quickly to my iPhone and the sound is AMAZING and crystal clear.  It’s easy to control and is small enough for placement just about anywhere.  I’ve only owned this unit for a week but so far the charge lasts a long time without needing to be recharged.  I highly recommend!!
4,This is a great little speaker for the price. I'm not sure it's finest quality sound. If you need that you need to look at a higher price point. I use this to play music from my phone in my bath and bedroom when getting ready in the morning. So I'm using it in a fairly small space for about 30 minutes a day. But it works great. I charged it when I got it for 12 hours as recommended. That first charge lasted just over 2 weeks. I used to use my ipod and a speaker dock but it took up too much room on my vanity and had to be plugged in. (the old one only stayed powered for an hour or so on battery). When I got a new iphone I finally retired the old ipod loaded up my phone and moved to bluetooth. So great. It's easy to pair to my phone. It does seem to have to re-pair every time but it's just a few seconds delay to get started. The voice tells you when it's paired and when the speaker needs charging. Second charge doesn't take as long. You can charge it off USB to your computer or plug it into a USB adapter to a plug. (Like the one that comes with your iphone). I didn't intend to use it as a speaker for my phone but I accidentally made a call while it was still paired and I was able to hear the caller on the speaker. I'd recommend this speaker. I got the white and it looks nice and clean. The controls are intuitive. You can adjust the volume on the scroll wheel (like the old ipod dials) you can pause skip a track go back etc. The size is discreet and fits on my window sill. No wires! Hope you will like yours!
5,I been have mine for 3 years and almost everyday use!!! It gave out last week. I'll be buying more!!!!
3,I have a love/hate relationship with this speaker.  There are so many things to like but also several to hate.Pros:  The speaker sounds really good - for the price.  I compared it to my daughter's Bose Soundlink and the Bose was much better but also much more expensive.  I wanted something under $30 to use in my office.  When you compare it to the JAM   JAM Classic Bluetooth Wireless Speaker (Black) HX-P230BK         or Philips   Philips BT2500B/37 Compact Wireless Portable Bluetooth Speaker         I own with similar costs the BOSS outshines them both.  Much louder better bass (but not great - more in CONS).  I was nervous about the touch type buttons on the top but they work well.  The speaker is well constructed and last forever.  My daughter uses it to watch movies on her iPad.  I've used it in my shop working or in the attic.  I will last more than a day on a single charge.  Really happy about that.CONS:  My biggest CON is the stupid sound it makes when the device connects.  It is an obnoxious multiple tone beep sequence that is LOUD. I bought this for my office so I could listen to music with my iphone.  I had no intentions of alerting my neighbors every time I connected to the speaker.  It is loud - ridiculously loud.  No other bluetooth speaker I have is so obnoxious.  I quit using it in my office because of it.Also - and this may just be me - but once I connected to this speaker with my iPhone the iPhone didn't want to connect to anything else especially my truck.  It took a while to narrow this down but the problems only stopped when I "forgot" this speaker on my iPhone.  As a result I don't connect with my iPhone anymore just iPads.  One more reason not to use it at the office.  I have looked through the reviews of this speaker - no one else mentions this problem. I've had two iPhones - both did the same thing.Con #3 - the buttons on the top will sometimes get "pressed" when you move the speaker around.  For example I'll bring this thing in the attic or on the back porch or wherever then move to the shop or kitchen - boom accidentally pressed the "next" button or worse - the "mode" button.  Ugh if you accidentally press the "mode" button just turn it off and start over.Bottom Line  - If you keep this speaker in your house or room and don't mind an annoying series of beeps when you connect this speaker sounds really really good for the price.  Otherwise you may be like me and just give it to the kids and look for something else.
4,A really good speaker!  Especially for the price.
5,UPDATE: DOSS Customer Support reached out to me about the malfunctioning speaker and sent me a replacement without hesitation. This speaker works much better than the previous one purchased. I still cannot have a wall in between my media device and the speaker or it akips but the range is much much better! Bumped up to 5 stars due to wonderful customer service and a better functional product!*So I gave this product 3 stars for sound quality and appearance. The sound is absolutely amazing! Note to those using bluetooth: Make sure your media volume is up on whatever device you're using because at first I didn't think the sound was that spectacular even though the speaker was all the way up. But after turning the volume all the way up on BOTH my bluetooth device AND the speaker the sound is absolutely incredible for such a small device!*NOW.... I took away 2 stars because many raved about this speaker and the distance people were able to go without it skipping. Some said they were able to enter a separate room while others said they were able to go downstairs with it working perfectly. I must be one of the unlucky people because if i walk away from the speaker with my bluetooth device in hand  I cant go any further than approximately 10 feet before it starts to skip in and out (and believe me it's quite noticable). The product description says 33 feet; however when I go that distance away the music simply cuts out. I paid $10 for a different speaker at Walmart and got the same quality when it comes to range. Not what I was expecting for a $30 product that guarantees it...While I'm happy about the quality of sound I'm DEFINITELY not impressed with the range.
4,Better than I expected to be honest. 👍🏾
5,We have been very happy with the sound from this small relatively inexpensive Bluetooth speaker
5,Easy to use good battery sounds great
4,pairs good with tablet not so well with laptop
5,This speaker is by far one of the best I've heard. I love the colors it comes in I chose the pink one 💗.  You will be very satisfied with this choice I'm most positive.
4,Received the speaker yesterday. Was impressed with the packaging it looked really premium and the speaker feels good and sturdy. I was surprised to learn that I need to charge it for 12 hours before switching it on. Anyway I put it to charge and I could see the red light below the micro USB port on the speaker which indicated that it was charging. In about less than 2 hours the light started blinking green and red. This confused me so I opened up the manual to figure out what it means. I couldn't find anything about blinking red-and-green light so I let the speaker charge further and waited for the light to become a stable and green.Six hours on charge and the light is still blinking red and green. So I left it to charge overnight and it was the same in the morning. I unplugged the charger and tried turning the speaker on. It won't turn on!! I held the power button for several seconds still no response. It turns on when it is connected to the charger but as soon as I disconnect the charger it turns off. I think there's some issue with the battery. Really disappointed with this speaker. I spent almost an entire day reading the reviews for this speaker and comparing it with several others and finally I decided to purchase this one. DOSS needs to have better quality control before shipping products to their customers.UPDATEDoss Customer Support offered to send me a replacement speaker and refund the full amount as well no questions asked! I was really happy with their service. I received the replacement speaker last week. It works fine. The bass is not as pronounced as I expected it to be but a really good deal for this price.
5,Nothing
2,Works OK for a while then it starts making a buzzing noise.  It gets to the point where the buzzing noise is all you can hear.Amazon where unable to help and suggest I reach out the DOSS.Contacted DOSS and was told there was nothing they could do even though I had purchased the item within the year.DO NOT BUY AS IT WILL NOT LAST AND THERE IS NOT SUPPORT IF THERE ARE ANY ISSUES
5,I really like it is very power and work as expected.
2,I loved the design and sound quality of the unit. But there is something wrong with the battery. I explained the entire situation with their excellent customer service agent. See below of the specific issues I had with the unit:Thank you for the customer service but I will be returning the product. I do not wish to receive another since it appears to be a common issue.I can explain the issue in depth:1. Speaker worked as described for the 1st 3 days of use.  I used it primarily as a speaker for my PC since i like the small single unit over the dual PC speakers.2. I recharged the unit as described in the directions. I plugged the unit (USB on the computer) in and the volume light turns red until it is fully charged then it turned to green. I have left the USB plugged into the PC while watching a movie.  I wonder if there is an issue if you keep the unit plugged in.3. On the 4th day while watching a Youtube video the unit began to beep every 20 to 30 seconds (BEEP-BEEP) and then stopped. I figured it required charging and plugged the unit into my USB port on the PC. The volume indicator did not turn red and continued to beep every 20 to 30 seconds.4. I switched to a wall outlet with a USB adapter and the same issue still continued (see #3) after 3 hours of charging.5. I also turned if off while recharging for a couple of hours and when I turned it back on the BEEP-BEEP sound as above continued again. Either way with the unit off or on while charging there is no indicator light to show the unit is charging.6. The beep sound continued while using bluetooth and the music sound became distorted. I assume this was occurring due to a bad battery that can't hold a charge.The firmware fix for the low battery indicator beep sound is not the issue.  Why should it beep if the battery is charged? It appears it is a faulty battery and either doesn't take a charge very well or if kept charging it may be reducing the battery life albeit very quickly.Thank you for your prompt response and effort to fix the issue but until the problem with the battery is corrected (besides "Fix Patch updates") and current reviews are consistent without the problems other have mentioned and I have now become aware of personally I will not consider purchasing another unit.P.S. Loved the design and size of the unit. Just needs a more dependable battery.If one reviews the most recent posts on the product you will see it appears to be an ongoing issue. Possibly quality control is poor and some units are good while other are not.
4,I bought this in late 2017 (June 2021 as of writing) and the speaker finally died. The cause of death was the charger port cables coming loose on the inside (yes I disassembled it to find out). This was most likely due to me throwing the speaker around in my car and at work for basically three years.The speaker has a very good battery life range of volume and sound production. The only real problem I have had is the connectivity. In open areas it has very long range but is easily disrupted by walls and doors.All in all I am going to replace my first with a second rather than buying a more expensive JBL product of a comparable nature/
4,I love this little speaker but I am disappointed with the lack of base.  There are no controls for treble/base but maybe that’s normal for these Bluetooth wireless speakers… this is my first one.  I’m cancelling my SiriusXM when it expires & will take this on our trips & play music off my Pandora app. on my phone.  Much cheaper than continuing satellite radio.
5,Bought this for my desk at work and am really enjoying it.  I don't really use the call functions or anything beyond just playing music and podcastsbut I think it sounds and looks great.
4,Connectivity was no problem. Sound was better than expected but it is not the quality of a Bose mainly because the bass is lacking and volume not as loud as Bose
5,I am so in love with this speaker. Amazing sound quality so easy to pair with phone and watch. I’ve had for a week and have yet to recharge. The volume control is touch I love it!!! Worth every penny. And it’s adorable. You won’t regret this purchase.
3,Good sound quality.  Just wish it would play radio through a nano.  Otherwise very good.
4,Very good speaker. i haven't had any issues as of yet. not super loud but gets the job done
4,A timeless adage goes "you get what you pay for"Nowhere does that ring more true than audio equipment.  Amps home entertainment systems surround sound headsets... And the reason we're here Bluetooth speakers.So where to start?  This is a great starter Bluetooth speaker for the money.  It actually has decent highs and booming lows.  It's mids leave a tad to be desired but as far as it's ranges are concerned it is passable on all 3 fronts.  You're not going to be brought to tears from it's clarity while listening to your favorite classical song or anything.  I mainly use it for metalcore/death core/djent.  For the price I paid?  It performs well enough to be happy.  I'm a musician at heart so I will always be left wanting more with my audio equipment but being a frugal consumer I know especially when it comes to playing instruments you can have the best gear in the world and still sound bad!That being said if you're also a musician you'll notice some clipping and even a little washing out when you crank the volume.  It's subtle but it's present.  My S.O. doesnt notice but I do to my frustration.  Then I remember that the most important part is that I have something to play music through when we have guests and it makes for a great atmosphere and fun times which for my money this thing outperforms just using your phone speaker at a ridiculously affordable price.It's not a Sony or a Bose BT speaker but it still sounds good and you're bound to have a good time whenever it's around.  If you're looking for a budget BT speaker you've found a great option!
3,...I wish I had.As it ships this speaker has two major design flaws:1. Turning on the speaker and connecting to a Bluetooth device both cause VERY VERY LOUD noises that cannot be disabled or turned down2. The speaker turns itself off after ~20 minutes without music playing even when plugged inYou can email the vendor to get a firmware update that you can install using a 32 GB or smaller microSD card. The vendor was very responsive but there's no way to just download what are apparently frequently-requested updates.And even when the firmware is updated there are still frustrating problems1. The speaker never shuts itself off even when unused and not plugged in2. The volume control stops working after a day or so and you need to restart the speaker... but it's hard to tell if you've successfully restarted it because the firmware update has disabled all noises3. The button layout on the top of the speaker is unintuitive which doesn't sound like a big deal but annoys me every dayI bought this speaker because my previous cheap speaker didn't have forward and back buttons and I needed to skip tracks using my phone. Because of the problems listed above I still end up using my phone.This is a flawed device. After applying  the firmware updates it is usable but the firmware updates should likely be treated as required. I gave a generous three stars because it does what it needs to do and because for the price point I should not expect too much.Next time I won't be so cheap.
5,I gave it 5 stars in 2020 but I’m back in Feb 2022 just to bring the point home.I purchased this for cart teaching (elem. music teacher in a pandemic- you get it)This thing has fallen from several feet been thrown been stepped on- it’s had dirt kicked into it. I accidentally left it on the playground overnight DURING A THUNDERSTORM…it’s still working like brand new. It gets really loud the sound quality is good. 10/10 forreal.
5,I have a name brand speaker which costs much more but I don't want to take it with me when I golf so I got this DOSS speaker. For my purpose and the price I couldn't be happier. It sounds great and I like it because I can download music to an SD card and listen to my preferred songs. Bluetooth connectivity is not an issue and the battery lasts a long time. If this speaker gets damaged or eventually stops working I would not hesitate to buy another one.
5,There are many with so many functions and keys but sometimes that can be overwhelming.This product's control scheme is simple but still delivers quality sound. I think this is best bang for the buck. I bought this to play music in my Garage while I work on vehicles. Sound quality could be better but at this price I have no complaints.
5,I purchased this speaker for my classroom. It works perfectly and the sound is an improvement from my previous little bluetooth speaker. The only problem was the built-in auto shut-off feature. This is an important feature for a lot of people but for my use in the classroom it was a drawback as I don't want to have to physically touch the speaker each time I need to play our songs. And since my speaker is always plugged in I found the feature a little redundant. So I googled the problem and found out there is a fix that Doss AV can send you to alter the firmware in the speaker and get rid of the auto shut-off. From the moment I contacted them they have been amazing. Not only did they send me the steps to install the firmware update they are also sending me the micro SD card I will need to do so. Doss customer service reps have been very communicative and interested in solving my issue with the speaker I purchased.
5,I ordered this to use with my phone's music app or Pandora. My son fiddled with it for a couple minutes and had it connected to Bluetooth in no time at all. We feel the sound quality is very good for a small speaker. I don't know how long the battery will last as i just got it and haven't used it much. We plan on taking it with us next summer for a camping trip and also for a family reunion picnic. It's compact and should travel well. For the money we're quite pleased with the speaker.
5,Small box with great sound.
5,Nothing
4,First and foremost this is an initial review.  I've had the product less than 24 hours and I will edit this review after I've used the product for a longer period of time.This speaker seems very well built.  It's got a study feel to it and the buttons/volume control are fast acting.  Which was something I was a bit worried about.  The volume control may seem funky to some honestly it's just like a flat knob.  It's easy practical and is actually a very nice feature.  The ring on top gives the product a nice look.  I'm a light kind of guy. I like leds lights things that make products stand out.  This one took the cake I that part.  The max volume is ok.  I wasn't overly impressed with the volume.  I have a 808 speaker at work that I may end up comparing to.  The overall size of the speaker is actually smaller then I expected not saying that is a bad thing just saying if it had to be increased I size to provide more volume it would be better in my eyes.  Sound quality seems great so far.  I haven't pushed it hard yet to see what it will deliver again I'll edit this post with more info at a later date.So as of right now I'm giving it a 4 star review  due to the slight lack of volume.  It's not that the speaker isn't loud.  It just wasn't as loud as I expected.  Current price when I bought it was about 33 dollars so at that price it's defiantly worth the money. Thats all for now.-Matt
1,First off... The battery life and Bluetooth range for this speaker are great; everything else sucks.Do not believe any of the reviews stating this item has solid sound it does not. I've had smaller speakers made by monster even that sound much much better. While it's not bad for movies and TV hell it even helped on the new Dune release it's HORRIBLE for music. There is 0 mid or low range. I'm not complaining because it's not a THX quality theater experience in a compact package I'm complaining because it makes everything even classical and country music sound bad.I listen to it all here is some proof:Beethoven: Symphony No. 7- All of the gravitas is removed from the resonation in these chords. It sounds almost chip-tune-like.Matt Mason: "E"-This is not a country song that relies on you feeling the music it's poppy but fun. Through this speaker it retains much of those qualities however it sounds better through my gen 3 dot.Led Zepplin: Stairway to heaven-It actually doesn't sound so bad on here because this entire song is recorded in such high tinny notes that it never totally drops out of this speakers range. That said there is a hollowness to the vocals that is palpable.Five Finger Death Punch "The Bleeding (Acoustic)"-Garbage. Ivan's vocals are reduced to being absolutely ineffective the music is equally neutered. I picked the acoustic to review because I thought it would be impacted the least given the bands tuning and mixing habits during production.Dropout Kings "I ain't depressed"-Horrible. It actually made my ears hurt I had to switch to my pods to finish the song.NF "Mansion"-The speakers are not horrible for this song maybe it's because of Nate's skillful mixing and mastering? It sounds better on every other audio device in my house and I did have to turn it down... But it wasn't a nightmare.Young Jeezy "Lost my mind"-Trash couldn't finish the speaker sounded like it developed acute gastritis.Corpse "R-girls are ruining my life"-For fun... It's horrible I had to stop it about 30 seconds in.I synced it back to my tablet and put on The Blacklist it's perfectly acceptable.Make sure you're getting this speaker for the right functions. If you want a movie and TV audio enhancer it's fine. If you want this for music it's the worst device I've ever purchased.****Oh yeah it shuts off after like 3 minutes of inactivity. So if you're studying or doing anything else using it for movies or TV even expect to have to turn it back on a lot.
4,My wife & I love this speaker and I'd give it 5 stars except for one issue. The first speaker they shipped worked once then wouldn't turn on again. DOSS customer service immediately offered a free replacement. Later we discovered that the problem might have been corrected by using the reset button on the back which is strangely located inside the aux port. But we just went ahead and exchanged it and haven't had any problems with the new speaker.Pros:Loud volume for its sizeGood balanced sound quality; Stereo soundDecent bass; although it doesn't dig deep the bass lines are full and presentFeels sturdy and well builtLooks sharp (we got the black one)Touch interface has "cool factor"Play/pause skip & rewind buttonsThe ring changes color and blinks to indicate bluetooth pairing and input typeVoice announces bluetooth pairing and low batteryGood bluetooth rangeBluetooth 4.0 provides clear sound qualityBattery lasts a long time between chargingGood customer service from DOSSCons:Changing volume with the touch wheel can be a little awkward and inaccurateBuilt-in voice has a thick accent and is difficult to understandNot waterproof although it includes a waterproof travel bagGets confusing when we have a few phones/tablets paired to it we have to disconnect them to pair it to the correct deviceDistorts slightly at the highest volume seems like it might blow the speaker (I never use it that loud anyway)The first speaker malfunctionedSound quality:The sound is warm round even and balanced. It doesn't sound tinny or try to push too much treble for crispness. The bass is surprisingly good; although it doesn't dig deep the basslines are full and audible. I found that positioning the speaker in front of a wall enhances the bass. Not sure if it's ported in the back or just gets help from the reflections.Overall we're very happy with this purchase and use it constantly.
3,For the price this is a good blue tooth speaker.  I primarily listen to book tapes or NPR (not music) and the sound quality is adequate but a little muffled.  With audio books though the start of words can be clipped slightly - not enough to make it hard to understand but enough to be annoying. The on off button is slower to use than a simple on/off switch like my last speaker. You have to hold it down for about 3 seconds for it to respond - those seconds can seem very long when I'm in a hurry. Love the lavender color which is probably why I chose this speaker.
4,Got this for my husband for Christmas and he really likes it.
4,Up-front...  I purchased this primarily for playing audio books from my smartphone not for plsying music for parties etc.  So I can't really judge it on a musical reproduction level.  When I listen to music it's on an audiophile-grade 7.1 sound system or using high-end headphones...  or at worst in my car.The volume level and clarity is ideal for my purposes and music sounds fine though there are some compromises there.The biggest issue is a tendency to clip playback at times.  After a breath sometimes the audio takes an instant to pick up again losing the first dyllable of a paragraph.  This does not happen consistently however...  most often in bluetooth-noisy situations.  And it seems not to happen using the alternative device firmware the manufacturer provides which disables the power-saver functionality though I can't be 100% certain the two are related.I got this during a pre-Christmas sale for $20 and it's certainly an exceptional deal at that price.  At full price it's still a nice buy but perhaps not the best in it's price range.
4,I got this speaker to replace the Oontz Angle.  I was really looking for some more bass and a deeper sound. I understood though that in order to get bass you will spend at least $75 dollars if not more. So I wasnt exactly expecting Bose quality.It definitely still could use more bass and if this was being used outside it would sound like it has even less bass. But... that being said it is nice sound regardless and I just use in my small apartment when I'm tinkering around or cooking. It was really easy to set up and connect. I haven't set up my Echo dot yet but I definitely want to and will in the near future It is heavier than I was expecting and feel durable. The battery life seems good but i don't use it super super often or for long periods of time so I probably would not experience significant battery drain anyway. I have not really blasted it volume wise bc I share an apartment in a house but the volume i have used it at is clear. I have it set up with my phone bluetooth and i can adjust the volume w my phone or with the unit itself.
4,I really loved this bluetooth speaker great sound portable long lasting battery and fairly durable.Why did I give it 1 star after all this praise? Well the overall construction and speaker seems durable but the internal pieces inside in which you plug the audio cable and USB port to charge the speaker are not durable at all. They're loose and overtime will bend and/or break with heavy use which happened to me... The plastic piece inside the USB port broke off and looks extremely flimsy.. which I use this speaker everyday at the park working out at work and more... Great  speaker but if your point of failure and weakness is the most important part on the speaker then what's the point? Not only that but the DOSS Audio website is poorly made and I have no idea how or where to return this and waiting for a reply from their contact form on how to proceed with a replacement...UPDATE: 6/15/17I was contacted by a rep from DOSSAV exchanging emails with "Milla" and she helped me with my replacement immediately and instructed me that I would receive the speaker in 3-4 days but arrived much sooner than expect in about 1-2 days! The replacement speaker works great as did the first. I decided to change my review from 1 star to 4 stars because I really do like this speaker great sound and durable. I can't give it 5 stars though because of the flimsy inputs made of plastic. If they improve the design in the next generation of this product they will most certainly have a solid product here!Great customer service in replacing my speaker though 5 stars for Milla!
3,Used it on vacation and also use it as external speaker for my computer.  Does well on both accounts but the quality of the speaker is disappointing.  I guess for the low purchase price it’s might be considered pretty good. But I expected clearer sound.  Maybe it’s the waterproofing that makes some sound seem a little muffled especially at lower volumes.  I’m not sorry I bought it but I need a second speaker so that one of them can be a dedicated computer speaker and the other a dedicated travel speaker.  I won’t buy this one again and will do my research for one that delivers better sound quality.
5,I was pleasantly surprised by the good sound quality and long lasting charge.I picked it almost only based on the price and wasn’t expecting much. But it’s good and I cannot complain.
5,Great sound battery life and price.
5,An upgrade from my previous bluetooth speaker this one is great. Loud great sound profile great battery life solid bluetooth connectivity. Would recommend to a friend.
4,Good sound and great price
5,This little Bluetooth speaker works very well I connected it to my Echo Dot and I can  use it anywhere in the house. The sound is very good considering it's small size. It can be a little tricky to get paired with Alexa I think the problem is in the App not the device. I just kept going through the App settings and finally it worked. It comes on automatically with Alexa and sound great. High quality construction and it's very nice looking.  A very good purchase!
5,The battery life on this is unbelievable. We live in a beach community where we drive a golf cart instead of a car so bought this to mount on the dash for tunes. Got it on June 28th and charged it once ... it's now August 15th and it's still going strong. We drive this golf cart everywhere - restaurants grocery hardware store to the beach etc ... I just had it out playing tunes while I washed the cart for like 2 hours. I don't understand how it still doesn't need to be charged!. Plenty loud enough for the golf cart (they can hear it in the back of a 6 seater while driving) - sound quality is at least as good as the JBL Flip 3 I had in the cup holder before. They could charge double and it'd still be worth it.
5,There are at last count about a zillion small and portable Bluetooth speakers on the market. The DOSS Touch Wireless Bluetooth V4.0 Portable Bluetooth Speaker is one of the best that I have tried. I plan to keep it and make good use out of it. As with all small sound sources it is easily possible to find fault if you use a speaker like this in too large a space or at too great a distance or too high a volume. I would say the optimum area and situation for using any speaker like this would be in close proximity to your own position as at a dinner table or an office desk and at a volume that you would feel comfortable with that close to the sound source. You are obviously not going to host a dance party in a living room with a speaker like this. It's really better to think of this whole category of speakers as more like mega external earphones on steroids. All that said I am very impressed with the general design and sound quality of the DOSS Touch Wireless Speakers. For listening to jazz blues pop and so forth at dinner or in a hotel room it really is outstanding. The only thing lacking in the overall excellent design is a carrying case or bag being supplied with the speaker. That would really make it a toss in the suitcase and go accessory. Set up and pairing could not have been easier sound quality is excellent bass pleasing and volume generous. As I said you shouldn't plan to use any speaker like this for anything other than close proximity personal enjoyment not as a sound source for a big group in a big space. I am a happy user of the  DOSS Touch Wireless Bluetooth V4.0 Portable Speaker.
4,This speaker sounds great for indoor use and on the patio but you loose some of the sound quality when you use it outdoors and increase the volume. For example when using it on the patio if your on the patio it is okay when your out in the yard and turn up the volume you can still hear your music but the quality of the sound is lost. Or this could just be because of way the patio bounces back the music. The battery life is okay.
5,I had a problem with my first speaker I purchased. It came and wouldn't work without randomly skipping songs on it's own. But I returned it and got a new one and haven't had a single problem with this one.I love this speaker.-The sound quality is great and it's loud enough for my tastes (I'm the one who's always getting yelled at to "TURN IT DOWN!")-It's easy to connect and use with your phone (my older mom ended up buying one after hearing mine and she was able to set it up with no help)-It's easy to skip/pause/etc. because you can do it from the device you're using or on the speaker itself-It charges pretty quickly and the battery lasts a long time!-It tells you when it needs a charge by beeping in the middle of songs repeatedly. Some might find this annoying I personally appreciate the incessant reminder.-It's really portable! I carry all around the house with me while i'm cleaning cooking taking a shower getting ready or just hanging out and it works great everywhere!-It connects to my phone super easy and quick every single time!-It turns off on it's own if you pause something and never turn it back on! Again good for someone like me who forgets about things like that.If you have any problems with random skipping return it! But I highly recommend!
5,Great sound . Stays charged
5,I am using it as a sound enhancement for my computer it’s better then two different computer speakers I’ve owned before.
4,Very easy to initiate the startup of Bluetooth connection
5,Exceeded my expectations! For such a cheap speaker it does an excellent job in terms of battery life and sound quality. Pairing is simple and the touch aspect in place of physical buttons is convenient for clean up especially when using it in a commercial kitchen for work. Excellent purchase highly recommend.
4,A bit small when you see it. It works very well for family functions but probably not a house party. Easy to pair with phone. Definitely worth the asking price.
5,After my old Bluetooth speaker stopped charging I needed something to replace it in the garage. I looked at a couple of different models but didn't want to pay $100 for one. Despite its price and small size it really does have great sound quality. It also has some weight to it and feels pretty sturdy.Bluetooth connectivity on it was a breeze. I've had other Bluetooth speakers that made the process feel like pulling teeth. Not with this one. I connected my Galaxy S9 Plus to it in just a couple of seconds. Without even knowing I went down two flights of stairs to the basement with my phone in my pocket and the signal was still strong.The battery life is also pretty surprisingly good. I spent two nights (5 hours each) in the garage on a single charge. It still had juice in it and this was with the volume on high.Finally it has a MicroSD slot! I didn't even know that when I bought it. I just wanted any Bluetooth speaker. This makes it even better. Instead of having my phone and data plan drain I just load all the music I want onto a card and plug it in.All in all a pretty good buy. If anything changes I'll add to this review.
5,Purchase made for XMas for little 8 year old girl who I don’t know very well so buying her this was a hit as she constantly dances to music. She has had it with her everywhere I’ve seen her since giving it to her last month. Her mom said it was easy connecting it to her IPad device.  I thought price was great as got it in bundle deal and the sound of the speaker is pretty clear and loud enough for using at home gatherings.
5,I’ve had this speaker for five years! And it’s running great. If anything it doesn’t hold charge for as long as it used to but it’s been five years so I’m OK with it. I did not think it would last this long
4,Pros:* Good volume fills my wood shop with sound* Battery lasts a long time* Connects quickly and maintains connection pretty wellCons:* If you switch between connected devices it can be a little clunky* Playing speech (tutorials podcasts movies) sometimes audio popsI have two of these one in my house and one in my wood shop. They are great for playing music or as external speakers on a laptop. If I'm playing a movie or TV show on my laptop I do notice that some dialogue sounds tend to cause the speakers to pop but I haven't heard it do that with music even at high volumes.If my husband and I both have bluetooth enabled on our phones we sometimes have to manually disable bluetooth on one devivce to get the speaker to connect to the other device. This isn't a dealbreaker by any means and if you never switch devices it's not a problem at all. Some speakers allow you to connect to multiple devices at once and that eliminates this problem.The speaker comes with a USB cable but no power adapter so I had to buy a separate adapter because I keep the shop speaker plugged in 24/7 and I don't have any USB chargers out there.
5,The Doss Soundbox is a great bluetooth device for the price with an excellent balance of price and quality. Sound wise this device like most in it's price/category focus on mid-tones while providing decent highs and some lows. You'd have to step up to the JBL Flip 3 to get a substantial increase in sound quality. This speaker seems to be most comfortable in a room (kitchen living room dining room) although at higher volumes it does an adequate job outdoors. Audio performance will also depend on the music genre. If you're a bass head nothing in this price range is going to cut it.The design of the speakers is rather classy fitting with a wide variety of furniture. Other than the mesh grill the rest of the chassis uses plastic which seems well put together. There's no weatherproofing or IP certification so it's not a great choice for pool/beach usage (though it does come with a pouch). However considering the price of $30 it's not a big financial loss if one were to break it. The capacitive buttons up top work well though I'm not personally a fan of the volume circle especially when volume increases/decreases in steps anyways. The lights are also a tad too bright. Also the voice prompts are kind of out of place. I don't really need a voice to remind me that bluetooth is connect/disconnected when there are light indicators telling me so. The voice also has an "Engrish" accent ;) because you know this was designed and made in ShenZhen China.At the end of the day if I want a bargain compact bluetooth speaker with good quality audio I'd choose the DOSS Soundbox. If I'm gonna spend more than $50 I'd step all the way up to the JBL Flip 3. And if money ain't no problem get that $199 Bose Soundlink Mini.
4,UPDATE:The more I use this device the more I like it.  It connects blue tooth EVERY SINGLE TIME.  A real plus.  I LOVE the TF card play capability. I bought 4 micro memory cards and my wife created 4 different playlists with different music genres.  So she can take it to work a bike ride gardening at our home or a long drive etc and never run out of tunes.  A 4 GB memory card costs @ $4 and will hold about 1000 songs.  Following is my earlier (3-star) review:A good value based on the $29 purchase cost.  The distance away from my bluetooth equipped laptop is quite limited -- maybe 10 feet or so before sound starts breaking up.  The sound is good but seems to deteriorate a bit at high volume levels.  My son has a different brand that costs a bit more but his has a range of 40-50 feet and plays for 18 hours rather than 12.  Also the volume control can be a bit picky..  The last thing to mention it  that they include a little hair-pin-like device to use when the speaker will not disconnect or connect.  You have to stick it into the audio jack port and then it resets itself.  Has happened to me once in the 3 days I've had it.  Can guarantee that I will lose that tiny device but I expect that a bent paper clip will suffice.  One feature I like is the ability to play songs from a TF card though I've yet to try that.
4,Got 2 because I needed comprehensive sound for a small group outdoor event. Speakers don't pair to each other the next models up supposedly do. Luckily my phone has "dual audio" capacity and got both working simultaneously although it split 1 speaker R sound and the other speaker L sound. Sound does get a bit tinny at max volume levels. Amazing product for the price.
3,I bought 2 and both are terrible Too late to send back?
5,I was genuinely surprised by how well put together this speaker was. The sound was amazing for such a small speaker. I would recommend it. I left the one I bought at our vacation home and I'm going to buy 2 more to gift out as they loved it.
4,It’s a great speaker! I have two issues though the busy tone when the battery is low. My second issue is it changes my song by itself! I’ll be jamming and then it cuts to the next song without me touching the phone or speaker. Siri isn’t enabled on my phone neither. Is anyone else having that second issue?
4,I like the sound but the Bluetooth speaker it’s so small I thought it would have been a little bigger
2,It doesnt allow you to listen to any audio books with out missing words its like the system is too slow to keep up with the books & system im using to read from .you  miss half of the sentence. But sound is pretty  good and battery  life is really good. Bluetooth has some kind of issues staying completely  connected.  And it just  makes you angry you have to keep rewinding  to understand  what your hearing or/ reading.  This was not  a great. Choice for audiobooks  not at all.  But does well for musice. Only had it a few weeks. Going  to try to exchange  or get a different  kind.  Hope this helps you to choose.
4,Good product
5,It was a toss-up between this and the apple home pod mini for $100.  I settled on this one bcI wanted something clear and loud enough for my tiny 2-room spa but not so overpowering that I'd bother neighbors or clients trying to relax.  This is perfect for small spaces and definitely economical.
4,Driving for a living I get to play my spotify playlist through this speaker. It has better sound than the speakers in my company car.
3,I use this speaker only on my 2013 MacBook Pro. Doubtful my Mac is the problem. I also have BlueTooth headphones connected.  I have tried and tried to connect this speaker without cables using the Mac BlueTooth connection; I can't make it work without the cables.  So my combination for making it work is (1) turn on my MAC (2) connect the speaker cables (both are needed) to the Mac (3) turn on the speaker box (4) disconnect the sound cable from the speaker box (it doesn't work if I disconnect from the Mac) then (5) the blue-circle power light will turn orange; and voila I've got sound. A HECK OF A WAY TO MAKE WHAT WAS BILLED AS EASY-PEASY A PAIN TO DO!  Nonetheless it's easier than returning hoping for something better.
4,Not bad for its price. I got the back one; nice sleek design.
5,Awesome sound I just love it
5,I purchased mine about five years ago and loved it so much that I bought one for my mom as well. Volume is loud enough to fill a gymnasium and I’ve never had any connectivity issues. It’s still going strong and the battery life is fine.
5,I like everything about the speaker.
5,No complaints
5,for such a small bluetooth speaker the sound is Amazing
4,UPDATE: The company actually contacted me through Instagram and asked me to email them. I emailed them and they actually sent me a new replacement within a few days. I've been testing out the new speaker for a few hours now and can tell you there is still a few small popping sounds but they are nothing compared to before. Barely even noticeable. You have to really be paying attention to even notice them. It's seems to be when I receive texts on my phone notifications from apps or open certain apps which is kind of normal. I'm much happier with the replacement than I was with the original one.The first time I used this product it was amazing and sounded fantastic. It’s easy to use and easy to connect to my phone so no problems there. But after using it for more than an hour it began to make weird popping noises. No matter what level the volume was the popping was the same. The popping noises are random. So I contacted the seller about it and they asked me to record a video of it happening. Which I’d have to sit and wait anywhere from 15 mins to an hour or more waiting for it to happen because it would happen randomly. So they weren’t any help. After researching more about this speaker I saw I wasn’t the only one having the issue. It also has nothing to do with being to far away from the speaker. My phone was literally only 2-5 feet away and it would still happen randomly.
5,I can't say enough good things about this speaker! I researched a lot of speakers before purchasing this one. Granted if I wasn't so cheap I might have looked at one of those really expensive speakers but - I am SO GLAD I am cheap; otherwise I might not have looked at this one! It is an incredibly great little piece of technology! It isn't just great for the price it's great period! The design is sleek it is solidly made a little heavy to hold which to me means it is very well-made. The display on the top of the unit is really beautiful. There is an SD card slot so I can play music without even using the bluetooth. Speaking of that it pairs up quickly and cleanly with my devices. I didn't like the voice that came on when it paired but I wrote to the company and within an hour or two they sent the firmware upgrade that removed it! Now to the best part - THE SOUND - one word: AMAZING!!! The sound experience is very rich. The mids are pronounced and clean and highs are crisp but not tinny or distressing. I can listen for hours without feeling like it was too much. It has some decent bass. It isn't super sub-woofer level kind of base but it balances well with the mids and highs to create an overall sound that is truly beautiful and gloriously full! I didn't formally test the battery life but I used it for four days one to two hours a day on three of those days and 5-6 hours on the other and I still had time. I can't say enough good things about this speaker! Great price booming sound fantastic build and amazing design! I highly recommend it!
4,For the price this little speaker is quite amazing. I have a really crappy little laptop with crappy speakers and I can't hear anything on my laptop's speakers so I gave the DOSS a try. The DOSS charged and paired easily and the sound is quite good plus I can just unplug it and take it with me anywhere. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because it still uses a Micro USB connector to charge instead of USB-C. These days Micro USB is kind of a rarity and an inconvenience but other than that I really love the DOSS SoundBox.
4,It was a great speaker and I enjoyed it lots. It was small portable and it was cool. It charged very quickly and played for long periods of time. However. After about two weeks with it something happened. It was playing music then all of a sudden it would stop. A few seconds later it would play and then stop. I was confused but I quickly suspected that it was because of the connection so I held my phone closer to it; didn't work. And so I restarted the bluetooth connection since this was the fix to some complications with other bluetooth devices that I owned; didn't work. And so I thought maybe my phone (Galaxy S8+) was the issue so I disconnected and paired it with my MacBook; didn't work. It still kept doing the whole static fade out thing. And finally to double check that I wasn't going crazy I looked at the music playing to see if it was the connection with the internet. The speaker would stop but the music kept on playing. That's when I decided to return it. I didn't purchase again.Too long; Don't readMoral of the story:This is a great speaker but I think mine was defected. If you want a portable speaker with a good price and good sound then purchase this. But just know that I've gone through some complications.EDIT 27.08.2017They've sent me a replacement which was cool. Good customer service. I have a working speaker now and all's good. So if you like the idea of this speaker tots get it.
4,Let's start with positive. No doubt it has awesome sound and volume. Sound is very clear and has nice base. The built of this product is solid. You do not feel buying a cheap plastic and feel it can last for a long time! So I have pretty good impression on this product.Notet:1) It took me 5 times to connect to my bluetooth transmitter. I just couldnt pair them together. Now I am not blaming this product. It could be the transmitter instead of this speaker's problem. I dont know which fault is that.2) About Static sound -- You just need to turn down the speaker volume. You can turning it too loud without even notice! Turn down the speaker > turn up volume on your connected device > you should not hear static and speaker will be clear and loud enough for normal people to hear.
5,As far as I'm concerned the picture says it all! I love this so much that not only did I buy two of them but I also bought a carrying case for them both. I also took the red one and placed it right next to my TV so I can listen to music anytime I want to and I haven't done this with any speaker including the expensive Bose soundtouch 10 that I bought last year. This is an amazing product with loud sound and a great price. I read the reviews before I decided to purchase it and I definitely don't regret it. In the future I wouldn't mind getting one that's even louder but I love the compact size I love the touch buttons that works seamlessly with your Bluetooth and I love the color. This is a product I give 10 out of 10 and would recommend it to anyone who wants to listen to music on a high-quality product.
5,This is by far the best bluetooth speaker I’ve ever owned. The sound quality is great and it’s nice and loud. The battery lasts a long time I still haven’t even had to charge it since I got it a couple weeks ago! Very nice! 💯👍
4,This is an updated review after receiving an extremely helpful response from Doss Audio's customer service. Not only did they provide the most up to date firmware they even sent a micro USB card to enable me to do the update. I'd rate customer service as 5-stars.As for the unit itself the sound is very good for its size and the Bluetooth functions seamlessly so far. Now happy with the purchase.Original review:I'd like to love this but I just don't. The auto-power off is clearly still an issue after many many complaints and critical reviews. For reference I keep it plugged into power ALL THE TIME so suggesting that it's just a way of saving battery life doesn't hold water. If I can't get it to stop powering off it will be returned. If the company fixes the issue for me I'll be happy to come back and update the review. The firmware update has been moved on the website to the specific product page for those looking to try to fix their issues. I have heard from the company itself so we'll see how the update goes.
5,I pair this with my Kindle to listen to books while I am sewing/crafting. It is so easy to pause/restart and control volume on this unit. I am very pleased.
5,Had mine for 3 years now. Highly recommend one for yourself or as a gift for someone else.Disclaimer: it is NOT a lightweight speaker.
3,So I rated this 3 stars to allow for user error (totally possible). The speaker works great and I have no issues with its quality. What bothers me is when I have it connected to my phone and play Pandora - if I have a call come in the call rings through the speaker. Which is fine. But as soon as the ringing stops the music returns on FULL blast. After having a brief heart attack I have to turn the volume down on the speaker (it's already on the lowest setting on my phone). I work in a small office and although it seems to humor those around me I cannot have this happen when a client is in here.
4,good for the hard of hearing
4,It works very well with one exception.I ordered this speaker for multiple purposes:It works well with my phone if I want to use it to improve hands free operation while doing conference calls.It also works well to play back music from the phone or another source and it is very portable to bring it out to the deck if we want music there.My main purpose was to have it by the lamp table while watching TV so as not to have the volume too loud (I sit at the furthest point in the room from the TV). It works great as long as the digital audio format from the TV is PCM; it does not work if the format is Dolby 5.1. The manufacturer has confirmed that. The unfortunate part for me is that this particular TV (a Panasonic) does not allow for user selection of the digital audio format and it automatically puts out Dolby when the signal comes through the antenna from a DTV station (which is all of them). All other sources (DVD player built-in apps Fire TV etc.) work perfectly. With other TVs that allow selecting the digital audio format this speaker works fine.While I was researching the issue I contacted the manufacturer's customer support via email and they were very prompt and courteous in replying.All in all I'm happy with the product and I recommend it with the limitation noted which would not be a problem in most cases; you just need to be aware of it before using it.
5,I purchased the DOSS SoundBox Touch Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speakers with 12W HD Sound and Bass in Dec 2018 as a gift.  The recipient is my husband who uses the speaker to connect with his phone for playing music and radio shows.  It is also used for listening to family calls on occasion.  The speaker makes a melodious sound when it connects and disconnects.  If you have family or friends over it's a Good idea to disconnect from speaker or turn it off when not in use; if this is not done the person who walks away and has left it on may still be connected to speaker and change what they are listening to and everyone else can hear it (some times it is Really Loud).  I've had to turn it off a few times when hubby is in another room of the house.  Overall we are pleased with this product it still works great and we recommend purchasing it.
5,Purchased for my wife and to protect my ears...My wife is hard of hearing and she keeps the volume waaaaay up on the TV.  This little speaker package saves MY ears and helps HER to hear.  She keeps this soundbox next to her at her desired volume.  I can still hear but my ears are finally comfortable!The Bluetooth connected easily with amazon fire stick.  We have an older TV that is not itself bluetooth enabled...I simply bought a very long 3.5mm cable to connect the Doss Soundbox to the TV headphone jack to use when watching antenna TV.  WORKS GREAT.  Sound is awesome coming from such a small package.  Battery life is pretty good too.  When the battery charge gets low there will be short "beeps" every 20 seconds or so.  We wondered why the TV was beeping before figuring out it was a low battery notification coming from the Doss Soundbox.  Completely happy with this little wonder package!
5,After buying different speakers I find this one superior to the othersEasy to set up sounds fabulous and looks great
5,For a group meditation
4,It’s great 4 tunes but it does lack that fullness from bass. I’d suggest going 2 the next gen. 4 fuller & balanced sound. I listen 2 music with bass bass saxophones bass guitars & this box can’t substain the bass well
5,I'm so glad I decided to purchase this speaker. I needed something wireless sleek and compact that I could connect through my phone. I put this purchase off for a long time as my brother in law first introduced me to this compact DOSS speaker. He brought it on our beach vacation. We carried it to the beach daily played music right off our cell phones. We had it playing all evening at the pool at our beach house and the range is phenomenal. You could hear it 3-4 houses away not that we were blasting it just the acoustics of the street combined with a quality speaker. After 10 years using primarily an iHome having 3 of them fail after only 2 years of use each sound quality and connectivity deteriorating the time to explore affordable alternatives had long passed. When I saw this speaker on sale I bought it on a whim and am so glad I did. I have a rather small (1100 sq.ft.) house. If I turn the speaker up to full volume as well as the device it's connected to I can hear it well throughout my whole house. It's so easy to take from room to room if desired ooutdoors garage poolside etc. I also really like the fact that I can continue working on my phone or laptop with minimal to no interruption no buffering issues (we do have quality wireless internet) so that's a huge plus. I have only been enjoying the speaker a few days and have nothing but positives to relay. If something comes up in the future or quality deteriorates inexplicably I'll be sure to update this review. As of right now I'm considering buying as Christmas gifts for family members/friends.
4,Works great the volume touch wheel is a bit clumsy but workable.
5,Very nice and solid built unit. Yes this speaker definitely lives up to all the claims about it. Ive ran it through its paces and is truly the best Bluetooth speaker Ive ever owned. Ive compared it to my Altec Lansing and Anker Soundbox (not knocking Anker they make some great stuff too) The unit does not distort at all. It has some kind of dynamic leveling in it to prevent it from clipping out even running it flat out volume. The tone of it is really good even if it is from the 2 5 watt speakers its got they really do put out a great soundstage. Battery life is accurate anywhere from 10-12 hrs of use on a full charge. No way to really tell if its charged or charging since theres no indicator light notating that. Plug it in overnight and should be set for all day. Ive had mine for over 2 months and I think I charged it 3 times but run it 4 days out of the week. Definitely the best 30 bucks Ive ever spent on a true quality unit. Comes with a 3.5mm/ 1/8" cord for direct connections has a nice bag it comes with for storing it or transporting. Uses a MicroSD or TransFlash (TF) card for music (Just throw the music files on the card in a mixture or folders whichever you choose it will recognize the music on the card. Build quality of it is pretty solid its nice and heavy. It has a metal grate that rattled a little on mine with punchy or bass heavy music but when its cranked up it does that but really shouldnt be a dealbreaker. Its definitely better than most soundboxes Ive seen.
5,I don't write a lot of reviews so when I actually take the time to write one it's because the quality is exceptional. This $20 speaker that I thought would last 3 weeks in the industrial setting I work in ended up lasting almost 3 years of drops scratches and the abrasives I work with. It ended up playing its final podcast today because eventually all the times I've dropped it caught up with it and it no longer charges and believe me I am heartbroken. The design is impeccable and I am positive that if I hadn't dropped it so many times it would be working for years to come. The bass is impressive for the size and price of the speaker and it's perfect for podcast listening. It's loud enough to hear in the loudest industrial environments and durable enough to take a beating. I will definitely be reordering. 5/5 stars.Edit: IT CAME BACK TO LIFE!!! Yes! I had all but given up on the speaker when I decided to push the cord into the charge port as hard as I could. CLICK. That little light came right on. The Little Speaker That Could lives on..
5,I purchased this speaker for my daughter and I find myself using it more. I highly recommend this speaker it reaches a durable level loud but not too loud. The size and color is perfect!
5,This is the 4th brand of blue tooth speaker I've owned. Best looking and best quality of the 4 brandsunder $100.00 I would highly recommend this speaker to all my friends. some of them actually listenedto it and purchased it as soon as they heard how loud and clear it is! Great Job!
5,[ASIN:B01CQOV3YO DOSS Touch Wireless Bluetooth V4.0 Portable Speaker with HD Sound and Bass (Black)]]  Revised review.  DOSS contacted me regarding my review and offered to replace item I received.  New item arrived very quickly and was found to be excellent both cosmetically and functionally and I am changing my review from 1 star to five.  I intended to use original speaker as a gift but purchased something else when first item found to be flawed.  So now I will used the replacement in my older vehicle instead of wonky FM transmitter in area with lots of FM stations.  Seems to have worked out very well in my case.Delivered June 11.  First thing noticed is that black finish on mesh in front of right speaker is flawed.  It looks like some chemical was dripped on mesh making it discolored.  It was like this when I removed it from box after it was delivered from Amazon.  I thought this item was new but maybe it is refurbished (??).  After reading the many reviews both good and bad I charged the speaker to see how this performed.  It has no problem connecting to my iPhone.  However when I played music from Pandora or mp3's from a SD card I notice a background "hiss" similar to what a phonograph record used to sound like before the digital age when the volume was increased beyond approximately 50%.  Did not see this complaint in the reviews I read so maybe this problem is unique to the speaker I received.  I intended to give this speaker as a gift but it is unsuitable for that so I will search for something else.  Overall I am disappointed.
4,Purchased as a gift.  Have not heard anything negative about it at this point.  Will update after it has been used.
4,A few reviews seemed to imply that this speaker was loud enough to fill a large room with intelligible audio. However In a warehouse or outdoor environment the audio disperses dramatically especially if listening to spoken word audio like an audio book or podcast. I could not hear or understand the words spoken when more than five feet from the speaker with both the speaker and my connected device at full volume. Listening to music through the speaker is more enjoyable however again in an open environment it becomes difficult to hear more than just instruments or electronica at a distance of more than ten feet.Good notes are that the touch controls are intuitive and easy to use without glitching out even when my fingers are dirty from work. The speaker is incredibly durable and has survived numerous drops and bumps which is more than I have experienced from other Bluetooth speakers. You can feel by its weight that it is well put together. I've never had a problem with it pairing to any of my devices.I originally rated as three stars because I wasn't getting out of the speaker the loud volume I had expected based off of reviews posted here and experience with smaller Bluetooth speakers. However the customer service team at Doss reached out to me in an attempt to understand the issue and I have rarely encountered such great customer service.Ultimately this is a great speaker for smaller rooms without competing noise. If you want a durable lasting speaker for your home than this is a Good choice.
3,Sound/bass quality not as good for the price plus you can't turn volume down on speaker just up. You can use your phone to control volume but I just don't like this feature 😕 Other Bluetooth speakers I've used usually can do this. Also for the price I feel the sound should be better. Not a bad speaker I like the colors available and bought for my teen daughter to use so not a big deal but if I was using myself I'd be disappointed.  Battery life isn't bad. My daughter never remembers to charge anything and it's still had juice since Christmas (couple weeks ago) but she doesn't use all the time either. Bluetooth connected with ease to her phone.
4,I am overall happy with this Bluetooth speaker. The sound quality is very nice and has a nice bass response giving it a full structured sound that is not tinny. The unit itself is very nicely built and has a very sleek modern design. I like that the buttons aren't "buttons" but rather touch-response sensors. It makes for a nice look.The reason I took a star away is that it seems to have a weird quirk in that if there is any bit of silence it goes into a sort of "sleep" mode and then when sound comes back a tiny fraction of the start of the sound is cut off. I mostly listen to talk show podcasts and this flaw is painfully evident. If the poem "Row Row Row Your Boat" was spoken and there was a second of silence between each line it sounds like this:"-ow row row your boat...-ntly down the stream...-rrily merrily merrily merrily...-ife is but a dream."It is somewhat annoying so I'm not sure if this is a flaw in the unit or if it is a battery-saving feature but perhaps that is something the manufacturer should look into fixing when making more units. Honestly if I had tried this speaker before buying it and heard that flaw I would have passed on purchasing.Either way I have it now and the sound quality is good enough where I can put up with the annoyance.
5,I buy a lot but don’t write a lot of reviews. But I am so happy with this speaker! I tend to research so much that I get lost in the conflicting opinions and reviews and end up just buying the most expensive in hopes that it’s true that you get what you pay for...which is not the truth too many times. I have been through 3 different Bose portable Bluetooth speakers over the past year and between the charging port messing up and having trouble with Bluetooth connectivity and range I finally decided to just try a less expensive one and see what it would do since it seemed I would be buying one periodically anyway.All of that is to say that I read a couple of reviews saying this DOSS speaker was better than an expensive Bose and took a chance. I spent $28 (much less than any of the Bose I bought) and I am so happy with it! Easily connects stays connected sounds great (I’m only using it for listening to music in the house and outside when I’m working) the range is awesome and it doesn’t sound distorted when I turn it up. Very pleased. Wish I had tried this a long time ago.
4,The sound quality isn’t the best but it works fine for listening to music in the space I placed it in.
5,So I’ve had this speaker for a month or two now and The battery lasts so long i opened the box and played music right away for several hours next to the pool then put it up and used it again the next day for several hours finally on day 3 I had to charge it after it was charged we were good to go also It’s not advertised as water proof at all but one of my kids knocked it in the pool and it sunk to the bottom I hurried and picked it out of the water and it was still playing didn’t damage it at all the sound is also good and it gets pretty loud. for the price point it’s worth it 100%.
5,My grandson has one of these. He is 4 and can play all his favorite music. I just bought this one for my granddaughter who is nearly 3. It is easy to use easy to add songs (you need a mini SD card for adding music - my son-in-law found one in an old phone that works just fine!) and it is just one long continuous kiddie songfest. It is very sturdy easy for little hands to learn and use has an auto turn-off function and my son-in-law emailed the company for a firmware update that removes the little "turning on!" and "turning off" noises. Responsive company. My kids had sturdy  indestructible Fisher Price cassette players from the age of 2 on up. Mp3 players for kids are just CRAP - read the reviews. This box is awesome. Will only play Mp3s - you'd have to convert Mp4s to Mp3 to use.  We buy super cheapo kids CDs used here or on other "used" websites and upload them to the computer. If you want your kids to be exposed early and often to great music (thow on some classical too!) this is a good sound box.  BONUS - also a very  nice bluetooth speaker for  grown-ups.
5,Had others before... hope in not jinxing this but long battery life; great good complex  sound.  Solid build.  Very pleased. Thanks.
5,As a non-audiophile and first time Bluetooth speaker owner I can personally attest this thing sounds amazeballs. It fills my 1100 sq ft apartment with crisp clear sound throughout. I could not detect any distortion EXCEPT when the speaker was placed at maximum volume and only at maximum volume; if I set it to max and then back off a smidgen the distortion goes away.The unit itself is very compact and has that feeling of heft that implies quality production. Certainly in running my hands over the external surfaces of the unit everything felt like it fit together snugly. I could not easily dislodge anything or cause it to rattle. The housing causes no distortion likely due to thickness of material hence the heft.The controls are very sleek and responsive. The icons are intuitive and using the center blue circle as a haptic touch interface implies modernity as does everything else about the device.I have not used it for voice calls so I cannot speak to the quality of that feature. It is likely safe to assume similar sound performance when using AUX or the TF card. As I do not have a TF card I did not test that feature so cannot speak to it's performance either.I noticed in the instructions it states it works with Alexa apparently as a wireless microphone/speaker. I do not have Alexa so did not test.All in all I am very happy with my purchase. It is exactly what I wanted - A quality but cheap and very functional wireless Bluetooth speaker.  I am not an audiophile and am usually happy with most speaker setups.
4,If you're looking for a nice bass boom this is NOT it.
5,I would definitely buy more of this item if I needed as the  quality of product as well as sound and battery life is more than satisfying- especially given the price-point of this speaker. I had previously purchased another speaker on Amazon that is compared side by side to the DOSS and it was nothing compared to this DOSS speaker. Another upside is that this speaker also comes with a SIM card Slot that  you can put your own play list on and take with you to listen to.I am a preschool teacher and use it primarily at work but also at home as it is very portable. Sturdy yet not heavy. At work we have a Bose brand that  is 3 times the price of this Doss and honestly- I wouldn't buy one either for listening needs for most situations you will be pleased with this one. If you need a boom box sound for huge events the $$$ ones are out there otherwise this one if awesome.~Mariss Haupt- Wife of Amazon account holder
5,I bought them (2) for my vision impaired 77 yr old sister. She had no problem setting up. She loves them.
4,Unknown it was a Christmas gift.
3,It’s louder than the  bigger cylinder sized jbl but it doesn’t have as much bass. The bass is kind of weak. It’s only loud in the direction it’s turned to you won’t be able to hear it as good if your not directly in front of it.As far as the battery 🔋 it kind of sucks because it only last about barley  2 hours max then it will lower the music. It’s kind of annoying to keep constantly charging. You would actually have to keep it on the charger. Not to mention the charging cord is not that long at all so choose carefully where you charge it.
4,It works great in wired mode.  It is a great (and very small) full time speaker attached to a permanent PC or docking station - the exact reason I purchased it.  I'm not sure why I started using it in Bluetooth mode instead but when I did I noticed it would very predictably turn itself off after 15 minutes.  5 minutes of research revealed that this by design that it is to "save energy" and the behavior can be changed by purchasing a miniSD card loaded with an alternate firmware image and  flashing the device so it doesn't do that.That seems like a bit much to me.  If the unit stays on 24/7 when plugged into A/C and using an analog cable for it's source then it should do exactly the same when plugged into A/C using Bluetooth as it's audio source.  It doesn't.  by default you get auto-off with bluetooth (even when it is plugged into wall power) and no auto-off when wired for sound.
2,This has a lot of static feedback while charging.  I was looking for something I could leave plugged-in at work and either Bluetooth connect my phone to it or connect it to my work computer via aux cord.  Even when I tried to ignore the static feedback it uses battery faster than it charges so after a few hours the battery died.  Didn't last a whole 9-hour shift.The sounds this thing makes when you click the mode button is very annoying.  The volume of the "mode" sounds does not go up and down with volume control.  It is always very loud.  So whenever I would turn this on and click through the modes my employees were distracted by the sound and I was embarrassed to be drawing the attention.  To be fair I understand there is a download on the DOSS website that eliminates that sound.  I haven't tried it myself.  If I were keeping it I would give that a try.The sound quality was decent for being so inexpensive.  That's about all it's got going for it.  I'm not an audiophile.  I can't give you an expert review on bass and treble etc etc.For me the cons outweigh the pros.  I think I'm going to try to resell it on Craigslist or something and get some of my money recouped.UPDATE 1/12/18:  Customer Service saw my review and sent me a new unit to test out.  While I will say that makes for good customer service unfortunately there is still feedback on the new speaker.  My speaker is 2' away from me next to my computer monitor.  I did a very crude experiment to see if it would be better another 1-2' away but I can still hear the haptic feedback while the speaker is plugged into the charger cord.  To reiterate I wanted to use this at my desk at a very low volume so as not to disturb my co-workers.  Because the volume is low it doesn't cover the sound of the feedback.Also the new speaker still uses battery faster than it charges.  I plugged it in to charge fresh out of the package while I was writing this update.  Before I finished the speaker is already beeping that the battery is dying.I forgot to mention the beep that indicates lows battery.  You know the "busy signal" on phones?  The beeping that hell itself must have invented?  The low battery signal is a single beep just like the "busy signal" on phones.  It will beep every couple minutes or so until it dies.It took me a VERY long time to figure out what this beeping when I was using the first unit because the instructions that come with this speaker are TINY.  There's nothing that says anything about beeping.  Or the center indicator light regarding the battery.  You would think it obvious I suppose.  But not so obvious when you don't expect the battery to die when it's plugged in and charging.Updating this review has made me consider giving this speaker 1 star instead of two.  But I guess since customer service bothered reaching out at all... and the fact that you might not hear the feedback with a higher music volume... I suppose I'll leave it at 2 stars.Did I mention the charging light indicator is on the back and is teeny-teeny tiny?  And it's UNDER where the charger cord goes in?  And therefore hard to see?I digress.Pics attached.  The unit was off and charging when I took the pics.
4,was not loud enough
5,I use this speaker to amplify what is coming out of my Kindle Fire. It does a great job and the Bluetooth feature works very well. It allows you to play music or hear anything else far better than using the speaker in the pad. Remember that you need to turn up the volume on the pad itself before adjusting volume on the speaker which may not be necessary at all. Set a moderate volume with the pad and then with the speaker Then you can just control volume from the pad if you like.
3,The speaker is overall acceptable for the price.  Sound quality is fine (at higher volumes there is a significant amount of distortion) and battery life is good.  The real problem is the presence of an integrated power-save mode that shuts the speaker down after 15 minutes of "idle" time.This is a problem for several reasons:1.  This "feature" is not documented in the manual; so if you wonder if your speaker is defective because it keeps shutting off it isn't.  They just built functionality and never told you about it.2.  There's no integrated way to disable this feature.  You can download a firmware upgrade and flash the speaker but that requires an SD card.  Not just any SD card a micro SD that is <32 GB.  Do a quick search for a micro SD and you'll find sizes 64 GB and up.  That's because flash storage is cheap; so you buy a lot.  I don't have a small micro SD kicking around; so now it's $5-10 just to get a card to flash this stupid speaker.3.  This disconnect happens on phone calls.  Why a phone call is considered idle by the phone is a mystery to me but it's really annoying to be having a conversation and the speaker just shut off.  I can understand why you want the speaker to shut off after 15 minutes of no playback but to have it behave that way during use is poor implementation.Overall there are many speaker options available.  You can probably do better than this one for the price.
5,Not much to say; inexpensive good audio quality. It make a little sound when it auto-shuts off but it never bothered me. Not like another speaker I had where a robotic voice made a loud announcement every time.So all in all no complaints.
5,This really is a fantastic Speaker. Love the sounds so I bought another one for my husband. He Loves His too. Use on out Bikes and he uses his in his 97Corvetter that has a broken radio. It's plenty loud....and the sound quality is excellent.nI read all reviews before I purchased. Glad I bought it and am very happy and satisfied with the results. It really is true that size doesn't matter...😁
5,I bought this speaker for my fiancé because he has to have nature sounds on a speaker at night to sleep. Well he ended up breaking his last speaker so of course I come to Amazon to get him a new one. I fell in love with his speaker so much to the point that I was kinda wanting one for myself. I ended up dropping mine the other day (I’m not sad about it) & just used that as an execuse to come back for this one. It gets pretty loud the sounds of the music is clear enough to hear it has two speakers in it…. and I like that it’s touch screen. That was a plus for us so just get the speaker. Can’t beat it for the price.
5,I love this little thing! My only complaint is that when it reaches low battery it makes the most AWFUL sound every few minutes until you plug it in.
5,NIce sound for a small speaker. I got this to enjoy music in our bathroom. I like that it's battery powered so I can take it into another room easily. It took a little bit to figure out how to turn up the volume because there is no button for it. The large round blue light in the top center is the volume. You put your finger on the blue ring and make a clockwise circle for volume up and counter clockwise for volume down. It a nice touch so that there are no buttons standing up. The on/off button is on the back and to my surprise it turns itself off after its not in use. I don't know how long that takes but when I walk through that room later in the day the unit is off. It pairs very easily with my iPhone 6. Charges with a USB and there is also a plug to directly connect a device without bluetooth. It came with a string closing water proof bag. I guess you can put the speaker in that and take out by the pool but it's so thick I don't see how you can hear the music but I haven't tried that yet. You can answer your phone with the touch of a button and use it as a speaker. I've only done this once so I can't say if this is sounds ok or not. If you are wanting Bose quality sound then spend a a lot more for one of those because this isn't it. I like it because it's a great sound for the price and I'm happy I got it.
5,I absolutely love this DOSS Soundbox.  It packs a big punch with its 12w speakers and the volume is much better than I expected.  I use it primarily to watch Netflix Hulu and Youtube.  I'll leave it playing at times to walk down the hall to do something and I still hear it quite well!  It charges relatively fast and the charge lasts me 2-3 nights of watching shows (over 3 hours each time).  It's an extremely well built speaker and feels strong and solid in the hands and to top it all off it's aesthetically pleasing to look at.I originally bought mine from Amazon in October 16.  Then as fate would have it it stopped charging in September 17.  It took me some time to find where I had put the warrantee card and when I did I only had about a week left before expiration.  I wrote an email to the company one night to tell them of the charging problem and about an hour and a half later I received a reply from Milla who graciously apologized and asked a bit about the problem.  Milla then asked me the Amazon order number and my address and a few minutes later said a replacement had been arranged.  The replacement Soundbox was on my doorstep 2 days later!  That to me is exceptional customer service it's so rare anymore to find companies like this who truly stand behind their product I highly recommend this quality little speaker to everyone!My sincere thank you to Wonders Tech and Milla in particular :)
5,I bought one of these speakers in November 2016 and I was very happy with its quality. So much so that I bought another one for a friend as a gift. After only a couple of months however the speaker would not play my TF card. In fact switching to TF mode caused my speaker to shut down. WTF!?  It was at this point that I remembered having read a number of Amazon reviews that mentioned the helpfulness of the customer service for Doss so I thought "Why not give it a shot?" Sure glad I did. In response to my initial email I received a very prompt and quite courteous response along with the suggestion that perhaps the problem was my TF card. When I told them that I had already checked out the TF card on another device they quite promptly offered to replace my speaker. Free of charge. Quite to my astonishment I received it two days later. Now that's what I'd call customer service literally. It's also a show of faith in the product. The company believed that this defect was an exception rather than a usual occurrence and they backed up this belief by doing the Right Thing. When it's working as the replacement currently is this speaker is a terrific device. I bought it mainly for travel but I like it so much that I find myself listening to it in my home quite often. As long as my new replacement speaker works for more than a couple of months I'd have to say that I am very happy with the purchase. And more than happy with the Customer Service!
5,This thing is so loud that you can hear it clearly from 3 houses down without the  volume up all the way ! The bass is incredible and the sound is very clear 👌 I would highly recommend this to someone looking for a great unit on a budget !!
5,hello there. I bought this and after a couple weeks was having issues with a malfunctioning part. the company sent me a replacement right away. I work construction and usednthis speaker all the time. it has great sound for such a little thing.  one day I left this speaker out overnight and it poured rain on it all night long. the next day or 2ni let it dry out and it still worked flawlessly. months and months later I started noticing it wasn't charging the battery and had to leave it plugged in to play. some time later it wouldn't even play for a few minutes before dying. I decided to put it up and forgot about it until I decided to let my wife use it at home. so I took it home and started tinkering with it and noticed it wasn't working properly because all the times I was plugging it in I must have broken the micro USB charge port. I contacted the company to see what options I had knowing I was way out of any warranty. they decided to send me the little board I needed to fix it as they couldn't send me a whole new unit. their customer service has been outstanding Everytime I needed them.  GREAT JOB!
5,Excellent for the price
5,After seeing this rated favorably on a review of bluetooth-connected speakers I took advantage of a spot sale. Pairing with phone was smooth and range of signal phone->speaker is good. The sound quality is not 'audiophile' but that's not a reasonable expectation for the unit. Volume is more than sufficient for my needs. It seemed to take quite a while to initially charge the battery - haven't yet needed to recharge it so can't say how long a full charge lasts.
5,It's really a great little speaker. For what I bought it for it is more than I expected. Very nice quality!
5,I purchased this speaker to utilize in my office to play music throughout the day.  I will say that this speaker fits the bill perfectly.  It is not going to overpower a large room with sound.  It will fill an office or small bedroom with great sounding music.  The high end acoustics are good.  The bass is not incredibly punchy but I didn't expect that from a small bluetooth speaker.  I really like the touch controls being on top.  Easy to access and intuitive.  The bluetooth is sometimes a little slow to re-connect when you power the speaker up.I would very much recommend this speaker for folks who want to listen to music at volumes that are conducive to working in an office or studying in a dorm room.  If you want to use it in your garage you might be a little disappointed.  It doesn't have the oomph to fill that kind of space.  If you wanted to keep it next to you on a table while you eat it's perfect.  If you want to have it outside to project music across the patio you will be disappointed.I own several bluetooth speakers.  I recently purchased the OontZ Angle 3 Plus speaker from Amazon.  This little speaker ranks very close to that one in terms of sound quality.  The OontZ beats it on volume (the OontZ gets VERY loud).  However I don't purchase small bluetooth speakers to replace a 2.1 sound system.  They are for listening in smaller rooms/offices.Highly recommended.
4,Right now we are using it inside house. Can't wait to try it camping this summer.
5,I have had this speaker for over 2 years.  It works fine when I need to use a Bluetooth speaker and I never gave it much thought.  With the pandemic and doing zoom classes I have used this speaker much more and only now realized there is a 15 minute time-out feature.  There are explanations of it in questions on Amazon and it told me i needed a firmware change.When I couldn't easily find the firmware (i didn't try that hard) I wrote to their tech-support over Labor Day weekend.  They got back to me the next morning emailing the firmware and very clear directions how to upgrade it.  This is an inexpensive item and to have such great tech support deserves to be mentioned.  I deal with many companies and this is head and shoulders above what I have come to expect.  So 5 stars for the product and a cherry on top for their service.
5,This speaker in my opinion is the best Bluetooth speaker for the price. Compared to other bluetooth speakers in this price range this one has the best features - 12hr battery life (have not actually tested this yet) 12 watts of audio nice controls and a MircoSD card slot. Sound quality and bass seems decent. You will not be totally blown away by the sound but you will not be disappointed either. This is no Bose or JBL but keep in mind this is about 1/4 of the cost of those. I found it to be plenty loud and I did not even turn the volume up all the way. It is really important that the device you are pairing to this speaker has the volume turned all the way up or else it may seem like the speaker doesn't go loud enough.I noticed other reviews which stated the volume could not be adjusted on the speaker - this is NOT true. Unlike other speakers this speaker has a touch sensitive volume control instead of physical buttons. To turn the volume up you rotate your finger clockwise around the blue ring to turn the volume down you rotate your finger counter-clockwise around the blue ring. I really like this feature - it sort of reminds me of the old iPodsMy only complaint about this speaker is that the lights seem too bright and kind of "drowns out" the logos for the controls. This may only be an issue when using the speaker in a dark room. The voice prompt for pairing may also sound annoying to some people.
4,a good cheap bluetooth speaker.  The only drawback you cannot easily tell how much battery is left.  The speaker beeps when it is low on power.  This can be a bit annoying when you are using it for music to fall asleep by.
5,This thing is handy. I can listen to music or a podcast while I'm washing dishes or doing chores at work. Ya I know I can do that with just my phone speakers but with this I can charge my phone somewhere in the house while still being able to listen to music/podcast in another room. Sound quality is good enough. I didn't buy it as a home sound system lol. It connects to my phone automatically when I turn it on. I have nothing bad to say about this product. As a bonus I like that there are color options.
5,It’s super awesome my daughter absolutely loves it! It is and does everything it says.. and it’s very loud! I can hear it when she plays it in the shower with the door shut and my door shut to my bedroom all the way down on the other side of the house… I can hear it very loud every word very clearly!! I highly recommend it and she does too!!
5,The speaker works wel but it does not have enough volume.
5,I bought one of these to use on our boat and loved it so much I bought another one to give as a gift. When we aren’t boating I take mine to work and use it. Everyone at work can use it too when I’m not there. They just connect to it and start listening. I’m pretty sure they love it as well.
4,Easy to use and good connectivity. I use it in my art studio so just fine for a small space.
4,My boyfriend has a Bose portable speaker and I wanted one because I like the versatility of being able to move it around.  However the price tag was out of my reach.  I did my research and decided to try this speaker and I have been very happy with it.  It arrived very well packaged and was easy to set up and begin using.  It holds a charge for many hours of play and I feel that the sound quality is great for the price.  I really don't notice a ton of difference between the Bose and this one except for at higher volumes which I really don't use it for anyway.  I have had it for a few months and used it almost every day and it is working well.The only aspects of it that I wish were different are that it doesn't charge using the same charger as my iPhone so I have to keep a separate charger and cord for it and the charging cord is super short which makes it less convenient to charge or to use while plugged in.  Also you have to hold the on/off button for what seems to me like too long of a time to get it to turn on and off.  This is really just a minor annoyance and again with the price of this little speaker it isn't a deal breaker at all.
5,This purchase was part of a project to reduce the number of wires and clutter I have around my desk.  I gave away a pair of Bose speakers (wired) and purchased the DOSS speaker. The sound is better than expected and I like the ease in using the controls.  Once the speaker was fully charged I was able to pair it within seconds with my computer and I was playing music from my playlists in another couple of minutes.  The only thing I didn't like was the order of play when I installed a Micro SD chip with a list of favorite songs. The speaker played the music in alphabetical order so when I went to use the speaker again it repeated the same songs.  I read where there was firmware available to change the play order to shuffle.  It was Sunday afternoon when I sent an email to DOSS requesting a copy of the firmware.  I was surprised when I got a reply 6 hours later from DOSS with the firmware with installation and instruction. I followed the directions but the firmware update failed.  I think the reason the update failed was because the speaker was paired to my PC at the time.  I tried it with the pairing turned off but it didn't work either - I assume because I screwed up the first try. I later unpaired the speaker and tried again.  This time the firmware change worked and the speaker now plays music from the SD chip in shuffle mode.
5,Me encanta comprar productos de calidad
4,Great little bluetooth speaker. I'm coming from a Jawbone that decided to quit on me so I can compare the two. This seemed to connect via bluetooth much easier and there was no annoying automated computer voice interrupting me when trying to do something as simple as crank up the volume. I'll say there was slightly more weight to the jawbone but the main difference was bass replication. The Doss seemed to be pretty light on the bass end which I guess is expected given the size and price point but I was expecting a little more. That said I think the overall sound quality is very good given the size and price. It is a well-built unit and very straight forward to operate. The buttons and volume (which is the circle in the middle simple slide clockwise to increase volume and counter clockwise to reduce it). I'll say compared to the jawbone this is able to produce much louder volume which was great. I was hoping to use this outside when swimming and it worked! It's not loud enough for a party or from a far distance but I could hear the music very easily from about 20-40 ft away. Overall I'm very impressed and happy with my purchase. If the bass was a little more bottom heavy and pronounced I'd give this a solid 5 and rave all over the place but for the price and features and quality a solid 4.
3,I have bought this speaker multiple times for people in my family. I noticed that they change the most recent one I bought charger. So now it is going to be harder to find a charger that fits.
5,Got this as a gift for my boyfriend the battery life is great we haven't had to charge it yet  it has a sleek look and it actually gets pretty loud! Good price for a good speaker.
5,Great value.
5,Absolutely love this speaker. I’ve had mine for about a year now and ended up getting one for my sister for Christmas and she loves it just as much.The sound quality is steller. I usually only need my volume at 50-75% to get the volume I need when I’m indoors taking a shower doing chores or reading but putting it on full blast is perfect for when I’m outside skating or kicking a ball around.It’s nice and portable but isn’t super light nor does it feel cheap by any means. It’s a solid few pounds but it feels more sturdy rather than heavy.The battery life feels longer than 12 hours at some times! I swear I used this for almost half a year before I had to charge it. Not to say I was using it throughout every day but I used it pretty consistently. And if battery life is something you’re worried about just throw it on a micro usb charger overnight and you’re set.This is such a solid speaker for around $30 when other companies would probably charge more. Can’t recommend it enough!If I could change two things it’d be to have the blue light turn red to indicate low battery and a lock switch to disable the touch controls on top. Other than that it’s perfect!
5,Perfect for when I work in the garage. Long battery life
5,I was really blown away by the sound.  I love it.  I listening in an office with the speaker on a desk - I don't know if that is impacting the sound but here is how I would describe the sound - highs mids and lows are great strong mixed powerful.  I have another larger Sony speaker and I have the same joy listening to this as to the bigger Sony - when you turn the volume up moderately loud you feel like you are in the same room with the artist like you are at a concert.  I play music and listen to the instruments and tone of the instruments alot and I am just loving this speaker.  And of course it was extremely affordable.  I will update - this is just day 1 - but lots of listening today.-----------Update Oct 2021 - this product is still going strong.  I might get a 2nd.  Great sound reliable connects easily.
5,I bought this speaker in December of 2016 and it's worked great for its life. Within the last year the battery starts dying fast and isn't sounding as good as it did originally. Overall for the price I'd say it's still good but for being 5 years old now I believe it's finally time for me to buy a newer speaker. Otherwise definitely recommend but not longterm*
3,This product appeared on a couple of different lists as being a "best BASS portable speaker". For only $30 it was worth a shot. However now I feel very mislead (paid product placement?).  The bass on this little speaker is essentially non-existent.  You truly get what you pay for when it comes to speakers. My son's JBL Flip 5 absolutely annihilates this speaker and its the same size. Granted it's also $120. It's probably ok for only a $30 speaker but overall in the wide world of portable speakers the sound is very mediocre.
5,This is a great little speaker! Long battery life and comes with a male-male connection so I could use my oldest devices (exactly my reason for purchasing it). Simple enough to use though sometimes the buttons need a stronger touch.The sound is pretty stinking good - loud enough to be heard in a few rooms! The bass is decent and no odd feedback or reverb (so far). It's a Doss not a Bose. Can't expect a $30 speaker to do the work of a $300 one. Way better features and quality than I was expecting. I would recommend this speaker to anyone.If I had one complaint I wish the volume wheel was more responsive. When you slide it halfway  around it produces a loud beep but not a lot of difference in volume. Not a big deal I just turn up the volume on my device. Would still buy again very satisfied!
5,I love the jam packed bass it has when I turn it up I can play whatever no issue the connection is instant!
5,Battery long lasting and great sound quality
1,Loved. Loved loved the speaker when I got it. I got it to take to the cemetery to celebrate my dads 1st heavenly birthday. We sat there for hours and listened to his favorite songs and even though a few made us all cry it brought us together and what I thought was doing to be one of the worst days of my life turned out ok because of this speaker. It brought our family together which was something we all needed. I used it one more time for about 20 min plugged it in to charge it and it never turned back on. It never got wet or mis-handled. I kept it in the box when I was not using it. So I have no clue why this happened. I’m really sad as it was a great little speaker. But by the time I realized it quit working the 30 day Amazon warranty was up 😭😭I would definitely try another one but I’m not going to buy another one in case this happens again. I had planned on making a habit of us all gathering there and playing music for him. His 1 year is coming up on 9/14/2022 and I wish I had it to take back out there with us as it really did help us get through the day.
4,I was familiar with this speaker because a friend of mine has had one for a year or two. When I caught this on a Lightning Deal I knew it was the perfect item for gift giving. Sure enough the recipient loves the speaker and is very happy with it! She has thanked me several times since receiving it and pointed out the great sound quality.I personally gave this a quick test as well when it first arrived. It is loud and clear and I was very pleased with the overall appearance quality and perceived value for the price paid. I did a quick comparison between this item and my personal speaker which is a UE Boom 2 - which was $199 when new and still about $100 right now. The only immediate difference I noticed between the two was that the UE Boom 2 had slightly more bass. However the are both loud clear and pleasant to listen to — the slight difference in bass is more than made up for by the price difference.Quick note — sound is directional on this speaker. Even though the perforated mesh covers the entire speaker the sound only comes from the front not all the way around.
4,Ok for Beach use
5,I love this little Box. Its compact and I use it for work while styling my client's hair instead of television. You would think this was a $1000 sound system but it a small box.  It was well worth the price...not problems  I only wish it had a remote control!
4,The sound is clear and volume range is high. Used it outdoors for playing with friends and it was fun
5,I love my new speaker! sounds great!
4,Small but powerful
4,Uso en oficina. Conectado a Spotify en el celular.
5,We use this with an I-pad to watch movies in an RV...Works great!
5,My IHome wireless speaker quit working after two years so time to buy another.  I was happy enough with it for my purpose but found this speaker and after reading the reviews and noting the minimal higher price of the other speaker I was going to reorder I decided to go with this one.  Glad I did!  It arrived very quickly and was easy to connect to my phone like most other Bluetooth devices.  It provides a much better quality sound than my previous speaker and has a louder output.  (Forgive my lack of technical jargon.  I'm not into electronics or gadgets.)  I use my wireless speaker to listen to music and audible books as I'm cleaning cooking etc. around the house and for this purpose I love it!  I can go to the next room and still hear it clearly without  any distortion.  Highly recommend!
5,This product is incredible I would recommend this product as your own personal stereo the sound is wonderful battery life is excellent you can play for hours without having to put it on the charger it insight weight easy to transport and I am 100% satisfied.  Try it I promise you you will definitely like it.I went through at least 3/4 until I got this one wish I had bought this one 1st.Thank you for allowing me to express my opinion.
4,The charger cord stopped working shortly after I received it.
5,Best damn $20 I’ve ever spent! Sound quality is awesome picks up over a rather long range and can go quite a while before needing a charge. I couldn’t be happier. Feels like I got it for a serious steal since it was purchased on Prime DayCame back to edit. It has been less than a year and my speaker won’t hold a charge. It hasn’t been dropped or damaged. It just stopped charging one day. I’ve tried multiple cords to no avail. The red light doesn’t even come on to indicate it’s been plugged up. Save the $20 and she’ll out a bit more for a speaker that won’t become a paperweight in less than a year. I’ve seen dollar store headphones operate for longer periods.
5,I use this speaker with my iPhone XR to play audio books (through the Overdrive app) and sometimes listen to music.  It's great for both.  When I get a phone call however people say they can hardly hear me so I wouldn't depend on it as a speaker phone but it's perfect for audio books and music.  Wish I got this a long time ago.
5,Small footprint product lots of features easy to use and the sound quality is really good for its size. Not really used the Bluetooth feature but the TF Card slot is excellent. TF Card slot is flush when a card is inserted so it can't be accidentally pushed. Buttons use resist contacts and are sensitive to touch so finger touch is all it takes. No clunky push buttons. Volume uses the center ring and all you do is touch it and move your finger clockwise or counter-clockwise to raise or lower the volume. A very classy touch to the unit. The complete product is designed with an upper scale look and feel to it. Compact size with a sound quality that proves its designers had "portable" in mind. Easy to use TF Card and Bluetooth features you come to expect. Many people having these units at work to play their own personal music which is what attracted me to the unit in the first place. I bought two of them on my initial purchase. I would definitely buy this again.
5,I just received this package yesterday and I love it already. The sound quality is amazing and I have not had any trouble connecting to any of my devices thus far. Again I have not had this product long but I hope the battery life is still good after a couple of uses. I will try and come back and give a better update
3,Delivery was fast the color is just as shown but there were no instructions in e box. I called Doss Audio and they emailed me the instruction manual. When I opened the attachment the instructions were so tiny I could not read them and when I enlarged it the words were completely out of focus and illegibile.  I called again and they said to reply to the email tell them about the manual and they will mail me a booklet with instructions.  I managed to figure out how to hook it up to my Galaxy s21 Ultra through Bluetooth so I use it.Doss said it might be up to 10 days to get the manual in the mail and that is much too long to wait. So took a picture with the zoom on my camera of each individual section of the instructions sent that to the computer and used the Paint program to enlarge everything. It's not perfectly clear but at least I can read it now.Doss needs to fix the problem with emailing the manual so that it comes out big enough to read in case this happens again.
5,I was blown away by the sound quality at this price point. I have been conducting a Zoom group study weekly during the pandemic. Several weeks ago we decided to provide this study group a hybrid option. That meant I as the teacher/facilitator had to assemble a portable version of my Zoom studio. One if my goals was for the in person and virtual participant to have very similar experiences. When iy came to audio I could no longer use my headset since there were other people in the room that needed to heat the virtual participants. So I bought the DISS soundbox. Everyone love the realistic sound; unlike the speakers in the tv on the wall which was the other option for audio the DOSS had rich bass but not overpowering. I’ve used both the Bluetooth and wired options and get great performance with both (actually I can’t tell the difference. Definitely recommend this speaker !!
5,Easy to set up Blue tooth. Love the ease to change the volume. 10 hours in the office on low to mid volume & it did not quit. Charges in a decent amount of time. I highly recommend this speaker.
4,The top of the volume is not that loud.
2,We were so excited to take this on vacation with us but no matter how long we charged it and had it ready for the following day it died after about 30 minutes! The sound was great and I imagine we just received a faulty one but we were one day late to the return window by the time we got back home so we couldn’t return it. Maybe you’ll have better luck!
4,It was a good thing to give.
5,Doss has top quality speakers that are very reasonably priced — with a rich and deep bass sound. I was pleasantly surprised at how great they sound.I bought this external speaker to hook up with an Echo Dot via a connecting cord rather than Bluetooth although this speaker allows for both connecting methods.Doss has just a tremendous customer service department as well!I wrote several times in trying to better understand how certain aspects of our Doss Speaker works though there is an online manual too that can be downloaded.The speaker emitted a buzzing sound to warn me that the battery level was low and I made an inquiry on how to disconnect this warning sound.But this is a simple speaker to use I might add.The Doss customer service department is simply outstanding and Chelsea the person I corresponded with each time (she always answered by letters promptly) was so very gracious.She really went the extra mile with me to help me with this buzzing sound even sending me a BIN FILE like by email and an SD CARD by snail mail.I highly recommend both this speaker and the company! Thanks again Chelsea!
5,It’s been better than I expected.
5,I wanted to use this speaker with my iMac as an external monitor and I’m overall very pleased.1. Sound quality. Don’t look for earthshaking bass (the Soundbox is modest in size) but it’s easy to enjoy the clear detailed sound on a variety of tracks from classical to punk. Even if your unit is pointed in the wrong direction the sound is still clean and clear. (Bass heads however would do better with headphones or floor speakers.)2. Ease of use. There are several ways of listening to the Soundbox - but using Bluetooth or external cable were the best for me. Once you plug in and handshake with the Bluetooth it’s pretty simple - though with a computer you’re going to have to manage to sound controls on your machine. It make take several seconds for your Bluetooth to connect if you have an older computer.3. Price. You can pay $100 or so for a top tier speaker but around $30 seems to be the sweet spot for many. Given the solidity of design and ease of use it’s a good deal.
5,I got it for my boyfriend for Christmas and it’s now april and it still works like new has amazing bass quality and sound
3,The sound is okay for the most part but not extremely loud. I’ve had it for a couple years now and all of a sudden it’s malfunctioning randomly turning itself on and off and making beeping noises. I’ve tried resetting it through the “line in” but it hasn’t helped.
4,All around decent bluetooth speaker for the price point. If you dropped $10-$20 more you could probably get something better. If you're just looking for something to use casually in a living space your room or bathroom this will do.Bass is not terrible some songs have a resonant frequency--or maybe it's my spotify settings--but the speaker does NOT like them. However this is few compared to many.Power-wise it's not bad at all I more so dislike bluetooth speakers that beep over and over when approaching low battery I'd rather them just die.Either way this is the perfect budget bluetooth speaker and the volume output is great for outdoor porch listening or filling a ~1200 sq ft room with enough noise to be a 'workspace'.
5,I was looking for a portable speaker to connect with bluetooth to my iPhone.  I wanted something that is better than the phone speakers without spending a lot of money.  This speaker fits my expectations perfectly.  It is small and portable and has good quality sound especially for it's size and price.  My only concern was that it emits loud annoying sounds when it turns on and off and connects and disconnects with bluetooth.In the questions section of this site I saw that someone else complained about the loud prompt sounds and someone from DOSS replyed to them instructing them to email DOSS at support@dossav.com and they would send them a fix to eliminate the sounds.  I emailed DOSS with my concerns that day and got a reply from Lu at DOSS within 24 hours with an attached file that I could copy onto a micro SD card to upgrade the firmware.  Lu also included instructions on how to complete the fix.  I followed Lu's instructions and had the fix done in just a few minutes.  Now my speaker works great and the prompts that I didn't like are gone.Bottom line is that it's a great speaker and my only concern with it was addressed within 24 hours by DOSS.  I wish other products that I have purchased had this kind of support.  Based on this experience I would not hesitate to buy any product from DOSS.
5,I have had this speaker for two years and am as impressed with it as ever. I have used it heavily indoors and out; despite being dropped on concrete buried in sand and drenched in water its integrity is uncompromised. The quality is impossible to beat for the price you pay. I used to work at a thrift store and would play jazz on this speaker for my entire shift. Customers would often compliment the niftiness and great sound and I rarely ever had to charge the thing because its battery lasted so long. Also as a jazz listener the bass is so impressive for such a small speaker! I cannot imagine ever paying several hundred dollars for a top-brand device after experiencing this wonderful thing. I could not be happier and I hope it lasts forever.However the controls are a little hard to get used to because of their uniqueness. You must read the manual but the instructions are clear and you catch on quickly.
5,This speaker has a booming sound that you would not expect from it's size. No distortion VERY VERY sturdy bc I bought it for my roommate and he drops it at least twice a day. The problem is that he's hard of hearing and has a constant ringing in his ears so he plays it very loudly and we really don't share the same taste in music. He also likes to play it almost constantly which is totally possible bc of the long battery life and I enjoy quiet time. It's going
2,Bought this mainly for listening to books and podcasts.  It cuts out at the beginning of every sentence.  Seems ok for music so maybe I should find singing podcasts?  At any rate not a great product.
5,This little speaker is amazing.  I’m not an audiophile by any stretch of the imagination but I know good sound when I hear it. As one of the other reviewers noted this is not a $200 Bose Soundlink mini; this is a $30 speaker well within my budget. When played at full volume it is extremely loud with no distortion. I normally play it at half volume and can hear it clearly throughout my little 2-bedroom home. The speaker has a pretty design and is solidly built. The voice announcement was annoying; it was a very weird freaky voice. I contacted customer service and received an attachment with a firmware update to remove it. Milla the customer service representative sent very precise instructions the update was simple to install and worked beautifully. The customer service was outstanding. I sent an email on Thanksgiving Day expecting a reply by Monday.  I heard back from them within an hour. The company Wonders Check is located in China and I don’t know where their customer service center is located but that’s great turnaround time. Thank you Milla.
5,Speakers work well delivery was good
5,I ordered this DOSS Bluetooth Speaker on Friday and it arrived the next day Saturday even though the scheduled day was Monday June 21st WOW.  The set up was quick and easy and I was listening to my favorite music in five (5)minutes.  It has two (2) 6 watt speakers for a total of 12 watts.  It's small lightweight and can go anywhere. It comes with everything necessary for charging.  While playing the first song wife said " Turn that thing down."  It has plenty of power and the sound is great.  It comes with a variety of colors to  choose from and I chose Purple (my mom's fave color).  This is a " MUST HAVE " item.
5,Worst customer service I have ever seen from an Amazon vendor ever!! The speaker sounds fine however when paired with an Echo Dot the pairing is dropped when the battery saver function kicks in. You have to manually restart the speaker every time by pressing the on button in the back of the speaker. ( I have other Bluetooth speakers that have a battery saver function but the speaker does disconnect from the Dot when the speaker is not in use.)  I sent an email to the Doss support desk per in instructions in the user manual. I received a return email with a "firmware" update that was suppose to remove the battery saver function. I downloaded the update onto an SD card and then loaded it into the speaker. This did not resolve the problem. I tried calling the customer service 800 number 7 or 8 times and each time I received a recorded message that said "Sorry we missed your call. Please leave a number and we will return your call". Really?!?! I want to talk to a human being...apparently they do not have any working for them. Will never by from this vendor again or recommend them to anyone else. If I do not receive a return call in 48 hours I will return the speaker. Too bad...it really sounds great.  I expect more from an Amazon vendor. I love Amazon and have never had this type of issue with service before.  UPDATE:
4,Second time buying this (gave the first one away). Never had any issues with it and it seems this version has a drastically improved battery life. Only annoying part is the "low battery" beep/cut. They could have honestly used a less annoying sound.
4,I'm a former professional musician and I have to say I'm rather impressed with this unit for the price.  You really need to use software equalization as the bass isn't booming by any measure but it's certainly enough to enjoy if you're not trying to have a house party.  If you're looking for a good PC speaker that doesn't take up a lot of space I highly recommend it.Edit:  The unit has started getting distortion while using physical connection mode when the charging cord is plugged in.  It's fine when you unplug it but if you're like me and using it as the audio device for your desktop computer it's annoying to have to worry about unplugging the cord when you're using it.  I get no problems from the bluetooth side of things even when the cable is plugged in.  Just something to consider.
5,They have had this speaker for well over a year and they absolutely love it. It goes with them everywhere. On picnics youth get-togethers at the park to play soccer or volleyball special school functions outdoors or just in their home or on their back patio. The sound is very very good. Very clear. I would buy this again
5,Sounds good and the blue color looks great in my office
5,I'm reading a lot of negative comments and most of it seems as end-user issues. Hell I plugged it in gave it a full charge turned it on and there was immediate pairing. I was stunned by the audio quality of this little powerhouse and its really good range I walked out my front door across the street and headed down to our mailbox I'd say at least 150 ft or more the signal never dropped and more importantly there was no change at all in sound quality.I gave it five stars.Here is a trick to make it sound better. Set it on a solid base about 6 inches above the surface it sits on. I noticed just a small amount of muddiness around the 500 Hertz up to 1100-1200 Hertz sound range by putting it on the pedestal the sound increased in quality by a noticeable difference and also helped to enhance its presence airiness whatever you wish to call it give it a try.
4,Over all the sound is great! Plenty of bass and volume to be heard over the shower and shower fan. The device pairs fine with my Alexa. I found out that Alexa finds it automatically. But it takes about 30 seconds regardless of how I pair it. So plan your activities accordingly. :) It can seem a long time if you just waiting on it to pair. But I'm getting used to this quirk. Also it doesn't seem to shut off automatically if it remains paired even without music playing.I have a suggestion if this is not already in the firmware update (haven't gotten it yet because auto shut off hasn't been an issue for me): a sleep mode where the Doss speaker remains paired but conserves power until awakened when music is sent to it via bluetooth. This way there's not this power up/power down thing every day.Which reminds me of another suggestion: The power button on the back is a little unhandy. A power button on top would be a lot more convenient especially since there is not a sleep mode that I know of.The ability to keep the device plugged in to an outlet would be nice too.(Could these suggestions be done in a firmware update?)All that said overall I'm happy with the purchase and plan to use it for a long time.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I work in a factory in a loud machine so I bought this small speaker to listen to music while I work. I was worried it wouldn’t be loud enough because of how small it is however as you can hear in my video this speaker has a great range for the volume. It comes packaged very well charger cord is included but no charger block. It also comes with aux cable too. Sound is 360’ also which is so nice. I can’t make a comment or complaint on the battery life as of yet but will update later.Good buy for the price and I am very pleased with this purchase. Would recommend.
5,I bought this for my 84 years young  mother. She loves to ask "alexa" to play music on her echo dot. So I wanted to connect a nice sounding speaker for her. This speaker fits the budget and the directions to connect to an echo dot through Bluetooth were spot on! No troubles at all!!
5,I purchased two of these one for my sister since I broke her last one and one for myself. the sound is very high quality and I was super surprised that it could pack that much sound into how small it was. I rarely have to charge it and have never had problems with Bluetooth. it connects super easily with my iPhone and never disconnects. it even saves its battery by automatically turning off when music or sound isn't coming through your phone when you're connected. something that surprised me was the fact that it isn't just Bluetooth and even has an aux port in case you don't want to use Bluetooth for whatever reason.
5,(update) I'm impressed with the speaker and the service.  The speaker was replaced free.  See the following comment for my initial review:  We use this speaker to accompany our morning coffee so we don't have to turn on the whole house music.  It has good sounds (lack good bass).  Volume is good for our one room 'ease into the day' morning coffee.  We took it to my wife's sister's house for the holidays.  She doesn't have a good audio system so we used this speaker to play holiday music.  The volume was sufficient for background music in a room with 10 people carrying on 10 different conversations.  The problem (downside) with this speaker is durability.  The inside of the USB plug broke.  I've never had this happen with our 6 other USB devices.  It must be composed of a very brittle material.  Not sure what else would have caused it.  Whatever the cause it will not charge because of the broken USB plug.  I will ask if it can be repaired; however because it was not very expensive I will not hold my breath.
5,Like other people say it’s not a high end speaker but the sound is impressive. Not really a bass boomer but for its size it is great! Heavier than expected and feels very solid. Super sensor  touch controls would recommend.
4,Pretty good speaker for the price. I put it on the vanity so I can listen to books or music while I shower. Seems like the battery doesn't last super long but it otherwise is a nice little speaker.
4,The sound quality from this little guy is the best I've heard on a speaker in this size class hands down. It is loud and clear at any volume with an impressive bass radiator that gives a nice audible punch to your music. The touch circle on the top foe the volume is okay I still tend to adjust it from my device but it's a nice premium feeling touch. The only complaint I have is because I bought the white model and it came brand new with black dirty smudges all over the grill see attached images so beware of this if you're eyeing the white one. Overall you can't beat this price for this quality of speaker none of my other ones in this size class compare definitely punches well above its weight!
5,Bought this to get more volume out of my tablet great sound for a small package would by again!
4,It does what it's supposed to. I like it and the price was right on
5,If you're looking for a small speaker with big sound this is it.
5,So I'm just setting up my home office and my new monitor doesn't have speakers. I decided I'd get something cheap but (multi-)functional. Came across this and liked the idea of it so I tried it out.I'm going to skip ahead to what I did second: connect this device to my phone. Nice rich loud sound. Wow. This is definitely coming with me when I need some sound on trips or something.EDIT: ... Maybe I'm dumb or it just needed time? It works now. I have no idea what I did differently but ignore the below issue. Keeping in case this happens to someone else too.Now to what I did first: connect this to my computer. I'm running a System76 Meerkat so maybe that has something to do with my issue but the volume controls do NOT work for that. I kept spinning the my finger around the dial and nothing. Sound was still great don't get me wrong and still fully controlled by the meerkat. But the dial refuses to work. I tried bluetooth and aux-in. Nothing. That's what made me plug in my phone to see if it was changing the system sound (nope; phone volume is not the same as Doss volume which is expected). So yeah not sure why I can't use the dial for my computer BUT I'm not going to 1-star this for that (just -1 lol). Like I said it still sounds great.
5,I was really pleased with the sound quality. I was worried it would be a bit tinny or weak but after using this speaker pretty much every day I'm still delighted with how clear powerful and well-rounded the sound is. I usually connect it via bluetooth to my Android phone and have had no issues at all. Once charged the speaker lasts a long time before needing recharging. I recommend this to anyone looking for a reasonably priced general use speaker!
5,Love it last a long time Great sound
4,I mean…sound comes out of it?! 🥴Maybe I’ve been spoiled on the quality of JBL flip speakers but this speaker does not hit.Yes the volume can go high. But I’m a musician. And I geek out on things like really quality-sounding bass and clarity of voice. But the sound coming out of this sounds more like FM radio.It’ll do considering that it was only $30 bucks. But overall I’m not impressed.
5,just used at home but connected with no problem and sounds great
5,I purchased this speaker in 2017 and it is STILL GOING STRONG. I would give this speaker more than five stars if I could. I love this speaker!
5,This speaker can get pretty loud. I like it.
5,The Doss Soundbox is a small and stylish Bluetooth speaker that produces pretty well balanced audio out of the box. If you compliment the speaker with an equalizer app like Bass EQ Pro you can really fine tune the speaker's output to your personal preference. I also really like the aesthetic of the speaker's design and the way the controls are nicely implemented. The Soundbox is capable of achieving a pretty substantial volume level and does so with some very mild distortion or muddiness if you have increased the bass levels. The overall bass response is great; you really have to temper your expectations in tune with what a speaker of this size can produce in terms of audio fidelity and volume level.Although I don't consider myself an audiophile I do know and appreciate proper music reproduction. I've owned a number of Bluetooth speakers from various manufacturers including Bose Soundlink II Soundlink II Mini UE Megaboom Vizio Crave 360 and Crave Pro (considered Bluetooth only because Chromecast doesn't work) JBL Charge 3 and JBL Xtreme. The Doss Soundbox is closest to the Soundlink Mini II in terms of size and a category you could compare this speaker to and it actually compares favorably. I thought the Soundlink Mini II had a rather limited soundstage for the size and cost of the speaker. I don't get that from this speaker; it is a solid buy with sound reproduction that actually belies its size and cost.
4,Connects quickly to Bluetooth and nice sound.
5,Heavy speaker well made and sounds very good for the price.  My daughter loved it!!
5,I’ve been wanting this for ever! I moved and treated myself to it. It works great! I haven’t used it much to know it’s battery life but the sound is great. I use it in my bathroom or in the living room while I’m in the kitchen. It’s great! Loud but not too loud! Super easy to use
5,This is a great portable speaker. Nice long battery life. It has lasted us months in between charges. Plays loud and clear. Good value for little money
5,This Bluetooth speaker is a wonder! It will pair with every device I have. The reason that connectivity got a 4 is that it won't jump from device to device by itself. But it plays music loud and clear and can connect to the right kind of tv. I have had the speaker as far as 15 feet from the source and it still played. Super simple to use-- there is an on/off button and volume control. You can use a  TF card and it has a place for the charger cord. If it starts to lose quality sound it is time to plug it in. By the way it will last all day on a charge.GREAT PHONE FEATURE! If you are running the speaker from your phone (my most common method) the speaker will ringtone all calls and texts and shutdown the audio automatically. Once the call is over it brings the music back up. If you are going to talk-to-text it lowers then raises the volume automatically.We have even taken them on vacation. Totally worth it!
5,The beautiful blue color is perfect more blue than turquoise. I love how long the battery lasts and how easy it is to carry it from room to room around the house. It was very easy to set up and connect with my phone. I would highly recommend it!
5,I got this to provide music for my gallery which is about 500 sq ft. It works beautifully. We don't set the volume very high so I can't attest to the quality in that case but at lower levels it sounds really clear and I don't get any interference or static like with some bluetooth speakers. It was easy to set up and my iPhone recognized it within about 15 seconds. It stays paired as long as you don't move the phone too far away from the speaker. I'd guess that at about 15 feet away it can start to cut out.So far the charge has lasted for all our events (4-6 hours) so I leave it plugged in when not in use and then we can move it anywhere in the gallery when we are open. It's nice to have music in our space again.
5,I received this today. It came with a charging wire (no wall plug) the device a manual and an aux cord. It came with a little charge so I was able to turn it on and play. It took a bit of adjusting because it kept disconnecting with my iPhone but it eventually paired fine. Sound was good. Pretty loud for such a small speaker. I tried connecting it to my PC (main device I was going to use this for) but it doesn’t play any sound even though it’s connected.I was so excited for this but it’s not really working for my computer unless I use line in mode.Also I was very disappointed because the unit came with a few scratches. See in pictures. The packaging was great so I was very unhappy to see small scratches on the bottom front my new device.Will test the Bluetooth with my husband’s computer to see how that goes but for now not totally happy with this purchase.UPDATE: So DOSS contacted me and offered to give me another device after they'd tested to make sure that that one works. It's great! I did notice that the LEDs are brighter with this new one. Not sure if that's a function that changes with battery levels or just how the devices are. Overall giving a 5-star since customer service was prompt and the device works really well.
5,Great sound with impressive bass for something this size if you position it close to a hard wall. But after an hour of use every morning in a humid bathroom for nearly three years the battery has finally given out. That's pretty damn good as far as I'm concerned. Ordering another today! My only complaint is that the low battery warning repeats much too frequently (once a minute it seems like) and is very annoying.
4,I bought this to go outside while working in my yard and feeding wildlife critters. I really like this speaker. It joins quickly to my cell phone Bluetooth. Despite not understanding how the “touch volume circle control” worked on top I quickly figured it out and love it!! Sounds pretty good. Better volume then other types of small speakers I’ve had. Overall very pleased!
5,I’ve been looking for a Bluetooth speaker for months. Before that I thought I wanted a record player with incredible sound quality and loudness so that I could begin my vinyl collector title. Haha!I think I looked at every brand every style etc. I came across this gems reviews and was impressed. The multi colors were also a factor. I had added it to my list of future purchases but put it on the back burner and ultimately deleted it from the list to focus on saving and be prepared for holiday season financially.This last Thursday I received a notification from Amazon about this item being the deal of the day so I immediately purchased it.The sound quality is incredible. Regardless of which room I am in my apartment. I couldn’t be more thrilled that now my Saturday’s can be filled with old school tunes as I clean away with this little boom box. Grade? B. It would’ve been an A+ but no carrying bag or case comes with this speaker which is unfortunate for such a lovely item.
5,This little speaker is perfect for my home office. Operation is smooth sound is beautiful and the battery charge lasts several days even being played a few hours each day.
5,This speaker is worth every cent! I use it ALL the time whilst painting houses. One of my biggest pet peeves with most BT speakers is they tend not to have a skip song/forward button. I listen to a lot of podcasts & every commercial break I would have to go to my phone & skip forward or back on my phone. 90% of the time a commercial would come on while my hands are full of wet paint or I was up on a scaffold or otherwise occupied.Not with this speaker. I love this speaker. The battery lasts WAY longer than other speakers I've used in the past. Will purchase again...& again & again if need be.
5,Love it
5,I purchased two of these each in different colors for Christmas gifts and giving them to a couple of relatives for both of them I set them up myself and programmed it.  so I actually got a chance to really see how these products work as I don’t own one myself I’m kind of mad that I didn’t get one for myself because I really love it it has a lot of functionalities it’s compact it the sound is perfect everything about it is seems great I just hope it lasts long.  One problem I do have it it’s a lot with the technology that they make these days there’s a USB cord but they don’t put an adapter with it I don’t know why I don’t see how we can make it any that much cheaper but it’s not like people have outlet USBs all over the house you have to buy an adapter or use an existing one so if you really want to make a great gift even perfect the same way when you buy electronics that need batteries to get them batteries for it so the same way you get electronics with a USB cord or charger make sure that you get an adapter for them that’s all
4,Overall I’d say it’s a pretty good speaker. One misleading thing they advertise is “waterproof”. It’s not waterproof it’s water resistant and that’s why I took a star off. It’s water resistant so don’t try to throw this thing underwater or anything. It should be able to handle splashing and rain. It’s decently loud and has a clear sound to it. Overall a nice speaker but misleading title.
4,Impressed with sound quality.
4,Good for music not very good for people talking battery life is decent however it regularly makes a noise while dying constantly interrupting whatever you are listening to for about 2-5 seconds then returns to the audio great Bluetooth implementation it is quick and connects reliably.
5,I bought this speaker five years ago and I'm still very happy with its performance! I've dropped it a couple of times over the years which has left dents in a couple of areas. Despite this the speaker continues to work beautifully. I connect my phone via Bluetooth and have had almost no issues with connectivity dropping across the five years I've used it. The battery life continues to be great. I would definitely buy the DOSS SoundBox again!
5,What i don't like is when I get a call either I have to turn off thr Bluetooth on my phone or the box but otherwise I am good with it....The sound quality is good
5,I received this speaker today on 10/15/21 and I'm very impressed . Quality of unit is pretty sturdy and has a decent high-end feeling  very well made . Sound quality is very nice and clear  although it does have a radiator I wish it was positioned differently to let more low-end out but still very crisp loud and clear sound . Connection was super quick and easy  touch controls are also very nice .overall a great speaker for such an affordable price.
5,I bought this for my Jeep Wrangler. Apparently the stereo system got wet too many times and I just don’t have $3000 to replace it. It fits perfectly in the compartment on the dash and cord reaches in the charger. It works great. The blue tooth for the phone isn’t the best quality for the caller. They say it’s very muffled.
5,I have been on a roll with the products I purchase online! Any online purchase can be scary. You rely on others honest reviews. I received this speaker on time. The ONLY negative thing I would say and it’s not enough to give it less then 5 stars is that the box it was sent in was much bigger then the speaker box packaging and there was no cushioning inside to prevent it from sliding or banging around during delivery. With that said this speaker box was EXACTLY what we were looking for. It’s not small and it’s not huge the sound is AMAZING you can hear it through our 4 bedroom house no matter where you are when it’s on full volume. It’s sleek looking. I love that the buttons are just touch features not push buttons. It chimes when you are connected or disconnect (no annoying voices prompting you) and my kids can use it outside while they play or practice sports all while my phone is inside with me. Overall I am completely satisfied with my purchase. If for some reason something changes I will come back and update! If you’re looking to but this speaker go for it!! And enjoy!
5,I have to say I love this little speaker. It has a great sound & much louder than anticipated. Worth the money. Wish they red :(
5,i love this speaker!! i'm very particular about my bluetooth speakers and this one fits the bill perfectly. connecting was super fast and easy—maybe the fastest and easiest of any speaker i've tried. the sound quality is awesome. what i like best about it is the touch controls. i figured they wouldn't work very well but they work perfectly and the volume control (sliding clockwise or counterclockwise on the blue ring in the center) is simply cool and fun to use. i will note that i ordered the blue speaker and the color is a lot less muted in real life than in the pictures but that is a plus for me as i think the color is really pretty. all in all this is the best bluetooth speaker i've used especially for the price.
5,Perfect!!
5,love it!!!! Easy to figure out and music sound is great
5,I bought this speaker to go with my Amazon Echo Dot. I already had an Echo and wanted the Dot for another room. After reading many reviews on low price Bluetooth speakers I chose the DOSS Touch Wireless "Soundbox". I charged the Soundbox and turned it on. I must admit getting it to turn on was a bit of a challenge. After getting it to turn on I paired it with my Echo Dot. The speaker sounds very good for its sizes and gets pretty loud! I was feeling really good about my purchase. Then I decided to pair it with my tablet....but I couldn't get it to go into pairing mode. Turned it on and off numerous times reviewed the instructions went online even reset the speaker....nothing.  Tried to pair with my smart phone....nothing. Mind you I'm very happy with the speaker but I wanted to use it with other devices  besides my Dot. So I send an email to customer support stating that I couldn't get the speaker to go back into pairing mode. I sent the email about 11:00 at night and gota response back stating that they were sorry to here about my issues. They offered to replace it. Mind you this was on a Friday morning when I got their and I had my new speaker by Monday!! This was without a doubt one of the BEST customer service experiences ever! Very good product great customer service!
5,I’m hard earring and I can set the speaker next to me on the coffee table!! Now I don’t need the TVs speakers very loud  I can hear this one on very low sound!! Highly recommended 5 star ⭐️
4,I loved this speaker until it started raining and ruined it. My husband blew it out with an air hose so it does charge and turn on but then it shorts out. If you buy this great sounding speaker never use it outside unless it is under a shelter.
5,This speaker is louder then my jbl clip speaker.
5,great for the price
4,I looooved it so much for first couple of days that is worked. The first time it ran out of battery I got the charging cable it came with & I plugged it into a outlet on the wall. The small light behind the box lit up red left it there for about 8-9 hours. Came back & saw the light green I so unplugged it connected to my phone just fine & played perfectly. Buuut not even 5mins later it turned off. I’m not sure why? I tried to turn it on a couple more times but nothing. So I waited about 2-3 days didn’t touch it at all. Plugged charger into the wall & checked off the battery was still full? It was (steady green light). But when i tried to turn it on it just wouldn’t turn on? Help?
4,This is the best portable speaker for this price! I bought it for my dorm 2 years ago and it still works great. Because I always forget to charge it the long-lasting battery is ideal for me. The device's controls make controlling music a breeze. The music does not sound muffled as it does with other speakers. The only issue I've experienced is that it will occasionally skip midway through a song.
5,I am pretty happy with this purchase. The size makes is super easy to take with me from room to room or outside on the patio. It has enough power to turn the volume up and not lose clarity. I haven't tried it for a party or large gathering but for small settings it's darn good1
5,This is an excellent speaker. Great sound easily connects to Bluetooth. I bought it to use with my echo dot. The only drawback is that I wanted the speaker to stay on so when I needed Alexa it was available. This speaker comes with an auto-shut off feature. When not in use after 15 minutes it shuts off (even if it is plugged in) so you have to manually turn it back on. Not ideal with Alexa. It is an easy fix though. Email Doss support (support@dossav.com) and they will email a firmware update with instructions (it took a couple days for them to respond). You will need a Micro-SD card. Download the update onto the card turn on the speaker put the card in (upside down) the update will install wait for the speaker to shut off on it's own and you're good to go. If you don't have a Micro-SD card they will send you one. Their customer service is wonderful.
5,I started using this product right away after it was delivered. I’ve never owned a Bluetooth speaker so I don’t really have anything to compare it to.. but I love it. I think the sound quality is nice a lot better than using my phone’s speakers. I like the look and feel of the buttons you twirl your finger around the circle in the middle to increase and decrease the volume. The bass sounds pretty good too. I highly recommend!!
5,Portable convenient great sound quality and no issues with bluetooth connectivity. Battery life is really good too. Recommend.
5,Easy to set up and pair. Connects automatically upon power on after the initial set up. Sounds amazing for how small it is. I dont use it above 50% volume in my garage as thats plenty loud. Would Recommend.
4,Bought this for when we go to the beach or the pool. Works pretty great. Although I expected a little better sound quality. Over all happy with purchase and do purchase the case. It’s a smart investment.
5,I'm using this to play audiobooks and TED talks from YouTube from my Chromebook and Phone and am impressed by the sound quality in a room which is about 20 feet x 15 feet. The box was ridiculously easy to set up and had no issues being recognized by my devices. Voices are crisp and clear and I like that it's so easy to pause a book right from the box. It's also nice to have an automatic shutoff so the battery doesn't drain when I get distracted and move to another room.My only criticism is that I can't be connected to my tablet and phone at the same time and toggle between them. If I want to play something from my phone I need to disconnect the bluetooth connection the box is making to my tablet. That's a pretty small critique given the overall quality and value of the DOSS SoundBox though.
3,Good: sound size and price (I paid less than $35). All important criteria.Bad:1) Loud bell-type sounds when turning on and off when changing modes when pairing and disconnecting and even when turning the volume to maximum. Irritating.2) The on/off button is tiny and you have to hold it down for a second or two to turn the speaker on or off. Would be a problem I think for someone lacking in manual dexterity such as the elderly or those with tremors. Also in my experience buttons such as these are often the first elements to fail so they should require as gentle use as possible. My guess is that Doss expects people to turn on the speaker and leave it on in which case the size of the button and difficulty in manipulating it become less important. Still to my mind another flaw.3) So far pairing is a problem. Sometimes when it works the speaker sounds fine but sometimes it sounds noisy. I'm open to the possibility that I'm doing something wrong but I can't think what. Also if I turn speaker off and then back on and try to reconnect via Bluetooth it refuses. And if I try to turn it off too soon after turning it on it won't shut down. I have to wait a few minutes until it gives up trying to connect (at least that's how it seems).If I were using this speaker via the included 3.5 mm cable connecting it direct to my laptop rather than via Bluetooth I'd probably give it 3.5 stars (rounding up to 4) because it seems to work fine that way. I wanted Bluetooth though so I have to score it 2.5/5 (rounding up to 3). Maybe it functions better with a phone or tablet.If you'd like to see the manual / user guide go to dossaudio.com then Support then DOSS Soundbox and download the right one for you (probably the first EN-SoundBox User Manual).
5,I give this speaker 5 stars because it was exactly what I expected from reading the product description and some reviews. It arrived in good order pairing Bluetooth with my elderly 2nd Gen. iPad that I'm using for a clock radio was dead simple. I'm presently using it for music in the bedroom streaming from the Calm Radio iOS app. Before the speaker arrived I was using the Calm Radio app articulating with the Nightstand iOS app (which displays time & weather and also provides sleep timer and wallpaper pic functions).However for some reason operating the apps in tandem this way (using Nightstand to cut off the Calm Radio music) interrupts the speaker output. How I do not know but after I discovered that the Calm Radio app incorporates a sleep timer it is also irrelevant. The speaker works fine if I'm operating the apps independently so this issue really has nothing to do with the DOSS speaker I'm simply including what I did for the benefit of anyone who's using it in a similar setup.Yes the LEDs on top are too bright but it's set high enough that this is not an issue in lighting up the bedroom all that is visible is a dim glow on the wall above the speaker. If I would reposition it to where the light from the LEDs would become an issue I will simply dim out the LEDs with a permanent marker.
5,Sound quality is good until you okay rock music. Then it's a bit distorted less you have the volume down. But everything else it sounds good. Good bass. I had a blue one and I had to get a white one!. It's a great speaker when you're on a budget
5,Saw this for sale for $20+ & save it when I came back it was over $30 read up on it & thought its might be an ok product but wasn't willing to pay that much for it saw the price go to $29 & decided to order it. Was smaller than I thought it would be but the sound was remarkable. It really packs a punch for it small size easy to connect to my phone via bluetooth very portable at a very very reasonable price. Quality of build seem very good & solid. I was trying to figure out how to take it apart to spray it "My hobby" there might be 4 screws under the bottom but I am not ready to mess around with it yet. been playing for over 2 hrs on battery without recharge so that is great. I don't know how long the rechargeable battery will hold up but I am currently more than satisfied with this products looks feel performance cost & sound. Sound quality wise I would put this 1 notch below the Bose Soundlink 2 mini at 1/5 the cost it is more than worth its cost & does not disappoint. setup & controls are easy to use  & very stylish. I would definitely give this as a gift to someone who wants a portable but powerful speaker.
5,I left my Oontz Angle 3 home when I went on vacation  so I purchased the DCSS as a stand in.  It was a bit more expensive but when I got home and compared it to the OontZ I much preferred the sound from the DCSS.  I'm no audiophile and tastes vary between people but I felt it did sound a bit better.  More than that the DCSS on/off switch was much easier to operate and it does have a "Line in" feature.  It does have a slot for a memory card but the Amazon description says it's a Micro SD and the slot is actually for a TF card.  Not a big deal but be sure you order the right card.
5,I listen to this speaker every night when I shower. I have an iPod and it was real simple to connect. I had a different blue tooth speaker that stopped working so since it was Christmas i just looked on Amazon to see what ad a on sale and I was not disappointed.
5,I gave this as a gift. I did try it first the sound was good vocals are clear and had some base for a small speaker not sure on the battery life. I would probably buy one for myself if I had a use for it.
4,The sound is good and it’s easy to connect to my IPhone. IPhone speakers are not very good so this make it easy to hear music and audiobooks from my IPhone. It’s a little hard to use the controls on the top of speaker. And if you bump the controls it goes to the previous program automatically which I don’t like.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 We like the simplicity of using this Bluetooth speaker; the connectivity is quick. The sound quality is great. The battery life lasts for days; I use it in the office for 4-8 hours five days a week. Great quality at a low price. Highly recommend! In fact we purchased a second one for home.
5,Compact little device that packs a punch!I mean it doesn't have subwoofer bass but the sound is crisp and clear and has a nice rumble in the heaviest bass songs so I can't complain.It also connects really fast has rarely dropped bluetooth signal and the battery life is RIDICULOUS. Ridiculously good that is. Our last bluetooth speaker was only 3 years old and wouldn't hold a charge longer than 3-4 hours. If we didn't listen to it for a week it would still drain the battery.This one? The first time we charged it fully we listened to it for 5-6 hours a day for TWO days and at the end it was down to 20%. We fully charged it again and a week later we used it again and the battery charge was still at 100%.Overall we are ECSTATIC with this purchase.
5,I been using it for about a month…. Works great!! Sounds great!!
4,Nice sound for a small speaker. Touch functions on the top are super easy to access and are very responsive. The size is perfect and portable. It is nice to have a 3.5 mm cord And option to connect that way. Charges very quickly and last a long time. Highly recommended
4,I liked speaker & would have kept it except for one thing. After being idle for 10 minutes speaker shuts itself off and cannot accept & announce incoming calls. Otherwise very good speaker.
5,Was ON  since 8pm and it was around 2pm next day and it didn’t die. Used next day without recharging and still on.Sound wise could be better but still good. Just play with your phone equalizer and it should be way better.
4,This speaker is good but not great. The main thing holding it back is the sound quality. It boasted HD sound and bass in the title but you don’t quite get that. That’s really my main gripe - if that’s what you’re claiming in your title description you should deliver pretty close to that at the least. There’s no rich bass and it’s really heavy in the mid frequencies.But having said that everything else about this little box has been fantastic so far. Pairing is very easy playback controls are nice and it puts out good volume. Charging is good - I haven’t ran it out to find out its true battery life but so far it has performed great in that regard.I’d say this is a great option for those who want a decent sounding Bluetooth speaker at a much lower cost than the big name brands. You won’t get the same audio quality as those others but you’re paying far less so you come out ahead on that side. If you care more about saving money than having awesome sound this is for you.
4,This is the first bluetooth speaker I have ever bought but I have had several USB and self-powered extension speakers in the same price range for somewhat of a comparison. My goal for any speaker this size is reasonable clarity (esp modrange for voice) and high volume.The Altec extension speakers I have were $25 and they have a very good sound balanced midrange and decent lower frequency. This DOSS unit has better volume but only slightly higher than the Altecs. The DOSS has a rather boomy bass overall sound which to me is a little bit too much but very preferable to the cheap tinny sound that some units provide.I primarily use this in my car as a hands-free device for my smartphone. For that I am giving it 4 stars. With more volume and a bit less bass emphasis the DOSS would be 5 stars esp at its $35 price level.  You Tube and Netflix movies are enjoyable when heard through this speaker. Good enough for two or three people sitting around on a Saturday nite with snacks and conversation.Packaging is extremely impressive and the overall feel and the controls are very good. But the volume control is a touch circle thing that would be better as a touch slide or simple knob. The other touch controls for call pickup forward and reverse are fine.
4,Very good for the price
4,The sound is adequate for my place.  It has a very long battery life and shuts itself off when not in use.
5,This little speaker rocks. Seriously super easy to connect and I get pretty good range. I can usually get about 1 week in between charges. And that’s using it everyday for about 30 mins on max volume while I hit the gym.
5,Escribo esta reseña después de casi tres años de haberlo comprado. Me ha impresionado su volumen resistencia y durabilidad de la batería. No lo uso mucho solo cuando cocino y me quiero relajar un poco y les cuento que cargo la batería cada tres meses. El bluetooth es de amplio rango como a unos 10 metros se puede conectar muy bien. Los botones son muy hermosos y táctiles retroiluminados.
5,I recommend this.  We bought if for our teenage daughter to listen to in the bathroom while in the shower doing her hair or doing homework.  Loves it!  Smaller than expected but big in every other way.  Li es the color perfect for her.
5,This portable Bluetooth speaker has great  sound quality and really enhances the tonal quality of my iPhone and iPad which I have used with this speaker. I enjoy listening to music and streaming much more using the speaker. I am completely satisfied and feel this was a wise purchase. You can also use the speaker in the phone mode which is a great perk as well. I have not had to recharge it yet so I am assuming battery life will be as good as everything else about this little speaker. I rate this a perfect score overall unless it were to malfunction which it has NOT done so far. Seems well-made and I believe it will be a long-lasting unit as long as it is treated well – but this is true for ALL things.
4,Great product
3,Just picked up today and so far impression is not the best. Purchased to have a free hands device both to listen music from computer and answer calls without headphones pressing the ears. Every device is located within adviced 1 meter distance (literally within one external keyboard distance)1. Bluetooth. Connection reasonably OK even if it turns off every 15 minutes (it is possible to fix it I know) and has a bit disturbances however the microphone level is prettty bad so it is not even worth it.2. Connected with AUX cable to laptop. Constant low grade white noise but ar least microphone is pretty ok here and no connection are without issues3. Provided cables are ridiculously short - my laptop is literally a keyboard away and I would have issues connecting as the audio input is on the other side of laptop. Luckily I had my own longer cablesNot sure how it would work with cell phone or so but I am pretty disappointed for wireless connection for laptop - I will have to take a bunch of cables or headphones if traveling.I like the touch feature (one of the main reasons I was looking at it - no physical buttons pretty easy to clean if need arise) and I don't have time to wait for return/try another so I am keeping it.
4,Cumple las espectaticas
5,Just got it yesterday 12/7/16. I can only give it 5 stars right off the bat. This is a great sounding speaker with an elegant look. The buttons repond just fine. I cannot see myself putting this on max volume no need. I have this paired with the Echo Dot which is also a great product and they make the perfect pair with looks and performance. I have heard co workers speakers at work and some of my friends in the past and I had my own speakers and they do not compare to the Doss Boss.I can't believe I purchased this for $29.00. I don't know what the Bose soundlink BT speaker sound like and I am sure its better than this. To tell you the truth after listening to this speaker I would't even think about spending more for one. Dont get me wrong I love Bose I have two of Bose headsets with noise cancellation. I have to give it to This Doss its great man I think I woke up everyone in my place messing with it and putting on max volume.Yes the sound is crisp Kenny G came in very clear and the Highs and lows seem to hit the right spots.If your looking for a great speaker at a low price try this out you will not be disappointed.I will update soon.
5,I have had this thing for about 4 years now and it is still working. I have used the crap out of this thing. Its has been dropped many times it has gotten rained on. Dropped in the mud. It has dents and scratches all over it. I put this thing through a lot. I went on a camping trip about a month ago and had this playing in the background for idle music for the whole day. I love this thing and for $30! It is VERY loud for how small it is. My friend had a bigger speaker but this one was still louder. It was very well made. The sound quality is awesome. This thing is just soooo good for how small and cheap it is. Now i cant say anything about any other Doss speakers but this one is a very good speaker.
3,If you're buying this for your phone or tablet on computer the sound is surprisingly good. I was always shocked at how it vibrated my desk. You won't mind this device for jamming on your computer. The sound is fine. I ultimately replaced it though and moved it to the kitchen. Here's why I don't use it on my computer anymore.Even though it interfaces perfectly in that volume always works (it doesn't with my current speaker) the device just annoyingly TURNS OFF after five minutes of silence. I've looked for ways around this and have given up.  This has gotten on my nerves because turning it back on has a MANDATORY very loud ringtone not suitable for late night when it reconnects in Bluetooth. Also I use some video editing software that locks up when I go back to it and the sound output has changed. You have to be careful when handling it because the top touch controls can pause or skip to the next song or podcast. Naturally you  won't be handling it much because you can control it remotely.Other than those shortcomings I recommend this device.
3,i have owned two of these now and both of them have had the same issue i owned one for about 2 years and it was amazing and then one day the charger port stopped working i bought this one i would say in the last year and the charger port has stopped working again I don’t know if it’s just luck or what but it literally sits on a shelf and only gets touched to be turned on and off.
3,Absolutely no bass. I mean zero. I had high hopes based off the reviews but I couldn't stand it past the first couple of songs to test it out. I sent it back and bought a JBL flip 5 which amazed me with it's quality.
5,I just bought a rzr and wanted speakers  but oh lord there expensive had this 2 for my kids took me a while to figure out how to have both playing  at the same time and let me tell you they sound bad asss 👌💯🕺🕺🕺at first I took only one when we went to the dessert to ride sounded good enough I can imagine both on at the same time even though it was noisy you could still hear it nice and clear no need to buy a stage 5 system for $2000 to impress other ppl im happy with 2 of this doss speakers ill find a Mickey mouse to put them somewhere in the cage of the rzr 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤣🤣🤣🤣Turned my jbl 4 speaker good enough to be home in the garage chilling not to good of sound like doss
4,El sonido al principio parece no ser tan bueno luego el oído se acostumbra 😂 está bien para el precio si quieres oír musica sola. Para estar en grupo no lo recomiendo.Cuando falta bateria comienza a pitar
5,Revised Comments:I found the TF card I was was using went bad. Just out of curiosity I bought a new one loaded a few songs and tried it. It worked son of a gun that almost never happens. So then I tried a different charger and by golly the green charge light came on. Good grief sorry if I mislead anyone honest mistake(s).Original comments:I used the TF card slot mainly then one day it stopped working. When I press the mode it changes back to a 'Blue ring' [which is Blue Tooth] with a chime. If I hit mode and the volume button the light stays green but the card slot won't play. Prior to that the green charge LED quit working. It's a great sounding unit for the size and price but I doubt I'll buy another one (of these).
5,I've not needed to project sound across an outdoor venue or a large hall so I have no complaints about the performance of the DOSS Bluetooth speaker.  It is as loud as I could possibly hope for at the price and louder than I'm likely to need very often.  When at maximum volume I've not yet heard any distortion of note and find it more than adequate for my purposes mostly indoors or on my backporch.  Were I more of an audiophile I suppose I might find some sound issues but convenience and good sound at a moderate volume were more important to me and this speaker provides both.  So I can easily recommend it for the average user.The speaker paired very easily with my Echo Dot my ipad and my iphone.  Switching it from one to the other can be a chore (needed to unplug the Dot before it would free up the DOSS) but not so much as to be a real negative.I've only needed to use it unplugged for an extended period once and then only for about six hours but it kept on playing with no problem or loss of sound quality.  All in all at the price this was a good decision for my purposes.  Your experience may differ but I give it full marks.
3,I bought this after my Jam Party broke. I also have a Vizio Bluetooth speaker so I am somewhat comparing to what I know already.**Sound is crisp. I live in a small apartment and the sound easily reaches all corners. Some had asked about a large living room. I don't think this will run a party for you but for individual use it might be good enough for a larger room. It all depends on expectations.** Pairing is easy and quick.What I don't like about it.......***You only have a USB charger. I wished I had paid attention because I would have not bought this. You will always have an electrical outlet somewhere to charge but you don't always have a laptop available. You can buy an adapter but then again who wants to run out and buy a piece for a brand new device that they bought? The USB cable is also very short so when I tried to charge at the wall with an adapter I had to put something on the floor to get the device closer to the outlet or it wouldn't reach (about 25 inches)***The touch buttons only work when you are paired to your phone not to your laptop. So if your music is on your laptop and you want to use the buttons they don't work. Might not be a big deal for some. Disappointing to me anytime something doesn't work on a brand new device.***The charge LED is the size of the tip of a needle (very small!) on the back and hidden under the charging cable. If you want to check if the device is charged you will have to walk up to it turn it around and flip it over before you get a good angle on the LED light. Just annoying.
5,Absolutely love it. Bluetooth connection was no problem and the sound is perfect.
5,Can’t complain 🥰
5,Great speaker for the price. So glad I purchased it.
4,It works great easy to pair... just wish there was a little more bass to it. But it's great for watching movies and playing music with little bass. Battery lasts a long time with out charge. Going on 5 days and I drive two hours to and from work daily. It's not rubber so it will burn your fingers if in direct sunlight.
5,Si lo compraría y más  por el precio suena bien
4,Pros: 1. I love the sound of this speaker. Gets plenty loud for its size.  2. I can get my phone over 100 feet away from speaker and have zero signal issues.  3. Battery life is great.Cons: Only 1 thing bothers me about this product. When battery gets low the speaker makes a phone busy signal type sound every minute or so letting you know battery is almost dead. Trouble is I have had this speaker make the low battery tone for over an hour before getting so annoyed with the intermittent tone I just turned off the speaker.(NOTE TO DOSS) PLEASE! Remove low battery tone from this product. It is not needed. If you must indicate low battery make the led ring flash red or something. Please NO annoying tones.
3,At first I liked it pretty well. For the price the sound is good. It could definitely use a lot more bass. I had a long driving trip and I had it playing for 7 hours and it never said low battery. BUT I got to my brothers and he had bought me a flip 5 speaker and it’s the best speaker I’ve ever had! The sound is amazing. I love it and I’ll be giving this speaker to my daughter lol.
4,I've had several over the years. Most laptop speakers are very weak so you're kinda stuck spending more $$ for acceptable sound pending on one's budget. Looks to be well made overall sound is good (not great) for a basic Bluetooth speaker. Bass response isn't the strongest I've heard either. It was worth the $25 when I bought last June. Not worth the $35 they want now IMO...
5,Works great! I've had it about 6 months and it works great! Very powerful compared to how small it is.
5,Stereo  sound is good only not loud enough
4,Buy It
4,Update on previous one star review: I returned the first one for reasons listed below the update. I did not contact customer service as I didn't want to mess with it. I received an email from customer service saying that they were terribly sorry for the inconvenience and they were sending me a new one free of charge. Wow!! very impressive!! Second one has worked great and I feel very fortunate for their initiative and great customer care.First Review: I so wanted to make this work. Charged for 12 hours before operating and followed all the directions to a T. I was connected to the device via bluetooth from my phone. My phone was within 12 inches from the device at all times. It would only play a partial song and then skip to another. I tried many different things to get it to stick to a play list but it just couldn't finish a song to save it's life. Sound quality is great but the bottom line is it's defective.
2,I have had this speaker for 10 months now. The sound quality is good for the price pleasantly surprised there. The battery life is average and the size is very convenient. The problem is the bluetooth connectivity.My last speak was simple; you turn it on (it doesn't make a sound) it connects (without making a sound) it stays connected until you turned it off or disconnected it yourself.The DOSS Soundbox for some reason will disconnect from a device if no music or sound is being played for a certain amount of time. When it is connected to my phone and I hit pause on the music I have about 3 minutes before the speaker disconnects from my phone then about 4 minutes until it turns off by itself. However when it is connected to my laptop I have about 10 seconds before it disconnects after the sound is paused. This is extremely frustrating. I can't think of any reason why this would be a beneficial feature in a speaker.Also the noise it makes when it connects to a device is loud and quite annoying. I'm not sure if there is some way to turn that off however. Speaking of annoying sounds you know that Emergency Broadcasting sound that plays on the TV once in a while? When this speaker is low on battery it will cut the music and make that sound for about 2-3 seconds and then play the music again. It will do this every like 30 seconds until you plug it in.Overall I really miss my last speaker. The Doss Soundbox is definitely a budget speaker. Good performance frustrating technology.
4,So far I am quite happy with this speaker. I previously had a Tribit X which was fine as far as sound went but it would lose Bluetooth connectivity and beep whenever it did so sometimes in the middle of the night if I had forgotten to turn it off. (Apparently its auto power off only works if the PC has Bluetooth disabled). This speaker has a comparable sound quality quite adequate for me though a bit tinny at loud volume. Two features make this an absolute keeper for me: it powers off even when Bluetooth is on and the beeps (power on connected and power off) can be disabled by a firmware upgrade (which requires a micro SD card and a adapter for about $7.00).  Very pleased so far. One star off because I find the controls a bit confusing. Really 4.5 stars.
5,Use this speaker every day! Have had for almost two years. Good sound quality and battery life. Will hear a beeping noise to indicate battery is low and time to charge. Would recommend to buy.
4,Good little speaker. I just wanted something to boost the sound of music from my phone while out in the yard. I'm not sure of all the bells and whistles and how the other features really work. The instructions are so small you need a magnifying glass to read.
4,Bought this on prime day. Took this on vacation with us. Pretty good speaker. I mean it’s no rave but it gets the job done. Actually better this way because no one wants to be on vacation near someone who is having a rave especially if you don’t like their music.
5,No issues sound quality is great battery life is good (my bf will blast music all day) and it can turn up pretty loud too.
4,I love the sound quality of this speaker! It's the perfect size has a great battery life (although once it gets to 20% battery it beeps angrily every thirty seconds until you charge it). However I believe mine is haunted. It just randomly turned on in the middle of the night (just as I was about to get in bed) and did it's little jingle saying it was connected to my phone. The speaker was upstairs and I hadn't turned it on all day. I tried to turn it off and it turned itself back on. Repeatedly. Needless to say the speaker is spending its nights locked in a small box in a closet until I can get a priest to perform an exorcism.
5,I’m so happy with this speaker!  I use it to listen to music from my iphone and bluetooth connectivity is very simple.  The sound is rich and easily fills my small living room.  Unbelievably nice for the price point.
5,The tone is sharp and clear.  Very easy to connect to my tablet.  I would buy again in a heart beat.  Please buy!  It's worth the money and I am picky.
3,UPDATE: BOTH SPEAKERS NOW AUTOMATICALLY TURN THEMSELVES ON WITHOUT PROMPT NONSTOP.  I'm extremely let down by this speaker. Every review I happened to read had nothing but glowing praise. I understand there is always that chance in getting a faulty unit but two faulty units shipped to my home within the same week of purchasing both really stings. Otherwise the first unit was great for the 2 weeks it worked while the other malfunctioned within a day.So I bought two of these and the first is working great! The second one I bought worked for a couple days before it started having issues stated as followed:- Turning on and off by itself-- this has happened during the night with a sleeping toddler within earshot! This is a problem only because it makes an audible power-on and power-off jingle.- When turned off the lights on the top of the unit flicker until it just turns itself back on.- Bluetooth connectivity is rather poor with the sound cutting in and out and sounding fuzzy. I have nothing that would disrupt the signal as I am always within several feet of the unit unmoving.Out of the box it saw a full charge and I found myself using the provided AUX cord with it more than the Bluetooth just for reliability purposes. Defective unit?Otherwise I enjoyed the product when it properly functioned. Now it has ceased to work properly even w/ direct connectivity between the multiple units I tried with it.
5,I bought this bluetooth speaker for my father and he loves it.It's very easy to setup. It took less than 2 minutes to connect it to his phone. I don't even need to assist my father connecting.Sound is very clear throughout its volume levels and bass is very much there.Its volume levels are very good for a speaker of this size. You can easily keep a good grip on it and it isn't strenuous in any way so when you need to take it anywhere it's easy to grab it.Volume control with the ring is pretty good it's very responsive. You don't necessarily have to push down and drag on the ring. Buttons are very responsive as well. Although the power button is a bit hard to feel where it is in the back since it is pretty small thin and recessed but after a few uses you get used to it.Connectivity is pretty good as well. You can take the speaker to 40 feet without any problems.Battery is very good as well. Used it for 4 hours straight and it works. And charging is pretty quick. When we first got it it took around 1 hour and a half for a full charge. Again when we first got it.
5,First thing I want to make clear is that this little guy has BIG SOUND! I was surprised at how well it handled at max volume and then adjusting the volume on my phone.  It was plenty loud enough to be background noise at a BBQ or outdoor function.  I like toe color scheme I like the very few moving parts even the British guy who talks to you when you turn it on is friendly.  Even though it was a little smaller than I thought it is much heavier than I imagined.  I thought it would be made from cheap plastic and materials but surprisingly it feels sturdy.Connecting it to my phone was as easy as you could hope.  Turn speaker to bluetooth mode search for it with your phone and celebrate!Legitimately the only gripe I can possibly find is that the indicator light for charging is located beneath the charge cable when it is plugged it so it is hard to see if it is charging or complete.The speaker can be played while plugged in and charging which is great if it happens to die and power is near!  The aux-in is convenient for non-BT capable devices.I would recommend and buy again for anyone not wanting a top tier BT speaker but a good one for the price!
4,It’s a good speaker. The bass is a little low for my liking but still decent. I’d say this is a great midrange speaker but spend the extra buck if you have it on a better brand
2,The overall sound quality of this item is fine just not for what I intended. I work in loudish warehouse where you can watch movies while running your machine. (Not metal work not nearly that loud.) If I was just listening to music it'd be fine but speech is much quieter. I'm keeping it for home use but I'm slightly disappointed.Update February 2022: I've become less happy with the product over time I rarely use it. Mostly because the touch controls are terrible so very bad. To further my disappointment the speech quality is also sub par. It's not good for movies or videos I'll have it all the way up and question what was said. Music is loudish and bassy but this doesn't have much else going for it.Update March 2022:The more I use this the more I don't like it. It's alright for a shower concert but barely tolerable because the base is so loud and you can't adjust it. Don't get me wrong I like some oomph but one of my favorite songs has a little spoken part at the end and you can't hear it at all. You will only enjoy this speaker if you exclusively listen to non vocal bassy edm.
5,I love this little speaker! It's cute and the sound is great. It was easy to set up and the battery life is amazing.  The music played all day while I was cooking for Christmas and it made me feel closer to family.
5,The sound was pretty good for the price and size
4,Wow I was super surprised how good this little speaker is. It's not quite as crisp as I would like BUT it's good and worth every penny. Bluetooth paired perfectly.One small warning don't place it too close to a game system like PS4/Xbox it seems to interfere with the wifi reception of those devices.
3,I have had this only for three years and the battery is shot. Keeps making a sound like it is connecting to a device when already connected will not charge and would not stop making the noise until it now will not turn on at all. Dead. This makes it a bad product. Should last more than three years. I loved the speaker until then
5,This is the perfect portable Bluetooth speaker. It’s just the right size. It was easy to pair. It has great sound. It can be used anywhere! I would highly recommend it.
5,Great sound match all expectations!
3,My phone sounds better. Slight buzzing sound when volume is more than half. Less than half sounds good.  Bluetooth works great and is fluid to connect to my devices! So far the battery life is good!
3,Bought this unit July of 2021. For some reason it stopped working March 2022. Called customer service and they tried to help me to fix it but nothing worked. They went and sent me a new one . Thanks
5,Speaker rocks! Using it w/ my Samsung Galaxy Note 8 & Microsoft Surface Book (latter= tablet/PC laptop hybrid) both of which have Bluetooth 4.0/HD sound capabilities which work very well with this speaker...For ex I regularly pair both devices w/ the speaker at the same time to play media from my laptop while using it for calls on my phone (no complaints about the mic so far from callers) + also any spatial sound settings/HD-EQ options/audio upscaling settings/Virtual Surround Capabilities/etc. on my Surface Book (Win10) and/or my Galaxy Note 8 Phone (Android Nougat) operate extremely well with this speaker- the improvement in sound quality is immense utilizing 1 or more of those HD audio options with it.  Unlike most this size this is a stereo- not mono- speaker so there are 2 high-quality 12W output drivers which crank out pitch-perfect highs & deep bass with great clarity at surprisingly high volumes considering it's a speaker with relatively small dimensions- all enabling the rich HD sound output I've been loving since I got it.  Capacitive touch interface is fun/easy to use battery life meets or exceeds the advertised 12 HR'a at 75% volume & it has a card reader as well as a line-in jack in the rear to provide more audio playback options.  Highly Recommended!
3,This worked perfectly for us for a little over a year so a good while - great sound wonderful battery life easy set up.Then one night in the middle of the night it just started turning on and off by itself nonstop. It wouldn't connect wouldn't stay off wouldn't stay on just the annoying on/off tone ringing for hours until the battery died. The company sent a firmware update but that didn't work. And of course it was just past warranty.For the price it was still okay but I would rather have a speaker that lasts more than a year!
3,Nice looking sounds pretty good but you have to hold the button a looooong time to turn it on and off.
5,The sound is great and louder than thought it would be capable of. No distortion for such a small unit. Perfect for my teen
3,Used very little (only because we have several speakers). Great sound cute bought the case and that’s where it lives. Has just started turning itself on and looking to pair. Unable to turn it off with button.
5,I'm just about to hit the 70's age mark and am no longer sure whether my phone is whispering or it's my ears.This little darlin' makes that unimportant.Is it hard to set up Blue Tooth connection? Believe me when I say if i can do it you can and it took maybe 3 minutes.Full volume is way too loud. Sound is full and rich.The speaker itself seems sturdy and well made.One gripe - WHY the teeny-weeny instructions? Hmmm ... wonder if they make an electronic magnifying glass?I gave battery life a three only because I just received it today and have no clue.
5,This thing has some sound!!  I absolutely love it.  I can carry it wherever I want too.  Would definitely recommend and buy again!
5,Very Good speaker for listening to music within the house
4,Sound quality is ok not nearly as good as our Fender speaker but it’ll do. If you want good or great sound keep looking. Connectivity is easy battery life is real good. Small speaker can go anywhere without noticing it.
5,So easy to bring with anywhere I go.
5,Sound is very good for the price. Exactly fits my needs.Didn't even try the bluetooth since I was interested in the SD card option.Had to send an email to DOSS to get a firmware which support shuffle when listening to music.Was super easy to perform the upgrade.Great support received.I use it in the kitchen to listen to music while cooking.
4,used it for music watching movies.  pros: sound is reasonably good quality with decent volume.  cons:  controls are not all intuitive (to disconnect speaker from bluetooth hold the pause/play button x3 seconds: who knew?) the USB charging port failed and can no longer charge the device.  Tried to take it apart and it isn't worth trying to fix.
4,Battery life is super great good sound. Needs more bass to fill out the sound.
4,I use this speaker for mostly for talk shows/podcasts and it works well. For music it's OK but the volume/bass is on the weak side. I'm impressed that it works well about 50 feet outside my house with my phone inside near the window.
4,Connectivity is spot on. Never fails. How is next to my phone within 5 seconds after I hit the power button. Works excellent with IPhone 6 and Samsung S7 Edge. The battery lasts forever I use it a lot and I swear I charge it once a month. I use it around the house and sometimes I bring it to work on construction sites. It is heavy and well built. Sound quality is awesome. It is plenty loud enough outside on the porch and heard throughout the backyard. Live in a quiet neighborhood and when I’m changing my oil in my truck I forget how loud it is sometimes. I’m sure not everyone likes to listen to Ozzy Osbourne in the distance on a Sunday morning. Not that this is an issue for me because I leave my phone pretty close to it but if you walk away with your cell phone in your pocket maybe 20/30 feet it starts to cut out. Pretty short in Bluetooth theory.
5,I recently purchased this for use in the fitness class I teach. The sound is great- it connects with no issues and is loud enough to hear. You can control the volume via your phone or the speaker itself- I prefer my phone but to each his own.I did however have a random issue last week. While sleeping in my bedroom the speaker- which has been OFF and in the kitchen randomly turned on and connected to my phone which was playing my sleepscapes. I disconnected it and then it kept happening. The speaker itself was constantly pairing and unpairing but I could not get the speaker to turn off. Once I finally got up in the morning I did all the troubleshooting to no resolve. So I emailed customer service because it was out of the Amazon return window. They got back to me surprisingly quickly and no questions asked offered to send a replacement due to their factory warranty. I received my new one quickly and am very happy! No- I was not asked to write this review.
2,I had to come back and write an updated review. This speaker has more cons than pros...here goes....Pros:1.) Small2.) Affordable3.) Blue Tooth works with one device at a time but it works4.) Vocals are clear (nothing else is)Cons:1.) Are there suppose to be instruments in music? Because if there are I can't hear them! I played Enya and Lareena Mckennit and could not hear the music at all. The voice was crystal clear...but not the instruments. They were almost inaudible.2.) The bass is horrible. For people who are writing that it has good bass...stop lying. I'm pretty sure they got paid to write those reviews. I played some pop music and the bass was legible but static like and not overly audible. I played middle eastern music and couldn't hear the core rhythms AT ALL! That is when I had to come and change my review to reflect the whole experience of what is happening with this speaker. It plays legible but not good pop songs. It plays inaudible softer music and middle eastern music....basically anything with multiple instruments that are integral to the song. (pop is recognizable my vocals alone).3.) THERE IS NO WAY TO INCREASE THE VOLUME! are you kidding me? This was okay when I was using my phone as it has a higher threshold. When I connected my iPod I couldn't turn it up past a whisper! So I've had it with this thing. It really isn't worth any money at all if you can't even hear the instruments playing let alone trying to increase the volume on any other device besides a phone.
3,Very good as a portable speaker.  The sound quality is amazing for a small package.  Plenty of power and volume even for an outdoor space.  The control buttons and volume dial on the unit itself are very handy.  Works best when the source is connected directly with aux cable.Bluetooth connectivity is fair at best.  Picks up significant amounts of interference and is very dependent on time of day and how many people and electronic devices are in the house at the time.  This item was purchased for listening to music in the kitchen from the computer in the adjacent room.  The speaker has not been more than 10 feet away from the source at any time and most often within 4 feet.  Seems to work best during the day when only one person is at home.  Late afternoon when family members arrive home from work and school (and bring their cell phones with them) is when the Bluetooth begins to fail.  Signal is interrupted when someone walks through the room a cell phone receives a text anywhere in the house and for any number of undetermined reasons.  If you aren't bothered by listening to a radio station that is half out-of-tune or having a cell phone conversation with someone driving through a tunnel then this won't be an issue for you.I have not used this to send or receive phone calls and so cannot comment on that feature.In fairness this is not the first brand or model to have this Bluetooth issue in our home.  All have been from the same price range.  Perhaps it's a "get what you pay for" circumstance but it is still very frustrating to have the sound signal constantly interrupted.  Should work better than it does.
5,For the size it sounds very good.
5,This product was GREAT for the price. I bought it back in 2019 and it's still working in 2021 no problems going strong.I needed a blue tooth speaker for my kitchen so I could multi-task while cooking and cleaning.....Love it!  I have also used it plugged directly into my devices as well.Volume gets loud enough to drown out water running and other tasks I am doing.  Would definitely purchase this again! I use it with my iphone my mac and my windows laptop and works well on all.  Battery Life is great I only charge it about every 3 or 4 days if under heavy use.
4,Love this thing for music. I wanted it to be good for Zoom calls where everyone in my room would be using it as a speakerphone but it doesn't seem to have a great mic for that. Still worth it for the music!
5,I needed a portable speaker with Bluetooth connectivity and a cost that wouldn't break the bank. This little guy delivers.a speaker this small and this inexpensive has no right sounding this good.  Ok maybe I wish it had more bass but it does good enough for me.it does not distort the sound at max volume and when you place it on a surface that's not flat it does not vibrate annoyingly.Battery life is good for a few hours on uninterrupted use I haven't had a chance to run battery empty in one sitting but I guess it will satisfy most people's needs except the most pretentious ones.Bluetooth connectivity is excellent up to 30 feet maybe haven't tried father than that.Aluminum construction makes it feel premium light and solid at the same time.I only have it for a few weeks so I can't vouch for long-term longevity but so far i like what I'm seeing.
3,I have had this since August 2019. For the most part I love it and use it in my office at work. One annoying thing is that it will randomly stop playing music disconnect from my phone and turn off. Sometimes it does it over and over sometimes once or twice sometimes not at all. On average it's once a day.It was super embarrassing when I loaned it to my boss the other day and it shut off multiple times in a 30-minute meeting.
5,Perfect size and love the sound that comes from this little speaker ! You won’t regret buying it😊
4,I loved this speaker! Best purchase 🤩🤩 I use this speaker in my room or kitchen and the sound is great!!
5,I purchased this and all I can say is it ROCKS! I used this thing everyday that I worked. I work out of an enclosed trailer. I would set this this on top of my unit and it would provide excellent quality of sound throughout the workday. I have knocked it dropped it hung it hit it but never slammed it. This thing is tough it took it and kept playing rock until I shut it down. Now I speak of it in past tense because I finally broke the charging port and was unable to charge it. So long little fella you did well.
5,I purchased this speaker in July 2016 and loved it!  My husband....green with envy kept stealing it to use in his work shop. So Feb 8 2017 I surprised him with his very own Doss Wireless Bluetooth Speaker...and he loved it!  A couple of months ago I realized he was stealing my speaker again. So after cross examination it appeared his speaker wouldn't hold a charge and had to be plugged into wall to use. "Why didn't you say something!?" " because there's nothing we can do about it! ". "Au Contraire mon ami!" ( high school French). I went into Amazon and read reviews to see if anyone else has had this problem....not many...but one thing I did notice was if anyone had any problem they contacted the seller and it was immediately taken care of. As one buyer remarked "GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!". I contacted seller explained problem....provided order info and a couple of days later my husband received a brand new Doss Wireless Bluetooth Speaker! No hassle! The rep I spoke to was professional courteous and charming. Great service. Oh yeah and the speakers are truly great!  For the size they give out quality sound and for the price you can't go wrong. We love them and will be repeat customers!
5,I love the “Ligth blue color I selected just right! Easy to connect! following the instructions. I love the  size awesome sound! Light to carry around from one room to next without hassle.
4,Love this little speaker. Sound quality is very good. Not quite what my Sony plug-in was but definitely good especially for the price. The only thing I wish it had was a remote on/off. I have to physically go to the box and turn it on to connect.
5,I try to carefully study all reviews and make a determination with who sounds like they complain about everything they buy and experience vs the ones who get paid to give everything 5 stars.  So with that being said.  If you want a ear popping concert level volume. Keep looking. If you want a good base big sound out of a small box. For jamming outside or on job site I have two of these that I sinc together and I’m more then impressed!!!
5,I love this speaker so much… great sound quality… great price shipped fast nice color and love the upgraded charging port which has been improved and is way more substantial and definitely no longer flimsy like previous models before!!! I love this product!!!
4,I discovered if you sync the speaker to your iPad and then later take it to a different room to use with a different device like your phone you can't do it. you have to disconnect the original device first. Minor annoyance but still an annoyance.
4,This speaker sounds like one of those old mono record players with a built in speaker! Hahaha anyone know what that is?  It's tolerable for my home gym music.  I may take it to the beach or camping too it was relatively inexpensive so no worries if it gets damaged.  And that should sum things up. "Soundbox" is actually a great way to describe it as sounds do in fact come out of this little box!  It connects to bluetooth quickly and stays on for hours.  Overall solid unit nothing special.
5,Well built. Could be louder. Good for desktop use.
5,Love it. No buzzing sound in the background perfect for calm or classical music. Still have to test it for audiobooks.
4,I use this speaker to connect to my iPad or iPhone when I am out. It’s a nice little speaker- good quality sound.  There is a little plastic piece on top of the controls with instructions which is supposed to be removed - but I would forget how to operate the controls if I don’t leave it in place as I don’t use this speaker often.  That is my only complaint.  This info should be on the speaker.  If you use it all the time then it should not be a problem.
5,I love this the sound is great and the volume really rocks!!
5,I like the white color and the soft touch panel. This thing small but make a bigger quality sounds
5,Intelligent switch off mode
2,This speaker connects nicely stays charged a long time and is loud. But the sound quality is not very good. It has no bass at all.
3,I guess I should have known better. It's a cheap speaker so the sound is kinda cheap too. A lot of the reviews I read said the bass is amazing. It is not. The sound is tinny. I've had speakers of a similar size that provide much more bass.Besides that the speaker works. Bluetooth connection works well even at a distance. Battery life is decent. But the sound is just okay.
5,This is an awesome speaker for streaming radio channels.  You could use it for just about anything you want but it is a direct replacement for listening to talk radio in my house.  Paired with my Amazon Echo Dot I simply have to tell alexa to play any radio station and there it is coming out of my DOSS speaker.  Love that it is rechargeable portable and has the play/pause button for momentarily stopping the talk radio stream I'm listening to.  Feels VERY solid in the hand.Biggest worry I had with substituting my real AM/FM radio for internet streaming was the signal coverage of the blue-tooth signal.  Luckily I'm able to take the DOSS box into any room of my 1700 sq/ft ranch house and it never loses the streaming connection from the Echo Dot.  I can take it out on my porch or back patio too; it just keeps on going.  The big win for streaming radio is the wealth of content now available.  No longer restricted to just my local AM/FM stations for content.Audio is excellent.  Talk radio has never sounded better.  Nice and clear with no muffling of the voice.  It isn't overpowered by bass either.What a cool World this opens up!
5,It was a really good product in general. Good battery life good sound and all you can really want out of a portable speaker. Highly recommend
5,I love this bluetooth speaker!  Loud and crisp sound.  You cannot go wrong buying this speaker!
5,This is my second Doss. This time I went Girl Power Pink.. The sound quality is so great that my daughter "borrowed" my first one to use is her fixer up car because her muffler is loud and she hasn't put in a stereo system yet. I hear her music before the muffler. I Bluetooth my Doss to my phone to have hands free working without a headset bluetoothed to my computer to amplify my music when I am cleaning the whole house. The size makes it super ease to throw in my bag and take it with me (not that I am leaving the house any time soon at this point with the way the pandemic is going in WI).  I really enjoy the Doss speaker.
5,Compact. Long battery life let's me play my playlist on my mp3 player with aux cable or use Bluetooth to play Pandora from my phone. Great sound quality. And wasn't super expensive.
5,Is loud great stetics it stays charge for a long time i will definitely  recommend
5,I'm glad I bought this speaker.  It's a great value for the price.  The sound quality is crisp and the volume gets as loud as a boom box.  Also bluetooth connection was simple and quick.  All around good purchase
2,Update November 2021: I lowered my 5 star review to 2 stars. Out of the five unites that were purchased in 2019 now in less than 3 years after purchase three of the five unit have failed all in the same fashion.Therefore while I like the looks and the features I can no longer recommend this product due to reliability issues.All three failed units have exhibited the endless reboot loop syndrome. The charged device will randomly power on into bluetooth pairing mode (the devices were never paired) and then after the bluetooth inactivity timeout will power down. This sequence loops endlessly until the battery is exhausted. It happens even when the device is being used frequently.Nearly a year ago I purchased 5 units of the Soundbox Touch speakers to use in a whole home system.Unfortunately a few weeks ago one of the speakers began to fail by going into an endless reboot loop.I contacted DOSS by email sent them my proof of purchase and a video of what the unit was doing and they promptly sent me a brand new unit.I really appreciate a manufacturer that stands behind their products without hassle and I'm also pleased that they still have the exact same model available.Nobody likes when things break but I will definitely recommend DOSS products because of the way they provided support.I'll echo others comments about the usability. The sound quality is great especially for this price range. I am primarily using them via the line-in which works well. On one we also use the TF card and the on-top touch controls are intuitive and easy to navigate. Sure wish it would power up with the last input selected rather than always defaulting to bluetooth but that is a minor complaint.
5,Nice speaker for the price! Gave it as a gift.
5,I would probably give this 4 and a half stars but I'm going to give it 5 since I can't do halves.I am not some young party-throwing person so for what I use this for it's great! The price is the best part about it. The biggest complaint I have is that I don't know when it needs to be charged so I just keep charging it every several uses. It has a little light on the back that tells you that it's charging which is nice. I've used this outside while I'm working on stuff in the bathroom while showering/getting ready in the bedroom for background music and in the kitchen while cleaning/cooking. I love how lightweight and portable it is. I have no trouble connecting to my phone but I have experienced some static a couple times. I don't know if that means it needs charged or I'm putting my phone too far away. It's such a rare occurrence it's not really that big of a deal to me. Again I don't use it for large parties/groups of people. The most people in the house since I've used it is 4. It's nice background music if you're chatting/playing games. I would definitely purchase again.
4,** upstate**  going on 3 yrs this thing is pretty darn good .  We have some jbp flips and this is close in sound.  I'd say the jbls handle the bass better.  The jbls also have the ups on this one for low volume sounds.  W this speaker the louder the better. But all in all .... Solid.I use this to connect /pair with an echo dot. I am pleasantly surprised w this speaker.  The battery life is quite good.  Sound is decent like gets better if you crank it.  For a small speaker it gets fairly loud. Don't expect sub type bass with this thing but you can certainly hear the bass on it.  I like the ability to skip a track on it from.the unit itself and controlling the volume on the unit via the dial.  It can be a pain to turn it off.  U need to hold a button on the back.  Otherwise...great speaker for the price.
5,This product gives great sound as well as great battery life. This is the best speaker for the best price.
2,Beyond sad . I bought this blue tooth does not work ever !!! What’s the point . I could have gotten a 10$ speaker if I wanted to listen to my music with a cord !!!
2,I had 3 of these speakers. 2 of them started beeping indicating a low battery. Since I'd had them a few years I decided the batteries had gone bad and replaced them. I bought 2. I have only started using one of them so far. Within 2 days it has also started beeping. It is brand new! I only plugged it in while it was in use. I really did like these little speakers but am very disappointed in them now. I'll find some other brand.Sad. I'll have to return them.
4,I bought this speaker to use mainly when we are outside but we use it inside also.  It uses an ox cable so it does not connect physically to a newer iPhone because they don't have an ox cable.  And we have had some BlueTooth issues with a newer iPhone but it may be operator error.  I haven't had time to look into it yet.  However for my older iPhone it works great.  The sound is pretty good and goes loud enough for what we need.  It stays charged for a quite a long time but then I try to keep everything pretty charged up.
5,It is a great little speaker! Sounds great. Connects easily.
3,It seems fine for music but for listening to books the sound quality is poor.It drops the first part of words mostly after a pause especially at the beginning of sentences.
5,Love the color and they produce beautiful sound! I use these outside and they are perfect.
4,Like the speakers in general.  Takes some getting used to the volume control (requires a circular motion of the finger either clockwise or counter-clockwise).  A little disappointed in the bass but acceptable for the price.
4,Battery life is a little on the short side. And I can’t get the pause mode to work....I just have learned to turn it off altogether to converse then turn it back on. It works that way just not as easily as intended. It really helps my mom who is hearing impaired even with aids hear better. If they made a product that helped the clarity not just the sound that would be perfect for her. Overall we use it all the time and it’s the best setup we’ve tried yet.
5,Powerful and cute ^_^
5,Was looking for a way to play tunes while working in my workshop.  I did not want to use headphones as hearing the sounds of my hand and power tools is an essential part of my woodworking quality and safety. I did a lot of online research before purchasing this item.I have had this little unit for almost a year now and am totally pleased. I find a charge lasts me for 3-4 days of working in my woodworking shop (average 3 hours a day). Every 2-3 days I bring it in the house when done working and hook it up to the charger. It's ready to go the next morning. On my iPhone I have 200 of my favorite tunes in iTunes and also  the apps for streaming my favorite jazz and classical stations. The DOSS player connects instantly to my phone and I have great music while I work.  The volume is more than adequate for my 25x25 ft high ceiling shop and the tone quality is quite remarkable for such a small unit which I just put on a shelf in the corner of my shop.  And with the low price this is a great value.Highly recommended.
4,I really enjoy using this item. It is very compact and easy to operate. The only aspects that I'm not too fond of are the volume control and the noise it makes when it turned to on. I also purchased a protective case so I could transport it and still keep it looking new as well as have its stay clean when I'm not using it. I am looking forward to taking it outside when I go for nature walks all I stopped for a lunch break.
5,Disclaimer: I've only just started using it. But I LOVE this thing. I am so impressed with the quality considering it is certainly not very expensive.Pairing via bluetooth with a MotoZ (phone) to play music was as easy as can be. I plugged the speaker in right out of the box & since it's plugged in it could be used right away. Can't yet comment on extended battery life but since I'll generally be using it in-home that's not an important factor for me.I will definitely edit my review as I use it more for different purposes/situations. But I could not wait to leave a stellar review!
4,Have had one for almost a year and am very happy with it and the seller. Bought two more for a relative who really liked mine. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that I have heard speakers with better fidelity but they cost quite a bit more. Don't know about battery life because it is usually plugged in and when on battery we don't leave it there very long.
5,I like this little speaker. It sounds great and the color is perfect on my desk. Love it! I'm ordering another (purple) one for my room.
5,No volume control is the only thing I don't like about it.
4,This little guy has some power! I was surprised how loud and bass booming it was!  Its small and easy to use. I carry from room to room without any issues. Get it.
5,I bought this specifically to take to the beach.  I needed a small transportable speaker that could be easily heard over the sound of the waves.  This did the trick.  It definitely gets loud enough and the sound is not distorted. Some of us are in my sun shelter some of us are outside of it.  We all could hear it.  I ran it about 7 hours over 2 days and the battery was still OK.  Going back in a month to use it again.
4,Very good speaker connects blootooth superfast sound is good. But the bass is not enough.
5,Love this unit. It paired with my iPhone in seconds and I was able to play music in no time. Tried Pandora stand works great. Tried and played songs from m iTunes and no problem. Last thing and here I had little trouble was with the TF card (old name for micro SD card). Not sure why they are calling it TF which was the old original name for micro SD. Secondly the card would not sit properly inside the slot or would not work. Tried sliding the card upside down and magic - it worked and the sound is better from my own MP3s. Not sure why they would want you to slide this micro SF card upside down in the slot. That and no instructions to do so and the TF naming is the only cons I have with the unit. I am still giving it 5 stars since the music sound quality inside the room (360) is extraordinary. When the phone rings the music stops automatically and or any calls coming in are routed through the device and you have the option on your phone to switch to handset. I will buy another one for our office. Oh having bought the box at 60% off and great lots of reviews helped me make the decision to buy it.
5,Super impressed with this little speaker especially for under 30 dollars! Packaging was nice and sleek. Pulling out the speaker it feels of great quality and has a nice slick design (sturdy and solid and not too heavy) the button lights and LED are also very bright.It was super easy to connect to both my iPhone & iPad (just have to be sure you disconnect it from one before you can sync it and use it with another device).  The sound dial works AMAZING and the quality of sound you get I'd say is just as good as any BOSE/JBL/major Headphone/Speaker - so for the price you pay you'll be happy with this buy.It's seriously one of the best products I've gotten on Amazon.  Great job DOSS!
5,Pro: it does carry a nice amount of soundCon: Not enough bass for me.... 🥴
5,I mean to tell you this thing can blow sound out into my entire living room and threw most of my 1200 square foot duplex. I bought it because I needed something for my Beyonce who is hard of hearing and does not have hearing aids yet. This way we can both watch something on the computer or listen to a book and I can can listen to it at the level of movie theater sound. Then he can enjoy being able to hear louder than the computer which is what he needs. So we just enjoy books and shows together! The best speaker I have ever had regardless of the money. The sound is fine and not tinny even when the sound level goes high I am totally happy. It is so much better than I expected. Just buy it!!
5,For the money it’s not bad. Ok sound and pretty good volume!! I’d buy it again.
2,Bought this speaker mainly for being able to use SD card. 90% of the time it has trouble playing from SD card. It never start from the song it left off and starts over. I would refund it but my window for refund is closed.
4,I'm not sure I can agree with some of the reviews that are posted.  The sound quality is pretty good for its price but as for maxing out the volume or increasing the bass....I don't recommend doing that.  Unless I got one that's somewhat defective The Bass distorts when raised too high but so dose the song itself when the volume is too high. It has a good feel and weight to it. The battery life is great.  Would I buy it again???...I probably would.  I've seen some B/T speakers that are very expensive with a much worse sound quality so this is a decent buy.
4,It connects well. Plays loud. Good buy for the money.
5,I reach past the Bose Revolve for this speaker.Sounds great. Connects easily. This is the second one I've had. I dropped the first one while charging repeatedly and messed up the charging port but it was still hanging in there.
3,I bought this speaker as I have had two JBL speakers with the micro usb go out on me.  Since they were past warranty dates I didn’t want to spend 80+ dollars for a speaker that stopped working in 2 years.  The speaker isn’t bad it has great functionality and I love that it allows a micro sd card to place if you still have songs on cards.  It has auxiliary jack to direct port your phone or mp3 to the speaker box.If you are looking for sound like JBL or UE boom puts out this just isn't it.  Bass is almost non existent and it doesn’t get very loud  at 100% my family and I could have a conversation without it bothering us.  For a portable speaker Ill look elsewhere but if you’re using it for low sound or nature sounds like I do at night it works perfectly for that.
4,For $27 this speaker offers great value. The quality of the speaker honestly surprised me - fit finish and feel suggest a much higher price point. The only weak point is the sound quality which is good but not great. Music can sound a bit flat if you are looking for a solely auditory experience. However for a speaker that you can take anywhere and casually listen to it hits the mark.High points include:- bluetooth connectivity which has been very robust for me- speaker phone functionality which has had very good sound quality on both ends- good battery life- versatility with SD card and bluetooth
5,I love this speaker.  I can listen to it inside and outside and hear all my music clearly.  I like the bonus of being able to answer my cellphone on the speaker too!!
5,...but occasionally you get more than you paid for! The sound quality is nice enough for the price. If you’re a hardcore audiophile you’re likely looking for something else- if you’re looking for a good speaker with incredible battery life then look no further! As I write this review some months after purchase the device is STILL functioning on its initial charge! Admittedly I do not use it daily- but I’m amazed every time it comes on again. How long will it last?! Bluetooth works fine and the ability to add a memory card is awesome. I purchased a second one after filling a card up with music to give as a gift. They loved it. Like a modern day mix tape!
5,Listening to music in the garage
5,i put hella cute sanrio stickers all over this little magical music box and i’ve never beeen so in love with something as much i am with this purchase 😊
5,Fast and easy shipping. I used this for an online program my 94 year old papa wanted to listen to. The bluetooth was easy and battery life was as long as the program...6 hours.
5,Easy to handle great sound
4,We bought this speaker to give a volume boost to our overly-quiet laptop. We set it up plugged in with the included 3.5mm cord and were floored by the depth of sound compared to our laptop speakers. Suddenly you could hear the whole orchestra! And they are as loud as we needed them to be.We were disappointed when we tried to use the Bluetooth connection though. The speaker looses connection only one room over and even when your phone and the speaker are in the same room there are frequent playback gaps. We’ve given up in the Bluetooth and use it solely as a plugged in speaker. But for the price we are mostly happy with it.
5,Simply put…THIS BOX ROCKS!Legit buyer. I’ve recommended this speaker to every one of my friends and family I even feel the need to buy a second one :)You will not regret your purchase. Playing on a semi wide flat surface is best. Has huge bass response for such a small footprint simply love this speaker!!
5,I've owned this product for over a year now. It has held up after being thrown in sand at the beach its survived water getting inside of it after sitting on an open windowsill during a thunderstorm and has endured several drops. The sound quality for its small size is impeccable and it gets very loud. The Bluetooth connectivity is quick and easy and it'll pick up your signal from way farther than expected. Now the battery life... my god does this thing have amazing battery life. I use this thing every day and I charge it maybe once a month. My only issue with this speaker as several other people have stated is the low battery beep that will go off every maybe fifteen seconds or so when you're at low charge. Other than that this is an amazing speaker at an amazing price. If you want something cheap but with high quality this is your best bet.
5,I don't often write reviews the day I receive something but this little guy deserves it. I've had to temporarily relocate my home computing tech to the dining room for the next few months and didn't have a convenient way to setup my (inexpensive) external speakers for background music. I bought this small BT speaker as a portable option and I doubt I'll go back to a wired setup. Even at 50% volume it's more than loud enough for the room. I could see this being great for outdoor entertainment. Obviously I would not argue this is the quality of a $100 speaker but it sure is impressive for the price.
5,Love this product!  Battery life is wonderful and more than expected! Easy to operate!
5,Sound is loud enough doesn't get distorted when in max volume. Connects easily to phone and battery lasts. Only thing is it takes forever to fully charge.
3,The charge port has a short in it so in order to charge it now after a year and 11 months I have to pull the cord tight under the speaker. Still works though.
5,Aunque el sonido no es tan potente es limpio y se conecta rápidamente. En verdad la batería dura varias horas. El diseño es bonito y muy fácil de usar
5,UDATE: 01/05/2020I am increasing this to five stars.  This speaker is still going strong and sounds good.  I try to be extra careful when moving it not to touch the a soft touch controls.I am giving this four stars now but may give it five after using it a while. Many reviewers say the volume isn't very loud but after turning up the volume on my cell phone the volume is really loud. The bass is much better than I expected.  I am not sure if I like the soft touch controls.  It is way too easy to change something by mistake.  I also wish there was a voice telling you that it was paired instead of the tones. (I know that's a minor thing).
3,Things I hate: The chime when it connects to bluetooth is so unnecessarily loud. Every once in a while only when I’m listening to podcasts and someone is speaking (I don’t know if it’s an issue with the bluetooth connectivity or what) but it cuts out a word or two when someone begins to talk almost like it’s trying to catch up and it just keeps doing that so you miss out on words super annoying. It’s never happened with music though. I usually disconnect and start it back up. If that doesn’t fix it then I just aux my phone in and that always takes away the issue.Things I like: The battery lasts a long time and I love carrying it from room to room as I want. It’s easy to use and was pretty cheap. The sound is great for the price and quality of the speaker. All in all I don’t hate it enough to invest in a new speaker. I would just change those two things I initially listed.
5,I was very impressed with the sound qualityI got more than I expected for the priceI got my two sons speakers for Christmas.It’s way better than my expensive speaker that I haveDefinitely recommend purchasing it
5,Got this so we could listen to some music on the patio.  I just set up an out door projection to watch movies I was originally using a sound bar to connect it but it was a pain was big and clunky and had to plug it into an outlet.  I love this thing the battery last a long time and all i need is an aux cord to plug it.  Its tiny but has a lot of sound.  Would and did buy again.  I have 2 of these now.  one for home and one for work
5,I bought this “music box” for my 60+ year old mom and she loves it. It’s easy to use.
1,I bought this a few months back for my office. it works fine. dont need it to be loud. Because im at work. However last week it just started sending a busy tone. Like on your phone. I didnt pay it any mind at first but it does it every few mins. Its very annoying. So I googled the issue. apparently alot of people are having the same issue. The answer was to replace the lithium rechargeable battery. NAH! Im not doing all of that. I shouldn't have went cheap in the first place.Trash! I dont usually write bad reviews but I had to on this one. Thing thing still new and its trash.
3,Sound quality is pretty good. Do not like the volume control - at all!! Would’ve preferred + & - (oh well lesson learned) would not purchase again. I want sound control with some precision.
5,Bought this for my macbook pro which has awful built in speakers. It connects easily via bluetooth but you can also use the provided cable to connect the speakers using earphone jack.The sound is amazingly good and I change it once every few days. Honestly I don't know what is the battery life of this since I have not used it till it was totally drained. One feature that saves the battery is that is auto shuts off when you are not using it.The controls are really nice you have the volume control with a circular touch control and the forward and back automatically controls web apps like spotify.For the price this is definitely worth it.
5,I have the Amazon bluetooth speaker that I've misplaced so I ordered the DOSS to replace it. At the time I bought the Amazon speaker I looked at the more expensive ones: Bose JBL etc and there were some less than satisfactory reviews. The reviews for the Amazon speaker were pretty good and for $20 it was worth a try. It's okay not terrific but for the price can't beat it. So I was going to buy it again but the price jumped to $28 from $20 so I shopped around. I found the Doss for $25. The sound quality and volume capability are way better. It paired immediately. It's heavier in weight which means the speakers have bigger magnets. The function buttons are very friendly. Totally happy with this
5,For the size and price this thing sounds fantastic. I'm comparing this to the 'Cambridge sound works Oontz' unit. This sounds much better. The bass response is clear and deep and the midrange & treble is clear and rich without being overpowering. Nothing hurts your ears. The build quality is also great with a hefty metal body. Even when this device is pumping out music it doesn't vibrate or rattle around. My only minor complaint would be the interface: the volume 'dial' is touch sensitive and is a bit too small to rotate your fingertip inside of it. I could make a joke there buy I'm far too classy. Regardless it works just fine and you will get used to it. Also and I'm not sure if other devices are this way but if you use AUX mode (my default) you can't skip songs using this device's 'next/previous' buttons. Not a big issue as you can control this function with your phone. I haven't used the micro SD/ TFF card function (as most of you won't) but I assume it works just fine assuming you have the songs in the order you want them in without placing the files in multiple folders. In short: this thing sounds remarkably good and I suggest you buy it.
5,Wow. It's got great even sound quality.Doesn't sound tinny or muffled at all.This is not however a loud party speaker in the least. The only reason I bought it is because I stopped using headphones to save my hearing at 50 years old so I've been using my phone's speaker which really just isn't adequate at all. This speaker is wonderful for me now. I can hear my prime videos clearly it does have bass as well for my music collection.Bluetooth was super easy but give your phone a few seconds to find the device. Don't freak out after three seconds of turning on your bluetooth. I have a cheap $30 alcatel android running the latest software and my little disposable phone runs and sounds just fine with this speaker's bluetooth.So in closing I would say don't buy this to entertain a party with music but for your bedroom side table it will get plenty loud and full sounding for you no problem.I am very happy with it!
5,I bought this almost 2 years ago and its the best portable speaker ive ever heard. Absolutely no issues with anything and the bass and sound quality are amazing. Its so loud. The bass is so strong that it actually fell off of my counter into the kitchen sink into a full bowl of water. And thats what prompted me to write this. IT STILL FRICKING WORKS. fully submerged while on and playing and nothing happened to it! I didnt even try and put it in rice or anything. I dried the outside and let the water drip out of the inside then let it air dry over night and its fine. Best money spent
4,This speaker definitely gets the job done! Great sound and last a very long time! Only thing I don't like is the low battery noise... Sounds like a busy signal. Feel like there are hundreds of other options than that sound! But other than that I love it!!
3,I bought this speaker exclusively for my projector. This was to replace the one that I just bought of a different brand that did not have aux cord capabilities. To my surprise it is just as loud as the projector speakers 😑. If you intend to use this with Bluetooth it's great and super loud. Unfortunately using it with the line in is not that loud. This is also true with other devices using the line in. Ultimately I connected the sound of the projector to my phone then connected the speakers via bluetooth. So all in all I could have just used the previous speakers 🤦🏻‍♀️. Now I have two different speakers 🙄 UPDATE: I did find out the speakers can be turned up through the blue circle light which was cool. And I had it on its side the light should be facing up which make a little difference. Still not as loud with Line in though
5,I wanted this Bluetooth to take with me wherever I go and I'm So Glad I got this because the sound is Crystal Clear and the bass makes the sound even better! Thank you
5,This is a godsend!  We use it as a white noise generator to play music for our toddlers to help them go and stay asleep.  I loaded a card with a couple hours of soothing instrumentals native flute music and baby songs and it has been fantastic with keeping the kids asleep and doubles as a night light.This is portable and travels with the kids to Grandma's house where it runs off of battery up to 2 full nights per charge.  If we forget and leave this at home it is a disaster!  Any little sound wakes them up and they stay grumpy the whole trip.I have noticed that the sound skips and stutters occasionally or seems to run slow through parts of a song and will pick up and play normally again shortly after. Thinking this might be a media problem I've skipped forward and back to replay the same song perfectly so must be an issue with the player.  When I hear it doing this it drives me crazy but the kids dont even notice so for the purpose we got it it does the job perfectly.
4,I expected a high end ultra smooth and brilliant control panel but it seems and feels like a cheap one.Sound are very clear even at high volume even so I expected a little bit more strength.And the bass.. (The point that had take many of us to this speaker) yes... You just can stay watching how outsanding is that a little speaker like this can delivery a so clean powerful deep and even low bass sacrificing the general volume though.You just need to think twice to realice this mini speaker is having the bass of a big one.Just try it with some Lo fi or other bass-music genres! In HQ definition if possible.P. D. Put the speaker in a corner of the room it'll boost all that bass.
3,The battery life is good. The sounds quality and volume are less so.
4,The soundbox is of great quality overall for the price. Sound quality is pretty good but it could get a little louder.
5,I love listening to music with these wireless Bluetooth speakers. I connect with my Android phone...very easy connection. I just wish the battery lasted 8 hours
3,Nice speaker with one major flaw.... the placement of the power button on the lower back side of the unit.  It’s a hassle to reach around and try to find it with your fingers unless you turn the unit around.  Kind of amazing that they didn’t place the power button on the top with the other controls or at least some place on the front of the unit.  Real design flaw and makes one wonder what the engineers were thinking. Others have also commented about this in their reviews.One other issue is the Bluetooth connectivity.  It sometimes take a while to connect and at other times connects quite quickly this being with the same device in both instances.As far as sound and the rest it’s a good speaker for the money. Appears to be pretty sturdy and well built.  Hopefully the manufacturer of this products reads these reviews and makes a few design changes in the future to make this a solid 5 star product.
5,Bought this speaker to replace a magic box speaker that finally died.  The controls on this speaker are much better than the magic box.  Sound is not powerful but does the job.
5,Excelente sonido y facilidad de conexión para su precio es un muy buen speaker
5,Used to replace Bose that broke twice (tired of sending it to be fixed). This works great. Much more consistent than my old speaker. I only use it for my TV though don’t know about music sound quality.
3,Really liked this speaker at first.  Great price for the sound quality and battery life.  No issues pairing and had good bluetooth range.  However trying to turn the volume up or down on the speaker was a nightmare.  Rather than just a simple up or down button to press for some reason they thought it would be a good idea to have a circular area where you slide your finger in a circle to go up or down in volume.  It responded very sporadically at best and for the most part just did not respond to my touch meaning the only way for me to change volume was to use my phone.  Wish they would redesign this to something less "fancy" and just give buttons!
5,i recently discovered i can put the sirius raido on my cell phone. as i am out on the deck alot i wanted to be able to listen on the deck with the phone being inside on the charger. so i ordered this bluetooth wireless speaker. was a very good decision. havent had to charge it yet. but i dont listen to it every day either. A+
3,My biggest complaint about these speakers is the mode button on top. The mode button switches inputs to the speakers. However the buttons are too sensitive and any slight touch changes them so I have to cycle through to get back to what I am listening to. This happens constantly when I carry the speakers from room to room or even if I just set my cell phone down on top of it.I would be happy with these if not for that problem. The sound and volume are fine for the price and what I use them for. Battery life is excellent. Bluetooth connection is smooth and the range is better than previous wireless speakers I have gotten. The position and sensitivity of the buttons on top are the biggest drawback.
3,Some people compare this device with Bose SoundLink Mini . Is not the same for one reason.This device cost $29.99  ( + $4  shipping )  DOSS Wireless Bluetooth Handsfree V4.0 Speaker with HD Sound and Bass (Black)         and the Bose Mini $179.  Bose SoundLink Mini Bluetooth Speaker II (Carbon)        There is a HUGE budget difference so don't be stupid to compare apples with pears.I read so many reviews about this product and some people wants caviar at pizza slice priceThe device is pretty good for the price you pay. Good sound compact packet good battery (I've been testing for 2 days so far).It's true the device turns off after 15 min if there is no bluetooth connection active which is good to keep the battery however if you want to keep the device on all the time even when you are not using it you can overwrite this protection using a micro sd card with a different firmware. I sent an email to the manufacturer and he sent me the firmware without the protection and the original one in case i wanted  to go back to the default firmware. I haven't try yet but technically you just need to load the file into the card and insert into the card slot on the back.For the price you pay is a terrific option. And once again if you want the quality of the Bose SoundLink Mini spend $179 not $29.99 and do not expect a Ferrari if your budget is for a Daewoo.UPDATE REVIEWThe audio jack 3.5 mm on the back  is useless it sounds like those old AM Radio.
5,I work outside 10 hr days and volume up half way it has lasted 2 days of work and plenty loud enough to hear. Great Speaker would highly recommend it.
5,Bought this thing for my little 14’ boat so I didn’t want some nice expensive speaker cause I know it’s going to get destroyed. This thing blew every expectation out of the water! I can jam out to my Mötley crüe even with a 1974 15hp evinrude screaming on the back of my boat. 10/10 would recommend
5,Easy to setup I use it for work.
5,This little bluetooth speaker has a great battery life! I also like the smooth controls for volume and song selection. I have RA and actually pushing buttons can be difficult at times.
5,Excellent sound!! Couldn’t be happier with this product. We mostly use it on our patio which we live on most of the day when we’re not busy. My sister bought three!!
5,I have two of these one at home and one at work. Received the first as a gift. Good sound and the battery charge is long lasting. Buying a third as a Christmas gift in their favorite color. Great speaker for the price.
5,Looks nice portable smaller in size. Works great with my cell phone. Great value.
5,Excellent sound very loud and easy to usr
5,Easily connects to laptop (nice & loud) android & iphone bought another!!!
5,We bought this for our nursery about a month ago and so far we haven't needed to charge it - we use it probably three times a week for 1 hour at night time. You manage everything from your phone so theres no volume buttons to mess with if you don't want it shuts off after you stop using it if nothing is playing anymore.  The sound is not like an expensive speaker but it's actually way better than I thought. No buzzing with the bass or anything it sounds just fine. I'd definitely recommend it especially for 25 bucks.  It's be great for casual use like a kids room kitchen or garage.
3,The speaker added NO CAN VOLUME!!!
5,This has been the best mini-speaker I have come across so far.All it's features are perfect. Connectivity Battery holds for up to 5 days sound is perfect.
4,My daughter used it for in her power wheels and it worked great battery lasted longer then the power wheels car
5,First off I saw several reviews stating this is better than Bose before I bought this. I was pretty skeptical of that thought. I know with Bose you're paying for the name but Bose still has insanely good sound quality. I would not say this is just as good as Bose (Soundlink for specific comparison). However this is about a third to a quarter of the price. I will say you get your money's worth a couple times over. This speaker isn't tinny or cheap. It has a pretty smooth sound. I don't think it's as smooth as Bose though like so many people say it is. We played this and our Bose one after another on a couple different styles of music. The Bose was still much higher sound quality. However compared to other similar devices we've tried in this price range this cute little speaker is head and shoulders above the others. If you're looking for Bose buy Bose. This speaker stands on its own with its small price tag and high quality. Very happy with the purchase. We just got it and haven't played with all the functions. Will probably toss out an update once we've had time. I gave it 5 stars taking the price tag into account.
3,It says to charge it fully before you use it and that the initial charge will take 12 hours to complete but after that it will only takes a few- however it only took a few hours to charge the first time so I don't know if that will be a problem. I was using a fast charger as recommended by some reviewers but I didn't think it would charge THAT fast. The voice that people keep mentioning is annoying especially "Bluetooth has be on" what does that even mean???? But I can deal with it and apparently the company can help you get rid of it if you wish to. The volume control is weird- you run your finger around the blue wheel on top to adjust kind of like an ipod. However in the middle of raising the volume it sounds off a busy phone signal every single time as if I pressed the call button on the speaker even though I never touched it at all. This speaker looks very nice and the actual clarity of the sound is great (like no blown speaker sound like some cheap speakers and headphones) but it is wayyyy quiet. I'm not even putting it in an open space! I placed it in a corner today and it mildly helped but it was still pretty quiet. I don't see how people are saying it works great outside when it sounds like it's on a low volume setting in my tiny room even though I have it as well as my phone on the highest. It also sounds like the sound goes in and out when I'm playing music sometimes and that's annoying too especially when I've been looking forward to trying this speaker. Maybe I got a defective one?
5,I love this speaker. I bought it for work and I am very pleased with it.  The sound quality is good  it can get pretty loud if you wanted. The battery lasts all day  plus!  The pink is really pretty.  I was worried when the picture on the box was black but it was in fact pink!  The Bluetooth connects automatically to the phone it was last paired with so if multiple people use it you just have to pay attention to which device it connects to.
5,This was a bit hard to pair with Alexa echo but does work with Alexa. Make sure you keep the directions. You have to go into the Alexa app to set this up. We had no problems using this with alexa after we finally got it set up. This sounds awesome you can turn it up and down with Alexa or on the device itself. We use it for several hours outside while the kids were swimming in the pool.  We have not tried using it to make a phone call yet.
5,I bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas. I haven't actually used it. But she loves it. That's all I can tell you.
4,Disconnects from Bluetooth ALL THE TIME.  Disappointing Prime day purchase.  I'll go the route of trying reset and firmware upgrade but at this point I wouldn't buy again.  I'll update the review if things change.  Update to review: (still no good news): factory reset firmware update and then no auto off firmware update didn't make it through one song.  Tried another phone also didn't make it through one song.Update 09-12-18  I was contacted by DOSS about resets and firmware updates and whether the unit was working properly.  It wasn't I was using the 3.5mm jack.  There were delays with ME getting back to them.  They offered a replacement unit.  I received that unit today.  I charged it and played 30 minutes of music without any disconnects.  Kudos to DOSS for reaching out and supporting their product.  I am raising review to 4 stars as I do "like it" but will update again after I have time to use it for a longer period of time.
5,I like the easy setup and sound quality. Highly recommend
5,For the price this puts out good sound not outstanding but good enough. I don’t regret the purchase. I haven’t used enough to know about battery life
5,What I liked most about this device is its sound quality.  The basses and trebles are terrific.  Another outstanding feature is its simplicity to use.  It is so easy to pair it to my cellphone tablet or my laptop.  I received it yesterday and have been using it ever since.  Charging the battery with the included cable is a piece of cake.  It charged in less than three hours.  The only problem I saw is that the LED light is just below the cable so you can't see the charging light because its sight is obstructed by the cable.  No big deal but it shows a lack of customer understanding.  Other than that I think it's a wonderful deal.  The price is withing everybody's budget.  I would fully recommend this portable speaker to my friends and coworkers.
5,The sound quality is even better than I thought it would be
5,One of the best speaker. Since the last speaker I brought Was low sound and gets easily damaged.
5,So was looking for a Bluetooth speaker for awhile and came across this one. I must say it is a great product and a very great price. Might have to buy more for the kiddos!!
3,I bought this speaker simply because of the color. I know I know the color has nothing to do with the sound. I wish this speaker had a better way to increase the bass.Oh well I'll have to live with it I suppose.
5,We bring it everywhere!  Battery lasts long time. Sound very good.
5,I bought this for the office and am so pleased with its performance. It syncs easily and has a good quality sound. The battery lasts more than a week and charges easily with the USB cord. Happy buyer here!
4,Good sound easy connectivity.  I use it on my desk at work so sometimes at very low volume for background and sometimes cranked up loud.  It sounds good at both ends.  Volume control play/pause skip rev all work and respond well.  I only use it for music so cannot comment on phone use.The low battery noise is the most annoying and loud sound completely overkill.  It is indicating that the battery is low not that your heart has stopped beating.  Wish I could tone that down but I can instantly plug in a charger since it's on my desk.  If this wasn't the case that sound is so annoying I would stop using the device when the sound started.Other than the low battery indicator sound it a great product.
4,returned it. It wasn't exactly plug in and play. Didn't work.Originally I gave this device a 1 star. The company was so concerned they gave me a refund and insisted on sending me another one free of charge. This one works. I definitely is plug and play. It picked up my ipod almost instantly and it does sound surprisingly good for such a small unit.I think there is a way for you to answer your phone and get calls through it but I havn't figured that out yet.I edited my review because this company rocks! Their product is great and I must have just gotten a bad one. Thank you Doss!I bought 2 like this The black one I hooked up with my computer. The speaker apparently blew It was 2 years old.  Yet the blue one keeps sounding great. I even take it kayaking and listen wirelessly to my ipod in the middle of nowhere.  Anyway I took off 1 star because the black one is now in Fuzz tone and pretty much useless. I don't even listen to music very loudly.
5,This Bluetooth speaker has great sound.  It’s easy to pair with any device.  The battery holds a charge for a long time.  Great product!
3,I've owned this for almost 2 years. At first it seemed great. Sound quality is fine battery life is great. The MAJOR issue is the bluetooth connectivity. It took me months to figure out that it can't switch between devices easily. Once it's been paired to a device you need to actively unpair it (not just disconnect it) before it will work with another device. So if it's been paired with my iPad even if my iPad is turned completely off it will not pair with another device unless I turn my iPad back on and then go into the bluetooth settings and unpair it. Unfortunately the last device it paired with was my phone which has water damage and can't turn back on. Because my phone can't turn on I can't unpair it. And because it can't pair with that device it just keeps blinking and beeping. It won't turn off no matter how many different ways I try. Interestingly enough I found that the device refusing to turn off is a common problem. So right now it's blinking and beeping until the battery eventually dies out. Oy vey.
2,First let me say I bought this to use as a sound machine for my kid's room. I put a file on an SD card and it plays on a loop all night and during nap times. Works just fine for that purpose. I have connected it to my phone a few times to listen to music and the sound quality is not great.1. There is an audible hum / buzz during playback. It's not that bad but it shouldn't be there.2. The top and bottom end are not accurate. Not surprisingly the bass is not huge but the high end is kind of inaccurate too. The mid is fine I imagine it would work great as a speaker phone (never thought of that).3. The audio / voice feedback is loud. I tried to do the firmware upgrade to remove all the audio prompts and it failed several times.4. I was hoping these could serve double duty...in my kids' rooms and be good for parties in our backyard. The sound quality is too poor for the latter.So I sound like I'm pretty down on this (well these because I bought two) but I want to temper expectations. There are SOOOO many reviews on here saying this thing is a miracle and sounds amazing. That is what I expected...it doesn't. It sounds like a relatively inexpensive bluetooth speaker that is small. If I compare it to our JBL speaker that is barely larger it is far inferior. It also cost like 20% of the price.TL:DR Don't expect miracles it works to hear music and likely for phone calls. It's not a silver bullet super amazing substitute for something like a JBL Bose etc...just know that before you buy it.
4,The only complaint I have is that the TF (micro SD) card slot does not work. The card just sits in there instead of seating properly and needing to be ejected.  It will fall out if the speaker is bumped.  It's best to just use the Bluetooth instead of a media card anyway as that is the only way to shuffle your music.Very good value though. I just use in my office on my desk and it has a good full sound.
4,The sound quality is okay but I was expecting a clearer sound. But for it's price I guess you should not expect the best. It's okay for your cellphone or computer. But if you're after better sound and bass...you may want something with sound adjustments. It automatically shuts off with inactivity in five minutes. Fast charging and it comes with a lighted display and functions.
5,I loved the touch spinning the lit up blue circle for volume. Very helpful it came with both Aux and USB cords. Also has its own volume so I can go max in what I'm using and Doss goes up even higher. And VERY good bass for small unit by the way. I'm usually more a treble gal but this isn't the annoying rattling bass clear bass. Not that heavy weighs as much as my hand mixer. The whole unit the sides front & back around the display set up like speaker with holes throughout. Sturdy though. Looks like if you take care of it should last a while. Mine works as good as the day I got it. Nice machine glad I purchased!!
5,I was originally looking for speakers to purchase for my PC but after browsing for a few weeks on Amazon I couldn't find anything decent that was worth the price. I came across this read the reviews and decided to purchase one for myself and I honestly love it. It's small but built very sturdy and it's very easy to use and set up. Mine doesn't have the "annoying Bluetooth voice" like most people said it had and I know there's an option to install a program to remove the voice. I haven't heard any voice on mine which to be honest would make it a little easier to use. It would help me know when Bluetooth was on or off. I'm not sure how long the battery life is as mine is hooked to my computer whenever it's on. The volume is a lot louder than I expected it to be on something so small. I have it set up in my room and I can hear it all the way across my house into my backyard when the volume is at its highest. Easily accessible on the go and works great for a little home office or at home!
4,It arrive in 1 day after ordering yesterday.  Sounds great and I've owned and have a lot of BT speakers including a Alexa tower from Gen 1. The only issue I have is it won't stay connected unless you're actually using it. I have some that stay connected all day to another phone whether I'm watching  or listening.  This one shuts off after 30 mins and you need to push the power back on. It finds my phone fast enough after that.  The sound is crisp with good mix of everything and bass. Nice and easy to operate.  I cannot review the battery life since I am disabled from cancer and dont leave home much. Plus I'm 60 acting like I'm 19 feeling like I'm Not 19 but I ride my own unique wave. I dont surf fyi.

5,10/26/20 Update: Changed my rating from 1 star to 5 stars. Contacted DOSS customer service on 10/24/20. They responded within 24 hours giving instruction to "reset" the speaker (paperclip inserted in the "line in" port on the back of the speaker-  WHO KNEW?!). Reset fixed the volume issue. DOSS customer service is definitely awesome!10/24/20 Speaker worked great for 2.5 months. Had clear LOUD output. Battery life lasted several weeks with almost daily use. Charged quickly. After the second time charging connected the speaker to phone turned the volume up and could barely hear the sound coming out. Tried disconnecting reconnecting charging etc. Speaker will not play at its original full loud volume.
5,Sound quality is exceptional connects quicklyand the charge lasts all daymy wife uses it in her car and loves itblasts her right out the doorgetting another one soon.
5,This is a Great Speaker… I just got it today and plugged it in to charge that took a few hours. I then synced it with my Bluetooth for my iPhone.It is so easy to set up and to use. I will be enjoying this everyday inside and outside….The sound quality is great no complaints at all…
5,Had to buy a new speaker when I got a 5G phone. The price was so good and it came like the next day. The battery life really sells this. Great deal all around!
5,Holy Cow.  Opened this up turned it on (it came pre-charged) opened Bluetooth on my iPhone picked the DOSS and it immediately started playing music from my phone.  I’m not kidding...this process takes 30 seconds.  Great sound and the speaker feels and looks rich and amazing.  We couldn’t be happier.  Size wise...imagine taking a brick and cutting it in half longways...that’s the general size and shape.If you’re on the fence this is a great great deal.  I’ve had other similar products that sounded muffled or wouldn’t pair easily.  This speaker is just awesome for our needs.
5,Needed an outdoor speaker to listen to music while doing yard work. It connects readily either to my IPad or Phone. Lasts for several hours and charges up in about 3 hours. Use a phone plug because there is none but price is  great for overall quality. Would buy again.
4,My suggestion to Doss is that  1) bass and toner buttons 2) some screen showing the info of the music played - - would be nice for future models if possible.  The model I got had a volume button problem: I could increase volume but couldn't decrease it at all.  So I contacted Doss Support Center by email and after several exchanges they sent me another model whose volume button worked as it should.  Thanks  Doss.
4,Feels solid and well made and the sound is above average lots of bright tones but with little bass -by comparison to others I have therefore would suit an open environment like the garden or rooftop.  The bad? Very annoying to turn "Off".  Have to keep pressing the (only) power/BT pairing button until a certain tone is heard -this can vary from a few to 15 seconds!  If they only made a dedicated power button for this.
5,Sounds awesome sleeping battery lasts forever. Connects easily.
5,I just had to write a review on this speaker. I bought this a year ago and use it pretty consistently. The battery life is great and it’s plenty loud for my tastes. I have left it in the hot sun for hours and even in the rain (twice) and this little speaker still works perfectly. I recently left it outside overnight during a thunderstorm and I could not believe that it still worked after that. Left it in the sun to dry and then put it in a plastic bag with some little bags of desiccant and it’s as good as new. I highly recommend this speaker and would buy another one (if I am careless again and it doesn’t hold up to another disaster).
5,Good quality sound and volume loudness is great.
5,Let’s start with the price. It was easy to make this purchase because it was not very expensive and from other reviews it appeared to be a top notch product in a lower price point. That was a win in my book.Next connectivity: It was so easy to pair! I’ve used other inexpensive Bluetooth devices and had to troubleshoot connection issues but this was a BREEZE!The sound quality: I was surprised by how solid the sound was. I bought it for the beach and it can get noisy out there with crowds other people’s music seagulls and waves of course but the sound was perfect and strong and we never  needed to turn it up all the way. Now I’m not a sound engineer so I can’t tell you why it sounded good. It just did.Appearance: It’s pretty. I got the white one and it’s nice and portable and light weight. And pretty.
4,Day one and I've used this all day. Easily paired with my Samsung S9. The sound is incredible at under thirty dollars. Thirty dollars! I'm going on 8 hours and the battery is still good. The instruction manual was clear and concise and covered everything. Unbelievable bass. Volume capacity is very loud for its size. The sound quality is will definitely vary depending on the source but this true of course with any Bluetooth product. When the source quality is good the speaker will reflect it. It is hard for me to believe that this speaker performs the way it does at the price. If it holds up this may be the best 30 dollars I've ever spent. *Edit: After about four months of moderate use the speaker is very difficult if not impossible to turn on. If I long press then short press a few dozen times it powers up sometimes sometimes not. I understand this is not a very expensive speaker but I feel it should have lasted longer.
5,I bought this as a secondary blue tooth speaker because I kept leaving my other one downstairs. I’m impressed with the volume level. It’s much louder than my other one. For the price don’t expect some premium sound experience. Music is crisp and clear. Seems to shine when you connect it to a tablet and watch a show. It also sounded good when I connected it to my computer. Much better sound than the weak tv speakers. If you are looking for a full bass sound look somewhere else. This certainly gets the job done. At first I trouble getting it to connect and then I discovered it went into sync mode when I hit the button that has like a phone icon.
5,This speaker is great. I bought it for my classroom. Any time I play a video I connect this and everyone can hear. It’s great!
4,I bought this product to use with my Smart Phone. I stream Sirius XM both indoors and outdoors. The sound quality is adequate but certainly not the true stereo quality I can get with my old Sanyo living room stereo. It connected easily with my Samsung Galaxy A10e via Bluetooth. If you plan to use this speaker in an area more than 25-30 ft. from the speaker I would invest in a larger more powerful unit. Sound quality is quite adequate at short distances.
4,Only dislike is the distance of which my phone has to be. Can't go too far before losing connection.
5,Love it..sounds great hooked up real easy. Jams...loud...can hear it across the house. Best thing I like it will send you a message  for someone to connect to it you have the option to say nope.. just like I did to my kids....lol...all mine
5,I had a bose Soundlink mini years ago and while I loved the sound you could only hear it if you were in front of it and couldn't use it while charging.  Since it only lasted a few hours that was problematic.  This little guy has almost equally good sound has fantastic battery life has 360 degree sound and can be charging while in use.  I was really surprised how good the sound was... it felt loud without it actually being loud.  Accent sounds were crystal clear and soft sounds were not drowned out by base tracks.  My office mate and I were amazed at how loud we could make it sound to us when it couldn't be heard in the hallway or on office calls.  I streamed Apple music via bluetooth from Samsung note 5. I want to get one for my house  and see if i can use it instead of my current surround sound speakers.If I had to list a complaint it would be the power turns off after 15 mins of non-use which is understandable.
4,The speaker sounds great and does get loud enough to use outdoors or while working out. I have not had it long enough to truly test the battery life. My only complaint is the touch controls do not tell u what is going on at any time. U have to remember what color and whether or not the color is flashing or solid to try and figure out what u r doing. Because of this u have to keep the user manual to refer to the first few times u use it which is annoying. But once i get it down i will be happy with it
3,I’ve had this product for over a year and I will start off by saying that the sound quality is great. The volume is also excellent. However my biggest peeve about it is that it beeps at random times. It’s like sometimes it’ll connect to my phone even when I don’t want it to and then disconnect at random. When I do want it connected it’s not a problem it works great. But when I don’t want it connected it does so when it’s in range. My only solution Is to let the battery drain out so it’ll stop.Not really sure what to do about it I’m not very tech savvy but I’ve never had this happen with any other Bluetooth speaker. So I’ll give it five stars in terms of sound quality and volume but one star for this annoying thing it does.
5,Set up was super easy. Sound quality is good for the price. Very pleased!
5,I like it. Connected to my Moto phone with very little effort and sounds good for a small speakers. It's not going to sound like a $1000 speakers. It's great for setting around the camp fire and listening to music.
5,I had originally rated this as a "three star" due to the very annoying beeps it was giving off as a "low battery alert".However thanks to "Milla" at DOSS I was able to reconfigure it using a file she sent me via email (along with a VERY helpfulvideo) and voila! No more jarring/annoying sounds. I now love it again. :)DOSS support email:  support@dossav.comOriginal review follows:I've rated this a "three star" item for only one reason and that is that rather than opting to employ the use of it's LEDs to make one aware that the battery is getting low this thing makes the most jarring "beep" I've ever heard any device (save for a smoke alarm) give off.  For most folks this wouldn't be a problem. But I use mine to play audiobooks while going to sleep at night. When that "beep" goes offwhen I'm halfway alseep it's not just an annoyance it's alarming.  The sound is quite good for something of this size and I'm quite happy with it in that regard. But it desperately needsan option to get rid of the "low battery" beep.
5,I resisted buying a blue tooth speaker because I didn't expect good sound quality or volume. While they're not Bose they are definitely not bad!During quarantine I've been watching a lot of movies on my phone. I got sick of carrying my portable speakers around the house. The cords! And they don't have very good sound or volume. So I finally decided to try out Bluetooth speakers mostly for convenience. I got a lot more than I was expecting!These get very loud! Not as loud as Bose but the sound doesn't get distorted if you blast them at at full volume. I can hear it everywhere in my house. I can take it anywhere in my house without losing the connection.Very happy!
5,Just got this DOSS sound box touch wireless speaker 2 days ago. It paired easily with my android phone. I was able to use it right out of the box without charging it and have bern listening to it for hours at a time throughout the last couple of days without issues. It comes with a charging USB under the inside bottom panel of the box. Your phone volume will definitely effect speaker volume so put your phone volume all the way up. The controls are easy. It feels very sturdy for it's size. It has 4 rubber pads on the bottom to protect tables and hold it nicely in place on my bedside table. I got the black one. The led lights are blue. It looks and sounds great for the price. So far im super happy with it. I will update if that changes.
3,It looks nice. But when you listen there is no actual base  and the volume doesn’t go up very much. I purchased it for my 85 year old aunt and even she said it didn’t have enough bass.  And worst of all I tried to take a video but then the  speaker stopped playing . 😕
5,Musica
5,What great sound from such a little box. I was impressed. I've been using it for about 4 months now. My daughter got a cheap name brand speaker (that was still more expensive than mine!) - you know the one - mine sounded better and didn't drop the signal as much as hers did. Battery seems to run forever - I LOVE THE BATTERY LIFE! That can't be understated. Great bass in this little speaker but more than that  just a seriously well balanced sound! However I plugged it into my record player the other day with an aux cable and that was it for my Doss. :( Disappointing because it had been my fave new thing - but probably my fault. Be careful what you AUX into it. Speaker is blown now and it sounds terrible. Also I had issues trying to connect this speaker with my echo dots and use it with my phone. Next time I'll get a separate speaker for my echo dots and only use it with that. All this said it's still a great value and I can't wait to grab another one.
5,I've had this Bluetooth speaker since Oct. 2021 and I must say the battery life is the best. Takes a licking and keeps on ticking.
5,Best little speaker I ever bought was better than expected!! Would def recommend and buy again
5,This thing is awsome! It is well built sturdy and sounds amazing. I was very impressed with this speaker.
4,I love this speaker.  I ordered it in pink my favorite color.  I love the sound and it was so easy to sync with my iPhone.  The only problem is I think I received a bad charging cord.  The part that is supposed to fit in the back of the speaker doesn't fit.  I am disappointed as I really love this.  I guess I could try to get a new cord for this speaker.  I would otherwise have given this product five stars overall rating.
4,This Bluetooth speaker is functionally very good.  Bluetooth connectivity is excellent compared to other units with which I have experience.  The controls are intuitive and work well.  Construction is solid.  The sound quality is very good.  It comes up short on bass compared to the high quality (much more expensive) bluetooth speakers but overall this speak has good value.
3,Sound is okay but not great
4,Pretty Pepsi can blue color but much less base and approx 1/2 the size and price of the Soundbox Pro+. That being said the base truly leaves much to be desired when at lower volumes and just ok at higher levels but the sound is crisp and clear. Since I use it mostly for sports and talk radio it works for me in my home office therefore I keep. Between $27-$30 isn't a bad price but if ur looking for real base look elsewhere.
5,Good quality speaker and price
5,I love this speaker. The volume control is tricky but otherwise it works great. I had a different one that had a very annoying introduction sound. This one has a nice little jingle that's not annoying at all.
5,I just received my speaker and it is smaller than I expected.  I saw pictures people posted but I guess I still expected something bigger.  Though my expectations where slightly different I love the size!  It came in its original box inside an Amazon box.  It would have been nice to see some packing material to keep it from sliding around inside the Amazon box...but it arrived undamaged.  Right out of the box it turned on and paired right away with my LG Stylo 2 phone (I'm not lucky enough to own an IPhone).  There is plenty of charge to turn on pair with my phone and give it a try!  The sound is a lot better than I expected...and the volume is perfect for my needs (showers grilling house cleaning etc)!!  I am not sure how good the battery life is or how far the range is.....but I will soon find out.
5,I was pleasantly surprised at how well this product worked for such a reasonable price.  Good solid base and easily portable.
4,I love how clear the sound is and it was easy to pair up with my phone without any problems but my only issue is that the volume keeps going from really loud to low on its own when playing certain songs... and also the battery life only lasted 3-4 hrs playing constantly so it’s not up to 20 hrs play time as advertised .. but I guess you get what you pay for.. over all good product only wish the volume would not keep getting loud and then low while I play music.. it’s pretty annoying 😒
5,I was looking for a little Bluetooth speaker just to have in my bedroom for when I’m getting ready etc... I was going to order one like I bought my adult kids a couple of years ago but really wasn’t wanting to spend that much. I happened to notice this Doss one as it was the “deal of the day” but was thinking it probably wouldn’t be worth getting because of the cheap price. But I read so many good reviews so thought what the heck and ordered it. When I first tried it out I was AMAZED at the sound of this little speaker. It was such a crisp clear sound and is WAY more loud enough for my bedroom!! Although I got it for a little less than what it sells for on here it is well worth that price! I would definitely buy it again at the original price!! Get it you shouldn’t be disappointed!!
4,Le faltó el radio  pero todo súper bien gracias
4,I was trying to get rid of all of the wires and junk needed to play music in my design showroom.  I have 2 sides and having a speaker too close to our "working" area became a problem with conversations.  So i put this wireless speaker in the other side and it easily fills the spaces with music.  My 1 complaint is that I wish the battery life were longer.  I have to move it to charge about every 3 days or less.  But that is a small sacrifice.
5,My wife enjoys sitting in the family room and listening to music which she can stream to this speaker.  It does have an on/off switch in the back but it will shut off automatically if not used within a certain amount of time.  You do have to turn it on by hand.  The sound is great and the volume will blast you out if you like that.  We really like the speaker and it's quality.  Very compact so its easy to move if you want to do so.  Good product which we like.
5,Doss connects easy and has great sound. I also use this speaker with my Ipod when working outside works perfect. Great speaker portable and easy to use. Word to the wise. I have been using the Doss to connect to my TV. Nice to have the speaker next to us. One day I turned it on and it would not connect. Trouble being it was connecting to my wife's phone. The speaker has distinctive tone when it connects so I knew it was connecting but no sound from the TV. Once my wife turned her Bluetooth off it worked perfect. Don't know why it connected to her phone maybe it was closer than the TV? I would recommend the Doss if you are looking for an affordable quality speaker.Update 6-18-2020Started having issues with the speaker and there customer service was awesome received my replacement today. Great speaker great price and great service.
4,I 57000+ all these reviews! Great sound great battery life! The prompts and beeping can be annoying but also fixed through contacting the company. I'm extremely happy with the speaker for the price!
5,I don't review much but this little box is awesome! I bought it a couple years ago and still works great. The real reason I'm writing this review is because last night I left this sitting outside in a heavy downpour of rain by accident. When I found it the next day I was mad at myself because I was sure it was going to be ruined but to my surprise it turned on and worked just as good as it did when I first bought it! I'm not sure if it was rated to be waterproof but it definitely held up through a bad storm sitting out all night and that was enough for me to write a review and recommend it to anyone looking for a speaker.
5,Just the right size for  interior of Moter Home very stylish an price  is right on problems.
4,connected to my win10 macine and works just fine in setup and use
5,I was looking for something economical that works. So far this is it. I've had this little box for approximately two months. I only play this when I'm doing chores etc. It beats any other sound system that I have in my home. I link this to the playlist on my phone and I get a loud crisp sound. The battery life is pretty strong. I've heard tales of a beep or disturbance that's heard when the battery is low. I never let the battery get too low. The only drawback I've experienced is my sound skips if my phone is too far away from this box. Therefore I keep them near each other.
4,Although I stand by my initial comments below I have come to enjoy and appreciate this speaker. It will not compare to a $200 Boss or UE but it does produce a pretty decent sound. I take this out on the deck when I fire up the grill and can enjoy my tunes in spite of the infernal freeway noise.Many reviews here praise this speaker for how it sounds relative to its price. In other words it ain’t bad for a speaker that costs less than $30. I suppose that is a reasonable assessment but as far as the sound goes it does not have amazing bass or what I would call a “room-filling” sound. I am giving a 3-star review because I don’t want you see all the 5-star reviews and think you are going to get an amazing-sounding device. If you only have $30 to spend then I would definitely recommend this speaker. If you are looking for a great sounding speaker like me then we should all keep looking.
5,I use this speaker all the time. I listen to music and play podcasts on Zoom meetings 3-4 times a week. The sound is great. Just the right combo of bass and treble. Hate too much of one or the other. And the sound is really clear No matter how loud I have it. And it goes pretty loud. I also bought a little case to go with it and I love it. It seems to keep a charge for quite a while. I really like it. Have Amazon music a can take it anywhere I can take my phone.
4,I order this speaker to hear my Church Service the sound is great but it keeps going off and I have to hit the on button two or more times to cut it back on I should habe returned it but I waited for my son to come check on it to see if I did or didn't do something right when I started using it
2,Seems I got unlucky and my speaker can only reach about 20" before it starts cutting out. Ive seen other reviews stating they can get it to 100 the description even says "enjoy wireless and seamless music up to 33 feet". Im not getting close to that. I got it to listen in the kitchen from my computer and not hurt my rabbits ears but I still need the speaker in the living room to reach. The sound is great it looks cool I can not yet comment on the battery life. Had I known the connection doesnt reach far I would have not purchased this. All-in-all a disappointment.
5,The speaker I purchased was very easy to use and has great sound all I had to do was take it out of the box and it was ready to go.
5,I have four throughout my home.  I’m listening to the one on my porch as I’m writing this.  It is my go-to gift for me colleagues at work.  I don’t know about battery life as all of mine are plugged in.  Definitely a great value.
5,I love this little speaker. I recently moved and was painting all the rooms before moving furniture it. I bought this little speaker to play music while I worked. So far it has been great! The sou d quality is excellent and I had no problems pairing it to my phone. The battery life is great I haven't needed to charge it since getting it and I have used it for many days 6-8 hrs at a time.
5,For the price I got this for ($20 Black Friday sale) it is 100% worth it. However Bose SoundLink it is not. And you shouldn't expect it to be. You want Bose sound you pay Bose money. You just want a small speaker with decent sound for the backyard a beach day or the bathroom-- this is your jam.The bass is not good-- realistically it shouldn't be. Can you tell it is reproducing bass notes-- heck yeah! Can you use this to attract snakes (Simpsons reference)-- heck no!But knowing (from other reviewers) that customer support is active and constantly providing firmware updates (auto-off to pair with echo shuffle play etc.) Solidified this unit as a must own for me to pair with a 1st Gen echo. That said the sound this speaker reproduces is very similar in volume and range to the 2nd gen echo but the built in SD card and long battery life (I used on and off for three days 2-3 hours at a time on one charge) make it worth the lonely Jackson.
4,So far so good I’ve use this both indoors and outdoors and you get pretty good sound. It picks up from Bluetooth right away. The Diles on the front I don’t use that much I just use my phone to stop and start it up again or to turn the volume up and down. I’ve only had it a little over two weeks I’ll report back on its longevity. But for the price point I think it’s worth it to be able to use for decent sound
5,We had a red Doss we purchased and used for almost a year outside while drinking wine by the fire pit....AWESOME little speaker with a BIG sound! Liked it so much purchased a blue one for father-in-law...he LOVES his too! Works perfectly with iphone or really just whatever...deep enough bass great sound and still have never run the battery completely out during our long nights on the back deck....get it!
4,Nice look and fair sound quality at this price.
3,1. There seems to be a "feature" that puts the device to sleep when there is no signal. It's too aggressive -- some podcasts are produced with digital silence between words / sentences and it causes the standby mode every couple seconds clipping off the beginning of every sentence.2. Annoying LOUD sound every time you connect over bluetooth. Good luck not waking up the whole house if you try to use this late at night.3. Annoying LOUD beep every 60 seconds when the battery is low. Worst idea ever. 9/10 times I am half asleep and it's very startling the first time it happens.The thing actually sounds great but these issues make it really unusable in many situations. Wish I had bought a different product. Can not recommend.Update: (see vendor reply greatly appreciated)... The firmware updates (easily found with internet search) do solve the issues but in a relatively unsatisfactory way. I chose the "Remove auto power off & prompt tone" update which lives up to its name but now the user interface is just clumsy. It would seem that using the power button to turn it off (now necessary) takes at least a couple long-presses on the power button and there is no feedback as to what is happening. Still better. Thank you.
5,This little buddy has been dropped and scratched and has traveled with me to so many places. Still sounds great and looks sexy everywhere. Whether watching Netflix on my phone or having a beach get together my little $20 buddy has kept consistent good sound. I go weeks without charging it. Here's to more years with my DOSS!
4,There is a lot of weight to this product and does not feel cheap at all. The sound quality is excellent to the point it may be to good as I get feedback when using this on my phone while doing other things making this high pitched noise when someone is taking it's rather subtle but can get about after a while. When playing music this speaker really shines. There's a great amount of base but not over powered and the clearity of the sound is rather impressive for a Bluetooth speaker. I can easily have this blasting and hear everything crystal clear through my whole house granted my home is rather small but that still is really impressive in itself. If my TV had Bluetooth I would use this as an alternative to the TV speakers.The only gripe I have about this speaker is how loud the sound is when turning it on.
5,use it almost every day for hours it holds up. easy to charge and it still plays while charging. definitely recommend
4,I purchased this for my kids room to go with their LED lights that are sound activated. It gets pretty loud! I gave it 4 stars on sound instead of 5 because you can't alter the sound settings and the bass isn't very good but the sound is clear and loud. The buttons at the top are sensitive to touch and uncomplicated to use. Connectivity is very easy and it's a great affordable speaker if you're looking for one - this is a good buy.
1,14 days in the battery lasts 20 minutes on a 24 hour charge.DO NOT BUY!!I threw this worthless brick in the trash.  If I want a paperweight or something I’ll go dig up a rock from the creek.  It will probably have a longer charge and better charge than this worthless piece of crapNext day it lasts 10 minutes after a 24 hour charge.  Piss poor rip off.  They got my money I hope they don’t get yours.
5,I love the sound from this speaker. I have a small 5 acre ranch and drive around my property listening to my tunes.  Very happy with this speaker.
4,I purchased this speaker because of functionalities of Songs from SD Card/AUX cable and Bluetooth :). My main purpose of this speaker is to connect with my laptop.I am able to take calls listen music from my iPhone 6 on this speaker I am able to listen songs form MicroSD card as well.But I am not able to connect this speaker with my Dell laptop with Windows 10.I tried to update Windows Uninstall and reinstall Bluetooth drivers but I am not able to connect this speaker with my laptop using Bluetooth.In Windows setting it showed me paired but it is not connected I tried almost all possible options but failed.So my main purpose is not fulfill :(I will not recommend if you want to use this DOSS Soundbox with Dell laptop running on Windows 10.Update 09-20-2018:Quick and very friendly Customer Support.I submitted picture and video of speaker not connecting to my laptop and they send me a new speaker.I really appreciate it.
4,Sound quality is good not excellent. I expected nothing more for the great price. Excellent portability with satisfying sound.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I really do give it 5 stars. Easy to connect to devices USB-C sound quality is great and lightweight. (Mario Party game audio is playing in video)
5,Excellent sound quality and volume for the price. Battery life is amazing. Bought mine over a year ago. This one I bought as a gift.
5,Love it! I've had this speaker for years. It just keeps going - sounds good holds a charge for days connects fast It's also built very sturdily - even with all the bumps and knocks it has taken over the years it still has zero dents or nicks. I bought a second one for my kids over a year ago. They both get a workout and are still going strong. I'm always nervous about buying electronics. I've had too many devices work for a year and die. These are better quality apparently because they have held up really well. Highly recommend.
5,Just received yesterday. Very easy to set up in seconds. Nice design. Was actually surprised at how the the sound is. Listening inside had to turn phone down to medium setting bc it was too loud. I got it mostly to use outside. It doesn't have any setting like bass. But I was working and ended up having to move it. I did have it on a glass table. Moved it to a metal garden stand. To my surprise the metal must've caused a vibration. That in effect created a bass sound. I was thrilled 😁 It arrived charged (no indicator). I played it for several hours but I still can't detest to the battery life. Will update on battery life with experience.
5,I use this with my iPad Pro. The speaker is more robust than the built-in speakers and when positioned in front of the iPad and aimed at the listener the voice portion of the audio is much more clear than the iPad speakers which are aimed to the side. Great investment especially for the price.
4,Very good sound. Needs more bass. Battery life is average.
5,My initial review is this speaker will far outperform it's cost of less than $30. It connected to my iPhone via bluetooth in a matter of seconds. The sound quality and volume exceeded my expectations in a such a small speaker. I did a distance test and was able to communicate with my iPhone well over 50 feet away in the house through several walls. I've yet to test the sd card capabilities or the battery life. I'll update review once I've done these tests.
5,I like that it turns itself off when not in use which saves on battery life
4,Loud and clear but lacking bottom end. Have an Amazon speaker BT that is not as loud but delivers bass. Love features water resistant package and battery life. Worth what I paid.
5,I'm not the easiest guy to please but this thing is the perfect addition to your smartphone for listening to music.  It has great tone and more than adequate volume for individual listening.  The battery life is amazing too pretty much all day non-stop for a work session in the garage.  Maybe not big enough to a real party blaster but light and easy to carry.  I just set it on top of my iPhone Plus when I need to move to a different room.  Fantastic value!
5,This is my Second one because I had the first one for a couple years and was stolen. my husband loves beats but I’m cheap so this is the best fit for me ... pretty color loud sound and cheap af! what else would you need in a speaker!
4,it's ok for my use - its not overly loud the quality is ok it didn't cost 100bucks so for what i bought it for it works well
5,I've had this product a couple weeks now and have come to appreciate it more as I go.  I currently have it sitting next to my Amazon Echo Dot in the bedroom and connected to the Dot with a short little 9" aux cord.  The power consumption of the unit is low enough I can leave it powered on all the time via the included USB cord.  Now my Dot has a much better "voice" and I can reasonably use it to play music when I want to.  The only complaint I have is the five lights on the top of the unit.  They stay on all the time in my above configuration (powered on in "aux-in mode").  This is a little too bright for the bedroom.  My workaround was to cut a piece of light-weight cardboard in the shape of the light panel and set it on top of the unit.
5,Small price. Big sound.Easy connectivity.
5,This is a great speaker!  The sound quality is really good! It was simple to connect  I am very pleased with this product and highly recommend it!
5,I've purchased this speaker before. So I was well aware of its quality. Operates before than some of the speakers that are considered to be top notch. I highly recommend this high quality speaker that's super affordable!
5,its really a steal ..well worth it!
4,I really like this product. It performs as advertised and met all of my expectations.  It arrived in a nice package and was well protected from the rigors of modern day shipping. It is a nice compact design with all of the controls  that you could possibly need. The audio volume is more than sufficient and the treble and mid tone ranges are adequate. Bass is not  any better  than you would expect on a device this size. Would I buy it again? Absolutely yes. So why am I giving it only four stars instead of five;  because of the lights on top of the device used to indicate volume channel mode and previous/next  selections. Dear Lord the lights might as well be kleig strobes at night. I am forced to remember to put a piece of cardboard or something on top of the device at night . My one suggestion that would give a solid five stars from anyone would be to put some method of turning the light off. Just my 2 cents.
4,I love it but my fire pad does not see it although it sees every device in the neighborhood. That is what I bought it for!
5,I looked at many Bluetooth speakers I wanted something wireless that I could move around the house. I was looking for a great quality sound at a good price! The Doss soundbox is that speaker. The sound is perfect and I can control the volume from my phone or the speaker. The Bluetooth connected easily to my phone and the charge is long lasting.
3,It doesn't get that loud but it's durable and connects very easily. I use it in my bathroom while taking a shower or cleaning the house. I bought a second one for my daughter for her room.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             It is very pretty good sound very easy to use you do not need the instructions to know its functions.
4,Connectivity is very good. Battery lasts a long time.
5,Owned my Bluetooth speakers like I am sure many of you have. The quality is great no crackles in the sounds; high volume doesn’t jeopardize the quality at all. Since getting this product I have not had to charge it once battery life is amazing. Connectivity is great also; can walk my whole house with my phone basement attic or even the backyard and the connectivity isn’t an issue. It’s durable for sure; live out in the country and have had it outdoors indoors and every room of the house. 5 stars all the way
5,This small box has a really nice sound for hanging out on the deck patio indoors a work area outdoors if nearby. It isn't a loudspeaker public address system so you won't be rocking your neighbors and the sound doesn't carry well across my fairly large front or back yards but for having a beer outside and relaxing chopping out a stir fry doing my yoga session in the family room it is just great!  It is easy to use and has not failed me once. The bluetooth signal faded when I walked too away with my phone in my pocket but range has been just as specified. I have not had occasion to use the speaker phone features but I fully expect it will perform well. It has worked well when my music on the phone was interrupted by a notification by fading out for the notification then fading back in to resume exactly where it left off. I paid $29.99 which was 67% off its listed $89.99 price. For this price it is impossible to be disappointed!   DOSS Touch Wireless Portable Bluetooth V4.0 Speakers with 12W High-Definition Sound Quality and Superior BassSensitive touch12 Hours playtimeHandsfree - [White        ]
5,It ok. Nice sound. It's worth it.
5,I've had this thing for several months now..I gotta say I'm impressed. For the size she sure does pump out some decent sound. Obviously with quieter tracks it doesnt seem as powerful (old acoustic mp3 files) but it does the job. I usually have to turn it down because it gets to be too much!I usually keep it in my bag with me so she's gone through a lot already haha but all of the buttons still work great holds a charge great. The battery life is awesome. I mostly use it as a speaker to replace my laptop's cruddy sound system and it's perfect for that. Bluetooth gets a little eh but that's mostly because of my laptop itself (I just wish the bluetooth range could be a bit longer but you cant have it all!!)
4,I bought this speaker to take to work. It actually has really good sound and volume however that is also a weakness.  I can't get the volume to go low enough to have at my desk at work with out bothering everyone else.  It's hard to control the volume I would rather have an actual button you push for the volume rather than the turn wheel.  Overall I do really enjoy the speaker I haven't had any problems connecting to any Bluetooth devices.  I like that is has a slot in the back for a micro SD card that way I can put my music on it and listen to it just from the actual speaker. I don't have to use and drain my phone so I can play my music. I bought a transmitter and have even used it during Halloween with my ATMOSFX digital projector.  It worked great outside!!  I would recommend this speaker for anything other than a desk speaker at work if you need to have a lower volume.
5,Cheap product broke in two weeks.Updated on 01/02/2016: The best customer service ever seen. Mine would not connect to my phone or anything after 2 weeks and I didn't return it due to the price and hassle also mainly my laziness. six months later I posted a negative review and immediately was contacted by Milla who was customer service representative from DOSS and couldn't have been more professional and generous. She offered to ship me a brand new one even though the purchased was make more than six months ago. However she sent it to my old address and after I informed her she was nice enough to send me another one to my current address. I am so impressed!!!!! The communication was nothing but super responsive. I just tried the new one and it was flawless. For the price I paid this is the most cost-effective product and it does it job perfectly. Especially with this type of exceptional customer service and I felt I am obligated to upgrade the rating to 5 star not only because its excellent quality but most importantly for the unsurpassed customer service on earth thanks again Milla Happy New Year!!!
5,Very good quality and the sounds are excellent
5,Works perfectly only wish it got a little louder for sound.
5,I bought this to pair with my i-pod to listen to music while in the yard. I really get great sound with it. It also came in useful at my friends' wedding and reception to play music for our small covid size gathering and celebration!  This helped contribute to make a memory for my friends I'm glad I had bought this.
5,I rarely leave a review on a product but this little thing has impressed me! Very loud for it's size smaller than I thought it would be. You need to scream to hear the person in front of you when it's at it's loudest and but is still very clear at high volumes! Super easy to connect to phone within seconds came charged and was ready to play. Can't speak for longevity as I've had it for 2 hours but very impressed great buy for the price!!!
3,Let me start off by saying I was really excited to get this bluetooth speaker in and it was loud when I played it at my house so I was pumped. I got this because I work in a place that's super noisy and wanted to listen to something other than machines buzzing in my ears. When I took this to work it not only was barely able to hear it and the bluetooth kept cutting in and out. Now if this is just outside near a pool or at your quiet office this will be plenty loud imo but I'd you're buying this to cancel out other noises then you're better off upgrading and paying the extra for more watts imo. Again it wasn't terrible or a waste of money and should be plenty loud otherwise. That is my honest review I hope it helps!
4,It serves my purpose perfectly. It’s not Bose quality nor Bose cost. It is a low cost speaker that has great volume seemless Bluetooth connectivity and portability.
4,Nice average. Nothing great. Enjoy
5,I purchased this as a sale item.  It works perfectly good sound and the battery last for days before it needs charging.
5,I purchased this as a gift and we were both surprised at the exceptional quality!  Really great speaker for the price!
4,DOSS -- stand for Dirty Old Sock Speaker.  If you search review on "light off" or "bright light" you will see I'm giving this 4 starts instead of 5 for the same reasons as others.  The lights for the buttons are very visible during the day--when you don't need them.  And at nightyou can light a room with the 4 white LED's plus blue LED ring.  A better design would be to have the blue ring dim after 15 seconds and the white LED lights turn off.  When I use this at night I keep a dirty sock handy to put on top of it. Bluetooth 4 means my phone display's the speaker's battery level the pairing is easy the sound quality for the size is great the battery life is also good.  But those lights -- if I have to put a dirty sock on my speaker and move it every time I want to adjust the controls then there is a problem with the speaker.
4,Sound good and battery lasts. Had a problem with the charging port and had to exchange but otherwise a real good buy.
5,DOSS SoundBox Touch Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speakers with 12W HD Sound and Bass IPX5 Waterproof 20H Playtime Touch Control Handsfree Speakers for Home Outdoor Travel-Black provides decent sound easy connectivity and portability.Only took a couple minutes to connect (I connected it to my Echo Show 5) and I'm please with the sound. Because I use it in the bedroom I don't ask for much volume. You can also connect via the provided mini-plug cable. It's rechargeable so portability is a plus!
4,Update....The product has such a nice support the company will replace it without hesitating problem for me is that I'm moving and as soon as I saw the problem with the device I ordered another one as I cannot wait I'm posting pictures of both devices the Doss looks better the touch pannel is beautiful and easy to operate visible at all times the sound is super clear the bass is not as deep as the other device but can be fixed from the phone's equalizer the Doss is heavier in weight maybe better magnets or more battery. Hope Doss adds a cover for the ports and a more bassy equalization for next gen.The most important is the support buy with confidence I'm sure they will stand behind their product even after Amazon's return period expires.
3,I bought this to pair with my laptop PC Windows 7. Device pairs at first but the drivers do not transfer and so does not "Complete" the pairing I went on DOSS's website which is a joke and the speaker is not even on it so no fix there. I tried to contact their support @ support@dossaudio.com with no response. The speaker does work with the Aux-In and it will pair with my phone but I bought this because it said it would pair via Bluetooth with PCs which is what i need it for and why i gave it 1 star. I will be returning if DOSS support does not respond with a fix for the driver.UPDATE***After writing the above review their support contacted me after a bit of back and forth I manually changed my computer's bluetooth driver to an older version. The SoundBox finally installed but then would still not pair correctly. DOSS customer service refunded the purchase cost and told me to keep it to work with other products if i was still not able to get it to work with my PC. After deleting the SoundBox off my computer and trying several different ways to load it back on i was finally able to pair it but i have to do this every time i turn on the computer which is a pain. So if you do purchase this for use with a PC be aware you might have a very hard time getting it to work. It does work well and easily with Galaxy S6. So i have changed my rating for 1 star to 3 stars because its a lot of work.
5,I have had this speaker for about 2 years now and I can honestly say it is a great little speaker. Bluetooth connecting is a breeze. It puts out quite a bit of sound that is very clear with just enough bass to know it. It will not be loud enough for a big party but that is not what I bought it for. I use it outside of my RV and it is plenty loud enough for that. I have dropped it too many times and it keeps on ticking.
2,Garbled and unintelligible.
4,Good Speaker for the money. Nice portable size. Battery lifeis decent. Sound quality is ok not the greatest  again for the price it's a buy.
5,Easily connects via Bluetooth. Clear loud sound. Great portable speaker.
4,This is the best price to quality ratio you are gonna find. Super easy to connect and swap devices amazing quality (almost the same as the bose soundboxes that are 3 times the price) and for the price is a steal.At first I thought it was too low sounding because they don't have a clear volume button but when I googled why it wasn't loud I found out you have to turn it up in a pretty cool but not obvious way.
5,I've been using a DKnight bluetooth speaker I picked up just about 2 years ago but felt I wanted something better and bought this.Interestingly I paid exactly the same price.  2 years is a long time for tech products and I'm shocked at how much nicer this one is.  It is far better built (solid heavy) and even the packaging is much more professional.  Seeing all those "name brand" bluetooth speakers costing some 3 or more times this I've no doubt they're gouging you.The thing I hated most about the DKnight speaker was that it didn't have separate volume control.  I had to press and hold the |< and >| button to decrease/increase volume.  If I accidentally released it too quickly it'd change tracks and if I held it for too long the volume would change more than I wanted.  This bad boy has separate volume control so no problems.  Funny some of those overpriced units don't have separate volume control either.If I had to say something negative the charging indicator light is under the micro-USB plug so it gets hidden by the USB plug.  No big deal.
5,Small with big sound.  It easy to take with you as you’re on the go.  Love it… no batteries just charge it like your phone
4,4 month review.Moderate useI use the Doss Sound Box in the café/bar at the Performing Arts Center I work at.The full sound leads many customers think the music is being piped in from another sourceI only use Micro SD cards not Bluetooth.Requires a recharge once or twice a weekPros:  - Powerful speakers rich sound.  - Good bass  - Easy to useCons:  -  Appetite for only high quality Micro SD cards with a speed of 80 MB/s  or better. Skips on slower speeds.  - Distortion slight vibration  at higher volume on louder pieces ( see attachment I used rubber bands to limit the grill vibration )  - Static noticeable on quiet music.  - Sound volume does not have a volume scale making it difficult to set a repeatable volume.The Sound Box performs well – worth the $30 price tag
4,I dig it. Sound could be a bit better but it could also be a lot more expensive. Which isn't to say it sounds bad just that compared to other more expensive units you can tell the difference but not so much as to leave you feeling like a cheapskate. I would have given this 5 stars but there is one thing that gets under my skin: It doesn't like to un-pair from one device to another. Even if I turn off bluetooth on the currently paired device whenever I turn on the speaker it still says it's paired to that device. I've turned off every bluetooth device in the house to make sure someone didn't pair it to something I don't know about but still it won't connect to my phone. I had to walk it outside of the house far far away from any other devices before it would pair back to my phone. Not sure what that's about but it bothers me. Also of all my bluetooth devices this one has the shortest range. maybe about 20 feet.
4,The red is a gorgeous shade if red. Connecting to Bluetooth was super easy. The touch buttons work as they should and the sound is very loud . At first I was upset because it was really low and I turn the volume to the max still low then I came and read a reveiw that indicated that I needed to turn the volume up on my phone.... silly me..... Just got it so I'm unable to speak about the battery life.
5,When a product is well made I think that it deserves some praise.  This little speaker offers some really nice sound at a very affordable price--$30 compared to $300 for my Bose Speaker. It connects easily with my Iphone and the charge lasts a good long time. Sure my Bose speaker has slightly better sound but this does the trick for me when I want some music on the go.  And in fact the sound quality difference between the two is not all that great in my humble estimation. (Not great enough anyway to justify Bose's inflated price.)
4,I'm going to leave my original post just in case anyone else runs into the same issue. However DOSS customer service came through brilliantly and sent my mom another speaker to replace the broken one when Amazon would not. Now she can enjoy her music again! Thanks for helping us out!After less than six months of gentle use the speaker's battery is totally shot. I bought my mom this speaker for use in her kitchen; she left is plugged in nearly 24/7 and now the battery is totally drained. Even plugged in to a different outlet with a different cable when connected the speaker's readout says that battery is dead. This is the second one we bought and the second one to fail within six months! There are plenty of other speakers out there save yourself the trouble.
5,This is an OUTSTANDING speaker for the price. It connects quickly and easily to your phone tablet or even smart TV.However you can only pair one device…check out the other Speaker that allows you to pair multiple speakers.
5,This little speaker packs a punch. I use it appropriately 7 hours a day and I only usuallyhave to charge it once or twice a week. Sound quality is excellent. Worth every penny I spent. Have been using for 11 months.
4,Needs more lists of Bluetooth appliances
5,Backyard music while sunbathe
4,Sound quality of this speaker is very good at least until you get to the top volume (looses bass and richness) and I've noticed that at lower volumes there is this inexplicable click sound every few minutes almost like the sound of you hit your hand against a love mic. Another thing I dislike is the fact that the volume on the device resets every time you turn it off and therefore have to manually turn it back up every time you want to listen to music.The Bluetooth connecting voice isn't pleasant... but it does connect quickly and with no apparent problems.I'm impressed with the battery immensely. Keep in mind it does take longer than you would expect to charge but what can you do?The LED's are a nice touch but I would like an option to adjust the brightness or turn them off as they are quite bright.Overall I like the item for the price and would recommend it over the liztec speaker of similar size and price that I also own.
5,I really like these doss speakers I bought myself one for my bathroom and my teenage daughter kept stealing it. So I went out and bought a two hundred dollar jbl speaker and gave my daughter my doss. I was thinking with the jbl I would be getting a better quality speaker but it sounds the same as the doss and doesn't keep charge as long as the doss. My family like ms the doss speaker so much I bought one for each of my girls room and I also have one at work. Overall it's a good sturdy speaker that is really loud!!
5,I bought this for a coworker and she loves it. She said that the sound quality is great and its loud.
5,I was hesitant to buy cheap Bluetooth speakers since I have a sony that is much more costly.  I wanted another speaker for outdoors and by pool that if damaged I could replace easily.  Also the Sony is quite heavy and only holds charge about three hours. I did some research and this Doss was too rated in cheaper model speakers. I am extremely happy I got it. I'm fact my daughter borrowed it and bought her own right away. Then my son was constantly borrowing both of ours so she bought him one also. I'm thinking of getting another as back up!  It's very light compared to Sony holds charge it seems like forever and is extremely durable. The sound is impressive for the cost. At max volume it is almost as loud as sony and almost as good. Clear and not tinny it doresnt sound cheap. I noticed at low volume it's sound I not as  deep and rich. I keep at max and use phone volume anyway. Is definately recommend this little  powerhouse! Very affordable at less than 30$.
4,this product is for more indoor usage. great overall product but needs to be a little more durable.
5,Excellent sound quality. Use it with my mp3 player. Worth the money. Would (will) buy again.
5,Great quality sounds. Smaller than I expected
5,Slightly exceeded my expectations. I was searching for a speaker for a small room it connected easily to device and I was shocked at the sound quality and loudness!  It has a touch screen control pad and overall looks pretty cool not a cheap piece of equipment by any stretch. Pleased with purchase and will more than likely get a few more of these.
5,Love it
5,I’ve gone on several long road trips with this and it’s never died while in the car. If you listen to a lot of heavy bass music it might not be the best speaker for you but besides that the sound quality is amazing. I don’t listen to a lot of heavy bass so I didn’t even notice until someone else put on their heavy bass music. I’d recommend buying!
4,I bought this speaker after buying a monitor with built-in speakers with sound was awful at best.  Struggled to get bluetooth to work for raspberry (had to use command line per instructions I found on Internet) but works fine now.  I would buy another one if needed the quality of the speaker is great!
5,I love the color. I connect this to my TV when everyone else goes to bed. The sound is great
4,Sounds fine no better than my Blackweb unit which cost $35 at Walmart. In fact comparing the 2 side by side the Blackweb unit has more bass. Nothing at all wrong with this product I bought based upon the reviews and price. Who could complain about the unit at this price? Operationally it is much nicer than the Blackweb until. The display for volume shows a different color for BT/direct connect/SDcard...the volume control is slick. I got the white one for my wife and it looks nice in the kitchen.
2,Pros: I love the analog volume control. Love it. And it has good bass for not having a separate sub-woofer.Cons: Bluetooth connection is iffy to poor. I've never had another BT device which forced me to go into settings to make a connection with an already paired device. Aggravating.The worst "feature" is that it turns off after fifteen minutes of non-use even when plugged in.  That sucks.  I'm reading and want music : it turned off. I step away come back hit Play: it turned off. So I have to turn it back on and then I wait to see if it will connect or if I have to go through the BT hassle again. Aggravating.There are rumors of firmware updates but they are not available on the Doss website.  You have to contact customer service and provide the serial number and proof of purchase.  WTH? I have this device in my hand. Why else would I need to download an update? I tried jumping through those hoops to no avail. Aggravating.I cannot speak to the battery life since mine is always plugged in on my desktop.Bottom line this device is too much of a pain for everyday use.
5,The sound is clear it's easy to use. I really like it.
5,Sound great beautiful case
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The product came in a nice box. The sound quality Bluetooth connection and battery life were good. It looked modern. I used it at home to play music when i was doing chores. Everything was good. But for the past 2 weeks it was dead. I recharged it and it played for a little then dead again. When i hit the On button it flashed like it was working but as soon as i released the On Off button it was dead.I added a video here so you know what i meant.
5,Had it over a month now love it sound good great battery life had to come back and leave a review this is a good buy
5,I bought a projector but the audio is very low and so I purchased this speaker to enhance the audio and wow it is amazing and I love how loud it is for such a small box. The only downfall is that when it is on low battery you will hear this beep that comes on every minute or two. But the battery life to this is very long!
5,This connects to my Fire T.V. and I keep it next to my bed so that I don't have to have the volume up too loud late at night.
3,The product is good quality. I did want a bit better sound quality so traded for a Bose.  It’s really a good product. Just preface for me.
5,Worked great. Not as loud as some but it lasted 4 years in an industrial setting. Being moved around the shop and stuffed in a tool box. Just ordered a replacement for it.
5,Wife love this speaker. Good sound  volume is decent  battery life is excellent. Just wish it had a bit more thump like my Anker soundcore.
4,Setup and bluetooth is easy. I'm generally very happy with them. My main complaint is too much treble and not enough bass.
4,Overall a good little speaker. For a fuller sound I would connect a bass unit.I wanted something I could use to listen to Prime Music on my laptop; this allows me to do that and to move the speaker around the house and continue to listen to music. I have wired speakers with fuller sound but obviously they lack the portability. I've also used the speaker while watching Prime Video and appreciated the fuller sound.
5,I bought this speaker because when my wife and I watch TV she needs the TV volume much louder than I do. I bought this small speaker to put on a table right next to her chair (ear). Solved the problem. My Samsung smart TV is Bluetooth equipped and the paring was almost automatic connected immediately. When I connect it with the TV I am able to use the mute and volume buttons on my remote to control the sound. The sound quality is excellent -better that the sound from the TV.This was definitely a win win!
4,works as described
5,The sound is amazing and loud and clear I love the modern style and is a perfect size it was definitely worth the money
5,Perfect
5,Great little sound box!  I use this in my classroom for children's music.  It's just perfect!UPDATE: Unfortunately the volume and sound quality of this soundbox have deteriorated after only 2 months of full use and then 6 months on the shelf (unused). Recently  I tried to use it with 2 different devices and the sound is so low you can't hear it.  Even with the devices volume turned up all the way.  So mad that this thing didn't even make it for a year!!  Don't buy it! It's clearly an inferior product.
5,Have had this about a month been using it in my dodge sprinter running it 4-5 hours a day.  I was concerned about the volume but found in another review the manufacturer replied that you must make a motion in the circle in a clockwise direction increase the volume which I don't recall seeing in the manual.  Well that works but sometimes it ends up going on mute maybe I'm to far out of the circle but do it enough the volume will raise.  After that it is smooth sailing to play music or mute the unit I tried it on bluetooth with my phone and it seemed to work well but I can't comment on using it for phone calls as I haven't done that.My only complaint so far is the unit 'talking' when you turn it on it says "entering bluetooth mode" or the like plug in a stereo cable and it says "aux in on" besides that it doesn't speak like volume off or shutting down.  I just don't like my gadgets telling me things I don't care about or already know but it is a minor gripe.
3,It's not like this is a bad speaker. The sound is okay -- a bit quieter than other speakers. The range is decent and the connectivity is fine as well. My major complaint is the design. First the on/off button is tiny and barely more than flush with the recessed back panel. You have to sort of stab it with your fingernail to manipulate it. Second the function buttons on the top are flush so that if you reach to pick up the unit while it is playing you are as likely as not to hit a button you did not intend to touch. That is fine I guess if you are listening to music. For an audio book podcast or cloud-DVR not so much since it is not uncommon to fast forward to the next chapter episode or recorded show. I suppose I could train myself to be more careful but that would mean using the product more and since the thing is so inconvenient I usually just use a different speaker. To my mind if a product to too inconvenient to want to use it is too inconvenient to want to buy. There are better options out there.
5,This is a totally underrated bluetooth speaker. It's dead simple to setup sounds great for the size and price battery lasts forever and even has external storage capability. It's so good I bought one for a gift then one for a white elephant this past xmas and then finally one for myself.Minor nits - better placement for the recharge light it sits under the cable when it is attached and you can't see the charge status at-a-glance. In later iterations they added a brief startup sound when turning the unit on - it really isn't needed because the unit already has a sound for the mode it is switching to when turned on.I would add one feature though - add the ability to scan through a song when holding down either previous and next buttons. Currently tapping the prev/next buttons goes to the prev or next track and there's no additional function when tap and holding said buttons.Ace product - highly recommended.
5,Love it
5,good
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I love this speaker so much and I have shown it to lots of customers.
4,This is the 3 one that I have ordered.  The quality just keeps getting worse on each one.  The charger messes up each time to the point where I can't charge the speaker 😒.  This one didn't even last for 3 months.I will not buy again.
4,Connects easily and integrates into windows sound controls perfectly; wife was not pleased with sound from her notebook sized PC ( speakers can only be so big )  so for less than $30 you can get better than PC sound that is clear and undistorted at full volume; not thrilled with the high tech volume control but at least it is an indicator that it is turned on and reduces the whole moving part thing with a volume control all in all a good purchase for the price.
4,Sounds great but only get about 20 feet from speaker before it starts to lose signal
3,The sound quality is crap. There's no bass or tremble to the sound.  Its not loud at all.
3,This is a nice little sound box for your phone but don't be fooled by the 12 Watts it state's in actuality it's 6 Watts per speaker that is side by side so actually it is putting out 6 Watts of power so don't be mislead as I was . I was buying it to replace another box that is 10 Watts But that is 10 watts per speaker as was stated 10 Watts of power.  I think when they say what the watts are that should be the output not divided in half so you only get half of what is advertised! Guess it's like saying my new car is 400 HP but divided by two wheels at 200 HP per wheel it's slower than a old vw rabbit LOL. Oh buy the way nowhere on the site does it say this you find out when you get it.
3,I recieved this about a month ago and was so excited after reading all the positive reviews. I usually use cheap 10 dollar speakers from big lots but recently started listening to more music and the sound quality on the cheap speakers are not that great. Since using this speaker I have had nothing but problems with the connection.  It will connect to bluetooth but after 15 minutes of non-use it disconnects and will not reconnect until it completely dies and is recharged again. I try to turn it off and the power button gets stuck and will not shut off. I like to connect my speaker to my phone to use as an alarm in the morning but it seems it has a non-use bluetooth disconnection of 15 minutes and turns off the bluetooth before morning time. ( you have to contact customer service for an update to turn off the built in power saver mode). I love the sound quality.  It's very loud and has no crackling with any type of music. I just wish it didn't have problems connecting and staying connected to bluetooth. I read the manual and tried all the problems shooting issues
5,I love this Bluetooth. My beloved original Bluetooth bit the dust when the charger started sparking!  I purchased this and could not be happier I use it at work to make the day go by faster. The sound quality is ok but for 28.00 not bad but the battery life is amazing. I can use it for days before I have to charge it. It connects very fast. I would recommend this 1000%. My only complaint is that I cannot figure out how to not have my phone ring through it but that is minor.
5,I've had no problems with this little speaker bought on Prime day and the battery lasts a long time.  Much better sound than the side by side computer speakers I used at work.  Easy to throw it in a bag and set up wherever music is needed.
5,This was a great buy and I'm very happy. I waited a couple of months to review it since I read about other people who bought it and had technical issues in a short time after i had no such problems what so ever and i use it almost exclusively with my echo. In fact I bought it to use in my backyard this summer and even the high heat didn't effect it although i did minimize or shade it on the hottest days. The range is pretty far my echo is on the second floor of my house but i can still use this speaker poolside with only occasional range interference in some spots of my backyard. The sound is nice and clear and the volume is excellent especially for it's size. I was a little skeptical to buy but glad i did because at this price this was a quality buy and I absolutely recommend this product. I included the pic so you can get a good gauge of it's size.
5,Great product exactly as described nicely packaged very clear & loud sound. 👍
3,Worked great for 11 months. I used it about once a week for an hour or two just for reference. However I recently brought it in my backyard for the first time and it broke right away. I listened to music for a while outside it was sitting in direct sunlight in about 85 degree weather. It probably sat for 3 hours total 2 of which it wasnt in use but was just sitting outside. When I brought it back in to use it that night it no longer would power on. I tried charging it and resetting but nothing works. So I am forced to trash it after 3 hours in the sun. The durability should be much better as even the cheapest cell phone can survive a few hours in the sun.Edit: After posting this review the company sent me a new speaker for free without my request. Obviously this is well intended customer service and that is appreciated and noted. However the speaker went to my old address as the seller did not bother to contact me first. Further this company found my facebook which is NOT linked to my Amazon account and tried to message me about my review after there was a delivery confirmation of the new speaker. I dont think they should be messaging customers on their personal social media accounts about an Amazon review.  I did add an additional star after seeing that they sent the new speaker as proof of standing by their product.
4,I have had this for just a few days. For the price I say the sound quality construction and features are amazing!I almost returned it because I could not find the tiny little led under the charge port which is the charging indicator.I thought the top round LED should turn on as indicators for charging and that it was not charging.Then I looked in the manual and sure enough there is a pin hole LED right under the charge port that indicates charging status.It will be steady red when charging and steady green when fully charge.When I found that LED and saw it operating I got the peace of mind that my unit is not defective. It would be better if the main larger LEDs where used for this purpose as well as that thing is tiny and it hides under the charge port.Other than that I am extremely happy with this purchase so far.
5,I looked at several options for a Bluetooth speaker before purchasing. I live in a two bedroom apartment and didn't really need something big or TOO loud (neighbors and all). I liked the price on this one and took a chance.Others have given very detailed reviews as far as the technical stuff goes so I'll forgo that. I'll just say this speaker fits my particular needs perfectly. The sound is amazing for its size and I can hear it from any room in my apartment. It was smaller than I expected and was concerned at first. But once I set it up those fears proved unfounded. There's a whole lot of sound coming from this powerful box!Set up was as easy as turning on the Bluetooth settings from my devices and clicking a button once the speaker was identified. I especially like using it from my Kindle using Amazon Music but it works for my music on my laptop and phone just as well. if you're looking for a small space saving Bluetooth speaker that packs a great sound punch I would recommend this one.
5,The touch functions on speaker work great the lighting is pretty cool and the sound is good. Well worth what I paid.
5,These work well for my kindle reader and playing music on the boat.  Quick connectivity easy controls and nice power saving setting
4,It's a great speaker. I only wish it was a bit louder.
5,This ended up being a perfect product for what I needed.  I bought this as a gift for my grandmother who is 91.  She is hearing impaired and needed to be able to watch TV and listen to music without having to turn the volume up so loud that she disturbs everyone else in the house.The controls on top are touch sensitive which is great because she doesn't have much hand strength to press buttons.  We have her tv wires into the aux port and she listens to music via Bluetooth from her phone.  Her eyesight isn't great so I was worried about her seeing the buttons.  The mode phone and skip buttons are illuminated in white and are spaced out around the volume control.  The volume control illuminates red for auxiliary use and blue for Bluetooth use.  It also makes different sound when entering Bluetooth and aux modes so she can tell without looking if she hit mode too many times.  So it has some accessibility friendly attributes that made it perfect for my needs
4,Battery life is pretty good haven’t had to charge it in a month or so. Connects easy. Only thing is the sound doesn’t compare to the really expensive speakers but I’d say it’s good for the price of it
4,I bought this speaker after trying the amazon basic wireless speaker with disappointment. This Doss speaker is a vast improvement. I use it in the garage workshop to listen to radio streaming or podcasts while working. It has decent performance. It's not going to blow you away with volume or sound quality but it doesn't distort a reasonable sound levels.  It connected to my phone as expected  no issues. Taking calls works great. Although people that know your voice will ask "where are you sounds like you're in a tunnel ".  I generally leave it plugged in but does have decent charge life. It comes out of the box with a plastic overlay explaining the top controls. Don't throw it away.  I dug it out of the trash after quickly forgetting what each button does and not being able to see the permanent printing well. I leave it place and you can activate the buttons/controls fine until you memorize them.
5,This is a great little speaker!  It’s powerful and clear and the volume can be adjusted right at the speaker. I don’t have to go back to the phone to change the volume. I am really glad I got it.
2,I can’t properly review as it is missing the cord. Purchased as a gift and opened today and no cord which was part of the package.
5,Sound is good better if put on a wood shelf.  Responds well to graphic equalizers. Volume is adequate of only 6 watts. Fills but not overwhelm a 28'x20' area with 13' vaulted great room ceiling.  Build is fine. No edges or screw-heads to look at. Control light on top somewhat bright but turn it over at night or put something on it. Bluetooth pairs easily with phones tablet and a dongle for the netbook. Really like it takes a 32GB microSD card. (That's 200+ hours of .mp3 @320Kbps. I use that feature for all day music. Plays in sequence on the mocroSD card Help Desk is great. Wanted to random play microSD card. Takes a piece of software provided by the Help Desk. Somewhat awkward procedures. Recommend this item so much bought its cousin the Traveler with rouged/outdoor case and 10 watt sound. An upgrade from the Amazon Basics. Battery life is as advertised Range is good take it from room to room.
4,Bought in August of 2016 so not a year old yet.  Will only stay on for about 20 minutes.  Its not dead I think its overheating perhaps.  Either way I loved it when It worked. I thought it was too good to be true. turns out I was right.EDIT:  I was not aware that there was a 1 year warranty.  The seller reached out to me and sent me a replacment super fast and it works great.  True test will be the longevity but as of now I am super happy with the product.  I didn't speak much on the quality of the audio on the original review because I was kind of upset that it had died on me but I give the quality an 8.5 out of 10.  It sounds as good as all of the sub $100 big brand name ones.  Its no Bose but its as good as the JBL and the cheaper Sony ones.
4,Great sound BUT after just a couple of weeks of use battery was very intermittent.  Result of low battery is an annoying beep about every 30 seconds during play.  After charging it for 3 days I turned it back on to play music but immediately began getting the low battery beeping again.  For the price the sound is great but I cannot deal with the constant battery beeping while I'm trying to listen to music.  I'm going to exchange it for an identical speaker.  If this one gives me the same problem I'll return it and try another brand.
5,This speaker works great when I’m working in my garage or just hanging out in the backyard. Very clear easy to use. Battery life pretty good only charged it twice since I bought it. but I only use it on the weekends for a few hours. Total recommend this if anyone looking for a portable speaker.
3,This works okay as long as you don't want loud music. It is fine for a smaller apartment or an individual room.
5,Nothing to complain about! It works great and battery last a long time
5,Nice little speaker
5,Super loud powerful speaker and great run time.  I bought this speaker when I was driving a cab and I wanted to listen to my own music.  It usually made it through a 12 hour shift without needing to be charged.  Now I use it for listening to audio books when I'm driving or I use it when I'm watching movies outside on my projector.  It has enough amplitude and a full enough sound that it's all I need for my back yard theater.Pros: Long battery life.  Super loud.  Moderately configurable though firmware updates from the manufacturerCons: A LITTLE bit of a buzz with some bass frequencies.  Can't set it to true alphabetical playback from SD card.  If you've used cheap MP3 players from China you'll know the problem.  It will play ABCD then jump to RSTLN then jump to JKL then go to WXYZ.  So it plays "pseudo alphabetical" and there is nothing you can do to change that.  It's either that or random playback.
4,Great little speaker for in the car. I use it for listening to audio books and it works great for that. Bluetooth to my phone was a breeze. Battery life is much greater than I expected and it fits nicely in the glove box in my car. Great value for the price.
1,I bought this speaker to replace a small BOSE unit that finally died after several years of faithful service. No the DOSS unit doesn't sound as good but that's not a very fair comparison considering that the DOSS speaker is 1/3 the cost of the BOSE. At this price point I guess the sound quality is fine.The massive letdown is the INCREDIBLY annoying sound effects that this device makes. I don't know who thought that it needs to play an entire jingle every time your phone connects or disconnects but they were wrong. Very wrong. It is SO annoying.I'd read some other reviews that said it plays a low-battery-warning sound that is pretty obnoxious but I thought "how bad could it really be?" Now I know and they were right. To use the word "obnoxious" is being kind.I'd return this thing if not for the fact that I've already disposed of the packaging. But the sound effects are so terrible that it makes me want to just throw it away.I emailed the DOSS tech support account about the terrible sounds and did in fact receive a quick reply. They said that the sounds could be reduced with a firmware update but first they'd need to know the batch/version number from my speaker and provided me with some instructions to retrieve the information. But...wait for it...the instructions didn't work.Meh. You get what you pay for and I should've paid for another BOSE.
2,I bought this speaker for my zoom calls and worked well for a couple of months then it stopped working all of a sudden. I understand the lifetime for this kind of product compared to its price but didn’t expect to last such a shot period of time.
3,Buen precio sin embArgo su anterior generación esta mejor en Calidad audio q paso??
5,I've had this speaker for some time now. I use it at work as I am a butcher and work in a cold damp environment. The sound quality is very good! Battery life is good as well! Have left  unused for weeks without use and still runs for hours on end. Durable as to the cold and moisture too! I paid considerably more than it is currently selling for a couple of years ago. This actually rivals the $130 Bose speaker I just received as a bday gift. I feel this is a great value for the price and highly recommend this speaker!
5,This was exactly what I needed! Wonderful purchase and it works very well! I'm pleased!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Excellent little speaker. Sound is great for the money....$26. I ordered three different speakers to compare sound quality and this one sounded the best even then the more expensive one's. Listen to the video using a Blutooth speaker and hear the sound quality. Base could be a little better but for the price and size this is the best you can get without spending $75 or more.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This little speaker packs a punch! Sounds good with hard bass songs or rock/ alternative rock.  Like that you can connect your ipod or save songs to a microsd. My only complaint is that it beeps or talks.  Have to turn that off since I plan on bringing this to work.  Can't have it beeping every time. Otherwise love it!Design is very modern too. Looks good in any room.
4,Very easy to set up volume control could be  raised more for easier manipulation. Sound is very good with only slight vibration of the speaker housing on a couple of songs. All in all a very good unit for the money I would recommend it to others.
5,Outside use for a small crowd. Great sound
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Functional and a great addition to my beach bag. I use this little speaker everywhere at home - garden kitchen porch office & bathroom. Have never had an issue with sand or water. Volume is a little tricky for me so I keep it at a higher level and adjust with my phone. Well worth the money! This is the 5th beach trip this unit has been to.
4,Good products. Sound quality is normal.Bluetooth connection is fast. The volume control need to be improve.
5,Bought to amplify my 2nd gen echo dot unfortunately when i received it it automatically turns off after 15 minutes of playing no music. Was going to return it but saw people here contacted customer support of doss for firm ware. they mailed me an SD card to update the firmware and now my echo dot is linked to my speaker when its on and i dont have to worry about it turning off every 15 minutes. Pleasently surprised and a good inexpensive speaker atlogether.
5,I ordered this after reading some pretty good reviews . What was right was that the sound  was good. unfortunately it went down hill from there . It did link to my Bluetooth phone but none of the controls  volume advance and pause worked . The lights stay on all the time in spite of the instruction manual identifying it as a trouble shooting problem and requiring a reboot.Because I could not get the controls to work I contacted customer service from their website and got a quick reply. They asked my to download an upgrade which required my loading it on an micro SD card and inserting it upside down in the slot in the back of the speaker . Unfortunately that did nothing to solve the problems. Then I got a PLEASANT SURPRISE. The supplier unsolicited offered to send me a replacement unit at no cost and they did it immediately. That was impressive and for my money may be the most important thing about this transaction. Good speaker but even better customer service
5,Fulfills its purpose so far. Battery life bass volume and controls haven't let us down yet. Especially at this price.The only reason to look at other options would be for waterproofing multi-speaker configurations a preference on where the device was made (good luck) or a smaller form factor (at the cost of audio quality). The bluetooth range is pretty good - to the point we can only have 1 phone with its bluetooth on in the house. It'll connect to the one 60ft away before the one right next to it if that one was paired initially.We also have a large portable speaker with more power and it's all but retired after the convenience of the smaller speaker without a noticeable difference in audio. The only difference is if we need it really loud - like for a 20 person BBQ this little guy doesn't stay as uniform through the frequencies as the big one. Keep it below 80% or so and you won't have this issue which is actually quite loud for indoor spaces.
4,I like the sound quality and the battery life but the Bluetooth connectivity is kind of a pain in the rear still a good speaker for the price
2,I struggle every time we try to connect with a device even though it has been paired with the same device before
5,Pretty good. Sound is about what you would expect for a speaker of this size & cost. It’s not booming bass but it’s fine. Size is good for travel & battery seems pretty good. Bluetooth pairing is easy. Buttons on speaker are a bit weird but just use buttons on your phone. Good speaker for audiobooks / podcasts - which is why I bought it. Bigger speaker with too much bass / low end is not my favorite for voice
5,I ordered this speaker as a gift for my son. He was pleasantly surprised about the volume intensity and the quality of the sound. He seemed very pleased and I'm sure he will enjoy it on his patio or wherever. It is a nice  size and easily portable and a great value. He had no problem pairing it with music on his android phone. Overall I am very happy I made this purchase.
4,I have had this speaker for over 6 months now & it still works great!! I charge it twice a week (& I use it pretty much from 7-3 Mon thru Fri!) Sometimes I have to reconnect my bluetooth because it doesn't recognize it but that may be my phone. I use it in the office & it sounds great. I wish the volume wasnt a circular touch dial. That annoys me because I never get it how I want it & have to adjust on my phone. But all in all I love it &just  ordered one for the house. And my boss got one for his office.
2,So far I like this speaker but it did not come with the USB charging cord. It shows in the instructions it should be in the box but it wasnt. I did have a cord to fit it but it was still an aggravation. So buyer beware that you may or may not get the charging cord if you buy this product.
1,Summary:1. Unusable for audiobooks.  The speaker cuts power to the drivers between sentences and you end up missing words.2.  I have tried to contact 'support@dossav.com' multiple times but never got an answer.3.  I now have a $25 paper weight.  I bought the Oontz Angle instead and am very happy with it.  Get the OontzDetail:Here is the exact email I sent to support but they never answered.  I could not find an alternate way to contact them.I mostly listen to audio books  The sound from my DOSS soundbox is so “interuppted” I cannot listen to it.  By “interrupted” I mean that the speaker appears to turn itself off between sentences.  The “interrupted” issue is similar to the effect you get from a voice activated recorder where the beginning of words are cut off because the recorder is starts just a bit too late after hearing a word.Sample:Actual spoken words:“One thing he could see it would require work hard uninterrupted work.  He rolled up his sleeves and began to concentrate”What I hear through the speaker:“One thing he could see it would require work hard uninterrupted work.  <He> rolled up his sleeves and began to concentrate”The word “He” is completely missing in the second sentence.  This happens all the time with DOSS Soundbox and doesn’t happen when I listen on the phone’s internal speaker.  There is a little background hiss when listening to the story or music and even the hiss stops during the pause between the words “work” and “rolled”.  This complete lack of hiss makes me think the speaker has turned itself off.  The interruption occurs between almost all sentences and even within some sentences that have a comma.  The backlighting on the control doesn’t blink so I don’t think the whole unit has powered down just that the circuitry has temporarily cut power to the speaker drivers.I think the speaker turns off when the input signal drops below a certain level but is turning off too quickly.  It should allow for a longer pause in the signal before cutting power to the speaker.  The pause doesn’t occur when I listen to music via Spotify.  Music tends to have a more constant signal which reinforces my belief that the speaker turns off when the signal drops below a certain level.I don’t mind losing the 15-minute auto-off feature if losing that feature will make it so I can listen to audio books.
5,N/A
5,I bought this speaker to listen to music at work. I work the overnight shift and it gets quiet and lonely lol. So they said I couldn’t wear my Bluetooth headphones at work. It works great and everything. Love the sound quality and the battery life. It goes a distance in the store. It was definitely worth the price. Got it on prime day. I’d definitely buy another one.
5,This like speaker has a great sound.  The battery life is superb. The base could be better.
4,Great product! Battery life is superb and connectivity was simple. Sound is VERY good...could be crisper but for the price you seriously can't beat it.  I would definitely recommend.
5,Great sound quality rich bass and strong dynamic range from a small speaker. Setup was a breeze: just turn it on in range of your Bluetooth device and wait for the confirmation beep. Haven’t verified whether it’s waterproof: I’m not inclined to sit out in the rain and I have other music options when I’m inside. I have unfortunately verified that it’s “drop-proof”! A clumsy move on my part but better I dropped the $25 speaker than the iPhone XR! Overall I’m quite happy with the purchase and recommend this speaker to anyone who wants an inexpensive durable option for music on the go.
5,Just what I needed :) Love it!
5,The sound is OK sometimes sounds a little off. But that could be in the television stationbut overall sound is good.  Battery life seems to be ok.
4,Sound quality goes down as you turn up the volume but still a good speaker for the money.
5,Sounds as good as factory speakers in a new car. Can't turn it up loud (with my phone)but Sounds good.
5,Works very well.
5,Bought this for my son for Christmas and he loved it.  Perfect blue tooth speaker with great sound quality.A+++++++
3,It’s a okay speaker overall. But if you try to customize your sound it will have a hard time.I was using Spotify and I have it on bass booster and the speakers were freaking out and I turned it off and it was producing the “right” sound lolIf you want a okay speaker overall this is a perfect one
4,Purchased this speaker along with a echo dot. Speaker works great no complaints here. For the price you can't beat the sound quality. I read a view reviews that didn't like the auto shut off feature. This speaker hasn't shut off while being connected to my echo dot. The one I purchased only shuts off if it's not connected to anything and not being used which I think is great for saving the battery charge. The only complaint I have which isn't really a big deal is the power button being on the back of the speaker. I have the speaker sitting on a shelf so every time I need to turn it on I have to grab it off the shelf to turn the power on. If it was located on top of the speaker it could be turned on without removing the speaker from the shelf but like I said really no big deal. Very pleased with this speaker!
4,For the price you can’t go wrong with this speaker. Build / Quality / battery life above average. I was just looking for something to play my music whilst i did my indoor rides. Definitely would recommend.
5,This speaker is great for the price point. The sound is solid and I haven’t had any issues so far. Looks more expensive than it is too.
3,It’s ok the sound is very tinney.  I wish there was a way to change the tone so there would be more bass.  But what else would you expect for $25?
5,This is a nice Bluetooth speaker with crisp highs and a fair amount of lows and mid-range compared to other Bluetooth speakers in this price range this is one that I could recommend to others that are looking for a nice Bluetooth speaker on a budget I  am giving  it 5 stars because the TF card reader wouldnt play all MP3's all the way through and I've contacted customer service they have resolved my issue they have returned my message with helpthe speaker is very nice and he has good sound for the price on a side note the LED lit touch controls are a nice touch just wish that they would turn off after a minute but they do they stay lit the whole time so if you're thinking of using this speaker at night keep in mind it stays lit and can be somewhat bright if you're trying to sleep other than that I think it's a good speaker for the price. I have contacted the manufacturer about the issue and they have resolved my issue and feel they are a top notch company would by this again.
4,Just received the package today. I love the look of the speaker. Good size. Easy to connect to Bluetooth. Battery lasts pretty all day and I use the speaker often to listen to my music. Only thing I would improve is the bass. I would’ve loved it to have more base. Other than that I like it!
5,It's the best speaker you can find. Great fidelity.  I had another one that cost me $70 and wasn't even close to this one in sounds and functionality.
4,Hooked it up to my echo dot and produces good sound for the price.
5,I love my speaker so much I bought all my kids one for Christmas in different colors. And by the way the colors are so beautiful. For the price this speaker is amazing. I bought mine 2 years ago and I use it like crazy. I have an echo dot 3rd generation and this speaker is very compatible to it. Maybe even better. The battery life after charge is very long.  Love it that I can take it anywhere. It's just a great great deal. Do not hesitate to buy this.
3,Not loud....
4,Very good sounds  nice speaker
5,We love this speaker! Especially for music around the house. Very great volume quality and overall very happy with it
5,Amazing batter so far I haven’t charged it yet and I’ve had it for about 2 weeks. I definitely recommend
4,This little speaker puts out nice quality sound for the money.  I've had one intermittent but persistent problem.  On about every third use or so it fast forwards on its own to the next track (and sometimes does so for 5-6 tracks until it stops).  It's done this when paired with my PC and my I-phone and it's done it while playing a playlist of downloaded songs in I-tunes and when playing music streaming from YouTube. So there is no doubt that it's an issue with the speaker vs. with some particular hardware with which it's paired or software providing the music.
4,Only used for a couple of hours but so far was easy to use and volume control was great.
5,Very pleased with this Bluetooth speaker! I have had it for approximately one month and I’ve used it every day since purchasing. It pairs very easily each time and sound quality is quite good. It works for a good amount of time before needing to be charged again. I would definitely buy it again. I also purchased the protective carrying case to store it in when needed (sold separately).
5,SY FY SPEAKER HERE ELEGANT SPEAKER THE CONTROLS ON TOP ARE BACKLITE AND BRIGHT LED LARGE AND EASY TO SEE TOUCH RESPONSIVE THE VOLUME CONTROL LIGHTS UP BLUE IN BLUE TOOTH MODE AND RED IN AUX. SPEAKER MODE AS ADVERTISED BATTERY LIFE NICE COMPACT SPEAKER THAT FEELS SOLID(HAS HEFT TO IT NOT CHEAPLY MADE) HIGHS ARE EXCELLENT AND BASS IS GOOD FOR THIS SIZE(i AM 58 AND HARD OF HEARING BUT CAN NOTICE SOUNDS IN SONGS I NEVER KNEW WHERE THERE) THE ONLY TWO LITTLE ITEMS i NOTICED WAS SPEAKER AT MAX VOLUME WILL VIBRATE AND CAUSE SPEAKER TO CRAWL FORWARD ON THE RIGHT SIDE FACING SPEAKER SLIGHTLY AND WHEN USING SPEAKER ON AUX MODE CONNECTED TO MY TV AND PLUGGED IN TO CHARGE PORT THAT THE SPEAKER BATTERY WILL NOT LAST MORE THAN 8 HOURS. CHARGER DOES NOT KEEP UP WITH CONTINUOUS USE. HEY FOR THE PRICE CANNOT BE BEAT AND LOOKS GOOD ON MY TABLE FOR MY MINI STEREO SETUP FOR LISTENING TO MY SONGS VIA MY TABLET. FAST PICKUP OF AVAILABLE BLUETOOTH SIGNALS PACKAGED LIKE A HIGH DOLLAR PHONE OR TABLET. BUY IT.....
5,Worked as expected with a good volume level and quality of sound. Easy Bluetooth connection
5,My teenage son loves this speaker! Great quality sound easy to carry and fashionable!
4,I WOULD HAVE RATED THIS 5 STAR  (FOR THE MONEY) EXCEPT FOR FREQUENT CONNECTIVITY DROPS IN THE BLUETOOTH SIGNAL.  ALSO I WAS COMPARING IT TO MY Ultimate Ears BOOM 2 LE Limited Edition Wireless Speaker Phantom WHICH HAS A MUCH BETTER BASS AND SOUND CLARITY BUT FOR $75. COMPARED TO $25 FOR THIS ONE. OVERALL I DO THINK THIS IS A GOOD LOW END SPEAKER IF YOUR BLUETOOTH CONNECTION IS STRONG. THIS ONE AND THE BOOM 2 WHILE SITTING IN THE SAME PLACE CAUSED SIGNAL DROPS IN THIS ONE BUT NOT IN THE BOOM 2.
5,This speaker produces excellent sound most impressive for the size. The sound is very pure and non-distorted unlike many portable speakers. The speaker creates a good sound stage and solid bass without "booming" bass. (It won't rival your sub woofer but the bass is tight and solid.) The volume output is very good and it has no problem filling a medium sized room with sound.Battery life is impressive. After a full charge it has no problem playing for 6 to 7 hours at high volume.The company seems to be very reliable and focused on good customer service. There was a charging problem with my first unit and I contacted Wonders Technology Co. Ltd directly (rather than returning to Amazon) and they promptly sent me a replacement unit once it was determined that my first unit wasn't charging. The new unit works well.I can highly recommend this speaker. The only suggestion I would offer the manufacturer is to beef up the USB charging port a bit that is what failed on my initial unit. Otherwise this thing is great.
5,The speaker that came built in with my gazebo broke after 1 week. I got this to use in my gazebo. It is perfect. Easy to use nice sound. Paired with my phone quickly and easily. It's exactly what I was looking for and the price was right.
4,This speaker is pretty great overall in terms of sound quality battery life etc. However my main concern is that I’ve bought 3 of these and they’ve all had the same issue. After months of using the speaker is unable to charge might be malfunctions within charging port itself. Cause this has happened to all 3 I’ve bought. Pls look into this.
4,For the price it’s a decent speaker. Something you could take to the park and not worry about losing or getting damaged. The bass is hardly there loud enough to hear too much treble kinda sounds like a narrow hall way if that makes sense. Decent. I don’t mind that I bought it but I wouldn’t return it. 4/5 !
5,Got this speaker for my husband as part of his Father’s Day gifts. We have the echo dot but he loves listening music while he showers and I wanted to get him something where he could connect his own phone to it and listen his own music. We are pretty impressed by the overall quality. The sound is really good the style of the speaker is very sleek and the “touch” feature is pretty nice too. He’s very happy with it and uses it everyday. I would totally recommend this product to someone looking for a nice speaker at a decent price point that doesn’t break the bank.
5,I bought it for father’s day and ended up getting one for myself as well. We work in the yard and on the orchard on the weekends. I charged up once and listen to Spotify. It does the job is simply to figure it out and there is no drama connecting to the bluetooth. Cannot find a better one for the price.
5,Works great
5,I use it when I am listening to music on my phone. You don't realize the quality of the music that comes from that small speaker. If you are looking for a small and one with good quality...TRY THIS ONE!!
5,This speaker is perfect for my needs. I use it on my lanai and to lull me to sleep.
5,Love the fact its touch for the buttons didn't know that till it arrived lol apparently didn't read everything like I thought. Very loud! I absolutely love the color I picked. I definitely recommend! After it's been fully charged it does stay charged longer than it says. Let it completely die when you first it get it I used mine straight from the box then charge it fully. Battery life is awesome! Sound quality is great! Bluetooth distance is good as well.
2,Had volume maxed and still could barely hear it. Had it right next to me and the beach sounds we’re washing out the music
5,So far so good! Great sound no issues with connectivity even at farther distances and the battery has solid lasting power.
5,I've had this for about 6 months and used it a lot. Easy to use via blue tooth or direct plug in. Good sound quality.
5,Great grand has health issues but loves listening to music this was perfect for him!!
4,Not a bad speaker for the price. Good range and pretty decent sound.
4,First I really do enjoy this speaker and recommend it for anyone seeking a low cost above average in sound speaker.I purchased this speaker as to have music in my kitchen. While I do enjoy the sound of B&O or BOSE I couldn't justify spending that much on my current income. So I took a chance on these.I do enjoy the unit and use it almost everyday. The sound is above average and fits my needs. It does get loud ( some reviews I read when investigating my purchase say it doesn't get loud don't believe it)For the price and how well it works I think you are getting a GREAT deal as a buyer. The reason for the 4 star is just simply because the sound did not have that same impressive "wow" factor as the $100+ units.Final thought: great product very happy with the purchase and recommend it to anyone lookin for an above average Bluetooth speaker.
2,Nice speaker but very little bass
5,The order took longer than normal. It took over a week. I normally receive orders within a week. I received the package (3-24-17). There is suppose to be a rain proof case with the order. There wasn't one. However I haven't contacted the seller yet. I'm sure they will take care of it. I'll leave a review on that subject afterwards. For the size of the speaker it has beautiful sound. My daughter loves it. She uses a 32gig micro sd card with it....plenty of good sounding music. We are a family of musicians and singers. We know sound. I personally love to hear bass in music and I can honestly say the bass sounds good! So we give this little box a Big thumbs up for it's sound and size.One more issue is every once in a while it skips like a scratched cd. Why I don't know. But it doesn't do it often enough to interfere with enjoying good sounding music.We haven't tried using the bluetooth so we can't comment on that. It was solely bought for portable music.
5,The speaker was very easy to setup. Sound quality meets all expectations. Just waiting for case to arrive.
5,Highly recommend to purchase it 🙂 Sound audio is amazing 🤩
3,Good size speaker. It has worked well for few months. However the power button does stick and sometimes does not power on.
5,It connected very easily and works great. Has great sound projection. Does what it’s supposed to
5,I bought this to replace a different bluetooth speaker and I'm super impressed with the sound and look of this speaker. It's surprisingly heavy making it feel like really high quality. The sound is simply amazing. I kind of wish it could get a little louder but the sound quality is so clear crisp and beautiful I really can't complain. Connecting with bluetooth is super easy. My dad who is very anti-tech savvy can use this device no problem. Would buy again!
4,When I bought this I loved it. Decent sound for the price easily portable easily paired using Bluetooth. I did notice some buzz with bass notes but I used it mainly for audio books. Then after 8 months of limited use it just died. It has plenty of charge but it won't turn on. Others seem to have the problem too. Reading reviews seems to show that regardless of the price none of these are without lemons. I wish quality was a value in the techno industry. Buying a Bose and hoping for better luck.UPDATE: Within a week of writing my review a new DOSS soundbox was delivered to my door from Wonders Tech. This is customer service that's unheard of! Raising my stars to 4 and if the DOSS holds up will update to a 5 star. Whether you're interested in the Soundbox or something I strongly support Wonders Tech!!!
5,Really great little speaker. Sound quality is good looks just like the picture easy to connect to
4,I would recommend this to my friends who are looking to not spend much $
5,This speaker is pretty good for the price and it has a decent sound. The only inconvenient I experienced so far has been the bluetooth connectivity which on occasion gets interrupted. I have an old WAE bluetooth speaker I purchase at Costco for $60 bucks and I use it a lot while riding my bicycle or hiking. I tried using this one on my bicycle and as I go over bumps the connection gets lost. The WAE has taken falls drops etc and never looses connectivity. So again good purchase but keep it indoors. The initial sounds when you turn it own and off are pretty annoying but I hear there is a work around that and I'll be contacting the manufacturer for assistance. All in all a good purchase and it would be a good gift this Christmas.Update: I recently contacted the manufacturer to remove the on and off prompts. The customer service was outstanding their representative Milla responded the same day and emailed me the files needed as well as a video.
2,I returned this bluetooth speaker the same day I received it. I don't understand some of the reviews which claim that the speaker has excellent sound quality and bass it absolutely doesn't. It sounds like the music is coming from a tin can. I don't expect super sound quality from a Bluetooth speaker in this price range but for $10 more I purchased the OontZ Angle 3 Ultra and that one is unbelievable. I suppose this speaker would be fine for listening to audio books but if you're looking for excellent sound quality in a Bluetooth speaker for under $50 go with something from OontZ.
5,This is my second one. The first one I got almost 5 years ago. This thing has played sooooo many hours of my music. It’s been outdoors in my bathroom blasting during shower time playing country music during my many 14 hour brisket smokes. It’s been great. Yesterday it started skipping songs by itself on my playlist. Then the lights on top were blinking. My good buddy gave up... so I bought a new one and it looks the exact same. Buy this speaker for less than $30 it won’t disappoint.
5,Good Bluetooth speaker. I don’t have any complaints.
4,I bought this to use in the mechanic shop I work in. Its plenty loud has a pretty good battery life too. Has some weird software programmed in that makes it shut down every fifteen minutes if it thinks it's not being used. Not a problem when my phone is connected to it but it was turning off when playing music through my laptop. It also plays a noise every time it turns on/off and dis/connects to a device. Comes with an Aux cable and USB cable for charging. Very easy to connect to and as long as Bluetooth is on it automatically connects to my phone. Overall very happy with the purchase .
5,I bought this to use with my Echo Dot. I first tried to connect it via aux cord (it did work but it had a lot of static and white noise)  but there was some interference from something (possibly because I had both the speaker and the Echo plugged in the same power slot). I didn't really try to resolve the issue that hard because the unit has Bluetooth connectivity. Connecting via Bluetooth was very simple but I ran into the issue of the unit turning off after 15 minutes if no music is playing. This is intentional on the part of the manufacturer to conserve battery life. However I bought this unit specifically for use with my Echo so I want the speaker to remain on at all times. As noted in customer questions they will email you a firmware fix for this issue if you want. I got a response in less than 20 minutes and the firmware update was very simple all that was needed was a micro sd card of 32 gb or less. I wish all customer service was this good!
5,This is our daily use speaker for when we're cleaning house or otherwise partying. Sound quality is absolutely stellar for its size; I was worried about it being tinny or hollow like some low-quality speakers but this one's great. The controls remind me of old-school iPod rings for volume and such and you can adjust volume and change the song through your phone connection (depending on your app maybe I use it most often with Spotify). Battery life on it is nuts. We'll take it on weekend trips and don't have to charge it at all after all-day use for two or three days. The only thing that annoys me is that the bluetooth distance isn't great; if you move your phone more than 10-15 feet from the speaker it starts losing connection but that's a small price to pay. I love this thing. Super recommended.
5,My husband was pleasantly surprised at the ease of connectivity and sound. You can't best it at this price!
4,I bought two speakers on prime day and I LOVE this one. The other one I bought was awful so I think I'm going to take a loss on that one and return it and buy another one of these. Of course it's not crazy powerful since it's small and cheap but it's really aesthetically pleasing has really good sound for the size enough that it doesn't need to be turned all the way up. I haven't had  problems with low battery life and I love that I can switch the songs from the speaker itself instead of having to get my phone. The Bluetooth range is pretty good I can go into the next room usually without it shutting off. I got this so I didn't have to lug around my normal speaker system (which still isn't big but it's not wireless) when I took showers or cooked dinner and this is great for that purpose.
5,This won't get posted. This is not about the product but the new Amazon delivery. I live in the city and never have I had packages delivered like this. Why didn't they also put a sign with a big finger pointing and saying "FREE". The other 3 major delivery companies bring packages to the top and set them in the right corner of the small porch where it is less likely to be seen. I know its hard climbing those GIGANTIC  5 steps to the small porch.  Does anyone else have similar problems. Maybe my delivery person got so winded he could not make it to the top or the air at five feet in altitude is so thin he collapsed. This is the 4th delivery by "AMAZON" I received like this.
4,Had not had a chance to really determine how much I like this product or not. Just gotbit 2 days ago. Have not used yet. Connecting with Bluetooth was easy. Sound quality is okay considering price point. Cannot say yet about battery life. Took less time to charanticipated. cipated. It would be mice if Amazon gave us time to actually USE the products before they start pestering us to rate them!
5,This little speaker has been pretty awesome. Excellent quality at an affordable price. Battery life is amazing I use it almost daily and bring it to work with me. I highly recommend it.
5,Has some bass do not expect a bose type bass. It is a decent BT speaker and is water proof. I needed somwthing for the shower and my garage. This is a great solution and very affordable.
5,It was a present to my nephew and he loves it. Says it is very good quality
5,I love it! I can even talk on the phone with it.
5,I was happy with the look and sound quality. I am sure the recipient of this will love it just as much.
5,Apparently it's a middle-aged guy thing to have a "golf play list" blasting when you're on the golf course all day.  This little speaker works great via Bluetooth and has a nice sound.  It gets plenty loud and stays charged all day.  I kind of wish the buttons were actually labeled on top a bit better.
5,I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He absolutely loves it! The sound quality is excellent
5,Love this got this for my mom as a gift and now she uses it every day blasting music .she has little quality time with it when she wants to be alone which is good that I can add happiness to her life with a musical gift .
5,Purchased to use only as a speaker phone for an elderly friend who was having problems hearing his phone ring. (phone speaker can't compete with their TV) Sound is loud and clear. It will require require a firmware update from the vendor if purchased for speaker phone use only as it comes configured to automatically power down at 15 minutes unless it is actively projecting sound. Vendor will provide firmware and instructions upon request. Simple painless process
4,Ok speaker. It doesn't have the best sound but it is ok for a desk in a small office and it looks good with Apple products. Good value but you can get better bass on other products.
5,Unbelievable quality for under $25. I bought this on a Cyber Monday lightening deal. It's a great companion to the Echo Dot whose main weakness is its less than stellar quality speaker. Now music has both volume and depth on Echo's tiny baby sister Dot and Alexa once again sounds like her old self!  I've only had it for a few days but I'm impressed with its overall performance thus far.  Only time will tell in regardi to the rechargeable battery longevity. I bought this model as well as a slightly different (newer?) version offered in black. The only slight negative about this particular model is the rather finicky push on/ off button positioned awkwardly the back of the unit instead of the much more reliable and user friendly touch power button on the top of the (newer?) model on the black speaker. This speaker is surprisingly weighty and is solidly made. Every once in a while  you manage to trip across a true find and a gem of a bargain to boot.  This is one of those fortunate times!
5,Lovee this so much . It sounds so good and for a great price .
5,I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves it. It gets very loud.
5,This device is by far the best blue tooth speaker I have ever bought. If you turn the volume up on your phone the sound is remarkable and powerful. I did not expect this quality! I was reading bad reviews on the cheaper Marine Stereos so I decided to give the route a try. It's way better than one of my friends car stereo. It is a little bigger that others but I highly recommend this product.
5,I purchased the speaker for my friend she came over and heard mine and I told her it wasn't my phone it was my new speaker so for her birthday I bought her a new one she loves it
2,Well it worked well at first. Now it only lasts no more than 2 hours on a charge.
5,I charged it once and use it for 15mins a day in the shower and that charge lasts all week sometimes longer. The sound quality and bass is unsurpassed. It's so easy to hook up to bluetooth and is by far one of my top 3 amazon purchases this year
5,I love everything about this little product.  The sound quality is great it's easy to connect to your devices and it's loud to be so small.  The best part iui s that it shuts off if you haven't used it for about 5 to 10 minutes and the battery life is great. I do wish it could be louder but clearly it's not meant for a party. I always use it when I'm cooking  and cleaning.
3,Things I really liked about this speaker:Quality materials used in the manufacture of it. It felt nice & heavy (but not too heavy)... as in a wind from outside won't blow it over like my old speakers.Very easy to pair with computer and cell phones.Things I didn't like:The power cord was WAY too short! You have to charge the battery immediately next to the power source. That was annoyingly inconvenient.It wasn't compatible with our smart TV. Very disappointing as I wanted to use it most with that.The sound wasn't "big enough". Granted it's a small speaker and I might have set my expectations too high but I expected more bass and more volume. It's really only good for listening to music while working on something in your room say on the computer or doing homework. It's not even loud enough for housework which is another thing I want speakers for.In the end I returned it mostly because it wouldn't pair with our tv but if I had kept it I still would have been unhappy with the volume ... or should I say lack of volume and bass.This is perfect for keeping on a desk while doing homework and pair with your cell phone or computer though.
4,Living room
3,Wish the sound quality was better - sounds like an fm radio
4,I brought this for the outdoor activity. Good battery life nice and clear sound. Easy to use.
5,The Doss speaker was easy to setup and connect. The sound is great and the controls are simple.
4,Very loud for the size.  My daughter loves it. Not big but bigger than I thought.
4,Smaller than I envisioned but the sound is plenty loud and clear. That’s what matters I guess. Will randomly disconnect from my phone. Not sure which device is to blame
5,Que calidad de producto diseño bello elegante y el sonido lo mas espectacular. No dudes en comprar 2 veces.
5,I just got this speaker for my smart TV. Seems to be working and pairing good. Not sure about the battery life but the bluetooth connectivity is fine and sound quality is clear.For buyers that don't want to hear the prompt when connecting/disconnecting the bluetooth just email support@dossav.com and get a file that will delete the prompt. When they send the file to you just copy and paste that file on a mini SD Card and insert it in the speaker mini SD card slot upside down. The light will turn green and shut down the speaker. The prompt should be gone.I use this speaker for my smart TV and music. When connected to my TV is has great clear output and when connected to music great sound with bass and treble. Great speaker for the price
4,Purchased as a deal of the day during Prime Days. Good inexpensive portable speaker. Sound quality is good for the price. Use this by the pool for aqua fitness class. It is loud enough that we can hear it and battery life is good. We are more concerned about volume than high quality sound so it works for us! Bluetooth connection to my iPhone was seamless. Durability was good. Speaker was on a chair and the sound vibrations knocked it off the chair and onto the hard pool deck. No damage to the speaker case and it just kept playing! :-) spend the extra and get the Bovke case.
5,Speakers on the Laptop needed some boosting for watching shows at home.  This little guy packs the perfect punch.  Has a decent amount of bass if positioned correctly.  I have this kind of sitting under my sit-stand desk and the compact size fits perfectly.  the sound is clear and crisp. The battery lasts a decent amount of time before needing a recharge.  I highly recommend DOSS think this is an amazing value for this particular product.Edit: after a year this speaker works just as good as the day I bought it. Durable and still holds a good charge I use this thing almost daily.
5,This device has some great sound quality. Well worth the buy.
5,I don't have a single negative thing to say about this speaker. I actually purchased this speaker three years ago and it's still going strong - even the battery! The sound quality is phenomenal (including the bass) the bluetooth connectivity is smooth and the controls are so easy. The music never sounds tinny or too quiet. I often bring this speaker to picnics walks to the park and to my backyard and I've had several people ask where I found it. They can't believe the price when they experience the quality! Highly recommended!
5,Been listening to music for 6 hours now and hasn’t let me down. Sound quality is great for the price and battery life is great. You can’t lose with this deal.
5,It’s the perfect solution if you tablet isn’t loud enough. Volume adjustment is super.
5,I don't normally write product reviews but had to write one for this product. Needed some speakers for my SFF HP that I recently purchased. Went through (3) sets of speakers they all had the same thing in common (No Sound Volume).Came across these and was blown away at the sound output. The sound rivals some wired speakers. I have a set of Creative T20 wired speakers and these sound almost as good as those. The icing on the cake is they are true bluetooth portable speakers move them around as much as you like.
4,I love this speaker but gave it 4stars by it cuts out for a micro second if there is a break in song or book and you end up missing a syllable or the start of a word when it picks up again.
5,Great sound for such a small speaker. I’m so impressed. DOSS is a better brand than I expected. I also have a larger speaker in my downstairs that works great. Good buy!
4,Loved the sound but only one channel at a time. Bluetooth or hardwire means I can't use it as a small-venue karaoke speaker (vocal/music). I was hoping to use this as part of a living-room sized karaoke entertainment system but when I plugged in my bluetooth mic dongle to the mini-jack the speaker unit wouldn't receive bluetooth from my karaoke music source. So while I love the quality of the music output I can't use the unit as I had hoped. I'm keeping it though it makes a great entertainment speaker for home parties.
5,This item has lasted forever!  My teenager has even had it for like a year he maxed the volume and it get roughed around still works fantastic.
4,I made this as a music player for my grandmother I recorded about three or four hours of mixed jazz and All she has to do is hit the play button and have continuous music. She  likes it a lot and it’s very easy for her to use plus she likes my taste in music
4,Bought this for an arthritic 86 year old. The ease of use in turning it on and adjusting volume were exactly what was needed.
5,I’ve had this speaker for two days and I don’t see how I didn’t get this or one like this years ago.  I get so much better use out of my iPad/iPhone by using this to watch YouTube/Netflix.  It makes watching videos so much more enjoyable.  I like headphone but this allows me to be able to hear my wife yell for me when it’s time to do the dishes.  I also use this with my TV for a poor man’s sound bar as it sounds so much better than the built in TV speaker in my little 32” TCL I got a few years ago I use in my bedroom.  This produces highs and lows I couldn’t imagine coming out of a $30 speaker.  I think I would’ve had buyer’s remorse if I got a more expensive Sony JBL or other name brand speaker for almost triple the price.
5,Good wireless speaker not expensive
5,Good price easy to use great sound good for connecting to phone to listen to music/pod casts/my favorite talk radio station/etc. Would make a great gift.
5,Great portable Bluetooth speaker. I kept borrowing it from my wife and figured I better just get one for myself since I liked and used it so much.
5,This speaker is small but it has a very loud sound. I’ve used it to play movies and music and I was not disappointed. I used the provided cord to connect to my computer. I have not connected it with a device via Bluetooth yet. I tried to use Bluetooth with a laptop but was unsuccessful
5,Game playing and music sometimes to watch my shows all this on my phone
5,I have been using this speaker for a couple weeks now.  It's a bit larger than other ones I've purchased in the past but still fits in my average sized purse.  I'm a mail carrier and this sits on my dash playing for an average of 5-7 hours a day.  It lasts an UNBELIEVABLE 3 days on one charge!  Also the button to answer the phone actually works!  This may seem like a no-brainer but I've had about 1/2 dozen of these type speakers over the years and none of the others had reliable phone answering.  It has great sound for a speaker of this size and super easy Bluetooth connectivity.I'll update this in a few months after it bounces on the dash of my truck in extreme temperatures!
4,Received the speaker 4/17/18 and so far so good!ProsVery clear.Speaker gets pretty loud.Great battery life so far! I've been using it everyday and only had to recharge once (after the initial charging)Nice looking design.ConsBass is not great.Doesn't connect automatically to my TaoTronics Bluetooth Transmitter and Receiver when I turn it back on. My JBL flip 4 speaker would reconnect pretty quickly when I turned it back on so I figure the DOSS speaker is to blame. (Not recommending JBL btw. Only had it a year and it already won't hold a charge.)Not crazy about the volume ring - it works but I'd rather buttons -- or even capacitive buttons.All in all pretty good little speaker - especially for the price. Let's just see how long it lasts. Will update.
5,This speaker is very nice and the sound quality was better than I expected. I was pleasantly surprised about the sleek look of this speaker. My guest complimented me on the speaker saying how loud the speaker was and the overall look of it. I purchased this for a party and it definitely was a good purchase for a reasonable price. I would purchase another and recommend it to a friend.
5,Decent volume. I like it
5,Pleasantly surprised by the quality of this speaker. Sounds great and has a good battery life.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I would highly recommend anyone buying this. The sound on this thing on MAX is super loud (which is a good thing). I will changing the volume is difficult. You have to start on the middle circle and with you finger move clockwise or counter-clockwise on the ring light slow. Overall its an amazing item to buy. I'd highly recommend this compared to other speakers.
5,The biggest problem is it came with ZERO cable for me to charge it. If a cable just wasn’t sent to me I can’t understsnd But I need yeah actual cable so that I can charge the speaker or it’s useless and sadly it’s been the third of different kind of speakers that I bought they also have had issues with either not playing in the phone or having no power cord so I’d really appreciate if you just send me a power cord I’m not gonna leave any negative reviews or anything until you know if the adult thing to do we can work it out between us ourselves
5,I bought this speaker to listen to my audiobooks and music on my phone. It is very nice and easy toUse. Good sound. My son said yesterday “Mom your speaker is giving you your own concert”. It has been a great investment.
5,I got the black color speaker. Quality of the unit is great very sleek look blends in nicely with other decor in my room. I have used this speaker both indoors and outside obviously inside a room the speaker is a lot louder but the quality of the sounds was great both in and outside. Battery life on this baby is great though I wish the charging wire that it came with was longer so it could be placed on a dresser and still charge. Other than that this was a great buy.
5,1. Sound is clear2. Bluetooth Connectivity never failsI have been looking for bluetooth speakers for my covered patio for awhile. A friend recommended this item to me and I am so glad he did.  Even listening to my audiobooks instead of music is a pleasure.  Truly happy with this purchase.
5,I think from this seller.  No problems fast delivery everybody is happy
2,We liked this little unit. It had great sound. Within seven months the batteries would no longer hold a charge and are not user replaceable. I do not recommend purchasing this unit.
5,Absolutely love this speaker! The battery last about 14 hours I work 8 hour days and only have to charge it about every other day. I also work in a manufacturing build with a lot of machines and this speaker sounds so clear and loud over all the machines and forklifts! Bluetooth super easy and I convinced 2 people I work with to get it and one of them bought 2 of them!! Can I work sales for this speaker haha!Thank you!
3,The speakers while able to be plenty loud don't carry the full range your tracks will.  If you have it too loud your tracks will top out and distort.  It needs better speakers than this but like I titled: it's an inexpensive product and as far as I'm concerned it has relatively excellent performance for the price.The micro SD card slot works and the player will successfully scan through and attempt to linearly play everything on it.  I used a 32GB card filled to the brim with alphabetic folders full of mp3s.  The problem is it will mysteriously skip tracks.  None of the tracks were anything other than mp3 and they would all play clearly on both my PC and smartphone.  It's no huge deal but yanking out the unnecessary electronics for something that isn't intended as an mp3 player seems like a more cost-effect approach.  I've observed no such problems playing through my cellphone so that's how I'll use it from now on.
5,I used this in my school bus. My kids love music and it's pretty loud. Holds a charge quite awhile.
4,The sounds isn’t super spectacular but it won’t be on a speaker this size at this price point. That being said it’s a nice little speaker that I use all the time while cooking or getting ready and the bluetooth connection is simple and stable. My only complaint and reason I’m looking for a different speaker is that the touch control is way too sensitive (for me at least) and I’m always accidentally hitting the wrong button and killing my connection. It can also be a bit tricky to turn it off and I’ve accidentally let the battery drain one too many times now.  Still a great speaker for the price and maybe I’m just challenged ;)
3,This speaker is okay. Idk maybe I guess I expected a little more. Sound quality is good but when low on battery life it makes the most irritating noise repetitively and constantly interrupts what you’re listening to.  It lasts about 8 hours which is okay almost like a phone. Just expected better life I guess and not to make that irritating sound when low.
4,This little speaker puts out a big sound with excellent quality. The bass is surprisingly good for a $30 speaker. It has some distortion issues at the very highest volume but nothing that detracts too much from quality. The sound control with touch is a cool factor. Sometimes the lights on the controls are a little annoying for the bedroom but I just cover it with a cloth. A feature to "turn off" lights would be nice. It is is not a Bose quality but it is excellent. I like the waterproof bag to carry it in. Also the feature to use for phone calls is excellent as well with the built in microphone giving good sound on calls when phone is paired to speaker. It's perfect to travel with; bring on trips and to hotel. I have received lots of compliments on the speaker and friends have also ordered it. A good purchase with great value!
4,Overall I've found that the DOSS SoundBox performs well for the purpose I bought it for; playing music while working out in my home gym and workshop utilizing it when playing music via Bluetooth through my phone and tablet when browsing YouTube and while staying in hotel rooms when traveling.  For me there is plenty of volume when increasing the level by circling the center circular light with a finger.  For the price - I'm not spending 2 3 or $400.00 for a more expensive brand for my intended purposes - the sound is overall really good.  The lows are strong with more contemporary music cuts but from an "equalizer" perspective the highs definitely outweigh the lows - with any music cut. For what it is I wouldn't mind paying a bit more if it contained a preset equalizer variety for potential reduction in high tones.  However as mentioned overall a good speaker for my purposes.
5,Great speaker for when I’m working on my hobby car project in the garage
4,Great sound for the price and size of the speaker. There’s an annoying repeating beep when the battery gets low (a light would be better maybe) but otherwise great speaker.
5,This is an update to my previous review. This company has very good customer service. They contacted me and I decided to try a second one. This time the speaker is working fine as described. It has very high sound quality for a small speaker and is easy to use.Based on the reviews I was hopeful this would be a great product.  I charged it up after I received it as detailed in the instructions and while it was charging all the indicator lights on top of the device illuminated. Could not get the unit to power on following the instructions provided. Each time I pressed the the power switch the lights just illuminated brighter. I went ahead and decided to return the item and while doing so it began to work. Seemed to work great and sound was very good as described in other reviews. After one use I powered the device off and attempted to re start and the issue started over again. I therefore decided to return the item.
4,Quality is legit for how cheap it is.
5,I have had a week to try this speaker out and the intent was to use it to listen to Binaural Beats & Isochronic Tones (With Subliminal Messages) during our sleeping hours so I was looking for a speaker that had a distinctive full range sound value and I am very pleased. I leave it plugged in so I really haven't tested the battery life. I accidently discovered that this amazing speaker will turn itself off when it's not receiving a signal.
5,We do not go outside with out our speakerbox. The sound is amazing and loud. It's so easy to connect to our phones. And the amount of usage in hours in crazy long as we love being outside in our pool. Amazing buy. Will be buying another for my gym
5,For less than 40 it’s amazing!!!
5,I moved my mom in with me a few years back as she is 90 years old and while she has a separate wing of the house in which to live her hearing is SO bad I can listen to her TV from my side of the house.This speaker sits comfortably by her chair so the TV sound is right next to her and can easily be picked up and moved to a nightstand for TV viewing in bed so the TV sound can be turned off completely thus allowing her to hear the TV and saving my sanity.
5,Looks great in my room rich sound easy set up and all at a great price.
5,Best Bluetooth speaker I’ve had in this price range!!Get the speaker you won’t be sorry.
5,This speaker works great. I have successfully connected it to several devices every time the quality was the same! I recommend this speaker to everyone!  Also the price was very affordable.
5,I enjoy listening to baseball in the evenings while working around the garage house or cellar. The MLB.com AtBat mobile app lets you grab just about any game broadcast but sound quality and volume are underwhelming on my smartphone.Doss Touch is an ideal solution. It's just like having an AM radio broadcast on a high quality radio. The supplied wiring lets me plug it into an AC outlet and into my phone which saves a little time and hassle vs. Bluetooth (which works fine). Portability out to the garage or cellar is great.I like the nice sleek aesthetic and how the lights illuminate while the unit is in use. It looks great in its own little place on a kitchen counter.The volume control is the weak point. There's no indicator that shows where you are on the volume scale. Instead of the tricky touch-swirl volume control I'd go with a regular knob if given the choice. But probably the touch design helps with the waterproof aspect of the unit.
5,Its very great for me. I love listening to my music in the shower with my little concerts lol. I can say that when i first got it on high it would chnage to the next it can take bass but not alot. So be careful try and turn the speaker down on it and your phone up to see if that help. BUT I love it for 20 bucks and it is touch sensitive and has good battery life. Stayed on for about 3 days till i had to charger it. So the only downfall is the song skiiping when to high. but overall its nice i just got it on christmas eve will change if something happen.
5,I bought this speaker to listen to music and the Bible while I'm getting ready for work in the morning and doing chores around the house. I am extremely happy with this speaker.
3,After reading the reviews I expected better sound quality.  You can only hear it well if the speaker is pointed directly at you.  Move to either side and the volume is cut 50-60%.  Go behind it... forget it.  In addition that deep bass sound you get out of any stereo speaker is completely absent.  It's also much smaller (on the tiny side) than I thought it would be.  I would have given it 2 stars but the light blue color is pretty.
5,Like the sound
5,Easy to use and works as expected. Definitely happy with this purchase
5,Works really great with my cell phone
4,Poor bass. Not what others described but for the price it works fine. What do you expect for $30.00 USD. If you want something that sound amazing be ready to pay for it.
4,I was looking for a good quality Bluetooth speaker for a lower price and I came across this one. Considering the price for this speaker this is an excellent high-quality speaker with a great clear sound! Looks nice too and I love the easy touch controls. My only complaint is that I wish the bass was just a little stronger so that it would carry across a room better but it still sounds great and suits my needs. Don't get me wrong the sound quality is pretty great. It's just that if you put it in a large room the bass can't be heard very well. I totally recommend this speaker!
5,I received the speaker yesterday and am listening to music thru it as I type.  I found it fairly easy to get up and running.  My only issue was the initial charge of the unit which is supposed to take about 12 hours. The user is provided a USB charging cable which I tried plugging into my laptop.  The problem was that my laptop turns itself off after about 30 minutes of inactivity and quit charging the unit.  I spent about 3 hours visiting my computer every 30 minutes or so to wake it up.  That got old so I decided to gamble and plug the USB cable into a Samsung electrical outlet cable that has a USB port. It took at most 45 minutes rather than 12 hours to fully charge (as indicated by a green light on the unit).  Right now the speaker is working great.  I don't know if over time the rechargeable battery will wear out quicker because I'm using an electrical outlet rather than my laptop to charge it.
5,I have a Bose Wireless Bluetooth Portable Speaker -- $300 from the Verizon Store This is comparable in too many ways to the DOSS at a price point of $25.  The Bose may have slightly better sound (not wildly discernible to my ear but if you are a volume cranker I will bet you would notice) but the DOSS picks up the bluetooth connection more easily. They both are equals when it comes to holding the battery charge. They are both quite fine in this regard. 13000+ people cannot be wrong. I bought the DOSS after much research for my husband as a surprise "I Love You" gift and it is working so well after 3 years I got one for my precious niece recently. (Love her too!). When the Bose Goes I'll get a DOSS.
5,I got this speaker about a week ago and I love it. But what's even better is the customersupport their company gives. I didn't have any trouble with it but contacted them with aquestion about leaving it plugged in all the time to the charger (I wanted to make sure itwouldn't be unhealthy for the battery). They kindly replied the next day and said it would be fine.I was shocked how polite and professional they were. They wrote me BACK again and thankedme for my purchase hoped I enjoyed using their product and did I have any other questions. Itwas from a person named Milla.... an ACTUAL PERSON with an ACTUAL NAME!!! I'm so glad Ibought this product. It is in my home office and has a great sound for it's size. My husband (who is VERY pickyabout speakers/ amps/boosters/subwoofers etc) was even impressed. Its a great product for the priceand  you can't beat the customer service. I love this speaker.
5,Easy to connect amazing sound great volume
5,Easy to sync Bluetooth. Great clear sound with very good volume control.
5,I got this speaker to use in my bedroom to play soothing music for my dog via a micro SD card that plugged in and also ran on battery so that it would continue playing if the power went out while I was away from home. I wanted a speaker that could play the SD card but also connect to my iPod and connect to my Alexa Dot. This speaker does all of these things and looks very nice as well. The sound comes out clear though I have noticed some distortion at the highest level when playing classical music. When listening to a podcast on my iPod I did not notice any distortion so it may be due to the copy of music that I put on my SD card not the speaker itself. For the price that I paid for it it does everything that I wanted it to do and I am very happy with it.
5,This is a good product overall - sound quality ease of use and price. Recommend!
4,Didn’t think the sound is as good as ad said.
4,The on off button can be a little sticky.
3,Sound is good relative to comparably priced speakers. However am returning for the following reasons: (1) Bluetooth connection isn't always automatic even on devices that's already been paired; (2) Bluetooth connection becomes static-y and drops whenever my phone is placed near or on top of the speaker; and (3) speakerphone is intermittently garbled. Maybe the unit I received is defective. YMMV.Edit 11/17/17 - A couple of days after my original review DOSS reached out to send me a replacement unit. I replied the same day but didn't receive any add'l communication. When I was about to give up on the replacement it showed up unannounced ~2 wks later. The new unit is better at recognizing repeat BT pairing and does not drop if my phone is placed on top of the speaker. However it has the same static-y issue. I'm keeping the rating at 3 stars mostly because of the responsive customer service. In terms of technical dings: (1) the replacement has the same BT static issue (2) speaker has a buzzing undertone and (3) the volume control is more unresponsive than the original unit (when I swipe 1/2 the time I get a *dong* sound rather than increase or decrease in volume). A side-note for those who might also care the replacement unit is a refurbished unit (there are two very small nicks on the front of the speaker right on the lip in front of the fast forward icon).
5,I am thoroughly impressed with this player and its company.  I bought this player about 10-months ago.  I used it daily for many hours a day.  I loved this player so much that I bought another model and was just as happy with my second player.  I have had  several other players but none compare.  Even some super expensive ones.What really has impressed me is there customer service.  I had an issue with my 10-month old player. I contacted their Customer Service Department and my issue was quickly addressed and resolved.  I can assure you buy these players and you will not regret your purchase!
5,WOW!!! This little thing is simply Amazing!  For the price there is no better speaker you could buy.  I've purchased several small Bluetooth speakers and they all were more expensive than this some 5 times the price.  and this is the best one by far.  I work in a loud environment and every other portable speaker i purchased i could not hear it over all the noise so only used it at home.  This little baby was so Load and clear when I first turned it on.  The first day I bought it to work you could hear it clear across the shop everyone there was amazed and asked how much I paid and where I got it from  I said under $25 and amazon.. They were blown away...  Bought this simply bc I needed just a small cheap speaker even if it wasn't great and got one hell of a speaker instead..It's a must buy.
5,I am very happy with the quality and sound of this Bluetooth speaker.
4,Ok so I'm super big on sound quality. I've owned many Bose speakers and also hooked my 97 Ford Escort up with Bose Speakers (LOL).  I absolutely love LOVE Bose because of there outstanding sound quality.  So for this box as small as it is it does put out quite the sound.  Very loud in my opinion.  I haven't tested this outside during a BBQ gathering just yet just indoors and I like how loud it is.  The quality though...its ok.  Not Bose quality but what do you expect for $30??  When the box is on its maximum volume you can hear a little rattling in the speaker itself but that's just me because I know exactly what I am listening for when I asked my husband if he hears it he says no it sounds great. But overall the sound is great. I'm just a stickler to sound quality.
5,I'll admit this is the first Bluetooth speaker box I've used so I can't speak of how it compares to others.  But that said I'm happy with the solid feel and clear sound.  It connected to my iPhone seamlessly.  I'm still on my first battery charge but have operated it six or seven hours and it's still going strong.  So far I'm very happy with my purchase.
5,So far so good
4,This is a great speaker if you’re looking for something cheap and not too expensiveThe quality is great and the built in touch buttons work great but as far as durability and water proofing things can be improvedAfter a few drops it starts to sound bad and if water gets on it worseThe battery life is very long tho and it charges fast
4,Love the sound although it has been cutting out can't tell if it's my device or the speakers.
5,I got this for my daughter for her birthday and she absolutely loved it she takes it everywhere
5,The product was exactly as it was advertised.  You're not going to use it to be the music for a party but relaxing on your back deck irs perfect for.
4,Nice little box bluetooth connection is solid even from the next room unlike my more expensive speakers. Honestly the sound isn’t that clear bass isn’t as loud as it should be and it’s too quiet at maximum volume. But for a little bedroom speaker or similar application definitely does the job well.
5,This is one of two of my all time favorite Amazon purchases. I have used it with my TV and have wondered what was outside the sound separation is that good. I've placed it upon a couple of smaller passive (no power) woofer speakers and that helped fill out the sound just a little bit more. (The next level up speaker has additional woofers built in.)I love the portability and durability of this speaker. I would only replace it to buy a bigger badder speaker from the same company.However for the bucks you get a great sounding portable long lasting speaker.
5,This is a pretty decent speaker!  We got it to put some quality into our Echo Dot which is rather tin sounding.  Works fine.  We have it physically plugged into the Echo Dot instead of pairing it.  Like some of the other reviewers talking about an auto power-off after a bit we don't see that since we have it plugged in all the time.  Now as for the micro SD I had one with a lot of mp3's on it.  It wouldn't play it at all at first.  So I looked at the card and found it was formatted as a FAT16.  So...I transferred all the Mp3's to a folder reformatted it to a FAT32 then transferred the files back and I was in business.  The volume ring is a bit stubborn and you have to really press hard but it works fine.  Can't tell you about the blue tooth feature.  Haven't used that yet.
4,I was somewhat leery about the bluetooth thing but after finally getting things paired with the transmitter I purchased from Amazon I was pleasantly surprised with the sound quality when the device was in the same room with the transmitter as well as when in another room.  I have not used it that much and cannot really report on the battery quality/life but it seems to do well with out any interruptions.  I would recommend this unit to others that were seeking an end to speaker wires.
4,Great sound for the price...i definitely recommend it
4,Great little speaker..decent soundI would rather have a usb input for a jump drive ..this has a micro card slot instead...other than that its good
5,This little speaker packs a punch Got my husband the black one  a couple of years ago and decided to treat myself to the purple one. It’s an amazing little speaker the sound quality is awesome and the best part is it keeps the sound in the room you are in so you don’t bother others .
5,I love this speaker. Sound quality is good and is super easy to use
4,I liked the small speaker for it's modern look.  Easy to use and connects to your phone or bluetooth device with no problems.  The disadvantage is most likely the sound quality.  it does not sound full like other brands but hey it is ok.  It's portable and if your not big into sound quality then it's a bang for the buck.
5,This is an amazing speaker. For the last year it has played music with beautiful balanced sound quality and is excellent in every regard. A few weeks ago I had a problem with the speaker and the company was so responsive and sent me a replacement. I can’t say enough good things about the customer service or the speaker. Sound quality is very important to me as a musician so thank you Doss for creating a quality speaker with beautiful sound and for your kindness to me as a customer. Thank you 🙏🏼
4,Everything from design to controls to sound on this speaker is great for the price. The one issue we have is that when using Bluetooth some of the music is lost for certain tracks. It’s like only part of the notes are being transferred leading to tiny gaps in sound. I don’t know if this is a speaker issue or a BT issue. It happens from an iPhone X and an iPad both over BT. When connecting the iPad using the line in physical connection the same tracks sound fine. Most tracks sound fine however.
5,I use this product with my smart phone to listen to music.
5,I have had this speaker over a year.  I really like it.  It's loud and has great sound.I left it outside overnight in the rain twice.The first time it was in my stroller.  I figured it didn't get very wet and that I simply got lucky because it still worked.But then I left it outside accidentally in direct rain overnight.  It thought it was done.  I turned it on and it still works!  I do not reccomend leaving it out in the rain.  But if you do it may still work!
5,I have the Anker SoundCore and Cambridge OontZ Angle 3. The DOSS Wireless comes in a slightly bigger size as compared to the two but it produces better and fuller sound with its higher powered speaker. What really makes this product stands out is its customizable and upgradable firmware. Just this feature alone is well worth the price.After I received the unit I wanted the volume level to stay the same after I powered it off and on. I contacted customer support and within a few hours I received a firmware file tailored to what I was asking for. I made a second request to have the alerting tones muted when the unit auto shuts-off as I used it to play music when I go to sleep. And I received an upgraded firmware file within hours. So far I know of none of the other portable wireless bluetooth speakers manufacturers carries such firmware upgradeable capabilities.Highly recommended
4,This is a good speaker for the money.  The only issue I have is that a lot of my songs are old and the volume does not stay as loud with the older vs. newer songs.  It’s a minor inconvenience and I just turn the sound up but wish all songs would play at the same level.
4,When I first got my speaker in Dec 2020 the sound was amazing and loud I have noticed over time the sound is not as loud as it was in the beginning.  I still love the speaker although I wish it still had the same sound quality.
3,Connectivity poor
4,Not working properly on and off with no reason
2,It plays music very well but it does not play audiobooks well which is what I needed it for.  The playback skips syllables on words.  I've learning it's a bluetooth syncing problem. My other players like Echo do not have this problem.
5,What an impressive little speaker!  You can't beat the price for the quality received.  For $30 I thought the speaker might look and feel cheaply made with poor sound quality but that's not the case at all.  It looks nice and the sound quality is great!  I just use it to have music on in the background so I'm not concerned with high quality sound but the sound on this is still really good.  As soon as I turned the blue tooth on in my phone and turned the speaker on they paired without a problem.  The range is seems to be decent too.  I walked down the house a bit with the iphone and the speaker was still playing.  It also comes with a nice "waterproof" bag to carry the speaker in.  I read some reviewers aren't keen on the way to turn up/down the volume but I didn't have a  hard time with it.  You definitely get more bang for your buck with this speaker.
5,My son got this for Christmas he loves the buttons and sound.
5,Was looking for a portable speaker to play music over during fitness classes on the go. While it is not "sound system" it gets the job done. Sound is loud enough for a classroom without sounding grainy. So far battery life has been good but I haven't played it much more than an hour at a time to know how long it lasts for sure. Small learning curve on connecting to bluetooth but once it was connected to my phone it connects automatically each time  now so not a problem. Overall happy with this speaker for what I paid.
5,My daughter love it and it has a nice volume and clear great sound. Definitely worth the money for my 12 year old room.
5,Looks nice great sound long battery life and loud
3,I ordered this as a replacement that was damaged and the sound quality is not a good on the newer version
5,I wanted to have a good wireless speaker for the longest time without spend big bucks. This Doss soundbox does the trick easy to set up. Sound is fantastic for the money and holds a charge. Great for when I’m outside and want to listen to a podcast or music.
5,I bought this for a gift for my daughter and based the decision off of previous reviews. My daughter didn’t think I would know how to buy a good speaker but I proved her wrong. 😊 The speaker feels like quality when you hold it. The Bluetooth connected easily and the sound quality is great! At Las Vegas for dance nationals a dance teacher brought her Bluetooth speaker to use for practicing in the hallways before performances. The dancers could not hear the music very well so my daughter offered to let them use hers. What a difference in sound! The dance studio now wants to buy one due to being small yet great sound output. I also bought the case that was suggested and would recommend it.
5,I love this speaker and take it everywhere when I'm using my lappy.  It has a nice bass sound and easy volume control.  Pairs right away and has a good sound.  The battery life could be a bit better but I keep a cord ready to recharge when needed.
4,Well worth the money.  Sound quality is great I wish it had a built in radio but it doesn’t and the lighted controls stay lit. Other than that this Bluetooth speaker is great for a one bedroom apartment or college dorm oh and the battery life is great too.  My speaker came changed and ready.  I’d say just buy it‼️
4,This was given as a gift and the recipient immediately asked "where did you find this I want to buy another in case it ever dies!?" I guess that says it all. The speaker is compact and has great dial control. I find the speaker to be lacking that deep bass sound you get with JBL and other higher quality speakers which is the only reason I'm giving it a 4. But for the price point you really can't complain - you get so much! I recommend this first and foremost to the younger members of the household and also to others who want a speaker for occasional use. If using it day in and day out as a primary speaker I'd invest in a JBL pulse or higher - a little more costly but it packs the bass this one is lacking.
5,Purchased for a gift  definitely worth it  sound is great
5,Excellent sound quality easy set up and strong steel framing. Great value for money.
5,Great sound easy to connect.  Bought for husband's bday who insisted on a Bluetooth speaker with excellent sound & easy of use.After my research this DOSS won out!! Came on time & my husband couldn't believe the great quality for the price paid.  In turn I decided to buy one for myself. I bought the carrying case for each doss speaker. It is perfect for my husband- who takes back & forth to work each day! Highly recommend.
3,Es buena la duración de batería volumen fuerte pero baja calidad de sonido
4,Love it easy to use nice sound
5,Used for Christmas gift exchange. All were impressed with the sound quality!
5,Simple small and does what it says.  It's powerful enough for anything I wanted it for.  The small size is handy -- easy to carry it and a phone one-handed.  The sound is decent though not as rich as in systems with separate tweeters and woofers.  Haven't tested the battery much but it's certainly not threatened to run low on me yet.
4,I gave this bluetooth portable speaker a 4 out of 5 stars because I expected a better bass response. I was a little disappointed after reading the reviews on how great the bass sounded. Other than that the speaker sounded well with balanced mid levels and clear sharp highs. The materials used for the speaker seem to be top quality. It has a nice weight to it and feels very sturdy. The controls function flawlessly. I like the fact that this portable bluetooth speaker gives you the option of inserting a micro SD card which is great because I am beginning to download most of my music on micro SD cards. The bluetooth connection is relatively fast. I have not tried the calling feature on my cell yet. Overall I would say it's a decent portable bluetooth speaker.
5,I bought this speaker twice. Once for a family member and once for me. I have quite the decent collection of speakers and this by far is my favorite. I've only had to charge it once since I purchased it. I use it a few times a day for an hour-3 hours. I have owned this speaker for about a week and it is truly a phenomenal device. The sound quality is amazing and you get a lot of bass out of it. The bluetooth pairs right when you turn the speaker on and it is very easy to switch the connection to another device. The volume control on the speaker is something I haven't seen before and I personally love it. If you are thinking about buying this speaker just do it already.
4,This was a great little speaker while I had it. Worked just as described right out of the box. Pairing was a cinch and the volume was more than adequate. We purchased it for our family's trip to the beach and the sound was very competitive with the crashing surf. This speaker was a great value and makes my loss that much more painful to swallow. The speaker was lost on the first day of our trip. It had fallen of our beach cart and went unnoticed when the cart bogged down in the sand. We realized it was gone later that night when the kids wanted to listen to some music. That's the only reason for the missing star I can't comment on the durability battery life or if the sound quality was sustained. It's really worth a look if you're interested in a Bluetooth speaker.
5,Waited a bit before writing review. Unit has great sound and I use it at least 6 hours a day via bluetooth to stream SiriusXM radio. I have never used it to see how many days to get on one charge. I do plug it in at least once a week. Phone conversations through unit is clear. Have had no problems. I do like the auto-off if left idle to help save on battery.
3,I bought this to watch films on my computer while traveling but the sound is not great. It is good for music. Perhaps it is because there are only two channels or perhaps because there is almost no bass.The volume is loud enough and it connects to bluetooth fine. It also comes with a 3.5mm cord to connect to something directly.
4,I was a little nervous about buying this speaker because of its small size and relatively cheap price.  However just set it up and it is really good. I had a Sharp mini stereo system that was not bluetooth capable and was already starting to act up. But after about three years of really good sound I was not upset with the Sharp.  So I was searching Amazon for another mini-stereo system and then came upon this DOSS speaker.  I'm glad I did. I have very eclectic music tastes from everything to dance/hip hop to heavy metal and so far this speaker has been able to handle it.  Nice.
5,Highly recommended
5,This little speaker really surprised me! It was fairly cheap but I just needed a simple blue tooth speaker so I wasn't too concerned about it. It exceeded expectations! The sound quality is pretty impressive for the price it's durable (enough so that I've been taking it to my scene shop job) and the touch buttons work well. My only little complaints would be that it doesn't come with a wall adapter for its USB charging cord which isn't a hard fix (I simply use the one from my phone charger) but isn't the most convenient; the sound doesn't come out of the back only the front (even though the "speaker look" continues around back); and that you have to hold the power button for a bit to turn it on which would be fine if it wasn't in such an awkward place. But those are extremely tiny problems. Overall I'm very happy and plan on buying another one as a gift.
5,most things on amazon are duds but not this one
5,For $29.99 I got my money's worth and more. I was simply looking for a speaker to connect to thru a 3.5mm cable. I needed to be able to hear during a noisy highway commute. The speaker was loud and crystal clear. I had no problem at all. In fact I had to reduce the volume a bit when I was listening thru my iPhone. The battery life is decent/ average depending on how loud you keep it and whether or not you're using Bluetooth or the 3.5 included cable. Since I don't care for Bluetooth the 3.5 mm connection at 85-90% loudness could easily give me 2 hours after a full charge. I have not tried to full charge and then play it to drain the battery. I will come back and edit this review once I find out how long the battery lasts in real world conditions. I would highly recommend this 12 Watt speaker for the $29.99 price.
4,This is a very nice speaker. The packaging that is comes in shows the pride and quality the company has in it's product. And the speaker does have a very nice quality feel to it. It even comes with a waterproof bag to store/carry it in. The sound is excellent for it's size. It can play music pretty loud and still be clear.I have two gripes however: 1. When you plug it in to charge it there is a TINY little red light UNDER the port it plugs into. This makes it harder to know if it's charging and when it's done. 2. The top volume control isn't the best. It's not very sensitive and is tough to know exactly how much the volume is changing. Plus it makes a very loud and annoying "busy signal" type beep when you go to max volume.Despite the two above gripes I would surely buy it again!
3,Does not offer clear crisp sounds especially when volume is raised and then that's not as loud as I would like.Purposeful cute product though.
5,Definitely a 5+ star product. An outstanding little speaker with great sound long battery life easy to use controls and a robust feature list. The support team is the best I've seen from any company. I had a "mode" changing problem when paired with the Echo Dot which was corrected via a firmware update within a few days of contacting them. The ability to update the firmware is a great and rare capability. The speaker has the feature of repeatedly playing music loaded onto a micro-sd card but I wanted to use it to only play a single list of songs then turn off quietly. I contacted the support team and within a few days had another firmware update which provided this feature. I travel a lot and  use this capability to listen to music while trying to get to sleep in noisy environments. The speaker bluetooth pairs quickly with the Echo Dot or Phone. It can also be used with a direct connection via the line-in port.
5,liked it good enough to order another for patio
5,Best affordable speaker I’ve had to this day. It’s loud we use it in our room.
4,Dope little speaker for the price. It definitely served the purpose.
5,Being a singer I'm very choosy about sound systems and I can't believe the sound quality of this product for the price! I have been using this speaker for 2+ years now . I can use it while charging as well.
4,East setup . .  great sound . . good volume range.
4,Expected more low end because of the reviews I read. With that said it has clear crisp highs balanced mids and a touch of bass. For as small as this thing is I'm impressed with its overall sound quality I'd like more pronounced lows but for the price the sound quality is good.The build quality feels solid I like all of the capacitive buttons. The only analogue button is the power button which is nice.I am happy with my purchase my only gripe is that I want just a bit more low end.Edit: After a couple years of use I want to change my initial review. This thing sounds great. The low end is pronounced just enough for my music to sound great. I love these things (because I ordered 2).
5,Works great nice sound and easy to connect!
5,I have several of these speakers quality is great price was also fair. Better quality than more expensive speakers.Best part is customer service. I have a problem with one of my speakers contacted customer service and spoke with Irene. She handled my claim and responded within in the day. 5 Stars to Irene for her service.I will continue to “talk up” this product.Thanks againPR
1,This product worked fine when it first arrived and the sound quality was meh but acceptable. Within two weeks it will no longer activate and there seems to be no reason for it. It was not moved it was not dropped; it simply sat in our kitchen far away from any moisture or prep area and one day decided it was never going to turn on again. We have tried charging it. We have tried to figure out a reset option (the manual flat out does not have one -- you can only "reset" the Bluetooth connectivity and only when the thing you know powers on). At this point we are returning the product and going with different options.Do not bother and spend your money elsewhere.
4,I am very happy with the speaker's sound quality(especially for its small size) and ease with which it pairs via Bluetooth. This is definitely a high quality speaker and for a great price! My only frustrations are:- The 15 minute automatic turnoff (I know there is a "fix" for that but the auto turnoff should only be when it is on battery power not when it is plugged in).- There is no way to turn the lights off. I use this speaker at night- connected to my cell phone- to go to sleep listening to podcasts and this unit lights up the whole room! It would be nice to have the option to dim and turn off the lights.Of course neither of these "issues" are anywhere close to a deal-breaker as this speaker is the BEST value for the money of any I have tried or found yet!
5,I anguished over which speaker to get to replace my cheap one that died. There are so many choices and some of the prices are ridiculous when you know it cost $5 to make. Anyway this one went on sale and stopped dithering and pulled the trigger. Glad I did. Bass is thin but what can you expect?
5,My radio in my car recently broke so I went around looking for a Bluetooth radio that could easily replace it. I didn’t want to spend $200 on a jbl or Sony so I looked on amazon. The Doss had the most awesome reviews and had good things to say about it so I bought it. It came 3 days early. The sound quality is amazing probably comparable to a jbl speaker. The bass that plays through it can show you the sound that it’s capable of playing. Touch pad is very easy to use in the car while skipping songs and pausing. I accidentally dropped it as well and nothing broke and nothing was damaged!! I give this speaker a 10/10 review and highly recommend it.
5,Sound very nice and battery longevity excellent
5,This speaker is really nice for the price. The sound is amazing and connecting via Bluetooth is a breeze. I like that when connected you can also answer calls in case you’re in a different room. The battery life is lit too! I don’t use it everyday but I bought this product in April of 2021 and I’m just putting it on the charger in MAY.
5,I use the speaker with my portiabel cd Bluetooth player.Sometimes it gets iffy but all in all I like it
5,I don't usually write reviews but I found the online reviews so helpful when researching for a Bluetooth speaker that I just wanted to added my voice.  This is a great little piece of kit good sound and neat looking. Yes!
5,I really like this speaker. It has great sound is sleek and compact. The only thing I wish I knew before buying another was that you can only use one at a time.
4,I'm using this in a small office to play music for myself.  I had purchased a JBL Flip 4 previously and I highly recommend that small speaker. I like the flip so much I took to home and now I use it when I play disc golf or work around the house (It's a much better speaker).  I purchased this DOSS because I wanted a cheaper speaker for the office that plays at a lower volume.  I can't say it's perfect but it has a good enough sound.  The base is not a good as the JBL and the highs are not as crisp.  But overall it's better than others I've listened to.  I would recommend this one for the price.  But if you could afford the JBL get it.
5,What a great sound box. The sound quality was so nice for one room. I didn’t have to read directions and fumble with charging it came charged. It connected right away easily. It’s still charged after several mornings and evenings of using it. What I didn’t like is it only came with a cord to plug to a computer to charge. I have a docking station to charge my phone. I’d like a separate charging box for it.
5,It’s worth it! I love it and so does my lady.
4,It is a nice bluetooth speaker good battery life and the sound is nice and bassy. The only issue is that in the SD card mode when you press the back button it goes to the start of the song playing which is why this is a 4 star review.
5,Love this little speaker!  I take it all over the house with me to help me get through household chores and it sounds great.  Not like a tin can and not too much bass either.  Connects to Bluetooth easily and has a pretty good range if you walk away with your phone in your pocket.  I like to use it in the bathroom while showering and I can finally hear most any music over the sound of the heater and shower now.  Would recommend!
5,I was able to quickly connect to my iPhone and play music through it in my patio.  Sound is very good especially for this price point coming from a small speaker.  So far I like it!
5,If you're looking for an affordable Bluetooth speaker that can put out some decent volume this is a great buy. Surprisingly good sound quality considering the size particularly with the bass. No it's not a Bose but it's also not absurdly expensive.This won't rock the house if you're trying to have a party volume-wise but if you're looking to add background tunes to your backyard get-together or similar event this works great.I rarely need to recharge this guy either battery life is great. Also never had issues with connecting my phone.
3,To sum up how I feel about this thing: it's super annoying. It is reasonably loud and sounds ok so I gave it two stars. Other than that this this is garbage. The power button is a bit oddly placed. You have to hold it down for at least 5 seconds to turn the speaker on or off. It has the most obnoxious (and loud) sounds when doing ANY function. The top light up touch buttons seemed cool but real world use it's just a pain to use and a bit awkward. The buttons are way too bright. Who thought of this scroll gesture for the volume? On a speaker the volume buttons are the most important and I have to use a scrolling gesture every time I need to adjust the volume. Annoying. You can hear a slight static sound when on. It's heavier than expected.I have an Oontz (old version) and it's better then this thing in every way. I regret not just going with that brand to begin with. Now I have to deal with returning this POS.Update: I updated the rating to 3 stars since the company did contact me with a firmware update to remove the annoying tones.  They reached out to me right after I posted this review so that is good customer service.  Kudos to them for their support. I however still do not feel this is worth keeping.
3,So originally when I received this a couple months ago I would have given it 5 Stars hands down. However after having this a while I have noticed that lately there is a random beeping sound coming from the speaker. I'm not sure what the beeping sound means but it does it whether it is plugged in and charging or off the charger. It even does it when the speaker is completely shut off. It's the kind of noise that the speaker would make if the battery was getting low and it was about to shut off. But it is making this sound when it is fully charged as well. I'll update this if I figure it out. I will say though the sound quality out of this speaker is excellent. There is no need to go out and buy an expensive bluetooth speaker if you want good sound. This will do the same job that $100 speaker does. The frame and the parts itself may not be of the same quality of that of a more expensive bluetooth speaker. But you're going to get the same results as far as sound goes and that's really all that matters to me. I would rather have this beeping problem with a $20 Speaker versus a $100 speaker.
5,This little machine is a wonder!!  Love it!  It is light weight comes in different colors and is about the size of an alarm clock! Portable and battery last for almost a full day.  The sound quality is perfect for home or outdoors!  Easy to use and connect to Bluetooth.  This price fluctuations in the color you choose.  We got the blue one which is really nice but other colors were $10 cheaper if you wish!  Delivery was prompt next day service!  Worth your time and money on this speaker!
5,This speaker is excellent!
3,Got this for my small gym class. Can barely hear it unless it's extremely quiet...which it never is. Would be good for a typical classroom though. Also won't connect to my laptop only my phone and/or tablet.
5,LOVE my speaker! We have a JBL and this one is better! It’s smaller and the buttons are straight forward. I find the sound crisp clean has good bass and we weren’t still looking for more volume when we turned it all the way up. I love this little speaker so much! I ordered 3...house camp beach house...and after turning one on my boys quickly claimed the other 2. Now I have to order 2 more. Lol we got tired of transporting the JBL that is heavy.
4,Its the same speaker except the new one i just bought has type-c charging port unlike previous one with micro usb. It says DossOn front of speaker unlike older one which was on side like pic shows. Older one stopped charging  at all after about a year.
5,Good sound for the price. Excellent connectivity. Good for use at home or in the office. These are not capable of pairing one speaker with a second speaker.
4,Sounds great. Louder than I expected. Battery dies pretty fast.
5,Hey it's a great little speaker to put in your garage or whatever while streaming music via bluetooth on yoru phone.  That's one of the things I use this for.  I also put mp3s of lullabys on the sd card and let it play overnight for my young child.  Don't expect chest thumping bass you know but if your cellphone has built in equalizer or tone controls you can make this speaker sound pretty good.Also I've made two inquiries to DOSS customer service.  Both were responded to via email within hours.  This is amazing to me in a world where manufacturers and brands don't seem to care after you've forked over your money to them.
5,Listen to music while I am working
4,Nice speaker  heavy  quality sound.
4,Size and sound. Excellent bass and tone.
3,Got this to use as an extension speaker for my TV; audio delay was too much. My TV has at least half dozen ways to adjust for latency including a delay adjustment a "switch" that allows BT and TV speaker to be used simultaneously and several other options. None worked.The speaker does work great when hard wired the sound is very good. But that kinda defeats the purpose of blue tooth doesn't it?I did not try it as a speakerphone or as a standalone speaker for any other device although I would imagine it would work just fine when latency with other speaker systems isn't an issue. I have another BT speaker the triangle shaped one and it works just fine with only a slight hint of delay.
4,Tiene buen sonido carga rápido
5,Size is perfect. Take it anywhere. Sound quality is excellent
5,Very good speaker. Quality sound and very loud!
5,The sound and size of this mini speaker is amazing
5,Excellent sound and long battery life all for very affordable price!
5,Very good sound and it is loud. Thank you!
5,3.20.18 UPDATE!  This speaker began stumbling at about 5 months.  I contacted DOSS and they were most helpful.  They asked for a recording of what the speaker was doing I provided it and almost immediately they said that they would send replacement.  EVERY product has an occasional hiccup but it is more often than not that companies want you to jump through hoops to get the problem solved.  This company handled the situation quickly generously and graciously.  Lu the tech I dealt with was such a professional I will be back to try other of their products.  It is still a great speaker that I highly recommend in fact I also purchased another one for a friend.  Thanks to DOSS for doing what was right and doing it in a way that made me feel good too.Charges fast and holds a long time.  Good sound from small speaker.  Highly recommend.
5,For the price it is great. Need to test it out with my projector
5,The setup was easy and operating the speaker is similarly uncomplicated.  The sound is not outstanding but good.  The speaker met my expectations and need.  I have had it only for a few days and my general impression is that the battery seems to last well. I would recommend it.
5,I listen to a lot of radio and music on my iPhone when I'm working in my art studio.  These speakers are the perfect sound boost for my phone.  I can put the speaker unit on a shelf with phone next to it and it takes up very little room.  Sound is sharp and volume good.  Great purchase!!  Easy to connect bluetooth.  I am happy.  Very nice packaging as well.
5,You cannot possibly get a better speaker for the money. I've bought 3 and love the sound the battery life and the clean design.
5,This speaker is just what I needed for my one bedroom apartment. It was super easy to Bluetooth connect and surprisingly fast to connect. No trouble shooting or hard to figure out features. It’s small simple and easy to use. I’d recommend this speaker. The only thing I’d change is bigger bass sound quality. If there was a way to adjust the bass even better. Still it’s pretty decent in the aspect of sound quality.
3,Thought it would be louder just use for the bathroom now. Nice design.
4,Bought these for our sons to replace radios in their room. Easy to set up a playlist on an SD card for their bedtime. The BIGGEST downfall is the annoying sound they make when the battery gets low. It has SCARED my and woken up my kids the one time it happened at night. NOW We always make sure they're charged but I think it could be MUCH simpler with a flashing light or something....not a scary alarm! They constantly ask before bed if it's charged.
3,Not loud at all. I don't understand why they can't just make them loud enough.
5,I already had a awesome Bluetooth speaker and I got this just for a back up computer speaker BUT it quickly got promoted to my main portable speaker. Clear crisp AND loud! Love that I can quickly connect it to my echo show or my computer or my phone or tv. The battery last forever and the distance range is surprising. I loved it so much that I had to write a review.
3,This device is a great shape lightweight and the setup to connect to Bluetooth is simple.The issue is the sound which is most important. It’s about as loud as an iPhone typical loudness. It’s just not loud enough. We wanted to use this while sitting on the balcony or porch listening to podcast music etc but its not what we expected at all.
4,I use this little speaker for listening to live broadcasts from my iphone like church and musical concerts. The sound is good for a small speaker but sounds a tiny bit muffled at times which could be from the source and not the speaker itself. It was super easy to connect easy to charge and I like the look.
4,Overall I am satisfied with this purchase. I understood going into it that this company is not one of the biggest and does not have as large of a following as other companies such as JBL or Bose. However I was looking for something that was going to be worth my money I do not use portable speakers significantly and did not want to pay a significant price for something I would not use very often. Because of this the Doss speaker is perfect! The bass does rattle at full volume but it maintains a solid connection and I can hear my music clearly. It is sleek and feels durable. Again I am satisfied with this purchase.
5,You will not regret buying this! I love it. I took it by my mom and she loved it so I gave her mines and purchased another one. It’s easy to use and the sound quality is amazing. The battery life is fantastic....sometimes I go three days without charging! Easy to place in your bag and carry with you. The delivery was quick and the boxing of this item is pretty neat I actually want to keep the box.  Overall great product!
5,The sound quality is great. And I don't lose connectivity if I walk away with my phone. The battery life is the best part. I bought this on Nov 4. I'm just now recharging it today and it's Jan 24. I listen every day for at least an hour. If you listened more I'm sure you'd need to charge it more often. I'm very pleased with this speaker. Would definitely buy again.
3,The sound is great but I bought this for my outside deck because in the description and when you type waterproof speaker this is one of the first to pop up. Read a few reviews great but I'm getting for the waterproofing which it doesn't mention on the box are the speaker or the directions. So 3⭐
5,The color is fantastic it's a nice Vivid red color I swear I'm in the theater with surround sound it's fantastic I would recommend this to anyone as a matter of fact my son requested one for Christmas so that's on his list and I will be purchasing it for him he has even borrowed mine to take the work to play music at his job while he's working it's fantastic thank you oh and it's a very reasonable price for such a fantastic Bluetooth sound machine I do also like the fact that the sound comes out all the way around it and not just in one spot or two spots.
5,I would recommend the DOSS soundbox..perfect size to pack for the beach or boat! I was very impressed with the ease of use and sound!
5,This speaker is just the right size to sit on my night stand next to my bed and sure sounds a lot better than the speakers in my mobile phone.  I like too that it has a slot for a micro-SD card and can play music independently from my phone. The speaker has a nice full rich sound and can fill a room with music.
4,I have paired this speaker with an Amazon Echo Dot. I leave it connected to the charger all the time. I like that it does not turn off so long as the Echo Dot is connected. Pairing was easy. The sound is OK considering the size an price of the speaker. After all one can not repeal the laws of physics. It is not very loud. I noticed no distortion even at full volume. The bass response in not remarkable. It is better than the Echo's speaker which was my purpose in getting it. I use the Echo Dot and the speaker by my bedside as an alternative to an alarm clock radio that was failing. The combination is less expensive than an Echo. The lights on the DOSS touch panel are pretty bright at night. I wish that there was a way to dim them.
4,Let's be honest! Everything is fineTHE AUDIO QUALITY BASS AND DEPTH IS SUPER AWESOME apart from the fact I use it on Linux. There is no firmware update(the support page has no update yet). A2DP sink connection on linux pulseaudio sucks. A physical volume key on the speaker would be great and absence of that is a great drawback. Plus there's no mic for hands free calling. The critical part is connection latency is huge on linux and sometimes doesn't auto connect. Power Save timeout feature is good but shutdown is way sooner than expected. I have another speaker from Anker that stays on as long as it is connected for days (even if idle) *wink* (I can keep my linux machine on for days without having to re start).
3,It's okay not great. First issue I have are the buttons on top. They are so annoying!!! I can't tell you how many times I've accidentally turned the stupid thing off or changed a song because you barely have to touch the buttons to mess with them. Second issue is the size. It's definitely something to keep in mind. It's rather large for a portable speaker (I've dropped it twice now trying to carry it around). It's not a major issue just something to keep in mind. Third issue: the speaker isn't nearly loud enough. All the way on high with the device all the way up aaaaannnnndddd....... it's still not that loud nor is the bass that great. Fourth issue is that the sound isn't very crisp at all. I use this speaker for music as well as tv (Netflix shows) and sometimes it sounds like people are mumbling when they sound perfectly fine on the television.It's an okay speaker for your $50 range speaker but there are definitely better ones out there. I would not order this one again nor would I recommend it however it's perfectly useable while I have it so I'll keep using it for now even though I'm not in love with it. The issues I have with it are annoying and would definitely keep me from buying it again but they don't make the speaker unusable as it is.
5,Great sounding speaker. Built very good and looks great.  I work construction and wanted a speaker that had a Micro SD Card slot. This one has a Micro SD Slot but would only play in alphabetical order. There was no random or shuffle mode.I contacted the manufacturer at support@dossav.com and they sent me a firmware upgrade for this feature in less than 24 hours. Fantastic customer service !!!I put the .bin file they emailed me on an empty Micro SD Card. I then put it in the speaker's Micro SD slot. I powered on the speaker as soon as it booted up to Bluetooth mode you press the Mode button and it goes into Micro SD card mode. The lights flash green and blue for about 30 seconds and it then shuts off. I removed the card and put my music micro SD card in and it works perfectly in random / shuffle mode. The downside is it will no longer play in alphabetical mode but who cares. I love random mode !
5,This was a duplicate that I actually returned. The original Doss had been lost but was found so that is what I’m reviewing.  I love this Bluetooth speaker. I synced it with my iPhone and played music every day when doing my water aerobic exercises. The music could be clearly heard even in the water. I used it for about an hour a day and the battery would last a couple weeks with that usage. It’s now inside by my exercise bike for the winter.
5,Very nice loud product.
5,My granddaughter and niece love it
5,I am very pleasantly surprised.  I have other Bose sound systems that I use and I wanted something small and inexpensive for our cabin.  I honestly wasn't expecting much but going off the reviews thought that this might exceed those expectations.  That's exactly the case with this speaker.  The bass sounds pretty decent for such a small inexpensive speaker.  Its very portable.  Easy to use!  One thing I noticed is that you do need to disable the Bluetooth on other devices before switching to a new device.  For example if I am using i IPhone to listen to Pandora but want to switch over to my IPad for my Itunes I need to first switch off the DOSS Bluetooth on my IPhone before I can discover it on my IPad.  Not a big deal but just keep it in mind.  Other Bluetooth devices I have used didn't require that to happen.
4,This is a good speaker. I was looking for something simple to play than can be heard throughout my apartment. The speaker than is light weight and easy to move around. It has a little bass but you can't turn it up too loud of the vocals get a little muffled and it feels like you could blow out the speaker. Bluetooth connection was just as easy as pairing with a other phone.
5,This. Is. Amazing.  I’m still figuring out battery life as I’ve only used it for a bit but this little speaker puts out amazing sound.  I read all the reviews for this and other speakers of the same type (Bluetooth small budget conscious etc) and bought this one based on how everyone said it sounded.  As usual amazon reviewers are right.  It was super easy to set up (15 seconds) controls worked flawlessly and the SOUND!  I know I’m geeking out about it but it’s got so much more sound than I thought it was going to have.  One thing that surprised me was that the speaker is located on the bottom so to get full sound I have to turn it upside down but it’s fine and certainly light weight enough to pick it up and turn it over.  So far very pleased.
5,What can I say? Use this at my job which is overnight stocking. The Micro SD card is perfect! At full volume was able to make the canned Xmas music go away. Even at half volume co-workers could hear it clearly. Because of this a co-worker looked into buying one for her to use at work as well.In terms of battery life lasted TWO eight hour shifts before being brought home to recharge.
3,Plenty loud for price.I wasn't expecting much bass and got even less.
5,Great speaker. Easy to use. Effortless to connect.
5,Very easy to connect and sounds is great!
5,I'm an Audiophile. Spent $5000 on Elrod power cords $3500 on Nordost Valhalla interconnects and $15000 on Wilson Audio Sophia 2 speakers and tons more on tubes DAC's Transports etc etc. This piece is AMAZING! NO! It wont throw a 3D holographic soundstage with Norah Jones 3 feet in front of you while the drum kit is 8 feet deep in your front yard. BUT I'm VERY impressed by the naturalness of the midrange and clarity of top end. It defies the laws of physics to get this much sound from such a little box. I got a hot rod truck with glass packs and I can plainly hear music with windows down. Most amazing is the only cheap piece of gear EVE$R that it wont distort or break up at FULL VOLUME! Turn it up all the way it still sounds clean with no distortion or break up. How thry got 12 watts in this little thing is a miracle. Happy I got it recommend to any one!
5,The sound is ok I dislike that I can’t adjust the sound on the speaker instead I have to go to my device to adjust it
2,Bought this for a niece who loved the vibrant lilac-purple color shown in listing. But irl it's an anemic faded shade with which she was disappointed making the gift a dud.Also one of the most annoying  operation protocols of any Bluetooth speaker I've ever used--including but not limited to that ridiculously tiny on/off button inconveniently located low on the back side.
5,This speaker sounds great and is very easy to use.
5,Great little speaker with good sound quality for the price. It connected with my Echo Dot easily and really improves Alexa's range. The battery did seem to last about 12 hours as advertised. My only complaint is that the lights on the top of the speaker remain lit as long as the device is on. I can just cover it up I suppose but I feel like an auto-off for the lights would improve battery life.**Update** Had to get rid of this speaker. There is a voice that says "low battery please recharge" every time it dies. Also the speaker stopped holding a charge after about 9 months of use. Even when it was plugged in to the charger it would keep repeating "LOW BATTERY PLEASE RECHARGE." The lights on the top of the device do not turn off and had to be covered. Between the light and the voice I was just losing too much sleep over this device and replaced it with the OontZ speaker.
5,Very nice sound. Good material. The battery charge longs enough. Good product!
5,This is by far  the best Bluetooth speaker I've ever had that was under $30.  The sound is rich and clear and the bass is just bass-y enough to deep without making everything vibrate.The unit itself looks really sharp and has a good weight to it w/out being heavy. The selection buttons on top are touch sensitive and are really responsive.I don't know what a TF card is but this speaker has a slot but the best part for me is a speaker port because my computer sometimes can't find any of my Bluetooth devices and without the back up option for being able to connect via the headphone jack a few BT devices I've had have been rendered useless which has been a big bummer!The battery lasted a good amount of time.Great speaker for the price!
5,The sound quality can be better but otherwise it’s a good speaker
5,I like the sound from the small unit….
5,I've had this for about three years the two speakers give you great stereo sound the battery doesn't show any signs of wearing out trust me this is good stuff I would buy it again in a heartbeat
5,I’ve been wanting a Bluetooth speaker but wasn’t sure which one to purchase. I’ve searched hundreds of brands and didn’t want to shell over the $100+ that most Bluetooth speakers with good reviews cost. I found this one on sale and scooped it up. Very good sound for the price very impressed with this speaker!
4,Not a bad sound for the price needs more bass though
5,Unfortunately it got stolenthis was my best speaker all my friend liked itI am ordering again.Basically I love perfect sound when I am having my scotch and cigar.. Anyways I'm need it now
5,looks good sounds even better ' My friends have JBL's and tube type but this little guy rock's theirs to the ground  ill have a better summer having my music at my side work or play OHHH its teleconferencing is too cool . keep it charged up 24/7 -jw  ' Rock on
5,I absolutely LOVE this!!!!! I have had it for a month and I’ve charged it once.  I’ve had it on for several hours on multiple occasions and it still sounds amazing!  I love how easy it is to use and how I can simply take it from one room to the next so easily so I can continue listening to my music.  I will probably buy another one so that my boyfriend can have one upstairs with him while he’s working out if I’m listening to my music while doing yard work or crafting.
5,Great for the pool. Easy to connect with Bluetooth. Had several people comment what a great sound the speaker produced. Liked the first speaker so much that I bought another for work.
4,It's alright
5,This speaker is AMAZING! Has way better sound than any other speaker I've had and it is super affordable. The battery outlasts my phone's battery...which doesn't say a whole lot i guess because my phone could definitely use a better one. But still...I'm sure the speaker's battery is just as good as the sound quality. And...also pretty important it is VERY durable! My toddler chucked it off the table and it hit tile floor pretty hard and it survived!! Nothing damaged at all. This speaker has more than earned 5 stars!!
4,This my first  Bluetooth speaker box.I was kinda skeptical about buying it at first. Being that it was kind of small. But to my amazement this little monster had decent mid-range sound. Sorry no subwoofer here for that deep bass. But anyway I like it. Battery life is great. You can even connect a  3.5 jack plug to behind your PC If you don't want Bluetooth. But who in their right mind doesn't like Bluetooth today...lol The only thing I didn't like the speaker box didn't have any earphone jack plug. Anyway it was a good buy for me.
5,initially I hated this speaker. I didn't feel it was easy to operate and the instructions are not very easy to understand. But after some trial and error I have grown to like it a lot. The trick for me is to turn the speaker on by holding down the power button for about 3 seconds and to make sure my Bluetooth is not only turned on on my iPhone but that I go into blutooth in the settings and chose "DOSS Soundbox". I have hands free in my car and even if this speaker is on and my Bluetooth is on I have to chose the speaker option. It won't automatically chose the speaker. I like it enough I'm thinking of ordering another one for a different room in my house. I got this in the white and I like how it looks in my white kitchen. Seems like a sturdy little thing and has good sound.
3,A few months later now and I need to edit my review. It worked well for awhile but now will randomly stop working. . The issue isn't with my phone because this doesn't happen with any other Bluetooth device I have connected. There isn't any pattern to this. Sometimes it will stay connected for a few hours sometimes only 15 minutes.  It's a shame because this was a great device while it worked.Original review below:My old speaker that I had for years finally died and I've been searching for a new one. I ordered 4 different ones and each had a deal breaker. One would always reset its sound to max everytime it was turned back on and it would deafen my office. The others sounded really bad not much better than my cell phone speaker. This one; however is great. The bass isn't as good as my original but this does fine and cost 1/3rd the price. I would definately recommend it.
5,For starters I have to say this is a very nice quality for such a cheap price! I work in a factory and there is lots of noise from the machines and I can hear this very well over the loud noise. Many people I work with have JBLs and this honestly has just about the same sound quality for a quarter of the price! As far as durability I’m not going to be purposely dropping this into the concrete floors at work but it did accidentally get knocked over and landed on the foot mat and the side did separate a tad but everything still works as it should! And I can still touch the top to turn the volume up or down or change songs while I have heat proof gloves on which is another plus!
5,Firstly I was not given this product for free to review. I was looking for something portable and within a reasonable price point.  I have to say "wow" I am soo impressed and Happy with this purchase.  I was really looking to purchase the Uboom which I know has awesome sound quality but really didn't want to spend that much money.  I am sooo glad I went with the DOSS. It has great sound quality and gets surprisingly loud. Has great volume control!! Was a little nervous at first as I had it on full volume and was disappointed but low and behold once I put the volume up on my phone  watch out. !!  I like the size and the controls are very easy to use. I am all about loudness and sound quality and wasn't sure for this price if I would get it. You can not go wrong for the price of this speaker. Soo happy wanted something for my outside deck. Happy customer.
4,GOOD PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE..
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This is just what I was looking for! Very pleased with the sound quality. I did not want to spend a lot of money on a bluetooth speaker. Glad I purchased this one. Not disappointed. It’s pink and that’s a plus..lol! I use it everyday 😍. Don’t hesitate to buy! You will be surprised.
5,The good - easy to use inexpensive works well good volume and fun to use.The ok - sound was not amazing but was decent and better than expected for the price.The not so good - haven't found anything yet!These speakers work with Bluetooth micro SD card and can connect to an outside source such as an MP3 player. It was easy to set up easy to use has good volume and the different color lights make it fun as well.All in all this was our first Bluetooth speakers and we are hooked. We even bought a second one for different rooms! My kids are in love and we just can't believe we got so much value for this price.
5,It work's great and setup is easy.
3,Got this to use in the car when my stero stopped working. (It's a GPS system and cost $1000 to replace). So for something to listen to podcasts audiobooks and music. I thought it was okay but after awhile everything sounded "tinny" when listening for longer periods of time. Made my head hurt. Look is beautiful but sound quality isn't there. Returning for a Cobalt Tank (smart price amazing sound quality and it's waterproof!)
4,I needed a small Bluetooth speaker to use for streaming on a narrow desk. The Doss SoundBox is easy to use and the sound quality isn't bad for the size and price. I liked it enough to get another for my bedroom. The first one turned out to be defective but the company immediately supplied me with a replacement and didn't require me to send the defective one back. Customer Support for Doss has been consistently friendly  helpful and fast--5 stars for customer support!
5,I went thru and read the reviews and most were good so decided to give it a try. Glad I did! I was looking for a speaker for out by the pool and didn't want to spend a bunch. Sounds is great! I did read that alot of people were complaining about notifications going off. If you pull the screen down you can turn the notifications off so if you are scrolling it doesn't interrupt the sound. So far I am very impressed and will be buying more for gifts....
4,Overall I’d buy it again but only for the sale I got. It was 15 dollars so it’s great for the price. It’s very sensitive to the touch and gets loud enough for the size. Personally I like it and I’d recommend it but I wouldn’t pay original price for it.
5,would recommend to a friend
3,This is the second one I’ve purchased. The sound is okay. Bass isn’t noticeable until the volume is turned up. I like the price of this speaker but recommend spending more on a higher quality speaker.
4,Fairly heavy which I'm assuming equates to substantial.  Right out of the box the design gave the impression of a good product...  clean design and nice lines.  Easy to pair with my Bluethooth in less than 5 minutes.  Really Great Sound; and the price is bearable.  To bad I wasn't aware of the new upgrade before I bought this one.
5,Very nice speaker. Well built and great sounding. Connects via bluetooth flawlessly. The coolest feature is the built in slot for a MicroSD card. I had to contact Doss via their website to get my Soundbox to shuffle the songs on my flash card. The customer service was quick and helpful. I had my Soundbox shuffling my songs in no time with their assistance. Great product. I highly recommend it.
5,I am so very pleased with this product! It is unbelievable that for the cost this little speaker provides such wonderful sound.  I use the Bluetooth feature on my Android cell phone with radio station apps from other states for best selection then sync the phone and speaker and enjoy.  The speaker battery has a long life and is easily charged through laptop.  I keep my phone plugged in during playtime to save battery life.  What's great about this is where I live we have limited radio stations so I can access NY classical music stations through phone app.  The speaker amplification allows me to hear through most of the house.  Another good feature is I can have the cell phone in one room while speaker is in the LR and it still syncs.Very pleased excellent amplification and sound excellent price.
5,I purchased this for my daughter and she said the sound is bad.  It has a vibrating sound and very muffled.  I told her to return it.  I am very disappointed.  I went with all the great reviews.5/2/17 Update:  How do I say this?  I am most impressed with Doss.  They read my poor review and made every concerted effort to make it right.  They wasted no time.  They contacted me and immediately sent my daughter another speaker.  She got it going and said it sounds awesome!!  That makes me happy!!!  Oh! She received the new speaker two days before expected delivery date!!  I have to tell you.  It's rare that I have seen amazing customer service.  They have definitely won me over!!!  Thank you so much Doss!!! Keep up the great work.  I'm a happy customer my daughter is happy with her speaker!!
4,This device is a good value and easy-to-use. Long battery life. Sometimes a little trouble with clarity
5,I purchased both this speaker and the soundBoxPro+ from DOSS immediate results and I honestly like the sound quality and features of the smaller speaker.  Sound is crisp carried through my entire garage and held true for some of the 'louder' music I tried on it.  The pro+ is fine but sound seems more muffled especially with the extra bass activated.  if I had to do it over I would just have this nicely priced one instead of both.  Can still hook up echo dot and use it as a phone con speaker.  Great little speaker.  Easy set up easy connection.
5,Very loud for a little speaker. Easy to use and connect.
5,I had a problem pairing a phone with this speaker and reported it to Amazon.  I got a message from the seller with precise instructions on how to do the pairing.  Worked like a charm.  I am getting to know every song by the Eagles and Fleetwood Mac from my wife singing in the shower.
4,Sound is ok and battery life is great.
5,I love that it's wireless. It connects to my computers and iPhone very quickly. But what I love most is the sound quality. I put noises.online on connect and I can listen to ocean waves sounds all day. Seriously a big sound from such a little speaker. I'm going to order more to put around the house.
5,If you’re looking for a decent speaker then this is it! It was perfect for what we needed for our family vacation at the beach! It’s volume goes high enough & it’s sound is very clear! I’m very impressed with this purchase & highly recommend this nice Bluetooth Speaker!!
4,Para el precio y tamaño es Genial yo he comprado 3 de ellos sin queja alguna
4,I keep it in the bathroom for showering. Works great.
5,Having satisfied with the product I have bought this second piece. I list of the plus points as below.- shape is beautiful- multi function (Bluetooth wired & memorycard connectivity) options are very useful.- the price is justifiable.- the maximum sound for it's size is unexpected- the good bass effect is excellent- the treble effect is crystal clear- no apparent distortion ( Normally I never increase the volume more than 75% to keep the sensitivity of the diaphragm)- battery withstands for a daySuggestion to manufacturer:please provide a small descriptive picture above the insertion slot of the memory card to guide the user to insert ; (I inserted mine in an upside position).One request to make your product complete:Please explore the possibility of including FM toonever mind to pay little more...I give 5 stars without hesitation.
5,Great little speaker for price and sound. I dropped it in my spa ( put it in rice and it works!!! Volume not 100%) so I came t get a new one....seen there's a pink one coming soon but like $10 more!!! Not cool! freaken pink tax is BS. Think ill go to best buy look for one without the pink tax
1,This is not the first time I have been bitten in the a$$ by being too cheap to purchase a decent bluetooth speaker but I do think it will be the last (probably). The only explanation I have is that the model I got was defective but it worked just enough to drive me totally crazy in the process of figuring that out. The instructions for pairing are decent and in retrospect most of my frustrations with them are likely linked to the fact that my speaker simply doesn't work. As instructed I charged the speaker until the red light turned green and then began attempting to pair it with my iphone 11. That took a few (at least 10) tries to get right. I admit that I am not the most patient person with instructions but I'm a software engineer so I'm at least minimally tech savy and I did not find the process intuitive at all. I managed to get my device to pair...for a grand total of 5 seconds and then the speaker would promptly shut off. Rinse repeat about 20 times and I was pretty ready to chuck the thing across my living room (sadly patience has not been a gift of this quarantine). Among the other things I tried (and didn't work): charging it overnight  connecting it to my computer with the aux chord pressing various buttons for differing lengths of time; the speaker never managed to stay on past the initial pairing phase. I would return this but I'm not eager to go to the post office during this lockdown so I suppose I'll just consider this another $27 lesson in not being cheap. We'll see how long it sticks!
5,I got this to replace a Bose Mini Sound Link that was years old and stopped working. This speaker was only about $25 vs. almost $200 for a comparable Bose. The DOSS Soundbox is excellent. It has great quality sound good features looks great strong and well made and connects to Bluetooth better than the Bose. The Bose only has slightly deeper base but other than that the DOSS is equal or better. I am extremely satisfied especially at the nominal price.
5,This is a great little speaker. I wanted something for around the house. I use it when I work out cook or work in the garage. The sound is great and battery life is too.  I take it and set it in the room I in and I can hear it clearly without having to turn it all the way up. I listen to all types of music and everything sounds good on it. Very happy great buy!
5,I love my little bluetooth speaker! It's surprisingly loud when I listen to Spotify from my phone on it! It looks nice too. All the "buttons" are on top & are touch not actual buttons which I like. To turn the volume up n down just rotate your finger clockwise (up) or counter clockwise (down). The ony thing I have noticed so far with mine specifically is when I am only about....8 feet away smoking it cuts out (off & on). That's with Bluetooth. I still love it & highly suggest it especially for the price.
5,Small. Lightweight. Great sound.
5,I use this to get better sound from my laptop and it is great. Very well suited for internet radio YouTube videos playing music from your phone.It has excellent sound. I compared to a Purvobia and an Urge Soundbrick so my comparison might be lacking because the Soundbrick is really old.This speaker has an excellent sound balance and it is loud enough. It's really loud and clear for its size. I really love this speaker and have used it without issue for 2 months every week. I've yet to take it on a trip but that is coming up and I will be using this speaker exclusively for that purpose and getting the other ones from Doss for permanent stay in my room.
4,While the bass on this isn’t as good as on my previous portable Bluetooth speaker the sound quality is fine for my needs (mostly listening to audiobooks). The controls are definitely nicer than on the speaker it replaced. Being able to adjust the sound up or down by sliding your fingertip around the blue-lit ring is much nicer than repeatedly pressing a volume up or down button. It takes slightly longer to connect to my Bluetooth devices than its predecessor but an extra couple of seconds isn’t a big deal to me.
4,Sounds were well balanced compared to the Angle but distorted at louder levels. Would have kept it if it wasn't for that.
5,This is an updated review of the DOSS Speaker and company.  I purchased a DOSS speaker in June 2018 for listening to a series of 13 audio books while I was working on a hobby project. The speaker worked fine. I finished the audiobooks and did not use the speaker until about 2 weeks ago.  I noticed occassional squawks while listening to music.  I checked my Amazon order and learned it was too late for Amazon to intervene with the problem.  I emailed the company and received an immediate response--we are talking late evening on a Friday night.  The company representative (Thank you Alicia!) answered every email promptly and was on top of my problem.  After verifying that I had a problem DOSS replaced the speaker in less than a week.  I would highly recommend the company for their service and their product.
5,Works great for my purposes I don’t need exceptional top quality sound so for the money this is perfect. Works great to add volume to to listen to music podcasts & movies.
5,This. Speaker. Is. The. Bomb!!! It was VERY easy to connect and the sound and volume is great! I love this little thing!! I keep it in my bathroom and it’s so small and portable so I will take it with me and use it in other rooms sometime. The only thing is when I received it I had the charge it before I used it. This was disappointing because I was so exited to get and use it eight away. But once it’s charged baby it’s read to roll and worth the wait!!!
5,Purchased for my hairdresser for her shop.  I read the reviews and thought it would be good for her.  She had a speaker she paid over $100 and u had to download an app and it was big it she was always frustrated because it wasn’t user friendly.  When it arrived in her shop she was skeptical because of size.  She has put the speaker up high on a division wall and she told me that her clients thought she put in a speaker system because you can hear the music so clearly and she can control the volume with her phone while she’s working it’s just simple  For the price I would recommend this truly is a great little speaker!
2,Got here fast and looks great just like the picture.  Easy to use and sync my phone to it. The only problem is that it randomly skips songs. The forward button flickers like it has a short in it. Skips several songs in a row then plays for a few seconds then skips more.
4,I’ve only owned this a few days but I’m very impressed with the sound quality and range of this speaker for the asking price. I recently compared other speakers at Best Buy and all the ones I liked where over $100. This speaker can easily compete with them at less then half the cost! As far as being portable well I wouldn’t carry it... it’s heavy! And a bit large but if you plan on traveling with it buy a good case for it. I bought this for my Kindle 7. When listening to audio book or movies the little speaker was enough for my old ears. With this speaker wow! I can share with a group of people. I use it with my iPad Pro & iPhone 6 as well.
5,Great sound and volume range.  Used for You Tube podcasts.
4,Great sound for such a cheap speaker. Can’t beat 20$. I’ve dropped it from waist high with no side Affects. I use this while working construction and everyone that gets to work around me enjoys my purchase. Great gift for anyone who needs a portable speaker. It doesn’t do the best on high base music like rap but getting deep base out of a small speaker like this is not common. I would recommend to all my friends.
5,I like the aesthetics of the speaker.
5,Got this to go along with our projector and who am I kidding ipod at the fire pit. This little speaker booms. Connects to bluetooth easily.
5,Got this for $19.99 during the Prime deal of the day and wow! I have several portable Bluetooth speakers and they do not come close to DOSS sound quality. This speaker is clear and has adequate bass sound to delight your ears. The sound is rich and full. Range is also more than adequate the enjoy the music and songs of your choice.Even though it is portable it is still somewhat heavy and better for stationary speaker for your desk. And that's where I placed it and connecting to the my Moto X4 via Bluetooth was quick and simple.Overall this is a great Bluetooth speaker that is clear powerful and long lasting battery life. Recommended!
5,I'm impressed with the quality of the sound from such a small speaker. The sound is clear and boomy Would definitely recommend.I got this for a good deal around cyber Monday but I was pleasantly surprised when I started using this speaker. It actually gives out really clear sound and does pretty good for base considering how compact it is. It's a really great little speaker for on the go. This DOSS SoundBox Bluetooth speaker connects very easy with any phone one thing I noticed you have to keep your phone in one room for it to work or it will start losing signal. The speaker I bought is white and the buttons are blue. very easy to use I definitely recommend this sound box Its a great speaker for a great price. Plus it would make a wonderful Christmas present for someone. PS it comes with a pouch so you can keep your charger and sound box in  there if you are going somewhere.
4,The DOSS speaker is compact but not as small as some in this category.  I have an old Bluetooth speaker from another company and am able to compare side by side.  This new DOSS has a deeper sound with a little more clarity.  The other speaker may be a little cleaner sound but only to mid level volume.  I have only used the DOSS for one week but it is a fine product for a small amount of money.  It was very easy to set up with my iPhone. I am sure there are better speakers out there but they will cost you more money.  All in all I am happy with the purchase
4,Good little speaker but doesn’t have much bass at all (makes sense it’s a tiny thing) but still worth noting as I have cheap headphones that give good bass. Regardless for the price not bad. Would recommend if you’re on a budget.
4,Great bass! Love how loud the sounds is! I'm only a few weeks in so can't speak to longevity. Very happy with how is working with my phone so far. I would love to add details but it's too soon for that.
4,I bought these because the reviews said the bass wouldn't max out. Not really true. On your EQ you have to pull down 250Hz and lower because if you don't it's just muffly table moving. Lotsa "thonk" sounds. I had to buy a different one. Oh and I'm not listening to sub woofer bass or anything. Just hoping for a fuller sound.
2,This sound quality is poor. No bass. Highs are beamed narrowly so you have to tilt the box directly at your face to get best tone. It sounds best if elevated 12” off the tabletop. Stereo projection is weak. It sounds mono. Tonal balance sounds like a very cheap computer speaker - all mods. I am very disappointed.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I love pink so of course I had to get a pink speaker! It has great sound I haven’t been able to listen to it on full volume yet but it pairs very well and i love the feel of it and how it’s sort of touch screen. Highly recommend!
3,The Doss Soundbox speaker seemed to be the answer to streaming my online workouts. However it has a built-in feature making it turn off/disconnect every 15 minutes. It seems like you can request a firmware update from the company but it seems annoying to have to upload the update to a card then to the speaker apparently. The firmware is not available on the Doss website so an additional step is needed to email and get them to send you the update.the sound of the speaker is ok for workouts where I just need to be able to hear the instructor. I would only use it for music in an outdoor setting with no other options. The sound quality doesn't seem that good to me for music.
5,I bought this to use with the SD card and had a lot of trouble getting it to work.  Finally was going to return it and while looking for a replacement saw that one of the other speakers available listed that it could only support SD cards up to 32 GB. I had a 64 GB card in there. I tried a smaller SD card and it worked. Wish they had put that information in the paperwork for this one. Would’ve saved a lot of frustrationHowever after posting this review the company contacted me and apologized for the confusion. Did inform me that it will work with up to 32 GB card. Gave me a refund to make up for my frustration.  Was nice they reached out to me. It doesn’t happen very frequently with most companies. Great customer support.
4,I got one of these for the cabin of my 34-foot sailboat.  In the enclosed space the speaker sounds good and provides plenty of volume.  The bluetooth connectivity to my iPhone is flawless.  I can recharge easily from my USB supply port.  OK this ain't high fidelity but given the size and the price it sounds fine.
5,I can't rave enough about this portable speaker. This is my 3rd one and it is still as good in sound and quality as the 1st one that I purchased years ago. Great to have a company that is staying true to itself. The sound of these speakers can be compared to ones that sell for 3-4 times the cost. Solid portable Bluetooth and usb connectivity. Works great with your smart phone and echo dot. Give this one a try you will be glad you did.
5,this speaker has worked great up until last night. yesterday was exactly 2 months since i purchased it. it connects fast and the sound is still great but the battery is dying VERY quickly. i charged it for 3 hours and it died after 5 songs. its quite obnoxious when the battery gets low also. it repeats that the battery is low over and over (at least 8 times per song) until it dies. overall not a very good buy. definitely not worth $35.UPDATE:i was contacted through email by a lady named Milla that works for wonders tech one day after posting this review. she apologized for the inconvenience of the speaker i had purchased and replaced it for free. i received the new speaker FAST! (within 2 days!) it proves that the company truly cares how their customers feel about them and how satisfied their customers are! updated from 3 stars to 5 stars!! thank you Milla!
4,I should have gotten the next verson up that has the dual sync but this is do-able. The sound is pretty decent it is not Bose or one of higher end speakers but I like it for I am using it for. I am going to try to sync the 2 that I have using the Samsung 8 plus and update my post.50 minutes later using the Samsung 8+....if you have the dual audio setting on your cellphone or tablet you can have both of these on at the same time. The sound was not bad ( guest bedroom was used) . It can/will try to play favorites but it does not sound too bad once balanced.
5,I couldn't get my Kindle fire to pair with it. But it works well with my phone! And it sounds great for the cost!
5,I have not had a chance to really put it though its paces yet as far as battery life but so far the range seems to be really good.  I can take it upstairs with me while having my Amazon Dot downstairs and it stays paired.  The speaker sounds great and has amazing amounts of bass for the price range.  Be careful when unboxing as the charging cord is kind of hidden underneath the unit within some other packaging.  My wife almost missed it thinking the unit did not come with a charging cord and we were about to throw the box away.UPDATE:  My wife said she had an especially bass heavy song playing and the speaker vibrated its way off of the shelf and onto the couch where she could feel the bass through the couch.  Soooo.... Be aware the Bass is that good with this speaker.
4,After a month the speaker would not stay paired no matter which device I had it paired with. I always have to delete the device; turn off Bluetooth turn it back on and go through the paring process. Every single time. It's extremely annoying. Sound quality is good and is the only reason I keep it around. Sorry but I just can't recommend this product.UPDATE: After writing my review the company reached out to me to help correct the problem. They were prompt with their responses and offered to correct the situation by honoring the warranty of the device. So far I've had no issues with the new device. Based on the response from the company I can now recommend the product. Good sound quality and great customer service.
5,Great sound good quality great price.
5,I saw the mixed reviews on this speaker and was hesitant.  Went ahead and bought one to give it a shot.  Was blown away by the sound quality (dont get me wrong it's not Bose or Polk or anything) for something that I use as a computer speaker.  I liked it so much I bought 2 more (1 for the wife and a 2nd one for my 3 monitor setup).  I've used it outside a couple times and am still ultimately overall just impressed by this little $25 speaker.
5,I purchased another product before this one only to realize that it was an inferior product. I decided this one would work for my needs and was pleasantly surprised by the quality AND sound. They design is simple yet easy to use and beautiful in any environment and I can use it as my phone with great quality. Definitely worth the price.
5,I got this for my 80 year old mother.  I know what you are thinking...an 80 year old woman doesn't rock out...  Umm yeah this one does.  She loves this.  It's easy to operate and has a great sound quality for the money and more.  Definitely worth the money.  Gets her doing more around the house than watching Fox and the Food Network.  Hahaha...lol... (but true)
4,Have only used it once but am very impressed the volume and sound. Everything came as advertised and the bluetooth connection was very easy. Haven't had the opportunity to test out the battery life yet. So far seems well worth the money.
5,Excellent little speaker for the price
5,Really great value. Not going to be the same quality as a speaker that’s several hundred dollars (duh) but for $30 the sound is great the volume Max is really high and the best part about this product is that the battery neverrrrr dies. I charge maybe once or twice a year and usually use is a lot throughout the summer
5,Sound color easily packed in suitcase.
5,I love my Bluetooth speaker. It's compact size is large with sound. Syncs up right now. No waiting. Perfect.
5,I got this after my old name brand speaker died after 4-5 years of having. I think its just as good and it was $100 cheaper. I even bought a second as a gift for my dad.
5,A quarter of the price and same sound quality as big name brand speaker.
4,Cheap but durable sound quality is decent and volume is great. Haven’t had to charge it yet. Sleek touch.
5,I listen to this every night and all through the night I made up a list of mp3 music files that I likeand uploaded to this product. I have about 300 songs which play over and over all through the night.This was a product I was really looking for and here it is.
5,Needed a speaker with the 3.5 in jack so my wife can listen to the TV as she walks on the treadmill without having to crank the TV volume and blast the whole house.Ran a long (several) 3.5's from the TV to the treadmill and she can have the volume where she needs it and not disturb the rest of us.Can't wait till I can justify a new TV with Bluetooth but for now this is a great solution - we are all happy!
4,This is small as I wanted since I'm just using this for a small room where I get ready in the morning. I think the sound quality is decent (don't expect bass out of a subwoofer here) for the size and price - couple small complaints. 1) - the sound it makes when powering on/off does NOT match the volume level of your music. So even if you're using the music as a quiet soothing background for your morning expect to hear the super loud electronic start up chime sound. 2) - the included power cord only has a USB attachment. You can pick up any USB wall adapter for only a few bucks but it's a matter of principle - something else you have to buy. Otherwise happy with the performance and battery life so far.
5,Works spottily. Can't understand the robotic voice. Difficult to control volume (often non-responsive). Finally decided to write a review when the sound began stuttering. Threw it away. Rats!UPDATE: Shortly after this review the company contacted me and sent a new speaker.  It was very simple to pair and works GREAT.  The one I'd received did not come with any instructions.  Also I think it was simply a lemon.  The new one paired easily; the old one never paired.  The new one has great sound and the volume control works; the old one didn't sound much better than my laptop and the volume control had to pressed hard and then would screech.  I'm giving a 5 now because of great customer service response and a good product.  I don't hold lemons against manufacturers.  Problem was that I didn't know it was a lemon because I only received one of the several documents that came with the replacement.
5,This speaker works great!  I have bought a few cheaper bluetooth speakers that were terrible.  I was afraid to purchase another at a low price point but this speaker has been amazing.  It gets loud!  This is wonderful for my class.  The battery life is great.  It will disconnect from bluetooth and cut off after an extended period of nonuse.  I recommended this speaker to a friend and she loves it as well!
5,I bought this for my husband for working out in garage and he loves it.
1,We purchased this speaker from Amazon on Nov. 25. It was listed as a "best seller". We felt we had done considerable research and the information we had lead us to believe this bluetooth speaker would be sufficient for what we needed - to pair with our portable devices and our Amazon Echo and Echo Dot. Here it is 2 days before Christmas and we're still waiting for the Doss speaker to perform like its suppose to.The Doss Sound Box Touch has failed miserably. Initially the speaker paired with my Galaxy S6 phone. Other than that it has paired with nothing else. Not my laptop running Windows 10 not my Asus tablet not the Amazon Echo Echo Dot or the Kindle Fire. When I try to pair it with the Echo Alexa tells me I have to enter a code in my device (the speaker) to pair it with the Echo. Well we know that can't be done - at least not that I know of. My other devices (yes Bluetooth is turned on) can not even find the speaker when they scan for other Bluetooth devices.I can use the speaker in the Aux In mode with the cord but what's the purpose of a wireless Bluetooth speaker if it won't pair with anything. Essentially the speaker is a $30 - $35 paperweight.I will say that for the price then sound when we use it with the Aux In is decent and acceptable for the price. That's why I gave a 1 star. We were actually surprisingly pleased with the sound. We were going to purchase another one for the downstairs but now we staying away from this and Doss altogether (there's no decent support on the website and the only pairing app they have is for the Cloud Fox (also the only product on the website). We just don't won't to waste money on another speaker that doesn't do what it's suppose to do.Invest in something else if you're looking for something to work properly has support and website.  DOSS Touch Wireless Bluetooth V4.0 Portable Speaker with HD Sound and Bass (Black)
4,Great little speaker for the price.  Don't expect too much on the low end bass but it does fill a kitchen with a decent sound range.  Also after two days and hours of use it still hasn't needed a charge...so long battery life.  Easy to pair with iPhone.  The only reason it gets four stars is because it's disconnected from the Bluetooth twice unexpectedly while in close proximity from the device.  Trying to figure out why.Update after one week. Went to charge the speaker and the micro USB snapped. It is a very tight fit.The company became aware of the issue and sent a replacement very quickly. I am impressed with their response and how aware they are of their product useage and costumer service. Thank you so much for the excellent service!
5,The quality of sound is great!It has some base which I like and the sound is crispy.The volume can be high and it is fair for its size. I would not need higher sound volume as this one otherwise I would turn on the stereo on the living room.PROS:Great price and great quality.Style is very modern and Bluetooth picks up right away.It does AUTO TURN ON when no sound is playing after around 20 minutes.CONS:None
5,This speaker is a great pick if you live in a condo complex the bass is not excessive. The sound of the speaker is neutral. It is not a true high fidelity speaker but it still sounds very fine. For the price point it is a great value. Sony offers a better speaker but it sells for $100 and likely will upset your upstairs and downstairs neighbors.
5,I have no complaints about this soundbox. We actually now own two because the price and quality are fantastic. We use them for listening to podcasts and music and the sound is great. We have no issues connecting our devices. I can’t really comment on the battery life since I have never used it for longer than a couple hours at a time.
5,As soon as the speaker came I set it up. It took about 5 minutes. Setup was simple and sound quality is great. I have been using it for a few days now (and haven’t had to charge it yet). Purchased on an Amazon lightning deal and couldn’t be happier.
5,Don't be fooled by the size or the price - this speaker is amazing!  I read through some of the other reviews before placing my order and have to agree with what's already been posted - this is a high-quality item: wonderful sound good battery life and definitely portable.  I had zero issues pairing the speaker with my phone and I am very pleased with sound quality.  I've played music from different genres (rock classical jazz etc.) and this speaker is balanced enough to perform with anything that I've thrown at it.  The passive subwoofer design provides nice bass without being overpowering or making the mix "muddy".  I purchased one for my father for a birthday gift and he said "this is the best speaker I've ever owned".  I did receive this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.  I liked it so much that I purchased another one at full price (which is still indeed a bargain)
5,This is one of my only product reviews on Amazon and I'm going out of my way because of the excellent customer service I received. I've been enjoying my DOSS Soundbox for about a week the sound quality is great and I have it paired with my Mac. The one thing I didn't like was the loud tones that would play when I turned it on and when it powered down (completely a personal preference - I'm using it at work and the tones were distracting but I could see how they would be helpful in other environments). I reached out to Customer Service and they gave me a firmware file to update the Soundbox so that the tones no longer played. Even created a little video to explain to me how to install the update. Great product + great customer service = will continue to buy their products and recommend to everyone. Thank you!
5,Love the small size for carrying around.
5,THIS IS A GREAT SPEAKER SMALL AND POWERFUL GREAT SOUND FOR 12W CLEAR AND GREAT BASS VOLUME CONTROL ON TOP IS AWSOME BLUETOOTH CONNECTION RIGHT AWAY AND RECONNECTS WHEN POWER BACK ON. DIDNT TRY ANYTHING ELSE WHICH I KNOW WILL BE GREAT GOOD JOB DOSS I ALSO ORDERED 1 MORE AND UPGRADE TO BIGGER ON 32W SPEAKER EXPECTING SOON.
4,Pros:Battery seems to great. I've tried 4 hours max so far and the speaker still had juice left.It's surprisingly loud for such a small device and the sounds are clear as well.You'll like it if you care about aesthetics of your gadgets.It retains great connection even from quite a distance.Competitive price.Cons:Noticeable delay in sounds when you connect it to a TV. It's not huge but the delay is there.The touch controls respond somewhat slowly. You'll get used it.Summary:It's a great speaker for the price and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes music and youtube playing in the background everywhere around the house. It gets 4 stars from me only because of the delay in sound when connected to a video source.
3,No instructions can't turn up the sound
5,I like this speaker has good sound but i have a problem. Now this speaker have %20 battery My s9+ showing %20 And i want listen music but this Every 15-20 Second giving biiip biiiip I can't listen fluently. I know have low battery too much biip can we fix this with a Software update? pesky.... I know MY LOVELY YOU HAVE LOW BATTERY STOP SAYING BIIIP BIIIIIP
5,Our daughter purchased this speaker first and brought it along on our Memorial Day Weekend trip.  We were amazed at the quality of the sound for such an inexpensive speaker.  We purchased it while still away and it was waiting for us when we arrived back home.  Just recently went on our family beach vacation and had a few friends join us had our speaker with us and ours friends were surprised at the sound from this speaker.  They also ordered one before leaving the beach.  We charged the speaker over night and it would last all day at the beach and then back at the house.  The Bluetooth connection was never a problem it always connected quickly.
5,Works great. It’s small enough to throw in a bag take anywhere or move around your house as needed. The sound quality is great. I ended up buying another for outside.
5,We bought this to use with our 2nd gen. Echo Dot. It's plugged in direct so can't comment on bluetooth function. One reason we chose this speaker over others is that it can function being plugged in to power constantly so can't comment on battery life. The sound is wonderful producing great tone from the Dot. Bass response is very good given that the drivers in the speaker are necessarily small. This isn't our primary sound system.  But how much it improves the sound of our "Alex experience" is easily worth the modest price. Solidly built and well supported by the manufacturer this is a quality product and very "affordable" for its performance.
4,We ordered this speaker on Prime Day so of course we got a fantastic deal!  We were replacing a Bose Bluetooth wireless speaker that crapped out on us after 3 years.....we will NEVER buy another Bose speaker because they are expensive we had a hard time using the Bluetooth and they do not stand behind their products!  We are very happy with the DOSS speaker.....it synced right up to our iphones and ipods and sounds very good!  We use this speaker out on our patio and it is plenty loud enough!  The sound is not as good as Bose but we weren't expecting it to for $32.99 vs. $250!  If it lasts more than a year I feel like we got a fantastic deal!!  I would recommend it!
5,Use it almost every night across the room in a rental house about 20 ft. wo/wires. Connects pretty much every time sometimes doesn't connect but I just turn it off and try a second time and it connects. Sometimes it connects ring will flash then turn to solid wo/the sound that it's connected but I can hear sound mostly plays media files from PC TV eps. Movie and Music. Have tried the memory card w/music and plays great ring will turn green. Sound quality is great for me but I notice when the battery gets low it has static when played at low volume. I use it wo/charging while on use it for 2 days for 3 hrs. before I charge it.
4,The battery life is good. It came charged and it lasted for quiet a while. The audio quality is aeesome. Love it badd. Very good purchase.  I hope it's durable. Only time will tell.
5,Good product for cost
5,Very nice and solid smart look has great sound. It came with a nice waterproof drawstring cover (which I would have used if I had not already bought a hard case for it) a USB to mini charging cord as well as a line to line for a "hard" hookup in case you're using something that is not Bluetooth-equipped. (Yes there are still SOME things out there that are not!)It came with a charge right out of the box. If you are in no way tech-savvy instructions were amazingly easy to read and to follow.If you are going to be using this as a portable speaker I highly recommend you also get the BOVKE for DOSS SoundBox Touch Wireless Bluetooth 4.0 Portable Speaker Protective Hard EVA Travel Shockproof Carrying Case Cover Storage Pouch Bag for 6 bucks. Everything fits inside it and you'll have great protection for a great speaker.
4,I've had this speaker for about a year.  The sound is great  i personally like more bass but for the price i can't complain.I was using this nearly every day for many hours at a time.  I rarely had to charge it! I'm beyond impressed with the battery life.Connects easily and is zero fuss.But now the speaker died and won't charge.  In totally i must have charged it three times  far too little for the port to break.I'm pretty disappointed. While i really enjoyed this speaker I'm not sure if I'll buy it again.
5,Really good speaker! Had no problems connecting or learning how to use. Sounds really good. Was exactly what I was looking for especially for the price.Battery seems pretty decent and lasts a while but gave it 3 stars because when it's at "30%" battery remaining it plays a tone every 30 seconds interrupting the music notifying you its low. To me low battery would be 20% or less. Dial tone is very annoying but if you fully charge you wont worry about that for a while
4,This is a great little Bluetooth speaker. The sound is decent for the price range and the battery life so far has been amazing. Using it about 2-3 hours a day I can go nearly 2 weeks without having to recharge. I would definitely purchase this brand again.
5,Works great with my Bluetooth players no complaints!
5,Easily set up & great sound.
5,Damn good speaker. Like most speakers you need to break them in by playing for a couple of hours & crank it up with something like techno music (Quantum Frequencies by Space Invaders) to really get the speakers pumping. At full volume the speaker is vibrating off the table but the bass is tight & crisp without any distortion at all. The highs mids & bass are all nicely separated with vocals that pop out nicely. Don't know how they get all that sound out of it. The touch controls work very nice & no problems pairing it to the Echo Dot while using the Dot remote at the same time. The sound is not as room-filling as the TDK A33 (which has a more mellow fuller but flatter sound) but the sounds are more distinct with better highs like cymbal crashes.  Very well constructed with metal body & grill. Very happy with this little speaker.
5,The feeling if this unit is substantial.  As it is probably not designed to be carried around like the round speakers it appears to be heavier in feel which loans to its "quality" impression.  As I tend to leave it in one place 90% of the time I cannot attest to the battery life it provides.  I would definitely purchase this item again.
5,I really like this sound box by Doss. Purchased specifically for use with my iPhone. It synced immediately and I have had no issues playing anything.  I set it in a window facing my patio and control it with my phone or watch. Very pleased.
5,...honestly... it's my only bluetooth speaker. And I am also high. So I don't really remember that much about the sound quality or the battery life. But I THINK it is good. And if you like getting high you should go search out the comic book Riley A Teenage Bigfoot.
4,This a great speaker for music but not audiobooks. It drops the first syllable of most sentences. It appears to shut down possibly to save battery power when it senses a loss of signal at the end of a sentence and it starts back up just a split second late when the next sentence starts. This is the second speaker I've bought in the last year from Amazon that does exactly the same thing. The first was a Jam speaker. Searching the internet it appears a lot of people have the same problem. The only speaker that anyone says works with audiobooks is the Amazon Echo. Amazon of course owns Audible.com. Anyone surprised?
5,Sound quality is excellent and can deliver a good distance.
4,For the money this is a great product.I will have to say though that even after a couple of months owning it I still have yet to find the secret handshake for actually shutting it down the proper way. It will go into bluetooth link mode make noises etc but shouldn't it be as simple as press a button = done?Oh well.Volume knob works well but takes some getting used to as there is no actual indication of volume level.Bluetooth pairing does tend to take a little time (with Echo anyway) but works well once you are up and going.Sound quality is good but you aren't going to open up a night club with this thing.Great price Solid build.... worth it!
5,Compact with excellent sound!
5,Good speaker at a reasonable price.  Controls are easy enough to use.  Speaker identifies and connects fast.  I use this speaker in a large open workshop so sound quality is sufficient but slightly tinny for my taste.  But to be fair I compared it to a Bose Soundlink that cost five times as much.
5,Its load and its great
5,High Quality with great sound
5,I was looking for something portable that we could use outside during camping or when the kids were playing in the backyard.  This speaker was affordable and has very good sound for the price.  So far we have had no problems with connectivity or battery length.
5,This thing drops!
4,I needed to replace my big blue speaker which was starting to have bluetooth issues. This speaker is so much better for 1/3 of the price. It pairs fairly easy and the sound is great.I'm a little confused that it turns itself off and doesn't stay on stand-by. So when I disconnect the computer it eventually turns itself off. Next day when I want to connect a device I need to also turn the speaker back on. The initial volume scared the $#!+ out of me a few times - so loud!!! I feel bad for my neighbors when it happens late at night. No idea why. Other than that I'm really happy with it.
5,Sounds great.
5,For the money sound Is good
5,I am a Zumba instructor who sometimes has to bring a portable speaker. I gambled on this based on price. It has made me very happy.  It is very small. I fit it in one of those cloth decorative drawstring wine bags along with all its cables (charging and connecting)  since it didn’t come with a case. It works great in my gym bag.I connect with a cable not Bluetooth to an iPad and quality sound is consistent. It produces more volume than my students desire.I charge it the night before each class for about an hour and it holds the charge nicely.
5,I ordered this speaker because I was tired of dealing with the hassles of the cheap speakers that we had bought at DG & other places (hassles in the way of too many cords involved minimal battery life  etc).This speaker box was easy to set up immediate connection to our ipod  and the battery life is excellent.  We recieved it last week and have used it every day since we got it.  No cords no hassle  no fuss. We LOVE it!
5,Like the product
4,I purchased this to go with an Amazon Echo Dot for my dad who is in his 80s and refuses to wear hearing aids.  This speaker was perfect to make the Dot louder and generates good sound.  You can either bluetooth the speaker or connect with a cable that comes with the speaker.  The speaker will run for a several hours without being plugged in but it does need to recharge.  All of the connectors for charging come with the speaker.  The only thing I really didn't like about it was the volume up/down which is the circle on top of the speaker.  You run your finger around the circle to change the volume - my dad won't be able to figure this out.  I noticed that it also works with telephone calls but I didn't use that feature.
5,I love my speaker.  Great sound and high volume it’s perfect for my kitchen job with all the background noise.  I definitely would recommend to anyone.
5,I love the quality of the speaker and how far it reaches. I like it way better than my other "name brand" super expensive speaker.  Im so impressed with the quality of sound it produces.
4,I was exactly what I was looking for
5,Have had this for almost a year and I use it nearly daily for hours on end! Still sounds great and is durable. Accidently dropped it from more than a few feet high and it still keeps going. Couldn't be more satisfied with the product especially for its price
4,This is a great product with a great sound for it's size. Heavy duty and well made. There are only a few draw backs for this product that I have noted. Either way it's a great speaker and I would buy again.Positives - great sound small size well made easy to connect easy to use able to answer your phone through the speaker good long range connect. Charges quickly and battery lasts about 8 hours with constant use. You can still use the speaker while charging.Negatives- not able to connect more than 1 device to a single connection. Not water proof so needs to be used inside where no chance for water intrusion exists. Doesn't seem too have a carry case available for traveling.
4,Great small sized
5,Ya tengo un tiempo con esta bocina y la calidad del sonido y de batería no a bajado nada. 10/10
5,Good sound quality. Pretty color.
5,So I bought this because the speakers on my laptop blew out and I didn't want to send my laptop in for  an undetermined amount of time just to get my speakers repaired. The sound quality is great and the speaker wraps around the sides and part of the back as well. The sound level depends both on how loud you turn up the device the speaker is connected to as well as the device itself so it can get pretty loud but does have a limit which it will tell you with a fairly loud beeping noise. You can pause play and change tracks or video from the speaker itself which is handy if the speaker is close than the device is which is often for me since despite getting it for my laptop I find myself using it all the time and leaving my phone or tablet around the house. Oh and for anyone wanting to know the aux cord works just as well.
4,After days of sifting through reviews I made the plunge... And purchased the speaker I am very happy with my DOSS bluetooth speaker. The only two real issue i had was no random play Via the SD card. But that was quickly addressed by the awesomeness of a firmware update and awesome costomer support from DOSS. The second is bluetooth data loss but that can not be Fixed as its normal for any bluetooth streaming device and service... I suggest using a SD card if you're planning on playing music for more than 2 or three hours to save on your phone battery... Two of my friends are in the prosesses of purchasing one for themselves as well... I would recommend this speaker to anyone for the price... Great Job DOSS..
5,I received this as a Christmas gift.  I had been wanting a smaller Bluetooth speaker to use in my sewing room and this one fits the bill perfectly.  Sound is very good not only for music but podcasts as well.  Upon receiving it I charged it ... since then I’ve listened to several hours of music/podcasts and have yet to charge it again. Absolutely no issues connecting it with my iPhone 7 or iPad. Several features I appreciate ... when you turn it on it and it connects to your device it makes a very distinct sound; the wheel on top for volume works very well - responsive but not overly sensitive;  if you pause your music/podcast the speaker will turn itself off after a certain amount of time -great battery saving feature.  It just works exactly as it should and has excellent sound. Highly recommended!
4,If you're looking for a portable Bluetooth but don't want to spend $$$ for one especially if you're using it for business travel or in my case an extension speaker for an Echo Dot definitely consider this speaker.Pros"Excellent sound quality for the cost (No it's not quite as good as a $100 Sony or or other pricey BT speaker in the bass "department")Very good loudness if you want it to be loud.Good solid design. The white model looks especially nice.Excellent customer support (I needed a firmware mod to allow it to quickly reconnect to the Echo Dot W/O shutting off after I "disconnect" it).Nice controls.Nice carrying bag.Cons:Control Lights are too bright to use in the bedroom (Doss: Add a dim mode to the speaker)
5,This speaker lasts for ever and the sound quality is amazing. Highly recommended.
3,The sound quality was good. I had no issues with it until it it stopped working after only ten months.
5,I listen to music about 15 hours a day both at home and the office. I had a great little speaker for my desk at the office but believe it or not it was too loud. I just wanted background music. This speaker is both low and can be turned up when needed. It has great sound connects easily and can has great high & low volume!
4,Works well for price it isn’t the loudest and the speakers aren’t the best quality but like I said the quality is good for the price. I bought this item to use for before/after hours for work so anyone can easily connect to it and play their own music while they work. My associates like it and it is sleek and easy to use.
5,This is such a fantastic speaker for such a low price! It connects super easily to  your device. It's actually surprisingly loud for it's size! And the look of it with the blue accent lighting is beautiful.  I bought one for myself and then I bought more to give out for Christmas. They make a great gift. People that received it comment they use it on a regular basis. Why buy crazy expensive speakers when you can get this great sound from this one!If my review has helped you in any way please click the "helpful" button below so that I know! If you have any questions feel free to ask! Thank you!
5,Definitely worth every penny! This little speaker was the first speaker I bought because it was affordable and I was very broke. It has been one of the best purchases I’ve ever made and I still use this thing today after I don’t know how many years of having it. It has withstood getting dropped being thrown by an ex taken kayaking it is sturdy af! Absolutely amazing product but thinking about buying another one just to have an extra one ready to go wherever and whenever!
5,my step son loved it
5,Perfect product i would definitely recommend it
4,My sister had got this speaker and whenever I would go over her house I would always play it and the sound and bass would be amazing. The speaker was on sale so I had decided to get it. The only thing about it is that depending on the song you are playing if you play it too loud it starts to make this "trash can" noise and you have to turn it down a couple of notches. Other than that its a pretty good speaker.
5,It sounds really good. Not a ton of volume. Not a sub bass. But it is Punchy and the bass is clear. Fills a room nicely.  I can use it to Bluetooth our tv for the whole family just fine.  It’s smaller than you think it will be.  The quality and what you get for the money is worth every penny. It’s sturdy and connects to every Bluetooth connection I have with zero wonk.
5,My mom loves this Christmas present!
3,EDIT: I returned this item but what isn't clearly marked is you can further adjust your speakers volume after your phones volume is all the way up. This is done but spinning your finger around the blue circle. (I had pressed the area of the plus and minus to increase the volume). This is an odd feature as all other BT speakers I've used/owned have a max volume control of whatever decide is streaming to it.The volume was loud loud enough in fact... I bought this for a boat and main/only speaker. It may have sufficed however the sound was distorted a little at the very top end.I would suggest something easily and blaintantly explaining to customers how to increase volume.Original Post:I bought this because I was borrowing my moms small 808 THUMP speaker to use out on the boat. (808 Thump is small and one speaker) with the reviews of this product and size/ power difference I expected much better.The 808 Thump $18 out performed this speaker and although aesthetically speaking this is a nice speaker or sufficient for a small room if you want good bass or volume look elsewhere.I'm returning and purchasing a JBL speaker that is waterproof a lot more expensive but worth it! and you can link them together to have 'surround sound'
5,Great little unit.  Bought this for my wife for Christmas with the response of "I already have a speaker.  Why do I need a new one?"  And granted we had a few little Bluetooth speakers sitting around the house some of the quite decent that she used when working around the house.  That said this is the only one she uses any more.  Has decent bass response and very good sound for the size.  Like the touch rotary dial for volume adds a sense of class to the unit.  Have recommended this to family members as well.  Battery life seems reasonable although I have no numbers on how long charge lasts as some other reviewers have given.  Would love to have a battery charge meter on it but know that would add to the price and I likely would just be charging it way too early anyway.
5,Love this!! The sound is awesome especially for the price. I had been looking at this for a while and finally took the plunge. I got the blue color and I love it. It is just something different than the traditional white gray or black. I'm really pleased with my purchase! I will add one thing about the volume. I see some complaints about volume. That is probably because the volume in the phone is low.  For ease of explanation say your phone has 10 volume settings for music and the speaker has 10 volume settings. If your phone is set on the lowest volume (setting 1) the speaker will have its volume range (in this example 1-10) off of that. So the low to high volume of the speaker based on your phone set at the lowest setting (setting 1) versus the highest setting on your phone (setting 10) would be dramatically different. Hope that helps.
5,Great value for the price!!!
4,I use this speaker in my car. Very easy to pair. Sound quality is the best you can expect for the price range is only slightly muddy at higher volumes decent bass. (Again relative to price range.) If you cover up one of the sides such as using it in a car the sound becomes distorted. The outside controls are very responsive however the volume wheel doesn't respond to going around the circle like a wheel but instead responds to swiping one side of the wheel. After a month or so of use the paint is rubbing off of the top where I touch it the most. Turning it off takes too long---You have to hold the power button down until it shuts off. Great overall would purchase again for the price.
5,I compared this to a JBL bluetooth speaker (don't know which model) and my Doss actually sounded better.
5,Works great. Use in my amazon van while delivering.
3,I purchased this in January 2019 along with a bluetooth transmitter that plugs into the AUX out port in the back of my TV. I have to say it worked great for a little over a year. It gave me the capability for having the sound closer on a tabletop as the TV has back speakers.  The last few weeks the volume of the speaker is so low I can hardly hear it.  The volume has to be all the way up in order to hear it even slightly.  I even tried to directly plug the speaker into the AUX port without the bluetooth and had the same problem.  I  tried a regular speaker in the AUX port and it worked fine.  Too bad this did not last longer.  Guess I will try a different brand.
4,The power button is a little unreliable. It does not turn off the device sometimes and I have to really press it hard or a certain way. But otherwise I like the product
5,Just got this today. So far it has been amazing. I purchased this for when I study and sleep. I tend to become distracted easily so playing music on YouTube is not a great idea for me. So along with this I downloaded all my studying and sleep music (really just instrumental ambient music) to a microSD card and playing my music that way.I also tried out the Bluetooth version with my phone and my girlfriend loves it.I'm not really an audiophile so I'll try to summarize my experience with sound quality as simplifed as possible:The sound quality is warm and full. There's no cracking of any kind I played Bohemian Rhapsody to see if there are any defects and found none.Honestly for a speaker at such amazing price there should be no second guesses. I have been looking for one for so long and definitely fell in love with this one.
4,Sounds good battery lasts a good long time.  It doesn't sound quite as good as my Bose Soundlink but it's about 80-90% the sound quality for about 1/3 the cost.  My only gripe is that the LEDs are really bright and cannot be dimmed or turned off.  The suggestion from support was to turn it upsdie down at night.  Why not just turn it off?  Well turning it on seems to require holding the power button down for a couple seconds.  If you hold it down a second too long you're in pairing mode and things go downhill from there.Anyway other than the LEDs I like it a lot.  It sounds great and runs all day on a charge.
5,I needed a small Blue Tooth Speaker to provide music for a yoga class I have been teaching this summer. I purchased the Doss Touch Speaker after reading all of the positive ratings it had on Amazon and have been very impressed. It is a great size and very easy to operate. Out of the box and once charged it immediately connected to my iPhone. The sound quality is excellent and it has great volume. I have been able to use it for up to four 1 hour classes on one charge. I'm pretty sure that it would go longer.This is a great portable speaker for the money. I am happy that I purchased it!
5,I don't generally bother with reviews unless a product is extremely good or really terrible.  This Doss blue tooth speaker is simply fantastic.  The sound is as crisp and precise as your high-end headphones.  The tone is very musical.  Base?  Not much of course but adequate.  Volume?  It will chase you out of a medium sized room.  When my wife heard it she thought I had purchased another high end stereo system.  (When she saw the price she was relieved.)  I am no techie but this speaker could not be easier to set up use and recharge.  If I ever lose it I will buy another one in a heartbeat.  And no I am not affiliated with the manufacturer.
5,Bought the DOSS after returning a poor-performing   OontZ Angle 3 Portable Bluetooth Speaker : Louder Volume 10W Power More Bass IPX5 Water Resistant Perfect Wireless Speaker for Home Travel Beach Shower Splashproof by Cambridge SoundWorks (Black)         unit. The DOSS is a superior Bluetooth Speaker. 🔹Great Sound! 🔹Excellent Battery Life. 🔹Attractive Deign. 🔹Variety of Sound Source inputs. 🔹Simple Next-generation Touch Controls. 🔹Comes with Protective Travel Pouch.  Okay. So there MUST be something about the DOSS I don't like. Right?? Well yes there is. (If I really want to get picky.) It would have been nice if the LED charge status light (red when charging green when done) were visible during charging; the plug of the charge cable is inserted above the LED blocking it from view. My fix for that (see photo) was to stand the unit on end and—Tah-DAHHH!!—the LED becomes fully visible. 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
3,Easy to transport around but when it comes to the sound it’s nothing to write home about.  Good for listening to music on your own in the garage but your not going to want host any social gatherings with it
4,This speaker is decent quality not the best not the worst. Great for around the house at the beach or places where there is not a lot of background noise. I tried using it while driving and the volume levels weren't loud enough to cut through the background noise. The bass mids and highs are fair. It's an inexpensive medium level speaker. I've had no problems connecting with iphone. Controls work well.There are other higher end speakers that offer far better sound and volume. This one is for home office patio in little to no background noise environments. Hope this review is helpful in your purchase considerations.
2,The first time I bought this speaker I thought it was the best thing since sliced bread. After about 4 or 5 months the speaker started to exhibit weird cut outs while playing music. It then started exhibiting random disconnects and I finally tossed it. I Figured maybe the unit was mishandled when lent to a friend so I bought a replacement shortly there after of this same model and have owned it for just over 2 months and now it plays a song maybe 2 and then just start skipping to the next song. It will play 2 or 3 seconds then move on to the next song and does so again and again. The button on the device is lighting up like it is being activated by being pushed but there is nothing near it to enact the action. On top of that I still get random cut outs.  After 2 units have multiple problems I could no longer recommend such a terrible product. I bought I slightly more expensive unit for my mom a couple months ago and another unit for a sister in law last year. Both still work without a single issue. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this garbage
5,My 17 year old granddaughter had a couple friends over in the backyard and I was there also. One of her friends had  the Doss Soundbox and the music coming from it was fantastic. I was dancing around the yard with the Doss in my hand. I loved it. The next day I ordered it on Amazon to surprise my granddaughter with her own Doss. She loves it. When my granddaughter is happy Nana is happy. Thank you!
4,I got this to use in my car since I can't hook up my phone to my internal speakers. It works well and is easy to use. However the sound can be a little hard to hear at times due to the speakers just being in the front. And when holding a sometime hit the tough buttons by accident causing a song to skip. When the battery is getting low it place a sort of "busy" phone tone every few seconds. Can be annoying at times if you can't get to the charger right away. But other than that I love using it!
3,I like several features of this speaker compared to the last 2 I've had in this size and price range. Connectivity is good I actually like the auto shutoff that many people complain of the low battery tone is actually incredibly obnoxious. I am completely dissatisfied with the sound at even medium volume level a lot of music crackles sharply and overall the sound is flat and tinny. I gave it a while to get used to it after my last speaker I figured the cones needed to break in and needed to mess with transmitting device eqs but months later I find myself turning it off rather than hear the staticy crackle over my favorite songs. Giving it a solid chance cost me my return window if I could do it over I would have returned. Maybe mine was defective
4,The volume control is not very easy to use. Not able to adjust the timeout setting is not too good.
5,SO Far excellent!!!  We have only used it for couple of weeks.  It was a birthday present.
5,A superb product.  Very interestingly it acquires the bluetooth transmitter I have hooked to my stereo/TV system very quickly and connects to my iMac instantaneously.  The sound is quite good even at very low levels..  Since we live in a condominium with some common walls our late night listening would disturb the neighbors; with the bluetooth device the sound can be kept very low without loss of adequate fidelity to hear the TV or radio from my computer.  The basic controls are easy to operate.One classic error is in the documentation.  There is no indication of what format music needs to be on the memory card that can be inserted (whether MP3 or some other) nor is there any instructions given on how to insert the card  In one direction it does not really fit but in the other it does not lock in.
5,Works and sounds great
5,I work in a machine shop where noise levels can get quite high and this little speaker puts out enough volume that it can be heard while sitting on my work bench behind me. Connection by bluetooth is as easy as it gets just follow the included directions and you'll be listening in no time. Overall highly recommend
4,Connects well to my phone decent sound quality I like that it's square so it doesn't roll around the dash of my hunting truck
4,This is actually a pretty good product. The sound can be quite loud and the portability is really nice. Bass is not strong but is OK. It charges fairly fast and is easy to use. My husband used it on the deck while grilling in the bathroom during showers and for answering calls. It's been in use almost constantly and there's been no problem with it running out and the quick phone answer is great for him. The person on the other end has no trouble hearing and understanding him unlike the speaker phone on his smartphone. If you want an affordable speaker for basic use this is a good choice. If you want sound like you'd get from a Bose this won't deliver. Still a good product for the price.
5,I bought 2 of these speakers. They do not put out any sound. They r the worst that ive ever bought.
5,I love my bluetooth speaker! I have taken this speaker with me everywhere since the restrictions have been lifted here in NY. To the park the beach even drove to Baltimore listening to music from my phone with it yes I love it!!! ❤❤❤
5,I primarily use this for TV sound on my home office desk.  My neighbor as a lovely dog that sometimes barks when left alone during the day when my TV that is next to her wall is on. I dislike wearing headphones.  This unit has great sound and no "Lip Sink" irritating delay. It is close enough to me that I can use low volume and not disturb Daisy next door and I can instantly mute it if I have a phone call.  Love the unit  Terrific value for the price.  And it pairs wireless quickly with my phone or TV.  Easy set up.
5,Excellent product and excellent value!!!
5,This little speaker is awesome!More great sound and clarity and bass than other speaker twice its size!Well constructed and has some weight to it other speaker this size have no comparison  buy one or two and Enjoy!I have Spectrum on my phone Now I watch and have the pleasure of a little theater sound to my experience where ever I go!
5,I love this speaker it's like my best friend. I take it EVERYWHERE. It's very loud and the sound quality is amazing for it to be as small as it is. My favorite thing about it is it's PURPLE
5,I love this speaker. It is plenty loud enough and the quality sounds great to me. I don't know much about speakers - other than it sounds good. I got it to listen to my Kindle books while I make quilts and sew and it's great for that. The Kindle alone is not loud enough so I got the Echo Dot and this speaker. Once I got it I started listening to music with it too and it's great for that too. I wear hearing aids so nothing is ever loud enough for me but this speaker is plenty loud enough and also has a very good quality of sound. I bought the blue color first thinking it was aqua blue but I didn't like the color of blue it was so I returned it and got white which I'm very happy with. I'm sick of everything being black.
5,This speaker was great for the first few weeks I had it.  But for the past week the sound has since had a static sound as if the speaker is blown.  To be clear this is on my desk in my office and the volume has never gone above one volume bar on my iPhone.  Not sure why all of a sudden there is static coming from the speaker but needless to say I am very unhappy considering this speaker was $30+.  Def not worth the money if after a few weeks it will not play as clear as it did the first few weeks.  And of course my return window has expired.**EDITED**  The seller sent me a new speaker since I was having issues with the sound.  Replacement works great so changing my review from one star to five!!
3,Not bad for the money
4,Easy to use long battery life. Sound is  decent. I think overall it’s a good buy.
5,My husband originally purchased one for work.  He loved it so much we bought a second one for our home.  Thenwe purchased a third for a second home.  Very good sound quality and longevity.  Gave it 4 stars for Bluetoothbecause sometimes it can be persnickety connecting to our phones but all in all well worth the price!
3,Sound is very muffled… too much base.
5,Great sound easy to connect
5,Man you cannot goooo wrong with this !!!!!!!! This is the best Bluetooth speaker I have ever bought ... It's loud .. it turns off after sometime if not being used saving your battery power... This is the real dealll!!!!!! The only thing this needs to make it 100% is just a little bit more bass ..
5,I have been using this for well over a year now good battery life nice sound output and have not faced any connectivity issues.
5,I have used this speaker less than 24 hours but am most impressed with it.  Do not expect lows (bass) from this speaker like you might hear from the Bose.  However with that being said this Doss is only a fraction of the cost of a Bose and I am more than satisfied with it.  The mid-range and highs are excellent.  Crystal clear and no distortion even turned up.  The speaker has lots and lots of volume was easy to pair with my Echo Dot (2nd generation) and a huge improvement over the internal speaker of the Echo Dot.  Music is very crisp and clear.  Setup for Bluetooth from the Echo was simple and Doss advertises the (wireless) range to be about 30 feet from the source.  I have found it to be closer to 50 feet.  For $34.99 plus free shipping (Amazon Prime) this is a real keeper!
5,I love this bluetooth speaker! The battery life and sound quality are amazing. I use it for cookouts or while cleaning around the house. Nice compact design makes it very easy to take around!
5,Bought this to connect to my computer (via aux cable) for zoom dance classes and I'm really happy with it. My class is one hour once a week and I've only had to charge the speaker once per 8 week session. The sound quality is good and it's been a great speaker for the money.
5,My wife and I love these speaker boxes. We currently have 2 but we plan on adding a couple of more around the house. They sync every time without any issues. They work extremely well with Amazon's Echo Dots or anything Alexa related products. They are loud enough to listen to music at a safe sound level and fill a small room with sound. The sound quality is there too even the bass as long as you're not looking for thumping sub bass. The controls on the top will control the functions on your mp3 player or an Echo Dot. It's charge for at least 8 hours of continuous play and still has plenty of juice left. Also it will play and charge simultaneously. Honestly I can find little to complain about with this product and for $30 and Free Prime Shipping you really can't go wrong.
5,Nice sound...great battery
5,I bought this because of the SD card option.  I loaded a card with hours of nursery rhymes and let it go.  The bluetooth seems to work about as good as any other device.  Sound quality and loudness are great for the price.  What I did notice and like from the reviews is these guys can get you a custom firmware update if say you don't want the speaker to power off after a certain amount of time which is very cool of them.  Now if I could switch to sd card mode via bluetooth from my phone i would be completely set ;).  Overall works great for the price and the options you get.
3,Daughter's gift to play her favorite play list tunes.
5,I love this speaker and I got mine in pink not only is it cute but the sound is amazing and I was actually shocked that the sound was that good. The sound comes out from every direction and you can easily switch from music or whatever to making a phone call. The button are super sensative however the speaker is great I looked this item up first on youtube before buying  to hear what the quality sound was like so if your still not sure find reviews on youtube and decide from there.
4,Prior to this speaker I had an Oontz angle speaker that put out 10 watts and it was a good speaker and lasted about three years until it wouldn't charge anymore. this time I went with the Doss. The first thing you notice is how heavy this speaker is and how well built it is. It pairs easily to our Ipad mini and the touch ring on the top for the volume is very convenient without pushing on a button/ Great sound quality and  with two speakers each putting out 6 watts each youi get a nice full sound. My only complaint is it would nice if there was less treble but other than that for a $35 speaker it is a solid buy with a 12 month warranty.
4,I thought this product was pretty good for the money I use it with my laptop which is kind of quiet to help bring out the sound the sound could be a better quality but from my use it's fine
5,Prácticamente útil y cómodo
5,First I want to say thank you to Doss they have the best customer service employees. I recommend this speaker it is small in  size that is what so nice about it. The beautiful music that come out will impress you. I recommend the speaker to all who love nice sounding music and  it will fit your budget it is well worth the price and some.It come with a nice storage  bag and the battery stay changed very long. If your  anything like me I love to listen to music as I clean it put a pep in my step..So happy I purchased this item. If your looking for and inexpensive speaker blueteeth ready it will make a great gift for music lover or even if you have Amazon movies on prime you can  easilerly use the speaker for sound.
5,El sonido es muy bueno
5,I loved the device it’s small but pretty loud ❤️ I have no problem with connecting to Bluetooth what’s so ever. It’s perfect! I’m also buying one for my mom ❤️
4,Battery lasts forever.  BT connects immediately.  Sound is meh.  But it's only $25 so what do you expect?  I'm very happy with the purchase and would buy it again.
5,It’s small but the sound it’s amazing!!! But if you won’t regret it. Best Buy I did this summer and great to have at the beach!!!
5,A great way to get excellent sound -- most happy to have it on my desk
5,the sound quality is impressive.
1,This little speaker packs a punch In the sound of course! the battery life is great I've used it to listen to my music watch movies and podcasts and even listen to it in the shower. The sound is very loud and I absolutely love itUPDATE: It’s been working fine up until now ironically after the freaking return window had closed smfh. The speaker used to be so LOUD now it’s not as loud as it was -_-  it’s actually significantly lower than what it was initially &now no matter what i’m watching or listening to the speaker will cut my sound off and all i would hear is a busy signal type of sound instead of what my speaker is suppose to be playing how do i resolve this? how do i fix this? this isn’t ideal at all and quite infuriating especially when i’m watching something and the busy signal comes on out of nowhere it’s really really WEIRD.
5,I bought the Doss soundbox because I needed something that was easy on my pocket and was good quality. After reading several review decided to go ahead and buy it. I have been using it for several months now and I have been pleased with quality of the speaker itself and the quality of the sound that comes from it. It is not a Bose but it definitely does the job it was intended for. The sensitivity on the touch volume works well and the battery life is outstanding. I have not used a memory card in mind yet just connecting through Bluetooth. I have the white Doss speaker and it blends and goes well with my decor as I'm sure the black one would too. I'm pleased with this purchase and you definitely get a quality product for a decent and fair price.
4,I bought this speaker to use in my kitchen.It has a GREAT sound quality and I like that you can adjust the volume!For the size of the speaker its pretty loud!  I highly recommend this purchase.
5,I couldn’t be happier with this speaker. It is inexpensive but the sound quality is great. The most impressive part for me was the battery life. Played this speaker on July Fourth all day - I would guess 5–8 hours and it never died!
5,Use it at work & last for long time before recharging
3,I purchased this on sale so the value is based on that.  Had I paid the full price I most likely would have returned it.The actual construction is fairly solid and slightly heavy considering the size.  The flat touch top control panel streamlines the speaker and bluetooth connectivity was quick and easy which isn't often the case with wireless speakers.Overall the sound is adequate.  The volume can go fairly high for its size but the speaker lacks clarity.  Even at lower volumes the sound isn't crip and feels slightly scratchy.  I have much smaller speakers that while not delivering the same volume offer much clearer sound.If you want a basic speaker at a reasonable price point this could work for you but if you want a richer sound with more depth this might not be your best choice.
5,This is a sturdy speaker and the perfect size for a small space. Sound quality is very good if fact better than expected. It was very easy to connect to my computer. I can't comment on battery life yet but I expect to be as good as or better than what was advertised. Very pleased with my purchase in a field with many competitors.
5,Sound is very clear and with some bass but not significant. It can play music well but vocal audio even better. I found the Doss XL to be one of the most impressive in terms of deep resonating sound for music. Both of these units (the soundtouch and the XL) are well made. Customer service is really a huge plus for these bluetooth speakers. They provided firmware updates very quickly allowing me to disable the auto shutoff and so use it as an always on connection for my echo dot. Kudos to customer service Mila for her outstanding response to questionsIn summary very impressed with the quality of the units and with the customer service. The touch is great for audiobooks and podcasts. The XL is great over all genres and comparable to the Riva Turbo X in terms of sound quality for music and audio files
5,Great portable WiFi/Bluetooth speakers. Best in the market with affordable price.
5,I just wanted something to amplify the music on my phone in my house. Didn't want to pay a lot of money and I live in a townhouse so I didn't want surround sound or a lot of bass. This little speaker is perfect. Sounds great connects right to my phone or I can use the aux cord. Long battery life. Easy to use my 6 year old can work it.
5,Gave it as a gift
5,This is a very good speaker:* Has a rich sound.* Good battery life.However it does come with some annoyances:* If you do not hold the speaker carefully you might accidentally press the touch buttons on the top.* It has an auto power-off feature even while paired (if music is not playing).* It has a narrator that will speak anytime the device turns on pairs disconnects etc. This narrator is always at full volume regardless of the volume of the device.That being said I am giving it five stars because support was very helpful when I asked them for a firmware update to disable the auto power-off as well as the narrator. They provided it very quickly and with clear instructions. I would recommend asking them for a similar firmware update since this corrects all of the issues I had (and that you may have) with the device.
4,This speaker works both wired and via Bluetooth. But it does sometimes get confused. I alternate between plugging in an iPod to it and using my phone's Bluetooth. So when I have the iPod plugged in and try to get it to play it but my phone's Bluetooth happens to be on it doesn't do anything with the iPod until I turn my Bluetooth off. There is a Mode button that should handle this issue but it doesn't work consistently unless I turn off any Bluetooth in the room. I can't speak to battery life as I mostly use it plugged in. The sound is pretty good especially for the price. Don't expect a lot of base and you'll be happy.
5,I forgot to bring a speaker on a recent family trip! You have to love Prime we were driving to our VRBO when I realized I forgot my BOSE speaker I got online and bought this one the next day  it was delivered to our rental and we had poolside music!  I spent a lot of money on a BOSE speaker and in truth I can't tell the difference.  Love this mini speaker and would def. recommend!
3,Reviews were good so I gave this speaker a try but honestly every time I use it I instantly notice how thin the sound is and I regret having kept it. Guess it's ok for something low cost but I should have spent a bit more on something with fuller sound. Its better than your average phone or tablet speaker sure but not much better than your average TV speakers. The speaker features otherwise function ok. No issues connecting our using buttons or volume. There is a large delay with Bluetooth that makes it poor for watching video but that goes away with a wired connect.So if you need something really low cost just to boost a device with tiny speakers out might be for you. If you're picky about sound you can do a lot better for about twice the price.
5,I purchased this to connect with my Amazon Dot. I wanted a nice sounding bluetooth speaker that doesn't break the bank and would have decent sound.  Purchasing this was a great choice and I would highly suggest purchasing this product if you are in the market for a great sounding portable speaker.The addition of using a micro sd card to play music is nice. However this unit really shines with the touch controls.  Reminds me of the classic iPod with volume mode and skipping tracks.  It's very smooth and intuitive to touch.Sound wise you will be amazed at that sound coming from a speaker that is less than $100.
4,I have to say I was very  skeptical about the sound quality considering the price point however when I played it I was blown away. I already had the JBL Pluse 2 and the sound on this was comparable and the sound can fill a small room easily. The only draw back for me was that there was no wall plug. The plug supplied was for a computer charge so you will either need a outlet with that or you have to buy a plug yourself. It feels good in you hand and is very well made again at this price point I thought it would feel cheaper.I bought this as a gift but I may buy another for myself!!!
5,I am very impressed! I was looking for a small portable Bluetooth enabled speaker that would produce a good sound for my home gym without breaking the bank. I have already bought a few that just didn’t cut it—no bass and just not loud enough. But since my kids like to take things without asking me (teens!!) I also didn’t want to spend a ton of money on it either in case it grew legs and ended up in one of my kids rooms.This speaker did not disappoint! I works so well in my home gym excellent sound and bass and when I have it cranked up with my “work-out” playlist going it is almost as loud as if I were actually in a Zumba class at my old gym ;) exactly what I was looking for.
5,Great
5,Bought this to replace similar item I bought last year [Meidong QQChocolate Bluetooth Speaker].  First impression is I'm going to like this a lot better.  The other one in under a year started having an annoying problem with you push one button and get a different function i.e. push vol up/down and get a track change.  This unit appears to have MUCH better controls.  First test sound quality was very good no complaints.  I'm giving it 5 stars on battery life and bluetooth as a guess until I actually find out.  Overall better looking unit as well.
5,Can't ask for more.
5,This is the best portable speaker! The sound is awesome! I recommend also buying the hard plastic case for transporting…
5,Out of the box the product impressed me with ease of use. When I connected to my phone the sound quality and volume were truly impressive. When looking at the cost versus performance this gets 5-stars.
4,The sound quality depends on the room and volume.  I noticed in some rooms it sounds great.  In others terrible unless you crank the volume.  Even if the rooms are about the same size.  It may be the walls and floors affecting the sound.  There is a major lack of bass in the questionable rooms.
5,I bought to use with amazon echo. I keep it connected to power port however it automatically shut off after 15 minutes. I contacted a very good customer service dept. and received an SD card that stops it from shutting off.The sound is good and Bluetooth connected to Alexa with no problem.
5,Good
4,I have a little corner of the garage where I sit in the morning after my workout and do some reading.  The sound that comes out of this has depth and it syncs immediately with my iphone.  for the money...cannot go wrong!
4,Great for kids
5,Everything is great…
4,based on this price quality of sound is good. the only problem is when using webcam or skype speaker making laud annoying noise and you must turn off the Bluetooth immediately
4,This thing lasts weeks... On a considerate volume level being used maybe an hour or two a day it will literally last weeks. Great for falling asleep working in the garage or for when you’re borrowing a car with no aux port. I got lucky and spent maybe $5-$10 on this when there was a deal going but even for retail price this is a great speaker.  A+
5,Love this speaker. Just wish I had found it years ago. You will not be disappointed.
5,Bought for my dad.  Has never had a Bluetooth speaker. He loves it and uses it everyday. It's easy to pair with and the sound is good. He even has is pair with his echo.  It's easy enough for my dad to be able to use it.  It is easy to pair with your devices also.
4,I have some hearing loss and ordered this speaker to connect to my old IPad 4 which I sometimes use while I am in bed. I connected the audio cable from the speaker to my iPad. At first there was no sound but after I more firmly connected the cable to the speaker it worked. The sound is an improvement over the really cheap one I had. The owner’s manual did a good job of explaining the controls and setup. I also tried the Bluetooth connection that also worked fine. I always connect the USB cable to a power source so I don’t yet know how well the battery works.
2,I bought this because it’s not cylindrical. I’m using on my little fishing boat and I don’t want it rolling around. But I have  other blue tooth speakers with much better sound quality.. this has a cheap sound quality like an transistor radio.
4,Don't move past this speaker just because if its price it's cheap and high quality. It is very easy to set up I was playing music on it within a minute of me opening the package that's how quick the setup was. This beast is loud and has amazing bass. I don't know if it was just the one I got but mine came charged I was so grateful for that lmfao.Update: this is still an amazing speaker however mine got an awful short in it about 8 months after purchasing. It turned off and on by itself at random times.
3,This Doss Bluetooth speaker is built like a small brick with easy to use controls. Do not expect the bass it claims but over all the sound is clear. The SD card is a nice plus. It remembers your last song when turning off the power. I have been able to move it to a another room from the music source but it looses signal at about 30 feet. The battery last a reasonable time - I leave it plugged in when inside.  It would be nice to have an light on the top to show when it is charged or needs charging.  The small light by the power inlet is useless. The one flaw I found it that it can only be recognized by one Bluetooth device at a time. If it has been paired with two devices one of the devices either needs to have the Doss Bluetooth disabled or the device turned off before a second device can be paired.  I find that a hassle. I have yet to use the line input.  It would be nice for it to have a line output too.
5,We bought this item and it worked right away very simple to set up.  The sound was crisp and excellent and the range of the WiFi was impressive.  Unfortunately it had some kind of malfunction in the ON button which made the device next to impossible to turn ON and very shortly after completely impossible. I put in a complaint and was immediately sent a brand new speaker I didn't even ask for one!We had already gotten a replacement speaker for what this was originally bought for so this became my personal kitchen office wondering about the house speaker.  The new one works perfectly and I have had time to put it through it's paces.  Seems like the bad on off button was a fluke.On hole the design is elegant well put together and intuitive.  A great little speaker.
4,Great speaker for the price BUT I will say the hightones are a little muted. Doesn't really bother me much but it could use some more treble to be better acoustically balanced.Speaker is built nicely though. I love the touch pad buttons and volume control and the white case is classier looking than traditional rubbery black speakers
5,It actually arrived within 24 hours - Amazing! very god speaker for the price. Could use a bit more base but otherwise great sound. I especially like the controls on top: easy access lights up so they are easy to see and use. Would have been nice if the on/off button was also on top instead of in back but not a real issue.
5,I dislike one thing: it automatically powers down after 15 min. I emailed the manufacturer and they sent me an email with the download to upgrade my firmware—it solved the problem. You must send them proof of purchase and pictures to verify. In the future I hope they will omit this useless feature. The sound is amazing! Buy it.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I absolutely love my little speaker! I couldn’t decide between pink or white so I went with the pink and the color is a beautiful pink. It was easy to connect the Bluetooth from my phone & it sounds so amazing ! Definitely would recommend 👍🏼
5,Awesome Sauceee! Get it! Works good and is very loud!
5,Great sound easy set up
4,Compact and durable.  Sound quality is good but certainly not as good as some other devices (JBL seems to have the best).  I hate that the volume occasionally will creep up by itself.  Good Bluetooth connectivity.
5,This little bugger is powerful and ingeniously designed.  I have a photography studio and wanted a bluetooth speaker to play music while doing shoots which helps clients to loosen up.  Setup and connection to my iPhone was easy and straight forward.  The quality of sound is clear crisp iwth acceptable bass tones.  It fills my 15' x 20' space at half volume level.  The touch volume level changer is ingenious and user friendly.  What's really ingenious about this design is that it is also a speaker phone when connect to my iPhone. when a call comes in the music fades and down and the phone rings.  With a simple light touch of the mode button you're connected to your caller.  This works well for me as I can continue shooting pictures while answering a call.  Battery life is great approx 6-8 hours at half volume.
2,Do not like this speaker.  Sound quality was poor to fair with music through the phone but terrible when connected to the computer for music and voice.
4,I loveeee my speaker. I have the pink one it’s the best I’ve had in a while...The sound quality is amazing! The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is because when I try to speak into the speaker nobody can hear me.
3,The speaker itself is very nice and loud to a certain extent. It's a little heavy but nothing that doesn't put it out of "portable" status. It has very crisp high quality sound and the bass on it is nice as well. But unfortunately that's where it stops being good. After having used it for about 5-6 hours at work I was having problems with it being quiet even on the highest volume setting and with it having it's flaw of having the touchscreen like interface on the top having the volume high on a majority of songs will have the bass pumping hard enough for the bass of the stereo press the pause button skip track button or repeat button. Would I recommend this product? If you want a bluetooth speaker and don't plan on playing music too loud then yes absolutely. But if you're bringing it to a party  or using it at your workspace and want it cranked up to the max for everyone to enjoy then no. The sensitive top of the DOSS bluetooth speaker was just a dealbreaker for me. If there was a button press type of interface then this would definitely be worth the money that is put out for it.
5,A little box with a big sound. I mean. they aren't as selective as a Klipsch speaker but who wants to listen to Rush all day. Any day. Even half an hour would be too much. But if you want to listen to Punk Garden boom you have a party right there in your bedroom. A mosh pit with your surly cats and an angry chihuahua. I got another one in pink because I wanted to be cute. Get off my back.
4,I read alot of reviews before purchasing this unit.I listen to alot of EDM and dubstep and such and read a review from someone who supposedly knows technical audio aspects. Long story short they were completely wrong!Simply put the bass is not as strong as they stated and does not reach volume levels stated.howeverIt is still a great unit for general listening. I have used this in home as well as on job sites. It does still get plenty loud and is very clean. Not the best for bassy music but rock pop stuff like that its great.
3,Stopped working after 1.5 yrs
5,This is an amazing little speaker. Hits the mark on treble and bass sound quality. Was taken by surprise at the talent this tiny speaker delivers. Has sound that over-matches larger units. When we entertain we always play music and eventually friends ask “hey where’s your sound coming from”? Well surprise from this little speaker. DOSS knows a thing or two about speakers and quality. They easily compete with others in the market. We just ordered the DOSS Sound Box XL 32 so we can carry the same music we’re playing outside to inside our home - you know incase it rains we don’t want to break up our toast to a favorite artist.
5,I buy a lot of weird stuff on amazon. This was some "daily deal" a while back and I've been interested in a blue tooth speaker so for the sale price I expected it to suck but was like why not? I've been pleasantly surprised by how much I love this. It works well it's loud and I can jam out to all my favorite music at a volume to increase the annoyance level of my children (they don't appreciate my live concerts). Win. Win. Win.
5,This is exactly what I was looking for and absolutely love it! I have used it with my phone my iPad and computer. Connecting to all devices are very easy and fast and I get a feedback after every connection and disconnection. The volume change dial works very well. Great sound quality. I did not charge it after receiving it and so far it worked several hours before the battery dies. Charging is fast. Just fully charged it and will see how long it will last with a full battery.
5,Perfect personal speaker I love it
5,No thanks
5,Perfect little speaker for most occasions highly recomend !!
5,I love these. I  just wish they were a tad louder.They are loud and have great sound but I like to use them outside and so a tad more volume would be nice.
3,There's a lot to like about this speaker. The sound is great. Features are fine. Volume control is a little inaccurate but fine. Size is great. HOWEVER if you are connecting this to a Mac (running Catalina) you can forget a 3.5 jack connection. The speaker itself won't recognize it and the Mac think it's now a microphone. Bluetooth connectivity is great but if you get a phone call or simply need to pause the music for a second (or aren't playing any) PLEASE ENJOY WHILE THIS SPEAKER TURNS ITSELF OFF. That this feature can't (at least) be extended or better yet shut off makes this a huge PITA with any desktop. You've been warned.
2,Due to a worn out mini USB charging port on my old BT speaker I decided to replace it. Instead of going with a name brand or another waterproof speaker like what I had I went with this DOSS speaker because of the reviews and the button interface.Unfortunately the sound quality of the speaker is absolute trash. I'm not a DJ or any music afficianado but I listen to music or podcasts while I work pretty much 7 days a week. I was extremely disappointed with the audio quality of this speaker it has practically no bass and the quality in general is very sub par. For the same money I could have purchased a waterproof JBL speaker - which I should have done.The battery life on this speaker is impressive and the BT connection has been strong even as I've moved around to other rooms BUT there was one time that I was only a few feet away with no real obstruction and the connection became intermittent and full of static.For $30 there are better options out there. Avoid the mistake I made.
4,Audio has a lot of clarity so for streaming movies and videos is its strengths.There is plenty of volume coming out of this little speaker.  Only down side is you don't get much of the bass until you crank it up pretty loud.Maybe okay for young folks but I like to listen to music at low volume so for me not enough bass for music.  But for movies very good.Nothing major since it's a $23 speaker but wish they put the power button on the top.  Also the charge LED is hard to see as the microUSB cable is above the LED while plugged in.
5,Purchased because my 14 year old car stereo is going kaput and I needed something for music on long road trips. First-  right out of the box it paired up with my iPhone SE as soon as I turned it on.  Totally compatible.  I was pleasantly surprised by the sound quality.  I wasn't expecting it to be that good for the price and size of unit.  Works well sitting on the front seat of my car and around the house. So far the battery seems good.Update: Took this on a 6 hour road trip and I couldn't be more pleased. Also very handy as a speaker for my phone here at home now that I'm of a certain age.
3,Updating my review here... DOSS actually replaced the original unit (so far so good) and didn't make me mail in the old one. Appreciated their warranty support.  Here's my original review....This speaker has a bad habit of making annoying chime sounds when it's not being used.  It turns itself on making a little electronic chime sound (waking you up all night long until you put it out in the garage).  It often refuses to turn fully turn off - it makes the "turning off" chime and the lights remain on.  The chime sounds continue at random intervals.  I'm trying to use the warranty but the instructions only tell you there is a 1 year warranty - no instructions on how to actually use it after the Amazon return date has passed.  It's too bad because the unit looks nice and has a good sound.
5,For under $30 I felt it was a good buy.  Needed something inexpensive that if it got damaged lost or beat up I wouldn't be bummed out.  Using it with my ipod with the 3.5mm audio jack cable haven't tried it as a bluetooth connection.  Battery life so far is better than expected.  Sound quality - OK it does lack on the bass (they have an upgrade/heavier bass unit but haven't tried it).  Best quality is at mid-volume which is fine for my purposes.  Wasn't expecting it to be comparible to $100+ higher end units.  A couple times I noticed it played a bit garbly when the battery was running low but I just unplugged and replugged audio jack cable after re-charging - fixed the issue.
5,It is exactly what I wanted.. superb quality and small sized for my home... Nothing bulky! Fits into my purse to take on trips! Great for campinghotelseven in the car....when I answer my phone through it the sound is clear and understandableno issues! Will order again and again for gifts for friends! Best purchase ever! Thank you!
2,I use this speaker for audio books & podcasts (Audible Overdrive MP3 talk radio YouTube etc). Some speakers have a lag or latency issue and THIS is one of them. If there's a 1-second break in between sentences the first syllable of the next word will get cut off. I'm supremely annoyed by this because it's the main reason I got this speaker. It makes most of my preferred audio un-listenable. That said the speaker does okay for other things. It has fairly decent sound quality for playing music; the "thump" of the bass is very weak. The JBL Flip 3 which my wife has is FAR better. Anyway as for the lag on words someone told me I can hack/workaround this issue by downloading an app called "white noise" (iOS) and set it to "mix with music" and just turn the white noise volume down very low (in the app not on the phone's general controls) so it's quiet and doesn't interfere with the preferred audio. When the audio book is playing over the speaker the sound doesn't shut down (power-save or whatever) during quiet moments because the white noise keeps it alert! I haven't tried this yet--only passing on the info and I'm just hoping it will work as well as my friend said. Better than buying more and more speakers (this is the third one I've had that problem with; I think it's a software thing for saving battery during quiet spells--lame).
5,I was hesitant to buy this after reading the reviews but I decided to give it a try given the price point. I am glad I did! Set up to my android phone was a breeze! I fully charged it and tried it out! The sound was GREAT and loud surprisingly especially given the fact that it is an inexpensive speaker. I am taking it camping with me this weekend and I will update my review after the weekend. So far so good!
5,I bought it for my husband and he totally loves it. Sounds great we love it
5,Love the color and the sound quality.
4,I purchased this as a gift for my wife.  It's smaller than one I currently own and it produces less bass but it works as advertised and she is happy with it.
4,For the price the speaker does its job.It's lacking bass but if you adjust you device sound settings you may get a farely good thump.  Just be mindful that this is not a boom box and you will get a distorted sound if the bass is too high plus you run the risk of burning out the speakers.  All else is excellent.
5,I wanted an inexpensive Bluetooth speaker to use for when I go on bike rides. The size of the speaker easily fits Into the water bottle holder on my bike and the sound is loud enough to keep me jamming mile after mile. I have gone on about 5 10-18 mile rides and I’m still on the same charge! It’s not a super bass heavy speaker but the sound is crisp and clear. And another plus it was available in my favorite color: Blue!
5,I purchased an Anker SoundCore 2 before this this DOSS and needed another.  It had good reviews so I gave it a try. I like this over the Anker much better. It has a clearier crisper sound. It is louder.  I have this in my sewing studio sitting right next to my ear. While sewing at high speeds I could not hear the Anker. The sound was muddled. Not so with the DOSS. It also shuts off after 10 minutes or so of no activity. I don't like the On/Off button in the back - hate it. The Anker's was on the top. This does NOT have a mic - if you need this consider another speaker. It was a few dollars cheaper (not that that had any bearing on my decision to purchase it VS another Anker).
5,I got way more than I expected when I bought this. Amazing quality for such a great price! I keep it in my classroom or hook it up to my TV screen for better sound quality. Been using it for a few years and still works great! Would totally buy again!
5,Great sound quality
3,Overall a great speaker nice sound but it does glitches not on the music but where the light up parts are
4,It has a very good sound to it at least while it's plugged in to the computer.  When I hook it up to Bluetooth though there's a lot of static and the music sounds like it's coming out of a tin can.  I'm not computer savvy so it may just be a matter of making adjustments in settings that I haven't figured out yet.  I use the speaker at work and it stays plugged in to my computer so not using the Bluetooth feature isn't really a problem it's still a good speaker.
5,After watching my brother leave his in the rain and it still Worked perfect (not recommended) I decided to get one!  I love the size and convenience and the sound quality is good!  Great speaker for a great price 😊
5,My first Doss speaker wouldn't turn off correctly on occasion. When I called customer service and left a message they re-turned my call promptly and after hearing of the problem said they would send a replacement speaker which they did. Representative was very cordial and I received the new speaker in a short time. I am very pleased. I use it with my Echo Dot and it greatly improves the sound. I also like the looks and size in addition to the reasonable price. I really wanted a white speaker but it was unavailable when I ordered the first one; when I mentioned this to the rep he offered to send a WHITE replacement speaker for which I was much appreciative. :)
4,Sweet lil' speaker! The battery seems to last a long time (8 hours or something...? I haven't had it run out while using it). It sounds great. I've only used it indoors. It's good for hooking up to a laptop when playing videos or for streaming music in a room.My only gripes are:- the startup/shutdown sound is totally unnecessary. I wish I could mute them.- the lights are annoying. I play white noise out of them at night - no need for a neon blue light. And when I have it hooked up to my laptop no need for a neon red light in my face.Minor gripes - overall a great speaker.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Great sound excellent battery life great for music Bluetooth connection is excellent  this little speaker is very good for the price...
4,I did not like the fact that I paid for a brand new Bluetooth speaker but when I open the box it had stuff all over it like it had been used. But the overall quality sound is good.
5,Sound is good for the small and portable one.
4,Awesome sound!! It has AMAZING BASS!!!! In my opinion because of how much bass it has it effects the volume. It has pretty good volume but if you listen closely when theres a lot of bass in a song the volume lowers. Other than that I love the speaker!!! I would recommend it to a friend!!
5,Love this speaker!
4,Easy to set up.  Easy to use.  Sounds good for what it is.  Very versatile.  I take it to the bathroom the garage the backyard -- wherever I'm going around the house.  It glitches or loses the connection once in a while with Amazon Music but I don't know if it's to blame or if it's the Fire TV having the problem.
5,I am very pleased with this speaker.  It holds a charge forever.  Has awesome sound and super easy to link up with my blue tooth.  I would definitely recommend it!
5,This speaker is amazing. I ordered this one and a different brand that had lights and mirrors. This one far exceeded the fancy one that was twice the price (had to send it back/defective). The bass is clear and heavy with no distortion the battery lasts for hours it's not heavy and the controls are user friendly. If you're listening to a playlist on your phone but your phone is charging and you don't want to move it this little black box has great range. The sound is crisp and clear but the volume can at times depend on the volume control of what you're listening to. It's great for rooms that have noisy fans running or if you're in the kitchen or even in the bathroom taking a shower. You'll be able to hear everything well. Very pleased! Especially for the price!!!!
5,After using this product for a year I found the speaker to be malfunctioning. It was sitting in its box when it started to turn on and off by itself without being prompted. I could be at the opposite side of the room and it would be having this routine of turning on and off by itself. I also can no longer connect to it. The speaker worked great for one year but for some reason it just stopped working.
3,I love this speaker. It is easy to connect to my phone through Bluetooth and it has great sound. My only issue is that it has a feature that automatically turns the speaker off after 30 minuets of use. It can be turned off if you have an SD card to transfer the code to the speaker and if you can get the file to download on to the SD card. I tried to download the code to cancel the auto shutoff mode but I could not get it to work. I use this speaker to listen to a call in conference when I am sick and it is annoying when I have to keep turning the speaker on every 30 minuets.So I was contacted by someone who helped me through getting the needed file download on to my sd card and then getting it on the speaker. I have  not had any more issues with the speaker shutting off after 30 minutes. This speaker definitely meets all the needs I have. It is Loud enough and connects easily to my phone. It is awesome. Thanks for helping me get the file I needed to keep the speaker on until I turn it off
5,Great quality!
3,I only had this speaker for one day before I returned itThe issue I had can best be described as static when using Bluetooth. And it's ashame because this speaker has a lot of good qualities: it's heavy and solid it's firmware is upgradeable and it plays music from your micro SD card. But the unit I received had intermittent garble when using the Bluetooth from my smartphone in Zoom meetings. I know it wasn't the phone or Zoom meetings' fault because when I switched to an old cheap BT speaker I had the garbled voice went away. I can only assume that the BT function on this speaker is not the best. I'm going to try the Tribit Sound Go but it doesn't have a micro SD card slot. Bummed.
4,The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because the volume control is a touch interface I feel it's just more awkward to use than just a hard button however it functions just as advertised. I've had dozens of bluetooth speakers over the years and for the money none have even come close for sound quality or battery life.
5,We were looking for a good speaker for the beach and lake trips. I didn’t want to spend a ton for a namebrand because I figured we would beat it up a lot anyway. This is a perfect speaker for us! It’s nice looking- very sleak- and connects quickly.  The sound is perfect and can get pretty loud - or louder than we will ever need it!Great purchase for us!!  Even my teenagers approve.
5,Bought one similar by Doss a couple of years ago....This one sounds much better...easy to connect and easy to use....I normally use it when I'm home doing chores...taking it from room to room...doesn't lose the connection....also extremely reasonable cost wise...for my use.....
5,I bought this so I can listen to my SiriusXM stations in my truck which does not have a compatible radio  It connects immediately to either my cell phone (my source for SiriusXM)  or my Kindle when I want to watch a video or surf the web.  For a speaker this size it has a wonderful sound.  Crisp highs clear mid-range and passable bass without it booming.  For the money you can't go wrong with this one.  It holds a charge for several days of intermittent use and charges rather quickly when it does need it.
5,This thing is awesome actually.  I have owned a couple of these cheap blue tooth speakers but this one is by far the best of the cheapies so far.  Battery life is awesome and blue tooth connectivity is flawless.  Will probably buy a couple more of these.  Great value for the money considering the low cost.
5,This is exactly what I was looking for. It's great to use when I'm cleaning or just want to have a concert. It connects so easily with my S10+ and the battery life is long. The sound is great but it can shake and move a bit when the bass is heavy but that is fine with me.
5,Reasonable price
5,Item arrived on time and well packaged. Setup took under 30 seconds— just plug it in and go. The sound is clear and strong and can generate some surprising volume but as you might expect with a speaker this size not very bass heavy. Significantly more bass than we anticipated from this compact little guy but certainly nothing that will rattle the windows. We cranked it to 11 and experienced no noticeable distortion or OM issues which was pretty impressive in my opinion. We tried pairing it with several different devices and it did so in a matter of seconds with no issue. Works perfectly for us as an Echo Dot speaker and for ambient music in the kitchen. A great "music while you're doing other things" little speaker. If you're looking for a core system for your next party this ain't it. But it does what it says and does so very well.
2,Little to no bass and flat treble
4,Very great size and shape. Sound is loud and clear however quality is not 100%. If you are searching for a budget speaker I recommend this one over all else. If you really want that crisp sound I would risk spending the extra $30 for a better one. I recently got a new nicer speaker for Christmas but I fell in love with the controls mounted on the speaker itself and I almost regret giving that up for better sound; however the volume controls were hard to use. I could not ask for a better speaker at the time. Thank you!
5,Great sound and easy to use. The small size and white color blend well on our kitchen counter. Impressive sound quality for such a small speaker. Its perfect for our open kitchen/living room area. I wish the battery lasted a little longer but it can be used while plugged in/charging so not its not that big of a deal. Overall I highly recommend.
5,I've had this little super speaker for a while now and I'm still happy with this purchase. The battery lasts a while it charges fast and fully it's loud and clear and I've used it with my laptop my phone my TV I even connected it to my car one time (my speakers in my car were out). It's just perfect and because it is so small I can carry it everywhere.
1,I bought this specifically for use with audiobooks. That makes it trash for me. After every slightest pause (like between sentences) the audio disconnects cutting off the beginning of every sentence. Just half a second is enough to do it. So a sentence beginning with "Doctor Frost did it." turns into "Octor Frost did it." Maybe the effect may be lessened while listening to music or something with a constant input but for me it serves no use other than to frustrate.
5,good if you want quite music and has good battery would recommend it to anyone who asked
4,Did not come with aux cable
5,The Bluetooth is wonderful plays loud and a feature quality for the price. Not too fond of the battery life. I love it tho I bought a white one the battery cord comes with it but you would need a block piece or a jack to plug it in to charge.
5,This thing puts out quite the volume for being such a small device. I was surprised at how deep the bass was and the sound came out better than higher dollar units I have heard. It has lasted a couple of years to which I didn't expect when I purchase. I always see people write I would give it zero stars if I could. In this case I would give it 6. What a great buy.
5,I have purchased two of these. One as a gift for my daughter and because she liked it so well I bought one for myself. HIGHLY recommend! The sound quality is great especially for the cost. I use mine in my living room or bathroom and my husband complains because it is so loud! The color is vibrant the speaker is sturdy it is easy to charge and holds a charge for a long time. I will be buying more of these as gifts.
5,Love it
5,Love this speaker!  I’ve had mine for several months and I’m very pleased with the quality of the sound as well as how long the battery lasts.  Drag it all around my house to enjoy music while I clean and do various tasks.  Just bought another one last month for my husband to use at work. Highly recommend!
5,Awesome little speaker and I take it on the job with me.  Sound quality is good but it will crack up on some YT videos if it’s loud.  Good bass but it needs for highs [ treble].
4,I use it as a remote speaker to my back porch it connects with the Echo inside and works fine wish the battery lasted a little longer and had a charge remaining indicator but overall for the price it's a good value and I'm pleased with it.
4,Update: Doss sent me a new speaker free of charge.  So far the speaker has worked well unlike my last one which died within 2 days.  Thank you Doss for the quick customer service.I bought this speaker on prime day hoping to score a deal but I was wrong in ordering this speaker.  The speaker worked for the first day but the following days the speaker started to push the buttons on its own and skip songs.  After repairing my phone to the speaker that did not fix the issue.  Then on the third day the speaker did not turn on at all after I had it on charge for more then 2 hours.  What a piece of junk will be returning.
5,This thing is really really nice. Hard to beat for about $30.I am using it to amplify my Echo Dot and by extension for playing music. It was easy to connect and the sound is really clear even at higher volumes. There is a little bit of distortion at the absolute highest setting but I never use it that loud and I have personally never owned a speaker that didn't do that when you turn it to 11 so I'm totally ok with that.The bass is pretty good I could feel it when I picked up the speaker.I will more than likely be buying more of these in the future for other rooms so I don't have to walk this one around the house.*Update*I did buy two more for my other Echo Dots. Definitely worth it.
5,Very good loud and clear
5,If I could give it more stars I would. You would think that this little box had that much punch but it does. In a large backyard the music from this box could be heard from the street. In addition we played the music on the box for over 7 hours and did not need to plug it in as the charge lasted and is still going without being plugged. Definitely an excellent decision to purchase!
4,The sound on the box is great. Only problem is the box will go on and off letting you know the battery is getting low. Wont turn off till you charge it. It is annoying when you are sleeping and all of a sudden it chimes when you know you turned it off.
5,Not too bad this little speaker.  I was looking for a speaker and being price conscience. Came across this little speaker and it sounds great. Battery life is good. It is good the price.
5,This isn't as good as my Boom2 (Ultimate Ears) but it costs a LOT less--and it's almost as good.  You can afford to leave one in your car one in your garage one in your bathroom together for a lot less.  Sound quality is excellent.  Highly recommended.  Avoid the JBL clip speaker-- compact but tinny sound.
5,Received this speaker quickly and the setup was quick and easy.  Comes with charging cable (no charger) and a short aux. cord both approx 12 inches in length. Bluetooth pairing (from my Samsung S8+) was quick and painless and the switch between bluetooth and aux (to play Pandora from my laptop at work)....but THE SOUND QUALITY WAS TREMENDOUS!  I admit I am quite the audiophile and as such sent my share of "high quality speakers" back...I don't tolerate junk and even my 17 year old son was like "that's coming from that tiny speaker?"I have a 20 x 40 office and it fills the room with quality sound both at low and higher volumes.My son ended up buying 1 for him and 1 for his co-worker who use it on the job (floor installer).
5,I use for  my lash boutique my all clients like a relaxing music and take nap
4,Love it but sometimes it slides off where I have it sitting and it’s super sensitive to the touch it will change to another song soon as you touch it.
4,Great value and would be a GREAT value if Bluetooth was as good as advertised. Some hinky stuff when trying to connect to certain devices but be persistent and read the helpful directions and you will get there. Does seem to need "line of sight" to broadcast more than 10 feet - walls and even people seem to affect signal strength but greater lengths (as advertised) when clear path.
2,Pros - For the price the sound quality is decent. It was easy to set up and looks fine. Seems to work okay as a speaker phone.Cons - I purchased this mostly because I was having trouble hearing participants in zoom meetings.  I first tried it on a face-time session. The person I was talking to said that their voice was being echoed back at them so I had to keep turning the volume down. For this application I ended up just turning it off and haven't used it again. The second usage was the real reason I bought this; a zoom meeting. Same problem people could hear themselves being echoed back at them through it. I had to turn the volume down to the point that it was almost pointless to not disturb the others in the meeting. Then after about 10 minutes or so it just shut off. I turned it back on and it lasted for another 10 minutes-ish and turned off again.It's an okay speaker to take on a picnic or the beach and play music through your phone but it causes more problems than it fixes in zoom meeting and face-times.
5,I bought this speaker on June 9 2017. It still sounds great and holds battery life for at least 8 hours of not more from the original 12 which is great battery life if you ask me. I recently bought a tower with no speaker and it is now my main speaker for my computer. The sound is great and loud for a room or the outside easy to connect and control. It is not a surround sound system so don't get your hopes too high up. But it is worth way more than the $30 I originally spent on it.Also it held well as a bathroom speaker for a couple of months and it did not die from the humidity.
5,This speaker is great! It gets very loud.
3,We have two of these speakers and one started to have a Bluetooth connection issue. Hijacking from one iPad to another like to software couldn’t lock on a Bluetooth signal and stay.  When it started searching and disconnecting at all hours even when turned off we have to remove it from the property. Even stashed in the trunk of vehicle it would try to connect (the sound signals of connection search) until the battery died.  The unit has been since disposed. We are cautiously monitoring the second unit for this zombie like behavior.  Unfortunate since we liked the sound and used both often for home and travel.
5,This is an affordable Bluetooth speaker. Is not that loud but good enough for smaller spaces. Is pretty good for the price.
4,Tienen muy buena batería y se escucha muy bien pero le falta un poco más de bajo pero por el precio no se puede decir más y se escucha lo suficientemente fuerte
5,I rarely leave product feedback and I honestly didn't have high expectations given the low price of this speaker but WOW! I wanted this to connect to my iMac and I am blown away! What a wonderful sound for a small cheap speaker. If you have doubts just go ahead and buy this! Great product!
5,Battery life is off the charts so far (two months in). The sound is good but you're not buying a top-end speaker here so be realistic. Works like a charm.
4,This is actually my first Bluetooth speaker; I bought it listen to my workout jams ear plug free while I workout at home. Since this is my first speaker I have nothing to compare it to but I will say awesome sound it delivers! I would have gone with the black but I think the red is HD? I actually found the red to stand out more online and it does in person as well! Everyone wants to be so faddish with the Beats Bose etc... but I know better and quality at a decent price fits my bill. So check out this speaker save some cash; so far so good... if anything changes I will update this review fiercely.
5,Man... this boom box is amazing!!!!! The sound quality is perfect and the battery life is shockingly amazing especially if you're connected via an aux cord (think that's the name).. can you believe my speaker fell in a pool of sulphur water while at a party and the next day it started working again (that was over 6 months ago) and its still going strong!
5,I LOVE this product. It is easy to setup very portable and has great sound - way better than my laptop computer and external monitor speakers. Makes listening to music and watching Youtube videos much more enjoyable.Also a GREAT price.
5,My car
5,I love everything about this speaker! I had the same brand but different model. It took almost three years. The reason why I bought a new one because I gave it away so I decided to get a new one!. I love love love it. When its not in use it'll automatically turn off by itself. The sound quality is amazing! High quality on a affordable price
5,The speaker works really well quality of sound and the best thing it lasted almost 10 hours. I went to the beach turned it on around 8:30 am and lasted til 6pm without stopping. Best purchase ever
5,I almost never bother writing anything but I’ve bought So Many speakers this year- sonos Bose and a menagerie of portables that I just Had to comment.  When I first turned it on I had it connected to a power source.  BEAUTIFUL rich sound with a crackle & buzz on the side.  I was so in love with the sound (I grew up in a home where lunch meat meant bologna & the fruit juice was only for guests but we had Speakers).  I unplugged it to send it back (I was trying to decide whether to order the same) & the buzzing Stopped.So at least this one can’t be used while it’s charging.I turned it up & it was Too Loud for the room but the sound quality didn’t waver.Love It !!!!
5,This little Bluetooth speaker was a fantastic buy! It was purchased for our grandson who gave it to his brother for Christmas.I asked for feedback info from his sister my granddaughter who in turn told me how great it is! She said it has good quality sound plays louder than other Bluetooth speakers. Her brother will even let his sister use it haha! She said she may even have to buy one of her own that's how much she liked it!So I'd say that I would recommend this little speaker most definitely!
5,It’s very well made. It’s heavy and stable. I love the portability and the small size of it.Although I don’t have any knowledge nor ability to compare it with similar items I am happy with it.I mainly listen to radio including music and YouTube conversations.I am very happy with the sound as well.
5,Found this on sale a decided to give it a shot based on other users reviews. I have to say I am very impressed with this product - it amazes me how cheap good technology has gotten. I had zero issues charging connecting and using these Bluetooth speakers. Sound quality is very good for the price and worked fantastic around the bonfire we hosted recently. If I could improve anything I would suggest adding more bass to the speakers. Also the charging light is underneath the plug-in outlet making it tough to tell if it is charged without picking it up and looking at it upside down. If your on the edge just buy it. You'll be satisfied. My only hope is that this doesn't break after a month or two of use in which case I will update my review.-MC
5,Nice heavy duty speaker with great sound. Perfect for taking with me to the pool in the summer. Very long battery life. Would highly recommend.
5,I bought 4 of these Bluetooth speakers & EVERYONE LOVES THEM & their GREAT SOUND!! I have one as well & I used to work in Electronics where customers couldn't imagine a great sound in music coming from a small speaker but YES IT DOES!! Since they're wireless you can take them anywhere. The charge usually last most of the day which is fine since all you have to do is plug it into your computer OR if you have the USB converter to plugin to an outlet (which EVERYONE has is you own a cell phone). And it's SO SIMPLE TO USE!! Just turn on your Bluetooth on your phone and the it will find the speaker!! It's WONDERFUL AND YOU CAN'T BEAT THE PRICE!!  Oh I ordered the cases too!! They're great to keep your 2 cables in & protect your speaker while traveling. AMAZING PURCHASE!!!
1,This speaker has been fine for my desk until I found out that I wasn't receiving texts while it was on. That renders it completely useless. I have no idea how many texts I've missed this year. In the garbage it goes.
5,It definitely sounds tinny for music but I bought it to hear my workout coach better and it’s perfect for that.Connects to bluetooth so Fast!Volume is dependent on you device it seems...no independent volume on the device.Overall I’m happy. And it’s red. So :)
5,I hate writing review's but this one is definitely worthy of one. I was looking for a less expensive bluetooth speaker option and man does this one deliver. Small form factor and the quality was surprisingly good and LOUD. 5/5 would recommend
3,This speaker gets the job done but it does have it's flaws. After less than a month of using the speaker I started to hear a small popping noise. This would make sense if I listened to loud music but I only turn it up to half of the volume limit. The speakers still seem to work but they randomly pop regardless of what volume is set. I'm also having a problem where my music randomly pauses and I know it's not my phone's bluetooth's connectivity because I listen through bluetooth earbuds every day and don't have this problem. No other previous speaker has had this problem. From what other reviews say the speaker works perfectly fine... so I don't know. You're getting what you're paying for I guess. Also apparently there's different LED light patterns to indicate calls charging process and modes of audio output but none are indicated on the speaker.
5,This is the second time I have bought this speaker the first one I had got ruined in a flood 2 years ago. I decided the other day that I wanted another one and let me tell you it is even better than I remembered. The sound is so amazing and LOUD. It has the sound of a full size stereo and sounds so clear. Very easy to connect to and has a decent battery life.
5,Easy use
1,I bought a Doss Soundbox in October 2019 and November 2021 it is kaput fini no more or as they kindly say in the business - it is End of Life.  Actually it was a slow protracted death for both the machine and us.  The constant disconnection/connection sound was slowly no quickly driving me insane - think Heath Ledger as the Joker insane (may he Rest in Peace).  I had to put it in the garage so we could sleep. The on/off switch was useless more a decoration than for functionality. But they got me good with that little hole for reset.  After I managed to jab an unwound paper clip clean through the machine well into my hand I found out that the real reset button is so kindly hidden in the line-in.  I did not realize I got more for my money:  a Soundbox and a puzzle woohoo. Lipstick on pig comes to mind for some reason.  I tried all the firmware updates and it was like trying to add another charge on my credit card - aint gonna happen!  The sad part is that it still looks wonderful. May be repurpose as a planter for some small succulents? Yeah not happening this lifetime...Cheers.
5,For the money I got mine for less than $30 you can't beat this speaker. It is smaller than a brick yet has audible low end. Not pounding bass but pleasingly smooth balanced sound. Enough volume to fill a large room or garage. Good battery life. I ran it at about 80% for almost 12 hours before it asked for a charge. Yes it asks to be charged. Other reviewers have complained about the voice alerts but it is not as loud as the music so i don't find it annoying. The beep that sounds off at full volume could be eliminated. Just flashing the switch lights would be good enough. The capacitive touch switches are a nice touch and work really well but the volume control takes some getting used to.For my purpose worksite and garage speaker this solidly built unit it more than sufficient. Very pleased with this purchase.
5,Bought this as a gift for my husband but the entire family uses it ALL the time!  Sound quality is great and the control panel is simple to operate.  My only complaint is that the last person in the house to use it has to disconnect from the speaker in their phone for the next person to be able to connect their phone - otherwise it's awesome!
3,It works fine but if you’re looking for good loud sound quality just spend the extra money and get the more expensive speakers!
2,New Review:UPDATE: After receiving the new speaker free of charge after my initial complaint of the speaker skipping the new one worked perfectly for a few months. However three months the speaker has already started to die. The quality of the speaker has went down and now sounds scratchy and can hardly play anything loud without it sounding like horrible quality. Only good thing I can say is the customer service is going to try to solve the issue. The speaker itself doesn’t last long or has issues.After making this review Doss customer service sent me a new speaker free of charge. They were very professional in replacing my speaker and quick to respond. So far I have experienced any issues with the new one. This speaker is very loud for the size. As long as it keeps playing without skipping like the first one I will always recommend!Old review:When I first bought this I thought the quality was amazing. The sound is super loud even without turning the volume up all the way. However I noticed it started skipping after a while in the middle of songs and when I tried to go back to the original song it’d keep skipping. It’s been plugged into the charger for a week and I used it for the first time in awhile and it skipped like crazy. Only reason why I’m giving 2 stars. Great sound quality. Horrible in skipping
4,Just received the Anker Doss Touch Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Speakers.  I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 5 that i psired this item with and there was no issues.  The sound is great for such a small unit.  Battery life at the moment is over eight hours at medium volume.  The loudness is very good again for its size.  The only down side is the Bluetooth range.  I could only get twenty feet before reception started to break down.  For my purpose it is okay.  Maybe for someone else it may not be sufficient.  Bluetooth version four has a range of 60 plus feet.  This must be version three.
5,I am very pleased with this device. For it's small size the sound quality is exceptional.  Far better that the small speaker built into my iPhone.  I was surprised that the blue tooth connection was intact 50feet away and on a different level in my house.  It serves my needs perfectly.
4,I love this speaker! Great for small dinner parties and gatherings. Nice design and the sound quality is perfect. It is LOUD when you crank it up to max but the quality diminishes since there's not much bass. I wish the battery life is a little bit better but it still played up to 7 hours on a single charge. For the price it's a great product!
5,After purchasing 2 different bluetooth portable speakers and having each child take them to school I bought myself the Doss Soundbox.  Out of all 3 speakers this is by far the best.  Paired easily with my phone.  I am very pleased with the sound quality and it is very compact and easy to take with me outdoors.  I'm hiding this one from my kids!!!
5,Very happy with this purchase! Sound quality is BUMPIN!  My last speaker was an Anker Soundcore. While the sound quality is comparable the Bluetooth connection seems better with this one. The Anker quit after about a year so hoping this one lasts longer. I like the controls on this one better as well. It does go into “sleep” mode kinda quick if you’re not using it but not mad at it-especially since the battery seems to last forever.
5,Easy to use has a great range. Connects very fast with awesome sound!
5,The sound is very good.  Easy to connect to your phone.  Battery lasts quite a while.
5,I bought this speaker about a year ago. I love this guy so much. it works well so far.Simple connection is the key.. microSD Bluetooth or aux..  2x6w is enough for everything I do.I really wanted to get studio monitors for some simple home recording but.This DOSS speaker works also well. I threw away my old Logitech PC speakers.I don't want to buy this and that. This tiny portable speaker does it all.No complaints so far.
5,The speaker is a good buy but beware what happens after it ages a bit. I’ve had mine about 2 years it’s my main speaker but all of a sudden it pauses by itself several times by itself during playback and sometimes it will lose the signal and glitch the where you have to turn it off and then back on to reset it. No matter what phone I use it always pauses so it makes it useless for parties I’m not sure if it needs a firmware update or something but it didn’t stand the rest of time.
5,The sound quality is clear and the bass is amazing. The Bluetooth connection is quick with no Hassel.. all in all I couldn't be more happy with my speaker.
5,The sound quality is great as is the ease setting up the Bluetooth connection. I’m a  little technology challenged and need to figure out the volume control but I’m sure that’s my issue.Very happy with my purchase!
5,So far I like this speaker. Loud enough for my needs. Clean sound. Battery lasts.The Bluetooth connectivity is a bit less of a distance than my old speaker but good enough.
5,I love the sound from it it’s easy to use and bring with you. Battery lasts long and I haven’t had any problems with charging or bluetooth. I wasn’t sure about buying it at first but i am 100% happy with my purchase and i’d definitely recommend it to anyone needing a portable speaker!
5,If you are reading a review for this product you need to keep in mind that it's a sub $30 speaker made in China and is a brand that is not synonymous with high end audio. Having said that I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised by the packaging the ease of setup the sound quality and the value for money. I got it for my 6 year old to stream songs from the Ipod and it does an excellent job. Portability and size is perfect. Sound is great and the for a speaker this size it can pump out good bass and high notes at a significantly high volume. Bluetooth has a decent range too so you can stream music and carry it with you in different rooms. Don't know how long it will last but for 30 bucks even if I get a year out of it I would be happy....
3,There is little to no low end on this speaker. However it does get loud and would be great for outdoors. For the price its a good product. Is it a speaker you would show off to your friends? No but it does produce sound and is louder than your iPhone speaker. I may have bias because I directly compared it to my Sony xb30. Which has exceptional bass for the size of the speaker!For 30$ you wont find a better looking speaker..
5,These speakers were a big hit with the grand kids! Nice heavy duty box great color that makes them look like that expensive Bose speaker. The sound was incredible for a Bluetooth Speaker! Bass and Treble was on point! Gave them to a 201816and 13 year old and all thought they great! I would recommend these to everyone who's looking for great sound in a Bluetooth speaker but doesn't want to pay those crazy prices. For grandparents who are always being asked for electronics you can't afford but these are affordable and fantastic!  All kids love pairing something to their tablets phones and computers. I Can't say enough about these speakers! But  I do know I will be purchasing more for birthday gifts in the future!
5,Update… after 10 days at 16 hours per day under a hot tent this exceeded my expectations. Sound and battery life were everything I had hoped for. At this price point it is about as good as it gets.
4,I would say the sound quality on the DOSS SoundBox is decent.  The lights on top of the speaker when it's on along with the simplicity of the design makes it look clean and attractive.  I'm taking away a star mainly because of the size.  I wanted a speaker for travels and this one is alot larger and heavier than others that I have.  I've decided to just keep this one at home instead; and to just take along with me on road trips where space and weight restraints in my luggage doesn't matter.
4,It fits my needs
4,So I have to edit this review.  It's been about a month and while playing music it will beep as if a call is coming in (but it's not) every 2-3 minutes which is really annoying.  The company originally sent me an email if I had any issues but of course I can't find it now to let them know and get help.  Great little speaker super simple to "pair" with my echo dot.  Lightweight and easy to carry from room to room.  Comes with a carry pouch and packed in a nice inner box for gift giving.  I've already recommended to friends.  Company was fast shipping.
4,Good purchase. Bought it for a gift. Bluetooth connection is easy. Great instruction booklet.
5,Worked better than I thought it would for this inexpensive price...great value to me working outside and in my garage. Blue Tooth connection worked very well and covered my whole back yard.
5,Terrific sound quality and convenience! Perfect for deck or patio listening whether just two people or a larger gathering. Plenty of power from such a small two-speaker unit. Would recommend also purchasing the travel case for this speaker. I did for an additional $8 and it provides great protection plus has space inside for charging and connection wires. Buy enjoy and don’t look back!
3,Looks great I have an issue with the sound though. Every once in a while there's a pop sound from it a bit like static but louder if that makes sense. We've tried everything to correct it and I've chatted with Amazon product support too. They couldn't solve it and offered credit in return. It bothers me more than my boyfriend. I think it only happens with dialogue (tv shows podcasts and etc) but I haven't experienced it with music. We use our speakers mostly for tv shows and podcasts so I get a bit annoyed if the popping happens often. Sometimes we can go an hour or more without hearing it but then it'll happen and I get annoyed all over again. I'm starting to tune it out but it doesn't happen regularly enough for my brain to ignore it.
4,Well the price was right at the time and I decided to get 2 of these speakers . For day to day listening to music they are awesome and I really like the SD card option . But if I'm gonna watch a movie on my tablet I'll stick with my Awesome Anker Soundcore boost speaker. The Doss does fine but can't touch the Anker for bass response.
5,I sometimes have trouble hearing zoom meetings over my phone or even family members who speak to softly on the phone and this speaker fixes the problem. Had no trouble getting the bluetooth to connect in just a sec. Good purchase
5,It has good sound quality. Using it for playing songs from UTube which were downloaded to my phone in a medium sized community center to teach line dancing. I love it
5,I bought this for my husband during workouts.  He likes it and it's easy to use.  I gave it 5 stars because he said it was a good buy.  Coming from him it deserves 5 stars.
5,Muy bueno. Sonido potente.  Nítido.
5,Bought the first one 3 years ago it quit with hundreds+ of hours on it.  I also own a OontZ angle 3 I do not care for it as the controls on off etc. are very difficult to see and use.  The DOSS is my personal preference.  No rating for the Bluetooth connectivity as I have not paired it as yet.
4,This speaker worked really well.
5,I am 72 Years old and hearing is starting to go and I found myself constantly running the TV really loud.  I used this item to pair with my TV and put it right next to me it works perfectly and so easy to set up.
5,I liked that it was in fact just as described online. I 't also liked that it is compact with a case available. I haven't discovered anything I don't like about it.
1,I work in HR and need to keep music playing to provide white noise that will protect confidential conversations in my office. I thought I had carefully checked the reviews of this product but what an utter disappointment the actual product is. I charged it fully per the instructions then turned it on only after the light was green. I paired it via bluetooth to my Samsung Galaxy Flex and started to play music through Amazon Music. It will play for 30 - 90 seconds before giving an obnoxious "dial tone" that will continue ad nauseum until the music is paused. The connection will reset within 10 seconds and then you can play another 30-90 seconds of music before the dial tone begins again.I switched platforms to Pandora and got the same issue.I rebooted my computer and got the same issue.I rebooted the speaker and got the same issue.I hard-line charged the speaker into the computer while playing and got the same issue.I hard-line charged the speaker into a cell phone charger plugged into the wall and got the same issue.I am so furious about the amount of wasted time with this piece of garbage. I am packaging it now to return and will find another company to shop for my future needs.
5,I use this with my Nvidea Shield to watch TV.  I have it on a table next to my chair and can hear clearly without being too loud. I don't like the volume control and the range is not that great but for the money you can't beat it.
5,You can spend a lot more to get the overall quality of this wireless speaker.My evaluation is based on what you get for the spend.I was blown away by the accuracy of the vocal frequencies. AND the bass contribution. Not overwhelming. A little right of center. Right where I like it. Let me feel it A LITTLE.It's  a bit heavier weight wisethan I expected but so are my reference speakers.No one who buys this speaker  at this price point should be disappointed. Actually will be surprised in my opinion.
5,I've had this unit for about  a month now and it is performing beyond my expectations. Upon receiving it I had issues with turning it on and off and pairing. A contact with customer service had me do a few  simple adjustments and then we were good to go. Good customer service  by the way.The sound quality is amazingly good for a small unit and  the sound can be made surprisingly loud.  I take it all over the house and outside on my patio - no problems.My wife uses  it daily while doing her yoga and stretching. I use it daily to accompany my various activities.  I asked a friend who came over our house what did she think this unit costs.  She said about $200.  She could hardly believe that I paid about $30. on Amazon.Try it - you'll like it.
4,It's a great product loud and very illuminating. I love the levels of volume this speaker is able to get to without distorting the sound.... So far. The Touch controls on top are a bit buggy not always responding only about 80% of the time. Which leads me to the next point the LEDs are BRIGHT they will definitely light up your room at night. The battery life is about average of 4-5 hrs which is good for a home speaker but if you want to use it on the go take a battery pack with you. Overall I would recommend it for the price if you don't want to make a huge investment.
5,During this whacky shelter in place I have been finding music to be my savior; and to make the listening experience oh so wonderful this little speaker has made my life just a little better!  Super easy to use portable and amazing sound.  Totally recommend.  Tried another brand that pooped out after just a short time; so far this little guy is keeping me dancing!
3,It's okay. I want to like it more than I did. The reviewers here are overselling this item. I played a wide-range of music to see where it performed best: pop classic rock grunge metal R&B big band jazz and classical. I'd recommend it for outdoor use and if you want to hear music somewhat without a beat.PROs:1. High quality build with good amount of volume.2. Easy to use. Connection was simple and functions are easy (volume back/forward play etc).3. Has AUX input4. Can double as a speakerphoneCONs:1. Sound Quality - Overly high frequencies (shrill) with very little mid to low frequencies (hardly noticeable)2. Can't control back-lit controls. The top panel has a surprisingly bright backlight that you can't turn down or off. It'd be nice to turn it down in the dark so you're not blinded or off in the day to conserve battery.3. Value. I wasn't expecting such poor sound quality at this price point. The quality of the build and the design are outstanding but the sound kills it. There are trade-offs with these devices I'd much rather have marginally better sound than led lights that aren't needed.
5,I thought I had ordered the bigger Doss speaker so at first I was disappointed. I opened the box and set it up. This baby changed my mind! It has great sound and it's loud enough to enjoy your music in your bedroom.
5,I needed a speaker for my computer. I was amazed at the audio quality this speaker puts out and the price was far less than I anticipated.
5,This puts out a lot of good stereo sound at a very low price. It is very surprising how good the sound quality really is. It has a good amount of power as well. It will produce volume levels more than what the speakers can handle so you need to keep the volume at a level that won't blow the speakers especially if the selection has loud and or ver low bass. This is NOT to say that it won't put out a good volume level. I have listened for at least 3 hours but I can't say how long the charge will last. With no obstructions I have been around 25 feet away from the speaker (outdoors) before I began to lose the signal from my iPhone 7.This is a VERY good product ESPECIALLY for the low price.
5,I bought this as a gift for my nephew for Christmas and as soon as it came in I opened it and connected it for very easily to my phone. Its pretty loud and easy to use. I wish I would have done a video but it really is a good speak. Heavy duty. Will buy again
3,While in the process of opening the delivered product it was very  much smaller than I thought it was going to be. I was alright with that though in my mind I was thinking wow HD sound and deep bass as described is going to come out of this wow I can't wait to hear it. While charging it for the first time for some several hours I was thinking how slick the speaker box looked and how compact it was. After charging was completed it was time to hear this amazing sound of HD sound quality and deep bass come out of this speaker box. While listening to the music I was waiting for quality of the music to get better. So I started to adjusting the equalizer and still I was very disappointed. When described  in the ad it very much said HD sound and deep bass. So I had my wife come look at and listen and to her she said the same thing I had said. So all in all I gave it 3 out of 5 because it looks fantastic and the sound is just average. I had bought my kids a  cheap 15 dollar Bluetooth no name speaker and it sounds just alike.
5,This is the second one I have bought because I was so impressed with the first. The volume goes up really loud and still has amazing quality. Easy to connect!
4,Nice speaker for the size. Good for porch or garage or smaller space. Sound does get lost in open areas so not going to be ideal for large gatherings outdoors but perfect for what I needed.
5,I have an older vehicle and my blue tooth would not connect into the radio.  So instead of buying a new car stereo I decided to purchase this DOSS. It was one of the best decisions I have made.  I can not listen to  my music from my phone directly from the DOSs.  It sits nicely in the passenger seat and the sound is Great.  I simply carry it into my home and keep jamming to my favorite music.  This is perfect size for traveling small but packs a big punch.  I highly recommend it for anyone to use. Nice style for all personal tastes.
4,Got this to replace my broken Anker speaker. It’s had good rich sound not as loud as my Anker. But it doesn’t distort at full volume. My only issue is compared to my Anker I have to continuously adjust the volume for different songs. I’m not for sure if the Anker had a sound processor to compensate for low and high quality sound files on my iPod.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Update: Speaker be gone. Sat unused on the garage shelf making tons of noises and flashing lights after many months of never being used and not plugged in to recharge. Kept turning off and on by itself so it was burned in a fire pit. I would NEVER recommend this speaker.Another Update a month from my below update: I placed this speaker in my garage towards the back of the shelf after the below incident happened. Walked out in my garage today to find all blue lights lit up and it's making a quieter noise then it did prior. Interesting. This thing has not been used in SEVEN months. Displayed the alarming dying signal a month ago yet here we are still flashing and making noises. Spy device. TIME FOR THE TRASH CAN. And anybody asking if you can pair  this to Home or Alexa why in the world would you have that thing spying on you in your own home?Ever have a piece of technology that makes you wonder? This is it for me. It makes an extremely loud tone indicating the battery is low. Woke me up out of a dead sleep at 4am. You can’t shut off the LOUD annoying busy tone or the blue lights flashing. I had to stick it outside in my garage and pray I couldn’t hear it inside. I would not purchase the speaker again. Look it up this is made in China with artificial intelligence built in. Same as Alexa. No thank you spy machine.
5,Sounds really good!
4,Update:  Doss has excellent customer service. Proactively contacted me about my unit issues and sent a replacement.  Not having the drop slip or battery life issues like the first unit.  I’m using the replacement regularly. Definitely worth the purchase now.Original review: The volume u can get on this tiny device is amazing!  however so far it frequently drops the connection & Sound crackles at the tiniest bit of wind.  Battery life is rather short. I must recharge every night after running just 4-5 hrs.  Undecided whether the cons outweigh the pros on price & volume ability.
5,I mostly use this speaker for spoken word (audiobooks) and it is very good for this purpose. Speech is highly intelligible and clear. Has skip back function which is important to me.
4,This is a great device. My only problem is that it has a battery saver mode so it shuts off during longer conference calls (anything over 15 mins). which is really weird.I downloaded a firmware upgrade for the device and the support says to email them for help on how to install it but when I email I get an deliverable error of content denied. There is a link to something but when you go to it it's in an asian language which I can't read. So unfortunately I can't get any help. Hopefully I can figure out how to do it on my own or I might have to return it.
5,I just received this last night so I can only make an initial review. Ita adorable and THE MAIN REASON I am make such a hasty review....I recall many of the reviews I read stating that your device did not affect the volume so I was really disappointed in the output of this speaker.... UNTIL I decided to turn up the volume on my iphone 6.  WHOAAAA! Amazing sound. I was able to wander around 40 feet before loosing bluetooth coverage. So far I am very pleased. If there are issues down the road I will update but just wanted to inform reviewers about the volume info
4,The sheer power of this little Bluetooth speaker is fantastic. I personally utilize it as a PC speaker and I NEVER thought that it would pack such a punch. It is outstanding. The one and ONLY reason that I gave it four stars instead of five is because it doesn't seem to save the volume setting when you turn it back on. At least for my PC. It seems like once I turn it back on the Volume gets placed back up to Max once it repairs with the PC. However that is quite literally the only reason. Even the pairing was simple and the repairing is even easier. Great product.
5,The sound on this is great.  I was able to take it to the beach with me and it was loud and clear enough for my family and I to all hear it over the ocean.  Some smaller speakers I have had in the past would only get loud enough for the person right beside it to hear.  This was great.
3,The sound quality is alright. I got this on discount for prime day so I got a decent deal. The bass is not good on this speaker. The battery life is really good though.
5,Good
4,What a GREAT speaker...Can I just say WOW...the sound is Awesome and pretty loud and the volume level on my phone wasn't even on half...I gave 4 star review because I was going to buy a protective case for this speaker but decided not to because most of the reviews said they wouldn't closeso I decided not to cuz people said they received a protective sleeve with this speaker but for my disappointment I didn't get one so now I have no protection at all for my speaker...
5,Well i did my share of reading before choosing this... I am not a "Audio pile". I got this speaker for a brief music time in each day and mainly to enhance/replace the laptop speaker output with this one so that videos/movies can be enjoyed better. This one exactly fits the bill. I like the touch ring quite a bit. Sound is more than loud enough. From my usage point of view i felt sound is much clearer and crisper. All in all great value for money. So in summary if you are looking for a bluetooth speaker with good battery backup( i haven't checked how long it lasts...it never gave up on me yet..as i just charge it when ever i remember to plug it in. I think it definitely lasts more than 8-10 hours) and great value proposition then go for it.
5,I goth this to go in my home gym as the speakers on my treadmill was giving my the sound I need to stay pumped so wanted something that was small but gave somewhat of a good sound while working out and this one does the trick better than I though.  It's very stylish and the base is pretty good.  Love it may order another one to take back and forth out on the deck.
4,I use it for work in a machining shop and can hear it nice and clear over machines
5,Perfect
3,I just received this today so I am not 100% sure on the battery life. The sound is pretty clear nothing phenomenal though. I just needed a little speaker I could take with me to work while I was closing to have music I guess it serves it’s purpose. It is a good deal I guess for the price the thing I do not like about it is I noticed when the bass hits on a song the speaker volume seems to go down a little bit so it doesn’t hit that hard if you’re looking for something with good bass performance this is not it LOL if you’re looking for a reasonably priced speaker that sounds pretty good with clear sound this is probably a good pic for you
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I think it’s Possessed or something because it turns itself on and off randomly. I can’t get it to stay on or stay off!! Overall it’s an amazing speaker! But I guess I have a Defective one ! 😟 never dropped it stays in one place and is used often Because i love the Quality! I don’t know what to do ....
4,The item was delivered on time that's great. It sounds good although I am a little bit not satisfied with its bass response but I will not compare it against those high end speakers out there. It's pretty good for its price I think. It is loud more than enough to fill my room that you can hear the music from outside my door. And I love the speakerphone feature that I don't have to carry around my phone to answer a call and talk to someone. There is also a micro-SD slot 'though I haven't tested it yet. I didn't remember reading about it on previous product reviews. Overall the speaker is nice and has bright lights especially during the night.
5,Both the sound and material quality of the Doss are great! It's an amazing speaker for a very affordable price. I was nervous about all the negative reviews about the sound/ volume button but it works well as long as you know how to properly use it (by running your finger around the blue ring). I also use the speaker with my echo dot and it works perfectly! Furthermore I love that it automatically turns off after about 15 minutes when not in use. It's also a very convenient size so you can easily take it with you on the go (it comes with a bag!).Do note though that the light from the controls do stay on the entire time and are quite bright. You also have to hold the on/off button for a few seconds before it turns on/off.
5,Was looking for a bluetooth wireless speaker along with aux cable for my living room as i  have a projector which we use to watch hollywood and bollywood movies and this was just perfect. Phew wanted something different to cope up with this covid times especially when we have kids.Not bad so far and liking it. Sound quality is nice and easy to operate like increase and decrease functionlity.
4,Update after my review the seller reached to me to inform me that the defective product would be replaced under warrany.  The replacement is great and the company stood behond its product.............I purchased two of these one last year and one this year  The first one was good. The sound quality was acceptable and it was easy to pair  However the second one has a distinct crackle when played with my devices.  Assuming that the second one would perform well I did not use the second one until after the return window closed. The first one still works well but i would not buy another one
5,Simply put the sound this speaker puts out is GREAT. I'm using it to listen to music from my iPod Touch and for sound while watching movies from my Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 tablet. It syncs up with them flawlessly. The best part is through the Bluetooth connection I can pause start stop fast forward and reverse movies and music from the touch controls on top of the speaker. It also works with my Galaxy Note 4 phone. Has a great state-of-the-art look also.The ONLY downside was I paid to have it delivered the next day but it showed up a day late. I gotta say this about Amazon customer service and support if they make a promise they keep it. They told me that they would refund my shipping costs if this showed up late and they did.Buy it you'll like it.
5,This speaker exceeds my expectation.  We use it in our RV while it is moving down the road.  We couldn't hear the TV with all the engine and road noise while the RV is going down the highway.  With this little speaker the sound can get even too loud.  It doesn't sound bad either.  The battery life lasts the whole day or we can just keep it plugged into our USB port to charge while being used.  Now we can enjoy a movie or two while taking long RV trips.
5,This speaker is awesome. Easy to connect to any device. and it is nice and loud. My son LOVES THIS!! The color is great too.
5,I was hesitant to purchase bc of past history with a similar product. But by far best speaker I’ve had for the price. I take it everywhere!
4,The Bluetooth connectivity can be iffy sometimes. I’ll have to forget the device then reintroduce it but over all it’s an excellent speaker! I’d buy again. When the battery is low it will interrupt your music/audio with a sound like an old busy signal. It drove me nuts! But I finally figured out that it was the low battery alert.
4,Great sleek little bluetooth speaker. Easy to sync and I really like the auto-off feature that kicks in after play has been paused for a while/the bluetooth has been disconnected. Well-balanced sound not tinny or cracking even at higher volumes. Clear sound at low volume as well. The speaker is sturdy and doesn't vibrate the table at all. Style points for the blue light although the circular touch volume control is not the most precise a basic +/- would be easier. Bass may not have as much oomph as some of the other speakers in its class but the sound quality is good overall considering the size of the speaker.
4,This is exactly what I wanted for the price it is great. My wife uses it in the kitchen to listen to YouTube and other podcasts while cooking dinner. It is louder and has a fuller sound than her iPhone 6s plus so listening to things over the sounds of the kitchen is easy. I give it a 4 star instead of 5 because it is not easy to switch devices. For example if my wife is upstairs listening to something on her phone and I want to pair it to my phone in the kitchen I can't switch it unless she turns off Bluetooth on her phone. Otherwise it's battery lasts quite a while for our usage.
5,Good
5,I am editing my review and it's still 5-stars after a significant amount of time and use. The sound quality is great and the volume it's capable of producing is impressive. The reason I needed to update this review is that I have clumsily dropped this thing from my full height onto hard floors at least 5 or 6 times. Had it broken even after the first time it would have been my own fault for dropping it and yet even after all this abuse it's still working perfectly. That speaks very well to how solidly it was built. This bluetooth speaker was a fantastic buy and if the one I have ever stops working I would immediately buy another one to replace it. I wouldn't even shop around first.
4,Se sabe que por lo económico no se esperaba mayor potencia pero me quede corto le falta potencia y no es nada envolvente. El diseño es bonito práctico y elegante es un altavoz solo para espacios cerrados
3,Pros:- Exceptionally nice fit and finish for the money- Good weight to the speakerCons:- Bass was so bad it sounded like the drivers were out of phase. My little junker 808 speaker half it's size had better bass. I was hoping it would have better bass than my 1st gen echo but not even close. Still thinking it was wired out of phase internally. I do not think a note was played under 100hz. Drums sounded like someone hitting cardboard.- Bluetooth seemed to glitch every 30-40 seconds. Just a little oddity. Happened when streaming from multiple devices.Returned this unit and going to give the larger doss XL a go. Well over twice the price and has a dedicated micro sub... so I have high hopes for it in comparison to this unit. Not looking for audiophile sound from a portable but something at least good radio quality.
5,Cutest little speaker. Has weight to it so it feels like it’s got good quality and not cheaply composed. The setup was super quick and easy. It gets VERY LOUD in my one bedroom apartment I can hear the music playing outside my front door with the volume all the way up.Wonderful purchase. I love it!
5,I bought this speaker for my upcoming vacation my sister  had bought the same one and I was in love  especially with getting it at an affordable price . Very nice sound you won’t regret buying this product
3,Just purchased and my wife (a music major) and I compared some of Bach's demanding organ music from the DOSS to that from a UE Mini-Boom we purchased several years ago. Our ears did not detect a significant difference. UPDATE review after using almost every evening since purchase. The volume control apparently resets automatically to a mid-range position after the speaker has been turned off. This is rather annoying as the volume must be reset to an acceptable level each time the speaker is turned back on. I don't have this problem with my UE Mini-Boom so am now obliged to downgrade the DOSS. UPDATE#2:  Manufacturer was contacted regarding speaker volume "problem;" they E-mailed a firmware "patch" that seems to have fixed the problem so I give them 5-STARS for customer service. July 2019 update: Speaker will no longer hold a charge and periodically emits phone busy signal.
4,I am liking this inexpensive little speaker for adding some quality ambiance to my town home. I use it with an Echo Dot to play music during my morning routine around the kitchen and living room. For this purpose I don't feel the need for punchy base like I'd get from my JBL Flip 4 which this speaker obviously lacks.  Still I find it fills the area with very good quality sound while I'm going about my morning tasks. It works reliably with my Echo Dot via bluetooth. While you can't turn it off/on via the Echo you can control the volume and music selection. Its just what I wanted.
5,I loved many things about the speaker including the responsive touch buttons volume control and the sound quality. However it would periodically have static "snapping" while playing music at any volume. It's a shame because I really liked the design of this speaker but I can't get past the annoyance of the static pop or snap that keeps happening. I ended up returning it.Edit: Upon reviewing the seller contacted me and offered a replacement. This one now works perfectly with no static but I have to say that the original defective item was not the exact same as the replacement. My replacement item had a peel off sticker at the top of the speaker with button descriptions and also came with a small needle to restart the speaker. The original one did not come with these extras so I wonder if the defective one was a previous version or something.
5,I love this speaker! I am able to Bluetooth it to my iPhone my iPad and my MacBook Pro. I watch my shows from my iPad while I wash dishes and the sound is never loud enough to be heard over my husband’s tv in the next room. But with this DOSS speaker I can now hear my shows clearly! I am thrilled! This makes my iPhone music come alive. Also...I was able last night to pop a DVD into my laptop and watch a movie with near theater sound in my craft room as I worked. I am beyond thrilled with this product and carry it around the house with me. I can even answer the phone and converse with someone while doing things around the room and their voice is really clear! I love it!
5,Considering the cost this speaker is great! It's perfect for use while grilling out or other outdoor activities where electricity isn't an option. The size is convenient to take it wherever you're going without worrying about lugging something heavy or bulky. The battery has never died on me and I've had it outside blasting music for a few hours at a time before.***The only issue I had at first was the Bluetooth. My phone couldn't find it or connect but I restarted my phone and it connected immediately. Whether it was the speaker or my phone it's been fine ever since.
4,Loved this thing could be carried 25 feet with walls without disconnecting or issues receiving audio. Then one day I unplugged from AUX cord and it wouldn't let me turn it off or modes until it died then I'd have to give it a full charge. Had it for almost two years before it started turning off when turned all the way up even when plugged in then it stop powering on without being on charger then it stop charging. Would buy again thoughI really liked the audio and bass this thing puts out. Also used in a LOUD warehouse and you could really hear this thing banging.
5,Really enjoy this speaker. It's loud and the battery life lasts longer than I expected. The sound is clear.
5,Love it!
5,I bought this 2 years ago and never wrote a review. This product is great for the price. I usually only use it for about 30 minutes at a time so I never really paid attention to how long the charge lasts. I had already used it a little bit since I last charged it. But today I am sitting in quarantine listening to a DJ’s virtual dance party for 5 HOURS and it is still going. I am impressed.
4,Works fine
5,Paired easily with my phone Bluetooth technology.  This 8 in jam box now sits unobtrusively on our mantle and booms out whatever tunes I tell my phone to send to it.  Adjusting the volume was confusing at first because it is not labelled anywhere but I figured out that the volume is controlled by touching the circle in the middle clockwise to increase the volume and counter-clockwise reduce it.  Other than that I'm a big fan of this little device.  I originally planned to keep this charged to take on trips since neither of our cars we're Bluetooth capable but that changed yesterday after  an accident forced us to get a new car so we splurged a little bit.  Regardless I can take this anywhere because it's small enough to fit in my backpack and jam out some tunes YouTube or any podcast.
5,I like the product . The sound is so wonderful. I just don’t like it turn on all the way because I am not the only one living in the house. But if I have the chance I will definitely turn on as loud as I can especially if I have my favorite song playing.
4,I like the sound box I purchased. The battery life does not last as long as I thought it would after charge.
5,The battery lasts a surprisingly long time! I use a Bluetooth speaker all the time and it lasts for days. The audio quality is high and the controls are extremely simple. Super good deal.
4,I like it but it’s not loud at all barely louder then the speakers on my iphone
4,I really like how fast it connects to my devices and the volume increase/ decrease button is really cool. My personal choice is to have heavy bass. This device is okay to me. When your from the Caribbean like me  people us like great quality speakers sound with good heavy bass. I have other speakers that are the same size as this one purchased has heavier bass than this one. Otherwise it’s nice.
5,I have had this speaker for a couple of months now and I love it. Good bottom end mid-range is strong and the high end is balanced and not overly bright. Good BT range and simple to pair. Battery life is amazingly good. Wishing everything I purchased worked so well.
5,I bought this to use with my energy work sessions.  It had lots of good reviews and was at a great price. I got it yesterday and it was better than I expected! The "volume" circle thing takes some getting used to but it's just as easy to use the volume on your device. The sound quality is fantastic. It does come with both a micro USB charging cord (but no wall plug) and a 3.5mm jack cord. Both these cords are very short (maaaaaybe 3FT each?) so expect to get yourself a longer cord or an extension cord. I would absolutely recommend this Speaker- will be using this for music rather than my computer from now on :)
5,This speaker is amazing. The battery life is LONG. The sound quality is great and the bass is there. It fills the lower floor of my house with sound. You can get better speakers if you're willing to pay for them but for the price I think this is top tier.
4,I want to give it 5 stars but it pops ever so often like it's going to blow the speakers. I can live with it for what I paid but it still loses a star for that side of quality. Other than that it is a sturdy unit that pumps out some great sound and has some wicked battery life.
4,Works good for the price i use it for louder sound when watching my videos i dont use it for music
5,*update* I first wrote the review below after receiving the product charging it and attempting to use it. Since then the company contacted me and offered a replacement. I have received charged and used the replacement. The sound is great! It pairs well with my phone. The only down side is it auto shuts off too quickly after no use but I can totally see why.The company has great customer service and really backs their product.I love the size. I want to love the product but I have charged it for well over 24 hours and I can not get it to turn on. Even holding the "on" button for a long hold still does not turn on. Since I can't get the darn thing on I can't tell how it sounds. I was looking forward to using this in my classroom and now I am sending it back.
5,I use this speaker in my garage and it sounds great it can also get loud enough to hear over my power tools.  I would definitely recommend especially with how low the cost is on it
5,I brought 2 of these one for my dad and me and the bass is amazing .. The sound quality is very great .. I do however notice at times the Bluetooth takes a second to pair but I do believe it's because of my laptop .. Nonetheless I will be buying more of Doss products..
5,I love my speakers it’s cute n portable n above all loud and clear.
5,Update: contacted the seller who immediately sent a replacement which works perfectly and sounds great. Connects easily and controls are perfect. Very happy with the product definitely what I expected given the other reviews. Good product and excellent customer service!Unfortunately when I received this speaker the sound quality out of the box was quite poor. That may not be fair to say it plays the music quite well and sounds nice but there is a crackling noise in the background which is very distracting.Given the plethora of high reviews out there I'm willing to assume this is just a defective product and will be contacting the company.2 stars as it's a nice looking speaker well designed and has good functions. If a replacement loses the crackling noise this would easily be a five star review.
5,I love the sound quality!  Also the battery life is better than I have had with others.  The price I paid for this speaker was lower than expected.  This is my second one so I can have one at home and one at work.  Thinking about getting a third one for other uses!
5,This little speaker puts out a surprising amount of sound.  I was pleased to find that the materials are solid (as opposed to some that felt flimsy or made if soft plastic).  It pairs easily with my iphone and ipad (assuming you understand the general process of pairing devices) and the controls are intuitive.  I even added velcro to the bottom and mounted in my car so I could listen to my stuff while the kids listen to the radio.  PLENTY loud enough to hear over the sound of freeway road noise and the kids watching a DVD in the back.  I think to get significantly better sound you would have to make a huge jump in price.  For the cost and size I don't think there's many (if any) speakers out there that could do a better job.
5,This is a perfect second portable speaker. My first is a BOSE that I keep for inside use. This Doss has great sound quality. I am very happy with this purchase.
2,I was going to give this a stunning 5-star review - I was so excited for it I never do that - but finally going to bed I discovered something incredibly annoying.I got this speaker for the sole purpose of linking it to my phone for alarms so they're extra loud but I need music to fall asleep too so what I do is edit songs to have a low volume in order for the song to be quitly playing but still keep the volume 100% for alarms.But as it turns out this speaker has this rediculous feature about cutting out audio when it's too quiet. Like I'd hear the humming from the song with the instrument but then when the humming stops the audio completely cuts out including the instrument. Seriously... why? How is that even a feature? It's rediculous.Still as I said before I found the whole purpose of buying it doesn't work I was really happy so if that doesn't sound like an issue to you you'll probably love it.
5,When this came in I was really excited to see and what kind of quality it has! When I opened up the box it was really really beautiful the boxing with the charger Aux cord and a waterproof bag for me! I knew after that it was gonna be great after that!!! It literally took about 2 seconds to connect to my iPhone via Bluetooth! And I'm into EDM music so of course I played some first and wow!! Just for this little speaker to have that exact bass for EDM is amazing!! I'm so glad I chose this speaker over any other!! It's not heavy at all in my opinion and portable great for beaches or for a small get together party!!! I'd say if you're having to choose between a speaker or this speaker(dcss) I would suggest you get this Product!!
5,So nice to have music play sweet lullabies from my phone as my grandchildren drift to sleep. Easy to set up. Good sound. Good purchase.
4,The sound quality is quite good the speaker fits well in many different places but the bluetooth connectivity does not work with my iPad. Still an excellent value.
5,With the help of customer service I was able to replace my original speaker with a new one and am pleasantly surprised. I thought this speaker was worth the money  but the first one used to break up intermittently which was annoying and the reason for my review below. I have it hooked up to my Dot and it is everything I expected from this speaker great sound for the price. I used the the beat driven song"Soldier of Love" by Sade to check the Bass which is more than adequate. I'm very happy with my choice now!Thanks to Wonder Techs.I'm really disappointed in this speaker such a great sound for the price if it would only play without breaking up every few seconds whether Bluetooth or Direct connection. Wish it also had directions of Mode colors? Insane!
4,Great little speaker for the price clear sound and plenty loud for personal use or even in a classroom where the kids are quiet and you are using it for background music to a skit or library show. Love the color and the touch controls. It hooked up to my galaxy S3 easily.Just wish it would play audio from my Amazon Echo. If it could do that I would have given it 5 stars. You can't go wrong for the price the quality is great feels very sturdy and it is a pretty blue if you chose the blue. Its a fun little speaker and I am creating a new playlist to use when I am sitting outside or gardening.
3,definitely alot of sound from this small box but it doesn't seem to have any soul? Its just kind of tinny like the sound doesn't move me but it is loud and the charge lasts a long time.
4,The compact size is great. The volume was sufficient for what I'm using it. The Bluetooth connectivity was easy and worked great. My only issue is that it turns off when not in use. Which for some is a great thing. But I use it with PowerPoint presentations - most of the slides have no audio so I had to turn it back on for slides with audio. Other than that I'm VERY pleased with it.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I've had several bluetooth speakers for my desk area .... this speaker.  THIS SPEAKERS blows all of them away.  The bass.  The professional clean crisp sound is *chef's kiss* .... So glad I purchased this one.
5,El volumen excelente la calidad del sonido podría mejorar la batería excelente podría tener puerto USB
4,I use this speaker for streaming music and for my dad to use on phone calls as he is VEEY hard of hearing.
4,The sound is very good. The only down side is that I could not get two speakers to work in Bluetooth. I gave up an went back to hard wire them. It was a little more difficult  and ran me about 30 more dollars but it works
5,I love this speaker. It is compact but has great sound.  I love that it has a volume control on it! It's so hard to find a small bluetooth speaker that can be controlled on the speaker instead of just from the phone or computer those are never loud enough. The sound packs a punch and is very clear. Very pleased with this product.
3,I bought this product for my girlfriend since she needed a new bluetooth speaker. I was excited when I saw the many positive reviews and the sleek design. I gave it to her in a park unboxed it so far so good. We connected it to her iPhone 7 plus--great sound quality for the price. 10 minutes in the speaker starts sounding distorted and it started cutting off. I am so embarrassed getting her a gift that right out the box starts MALFUNCTIONING. The battery started dying 10 more minutes after that. However I will give the battery life the benefit of the doubt since it just came right out the box. I cant even return this for a replacement or a refund because I broke both my feet in a motorcycle accident and it's hard just to ship it back to the UPS store. Very disappointed and unhappy customer.
5,We got this because it has the port for 3.5mm cord.  Very few of the speakers in the category have this feature.  That way we can use an older player and still connect from our iPhones to play music.  We used it extensively on a recent vacation and loved it.  Great sound long battery life and sturdy.
5,For the price paid and size of the box it sounds great!  I love the color options too.  I compared side by side to my Oontz 3 Plus and it's louder with crisper highs.  Not as much bass or "oomph" sadly but more clarity.  If I really want bass I'll use a real speaker system.  It sounds great and powerful even at low volume and it's always nice and handy to have a lightweight portable speaker around for parties or simple listening pleasure.  Comes with a very nice sleek carrying/storage case charging cable and aux cable.  Well done!On a side note: I have no personal experience with them but from reading the responses to customer questions by their support team the company seems really top notch.
5,I am very impressed with out rich the bass and treble are. I have played this at full volume and it does not sound distorted or crackling at all. It charges within 2-3 hours (which is recommended once you receive it per the instructions) and pairs very easily to your smartphone.Definitely would recommend getting.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Love love love my speaker! Great sound bass-can hear it from any room. Plus I can answer calls! Totally work the buy and they have different colors.
4,Sounds distorts a bit I don't know if this is from the bluetooth connection or the shows I'm watching. I don't think you could listen to this very loud without the sound distorting.
4,I’m not going to give it 5 stars bc the sound have a bad quality the battery life does not last long and sometimes have problem with the Bluetooth connectivity. At the end of the day it ended up damaging since it had no more sound. Don’t know what happened.
5,Love it best Bluetooth speaker I have (and great price on lightning deal).  Listening to radio TV and streaming on an outdoor patio: sound quality and volume are awesome Bluetooth connection to indoor Yamaha TSR-7850 receiver is solid at well over 10 meters.  Expect a little lag between source and speaker but for my use that's not a factor.
4,I enjoy listening to audio books at night. The sound quality is good it could be a little more clearer. I do like the feature of the auto shut off so it turns off at night. I also really like the size and color. Overall a good product for the price.
5,Good sound quality. Easy to connect. Battery drains quickly
5,If you’re looking for very good Bluetooth speaker that one is for you don’t even think about jbl or bosse etc... omg that speaker sound some like those from the top of shelf!!!! I’m writing this review after 3 months of use I’m really super excited how everything works battery life long distance connections deep bass clear sound... excellent item. All my friends from work ordered after my purchase plus I bought additional one for my father.
5,Very pleasing blue color with simple straight forward controls.The sound quality was a pleasant suprise! It is amazing. That from the stand point of a former audiophile. The bass is wow for the size. It wont shake your body obviously but does a good job.  The treble is clear and pleasant. Remember if using with youtube the sound is dependant on the quaulity of what was upload. There is a vast number of poor quality youtube uploads which will obviously not sound pleasing. Just pick a a better upload. I made adjustments on my phone to my sound tastes.Wish there was a visual of how much battery life is left but that would increade the cost. I am very satisfied
5,Powerful sound in a small package!!! Love it!!!
5,A friend has this speaker and it sounded pretty darn good along with his TV. So I thought I would try it with my Fire 8 Plus and with my Cell phone to listen to music while heading off to sleep. Playing ocean sounds to stay asleep. And you know its a really good speaker. Yes I recommend it for anyone wanting a Bluetooth speaker to have at home
4,This handy speaker connects quickly to Bluetooth. And the sound is wonderful. But it makes loud "twiddle diddle dee" tune when connecting to a device. This annoys me.
5,Love the portability of this Doss speaker box as I can use on my deck with my iPhone or connect to my MacBooks!
5,I've owned this for about a year. At quiet volumes I wasn't thrilled with the sound but it's great at medium and loud volumes. It can be loud enough to annoy neighbors or flatmates- not that you'd want to just trying to think of a way to describe the volume level it can produce. I can't quantify much but I've never had a problem with the battery life. I use it to play music when I exercise or to play music for little kids. Haven't bought other speakers in this price range or above haven't needed to. Perfect to fill a small apartment with music.Only inconvenience is when my son easily accesses the touch controls but that's to be expected with a little one.
5,Amazing sound for such a little speaker at such a low price. It's not high-end audio but it would be really hard to beat without spending a lot more. I use it with my Chromebook laptop all the time and listen to a lot of music of all types. Very satisfied.
3,I have had my speaker almost exactly a year and I loved the sound. I'm not sure if it got wet or something but it's very low sound lower than a cell phone now. We rarely used it maybe 20 times total. I bought it for my kids' birthday party last year.
5,This was a gift and I looovvveee how it sounds. I wish it was mine. I think I may buy for myself.
5,I'm very pleased with this little speaker.. Read a ton of reviews on it and decided it was cheap enough to take a chance with it. I absolutely love music and having the right sound is make or break for me. I thought well I'll get this one until I can afford REAL speakers..Surprisingly I'm hearing sounds come out of this thing that I didn't know were in songs in comparison to my headphones.It's even a bit louder than I expected. The BASS is there... somehow? I mean it's more BASS than something so small should be able to deliver. It's not comparable to having a sub but it's surprisingly good for what it is.my friends bluetooth speakers always left me unimpressed so I've avoided getting one but I went for it and I'm glad I did.
5,Been looking for a speaker and this is it!!! Great sound. Can hear throughout apartment. Plan to use in my car without bluetooth for hands free talk and good volume.
3,This speaker worked well for a while. Recently the sound started skipping when paired with audible. I didn’t experience skipping when simply using the speaker on my phone or my headphones. Also within the last couple of weeks the speaker has started turning itself on multiple times per day and it will not remain off. The manual says to press the reset button but that does nothing. It’s annoying for everyone in my home and if it worked better with audible I could probably overlook the fact that it keeps turning on. But I’m not happy with it’s performance and I’ve had it only 10 months.
5,Even better than the Bose speaker that we have!
5,For the price I absolutely love the speakers easy connectivity fits just about anywhere and has Good sound quality. Above all the customer service of Doss is awesome my speaker had some issues and it was outside Amazon window of service. Doss customer service step and provide me with a new device at no cost. They service their products for 1 year after purchase price with adds some security behind your purchase no matter how big or small that is.
5,I did a lot of research on good lower price speakers before deciding to purchase this one. I read some reviews saying it died to quick or the buttons were too small but so far I have had no problems with this speaker. I've had it for about a month and a half and don't have any complaints as of yet. Being a college student I use this speaker all the time in my dorm as a way to amplify my music past the volume cap of the iPhone. I have only charged it once the first day I got it and haven't plugged it up since. I've used it for a total of about 4-5 hours and it hasn't died or lost its charge yet. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a small high-quality sound speaker for a low cost!
5,i like the sound the volume and the capacitive touch controls
5,Whoa! It's been about 12 hours and I'm contemplating purchasing a second one!I purchase this speaker for my classroom hoping something with decent sound quality without a huge price tag. I'm VERY impressed with the sound that comes out of this little machine.I've listened to a variety of music - rock alternative metal and the Trolls Soundtrack (because I have two small kiddos). The bass is amazing and the sound quality is better than my iPhone 7plus (and that's pretty good).The set up was simple - charge until the light turns green pair with your device enjoy! The buttons are very responsive - very remeniacent of a touch screen. The box it comes in is very sturdy & great for storage and transportation. It also comes with a little satin bag for storage.Overall is highly recommend this product!
4,I like my Doss speaker. I purchased it for louder music from my iPad but the sound is more muffled and not as clear as it is from my Ipad.
5,Great sound in a small package.  The weight of it feels good.  Easy to start up.  My wife appreciates the start and connect chimes.  The auto-off feature works great for our needs.  The sound is quite excellent for the price.  We have a Bose Wave Radio at home for comparison.  The Bose has better bass and slightly better mid and high but for the money the DOSS handles the mid and high so well it sounds like it should cost a lot more.  And where it lacks in bass volume it makes up for it in very good bass tone quality.  Be sure to listen for a while before you say "I like" or "I don't like".  Great to see lesser known brands like DOSS putting out great products.
5,This is a perfectly portable Bluetooth speaker. It is very loud for its size. Loud enough to entertain a small party or fill up a mid size room.It looks really good the touch buttons are a nice touch and round touch for the volume is really cool and works perfectly. The sound quality is good enough for a speaker of this price. It does have some base. I use it on my desk and get a nice bass effect from it.The battery is good. Have been using it on a single charge for 3-4 days with around 2 hrs each day. So it easily gives atleast 8hrs of play time if not more. I just wish if there was a way to know how much charge is left. That is the only down side for me.
4,I was saving to buy a Bose speaker. Saw this wee speaker from Doss on deal of the day. Though what the heck...for $20 I’ll give it a try. While it’s not a Bose it’s pretty darn good for the price of lunch. Connects easily great battery life cute and has some fierce base and good treble. May still get a Bose at some point but for little money I’m very happy with it.
5,Excellent Bluetooth speaker with very balanced frequency response. When listening to high-resolution source such as 320 kbps MP3s WAV or FLAC music files the bass is present but not overbearing mids are clear and proportionate highs are crisp and sparkling.This speaker sounds as if it should easily cost twice as much if not more. Small very portable has very good and even frequency reproduction at low volumes powerful volume - fills a large room with rocking loud party volumes and does not distort. Lasts between 10 - 12 hours on a charge.Speaker arrived promptly and in pristine condition. Wonders Tech followed up quickly with confirmation notice and quality satisfaction inquiry. VERY assertive and attentive customer service! Excellent service and support. Would be happy to buy from this seller and company again in the future.
2,Bought this for my new apt. At first it was nice and worked great. Sound was alright. Then i started taking it with me in the bathroom meanwhile i showered and i noticed it started switch songs pausing all by itself. So i stopped using it there wiped it but it still kept happening. Then i dropped once it from my bed which isnt rlly a big drop from the floor but alas it fell and the charging port got logded inside. Like it fell off but it fell inside the speaker. Lasted me like 5 months.
5,What a wonderful speaker! First off the packaging it comes with is very nice and it comes with a micro USB charging cable an AUX cord and a waterproof protective sleeve for the speaker! As for the sound quality beyond superb. The built-in sub-woofer gives amazing bass for how much and how big the speaker is. The battery life is very long and it doesn't take too long to charge. Another thing I really like about this speaker is the fact that the volume control is touch-controlled rather than just buttons. Overall amazing bluetooth speaker for the price and if anyone is reading this right now BUY IT!!!
5,It is perfect ! It’s the first one I have ever had so I don’t have anything to compare it to but I love it !The sound is great the set up was easy  super easy and I haven’t had to recharge the battery yet from the first time That was in the beginning of September .
4,I use this when I want to listen to music off my phone and be able to hear it from room to room. It's rechargeable so no need for batteries.
4,Very good speaker. Came in on time and was easy to figure out. It has clear sound but the only thing I wish could change is the bass. I'm not a technology person but I have an iPhone and I feel like they're about the same. the speaker is just louder. I was looking for an inexpensive speaker that I could use around the house and this works just fine. I only bought it because there was a video posted about it and it sounded great. also the lights are pretty cool. The buttons do seem a little close to each other though. I try turning it up and I end up skipping or pausing a song.
5,Excellent!
4,The only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is because it's unable to charge 13 months after purchasing it one month after the warranty expired. The little connector piece inside the charging port broke off. I was always careful when plugging it in so I don't think it was a user issue. Other than that it's a great speaker especially for the price. Great sound and great battery life even after a year of use. Never had any issues with it other than what just happened. I'll probably purchase another one I just hope that it doesn't have to be a once a year type thing.
5,I love this portable speaker!!  Perfect for my needs.  Worked flawlessly for about a year.  Developed some problems with the unit.  Wrote to customer service at Doss.  They were super responsive awesomely courteous and genuinely cared about me as a customer.  Faulty unit was replaced within a couple of days.  Back in business.  I would not hesitate at all to purchase additional items from this manufacturer and I highly recommend this speaker in particular!
5,Excellent sound quality for the size. Not room filling sound but it does sound full and not tinny or distant. I like this one speaker better than than 2 paired oontz angle 3 speakers. The sound is roughly equivalent to an echo show 5.
3,I got this to play music while we sit around the fire pit. The Bluetooth doesn’t connect as well as I would like at a distance. The battery life is great. And the sound is ok but I have had better sounding Bluetooth stereos. But for the price it’s honestly a good product. My son uses it a lot to play music while he is in his bedroom. If you are looking for something super high quality this may not be it but it’s durable and a good price for what you get. I would repurchase this.
5,Outstanding
4,It sounds great but the buttons mystify me.  Everything was great until today when it started playing a busy signal every thirty seconds.  I started trying to fool with it but now it just turns itself off like it is annoyed with me.  I am sure a younger person would immediately understand how to use it but I bought it for my 85 year old mother and she gave it back to me in frustration.  I thought I was good but I really need to know how to just get it to play without the busy signal.  I don't need it to answer the phone just play the music!
5,I bought this during Prime Days and it was very affordable sounds terrific! I use it in my walk in shower because of it's water resistance and take it to the pool also. Great buy!
5,I read reviews and ordered this small speaker to have outdoors or take in the bathroom. It’s small enough to easily move but yet packs a punch like a bigger speaker. I have ordered so many Bluetooth speakers and normally I look at them as a throwaway after a few months but this one seems to be built better. It definitely sounds better than others that I have tried. Great speaker at a good price point. No Bose of course but still nice.
4,I would love to give this 5 stars but I have only had it a month and it has started glitching the songs skip every 10-20 secondz. I have tried several different devices to connect to have singled it out that watching the touch buttons on their own nothing around them and they light like someone had touched the skip button and goes to the next song and sometimes the play/pause and I have seen the mode button flicker like it was touched as well. It’s quite frustrating and kills the mode when your jamming out with friends. Dodd please fix this glitch!
3,Ok ....but sound quality needs improvement.....
4,Sound quality is good.  Used for a outdoor family event.
5,Just received this this morning and I knew by the weight when I picked up the box it was more than I expected. I’ve used it all day with Amazon Music on my iPhone and I am major pleased!!  The sound is much better than other speakers I’ve tried or owned. The controls are outstanding and the thing pairs in a flash. I’m very pleased. Not too many items just inexpensive are this quality. I like being able to play from a TF card or with the AUX in. And I know this is a little thing but the charging cord is longer than many which I really appreciate. Shipping was as promised and I’m just all around pleased. Check it out.
5,I needed a Bluetooth speaker to connect to my phone for music & my tablet when my son watches a movie on the tablet since we live with my sis in law & their kids so our house is kinda loud.This speaker is almost as loud as my sister in laws Bluetooth speaker which is a little over double the size of this one!The sound is clear & great! Very loud for such a small speaker
5,Got this as a gift this year for Christmas and I’m kind of bummed that I didn’t get one for myself. Sound quality is quite nice for how compact it is but it isn’t small/tiny. Easy to connect and hopefully the battery life holds up to its expectation. SD slot is a cool feature.
5,This was the best $27 I have spent in a long while. The battery lasts a long time and it improves the sound from my laptop and phone exponentially. I wish the volume control was a little more precise but that's a small issue. I use it all day every day; I honestly don't know how I survived so long without it and don't plan to ever again lol
5,I've only charged my speaker like 3 times and I've had it for like 5 months!! I use it so often!! I love this!!
5,If you are looking for a good speaker that doesn't cost you $50+ I'd recommend this one. I love this speaker I recently broke mine due to dropping it 1 too many times 😂 but I had it for about 2 or more years and if it wasn't for me dropping it it would have lasted so much longer. I just ordered another one  The battery life is amazing on it and it gets pretty loud with good sound quality.
4,So far this unit seems to be of good quality and sounds great. I installed a MicroSD card for backup to my mp3 player and discovered a problem. There are no instructions for installing the TF card but the picture of the unit on the Amazon page shows the TF card with the printing up. I tried several times to install and it did not seat properly. Just for fun I turned the card upside down and it inserted properly! Not sure if my unit has the socket upside down or that's the normal orientation. It does play properly so just a heads up in case yours is the same.
5,Good volume and sound quality.  I use it for music like most people but I also use it with an App called Speech Assistant which translates text into speech but the I-Phone volume is insufficient when communicating with others.  I have a neurological speech issue and sometimes people can't understand my slurred speech so this unit combined with the aforementioned app helps me to have people understand what I am saying whether in person or on the phone. With the App it also works with Amazon's "Alexa" as even that equipment often "does not get" what I am saying.
4,This is a great speaker!  I was able to turn it all the way up and it actually be loud enough for me to hear it in my back room from the living room.  I wish it had a little more bass but other than that its great!
4,it should be water proof.  The sound is good and portable to enjoy music at any time anywhere
5,Great battery life compact very good sound for a nice price.
5,The speaker is bigger than what i expected but the sound is great. You can adjust the volume on your phone and on the speaker itself. I had my volume on low on my phone and yet it still played loud through the speaker. If I could I’d give this product 10 stars
5,I love this speaker I got one because my brother bought one and it sill works amazing even after 5 years.
5,It was one of my favorite Amazon finds for my classroom!
5,Sounds is great! Solid speaker not flimsy. I like the buttons they light up and you can advance to the next song or go to a previous doing answer the phone pause play and toggle from bluetooth aux-in or TF card. I'm happy with this purchase! My old one not as nice as this one.
5,I couldn't have asked for anything better for the price range. I like EDM and hip hop and I don't miss the very seldom bass notes that I don't hear with this speaker. It's best used in a situation where you are stationary such as an office job but still gets plenty loud at 10'. You can literally feel it through the table even at moderate volume. If you want something more expensive the next comparable model to look at is the Sony XB2 which is about 60$ more. You will get a little extra bass probably a little more volume but not worth it in my opinion unless you are moving at distances around the 10' mark all the time. The lights on top are not bright enough to be bothersome either. And I work in a dark room.
3,Sound is decent for a cheap speaker. It gets some background fuzziness at higher volumes. It feels a little cheap. It says “waterproof” which is misleading. It has open ports and after further reading it’s only “waterproof” to small splashes and spray. Also the packaging says nothing about it being waterproof.
5,I wanted a wireless speaker but didn't want to spend a bunch of money for it This is a great sound speaker and it gets very loud. Make sure that you turn up you phone volume and you'd swear that you're in the club. I like the fact that when it's dying it makes a busy signal letting you know you have to charge soon.
4,You can toss out the cable that comes with the speaker.  It is junk and does not work well at all.  I thought the speaker was bad until I tried my phone on it.  Worked great!  Super good sound and volume control.  Then I tried a different cord for my IPod.  Excellent sound!  The cord that came with the speaker was pure crap!  Might as well just keep it out of the box.
4,Sounds great but not loud enough!!!
5,What an amazing device! I am a product of the 60's and 70's stereo sets in my room with the great big woofers and tweeters and the big clunky headsets. I have always felt that modern technology does not compare well to the old technology with regard to the sound quality of music. That is until I paired my new Kindle 10" to the DOSS portable speakers! I had no trouble at all pairing the two devices (in spite of the fact that I am not well-experienced with all the new wireless technology). The sound quality is fantastic the battery life is exceptional the speakers are compact and easily move from room to room with me. I can now "fill the room" with my favorite music just like during my college days!
2,Be careful how you grab this speaker! You may inadvertently turn it off if your finger touches the on/off button on the side or change tracks or volume if you hit a 'touch' control on the top of the speaker.I purchased the speaker to listen via blue tooth to radio or audio books. It works and sounds decent BUT (!) :  -It is not only heavy for a small speaker but must be handled awkwardly due to poorly conceived controls on the side as well as the top of the speaker.  -It is BRIGHT! If you want to listen to an audio book while falling asleep you will have to find a way to cover the intense blue light emitted by the volume and tracking controls on the top of the unit. (literally lights up the room)I did not return the speaker because it works but there are much better options on Amazon.My favorite is the Oontz Angle 3 ultra. The shape and weight is easy to grab without hitting any controls and you can pair two together allowing one to go from room to room still listening without interruption.Bottom line pass on this speaker.
5,I like the color and size
5,i love that its durable sort of. i dropped it but it still sounds great
5,pairs in seconds sound is very good changing playing to next works great no distortion  awful volume(rare find) would recommend this for listening outside  asm well .. very well made rate it a 10
5,I've used this several times and only had to charge it once. Sound quality is very good with no issues connecting.
4,I generally use my speakers while showering and cooking among other things. But  I love it. It's clear connected easily and the volume is fabulous. Awesome but for mysrkf at $10 off!
4,For the price (on sale for $20) this was a great buy. If you want quality sound you will have to spend a bit more. This is great for a small bathroom speaker.
3,Great looking speaker and what I thought was my next replacement for my new daily use. Unfortunately something kept happening where it would make a sound like a busy signal interference into the music I was streaming. Weird right? Maybe just a fluke.I tried it and it happened again. And again.In addition I like my music loud and to me this speaker couldn’t handle the louder music like my Oontz angle does. I had to return it. Still kind of looking.
5,This one is an exception.  I am using this as a speaker and microphone for my video conferences on my MacBook air as the inbuilt microphone has some connectivity issue.  This has been a great addition.  The sound quality is an exception and the microphone is flawless even at low bandwidths.
5,I bought this because i didn’t want to hook up a owned speaker system in my house. Since my home is a wireless haven now didn’t make sense to spend time and energy wiring anything. I bought this and out of the box came a remarkable sound. The portability makes going from room to room perfect.
4,I'm only taking off one start because of this silly/inconvenient feature: it starts to emit an intermittent beep sound each time its low on charge instead of for example blinking red.Otherwise it would be perfect. Sound quality is good it has decent range pairs SMOOTHLY with nearly all devices looks sharp.... hard to think what else one would ask for from Bluetooth speakers.
4,The only thing I don’t like about this box is that you cannot control the volume from it. Only from your phone or whatever it’s connected to.It gets really loud and the sound quality is great! I bought it for my kitchen so I can dance to music and cook.
5,Great battery life and awesome sound! I have an 1800 sq ft warehouse sis e and the sound this speaker puts out is amazing!
5,The voice used for this speaker's prompts sounds just like George Takei which is awesome. It also has great sound quality and good battery life. I've had mine for years and it still works well.
5,WHAT THE HECK!?! The thing vibrates because the bass is so good for the small size! I guess the reason for the weight is to keep it on the ground while you blast the bass(works best at 45-50 Hz). The sound is so crisp and so clear as well! The small size is great for portable use. And the battery. The battery. I've played it several times per day for long periods and the battery just doesn't seem to end. The 12-14 hour battery life is incredible for the four-hour charge. Touch-screen is a nice touch(get it?). The aux cord in-line is really neat since my phone won't last as long as this speaker does on Bluetooth. Love love love this speaker.would highly recommend!
4,Look & feel nice. Easy paring. However not a good sounding speaker. Lacks bass thin midrange. Highs are not too bright though. Good choice for its price.
5,Really like the sound and it has not lost charge anytime for me in 2 years. Liked it so much I sent another as a gift and they thoroughly enjoy it too. I’ve never turned it to full volume but can I easily hear it in the shower when it’s out on the counter.
4,I tried this product out after reading all the reviews. I never got to see what the battery life was. I took it out of the box charged it and tried it out. I couldn’t hear any bass. I love to hear the bass but I don’t like turning the volume up too loud. I immediately put it back in the box returned it and purchased an Anker Soundcore 20w. Love it!
5,I have purchased three of these speakers over the last month and a half. Each is connected via Bluetooth to an Echo dot. Pairing was simple. Simply set up the Echo Dot power on the DOSS by holding the Power On button for 5 seconds until it states that Bluetooth is enabled and then find the DOSS in the Bluetooth setting for the Dot and "pair it".  Sound is fine for an inexpensive speaker. My only complaint is that the DOSS has lights on the top and they are bright in a darkened room.  Thus if you plan to put in a bedroom please know that you have also purchased a night light when you have this. My solution was cutting a small square of white cardboard and placing it on top of the speaker.  Worth the money. Easy set up.
5,I didn’t really have any expectations - as long as it connected to Bluetooth and I didn’t pay a fortune I would’ve been happy. But I’ve been very pleased! I think it has nice sound quality and it actually connected to an old iPod that still have...impressive!
5,Took a chance on a crappy 25$ speaker for my work truck. Holy hell was I wrong. My last one was over 100$ and was half as good is this one. Turned it on and scared the cats ! Super easy to pair easy to use without really looking at it and for some reason turning it up and down is so satisfying by making circles around the light. I'm in love with this thing !!! Such a great buy !!!!
4,Great speakers and a very nice design for a speaker in this price category but the sound it makes when you connect via Bluetooth is killing me.Every time you connect it makes a horrible ringing sound at max volume that just takes the classiness right out of the speaker. DOSS please find a better and more subtle sound bite for the Bluetooth pairing.
5,For the price it's pretty good quality.  I've been listening to it off and on for four days now and haven't had to recharge it yet after the initial charge i did when it first arrived.  Bass is decent treble is good.  It suits my needs.
4,Cool speaker with a great battery life! Quality and Audio is amazing. I love thisUpdate:I'm not sure what went wrong but this is not working anymore. The speaker get on automatically.  I can never switch off. Finally had to drain the battery to turn it off. I liked the product and very good sound quality inspite of the issue its not gonna work anymore.
2,this speaker don't receives good signal my phone have to be very close to the speaker to play good even if it is about 2 feet apart if something cross between them the music interrupts. I just keep it because is not too bad the sound and the battery life is long and because the price is not too bad. If I need another speaker I'll find a different one than this.
4,It's not the worst one or maybe I was expecting too much. I don't think it's bad nor it is best either. For $25 it sounds like it's $16-20. I used to have a speaker of same price but that sound much crispier and sharp. This one is more dull and there is no crisp or sharpness to it. But yeah is ok 👍
5,Nice device it is what the advertising says. Pretty well manufactured even though it is made in China but they took care about design and details. The sound quality is excellent for a 12 watts device. The bass response is pretty decent however if you are that kind of "DJ wanna be" music fan the bass won't be enough. I personally hate nowadays audio devices because they abuse with bass response. This device is by far the best portable audio system I've ever had and it completely fulfilled my expectations and even more. For business it is pretty useful if you need a portable easy to use audio system in a training or meeting room. From my personal opinion this DOSS device competes with JBL Sony and BOSS similar products.
4,This speaker worked fine for 8 months then abruptly stopped accepting a charge.  It no longer recognizes that a charging cable is attached so the battery cannot be charged and it will not operate even when plugged in to an outlet.  I tried multiple cords and chargers with the same results.  The speaker is now as useful as a paperweight.UPDATE: 01/2017  I had a very good customer service encounter...after inquiring about replacing the speaker DOSS customer service sent me a replacement for free.  I had the new speaker in two days and it works.  Hopefully it will continue to work.  Kudos to DOSS customer service.
4,It’s a good speaker. I have been using it for a little while now and in the end it is a low price speaker and that is how it performs. For the price it is great but there are definitely better speakers out there in terms of sound. The look is nice though and it is very portable.
4,Have this linked to my Echo dot in the kitchen via Bluetooth. Makes the Alexa voice louder and is very crisp and clear. Pairing to the Dot took a few minutes but did work first time. I keep it plugged into power all the time since it's in the kitchen.The lights remain on on the device which is mildly annoying. If there is a power cut the speaker does not power back on automatically despite being plugged in. It re-pairs with the Echo Dot automatically once you switch it back on. Wish I could configure it to power on automatically once power returns after an outage.
5,EDIT 2021:I've now had this speaker for over 5 years and it still works great! I highly recommend this speaker great longevity!***I've had this speaker for about three months now so I can safely said it has held up well.Good sound quality works as a nice speaker for my desktop and as a portable speaker for my phone.The battery life is excellent I only have to charge it every couple weeks. (However when it does need charging it starts randomly beeping while playing music and it confuses me for a good five minutes before I realize what the sound means.)The controls are not hard to use at all and I rather like the sleek design of them.Overall I do recommend!
4,I was totally surprised with the amazing sound that came out of this DOSS soundbox clean clear vocals and good bass. The bluetooth connection is easy and fast the touch controls on top respond good battery life for me has been about 10hrs i would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to buy a affordable portable wireless bluetooth speaker.
5,I chose this DOSS Soundbox speaker over other best sellers based on an article that reviews 10 best portable speakers.The speaker looks slick and well made.  The sound is superb considering it's size and price.  I find the sound clear even on high volume.  I listen mostly to progressive rock classic rock and modern jazz.  And I am thinking of expanding my music library to include more instrumentals just because of this lovely little speaker.  David Sanborn's Sax sounds really very nice on the speaker.I am very happy with this purchase.  The only thing I can think of any improvement is the on/off button.  It is kind of tricky to work the button as it sits flush.  Other than that pairing is super easy.Thank you DOSS Soundbox!
4,It seems well built and seamlessly  pairs to devices. Has enough volume for most uses. I di not like that is shuts of while using it for phone calls.
5,Wish battery would last a bit longer but other that that can play music full volume with no problemsAudio is still crispy clear I can leave the speaker in the kitchen and leave my phone charging in my room with no problem I can skip songs using the speaker lower or raise the volume using the volume feature on the speaker I really recommend it for any one that loves to listen to music at home it’s pretty loud for the size I love it
4,For the price it isn't bad at all. It definitely doesn't have the range that one of my other speakers has (Altec Lansing) . Farthest I can go is about 15 feet. However it does good it's nearly a 3rd of the price if not less and does fine. I honestly think I would have returned it if I hadn't dropped it. It scratched it pretty bad and it kept right on working (4 foot fall). So I honestly can't complain. The bass isn't as strong as I thought it would be but I think my expectations were just a little too high.
4,I like the radio but when I bought recently within a month it was 27.99 so price went Up $7.00 now it doesn’t sound too cool.
3,I seem to have a minor issue with Bluetooth connectivity.  I'm not sure if it's user error or the speaker.  I like the sound quality and the battery life had been good.
5,Have had this for several years. Great value for the money. Great sound. Can easily fill a good sized room. Have had it on construction sites and could still hear music over power tools. Charge lasts and the speaker itself is durable. You get great range from the Bluetooth. The touch interface works well.  Ended up buying several more for my house.
3,This is a good product not a great product.  For the money however it's well worth it.  No comparison to the sound of the Bose unit but then it's a fraction of the cost.  Battery life is excellent.  Operation and bluetooth pairing are very good.  I'm certainly not disappointed in  with my purchase but not thrilled either.  I'll probably take this one to leave at work and invest in the Bose for home.Update June 9 - I continue to be please (but not thrilled) with this speaker.  True to my word I took it to work and it's great for that environment - good (not great) sound at an affordable price.  That's one big plus; I just leave it in my desk drawer at night and if somebody gets stick fingers I'm not out much $.  Reliable easy to set up and use affordable price and decent sound at a low to mid volume.  A good addition to my office and I don't regret my purchase.  But if I read any more reviews saying it sounds as good as a Bose speaker I may scream.
3,I bought this because the sound on my Echo Dot can be a bit muffled. And it worked great...for 15 minutes.  Turns out that if not in constant use it turns itself off after 15 minutes to save the battery.  So I plugged it directly in to my Dot and the same thing happened.  And then you have to reconnect it via Bluetooth every time they don't automatically find each other (even when connected via the cord).So I'm returning it because what's the point of having a speaker that you have walk over and manually turn on and instruct to reconnect every time you want to use your Echo?But the sound was good and if you're looking for a wireless speaker to not use in conjunction with Echo I'm sure it would be great.
4,For the price this is a good little speaker. I did have issues with trying to pair with it.
3,I have some really noisy neighbors (toddlers) and I wanted to be able to beef up the sound from my computer so I'm not stuck wearing headphones during endless hours of classes via Zoom.Unfortunately this speaker does not want to connect with my Windows 10 machine AT ALL - it sees it it pairs with it but it won't connect and play sound through it.Very frustrating. I've been fiddling with this off and on for a couple of hours and can't seem to make it work - i'm really tech-savvy so this is ridiculous.
1,The sound on the speaker is okay although there are occasional random static pops that happen out of the blue but the biggest issue is the absolutely horrible Bluetooth connectivity.While watching videos on Youtube the speaker will occasionally disconnect in the middle of a video it's not to frequent and I would deal with that if it weren't for the other huge connection issues. About 20-30% of the times you pause a video click to start a new video or just go to a Youtube screen such as your subscriptions or recommended the speaker will disconnect for 10-30 seconds with an annoying beep then reconnect with an even more annoying scale of chimes.I could live with it if it was once or twice a day but it's literally at least once or twice an hour but that's when you are watching 30ish minute videos the shorter the videos you watch the more frequently you will have to deal with this major annoyance. Hell fairly regularly it will even disconnect when Youtube plays an ad or returns to the video from an ad.Basically it's unusable and even a saint would be ready to throw it against the wall within a day or two.I planned on return it but unfortunately my wife got ride of the box right after I had opened it thinking it was from and old speaker I was replacingSave your money and don't even consider this speaker even if the price is lowered it would never be worth it as using it is just an exercise in frustration.
5,This sounds like a 60-dollar speaker. The best sound quality you can get without a moving sub like the JBL charge or flip which will both put you over a hundred dollars. Dare I say this could maybe compete with those; the bass truly radiates. This is an initial review so I can’t say much about battery life. The touch buttons are really nice and have none of the downsides you might expect. Moderate weight. Packaged nicely. Wait time for support over the phone was 2 minutes. A lot of people talk about BATTERY SAVER MODE which support told me CAN BE DISABLED  by holding the power button for 30 seconds. .
5,At first I was unsure of buying this product but when I received I charged it for a lil because I wanted to see if it was worth the price .... this speaker has GREAT sound quality GREAT BATTERY LIFE . Literally haven’t charged for days now and I e been using it at least 4/5 hours a day . & still hasn’t died on me !! I’m completely shooked !!!!!
5,this is a well built speaker at a fraction of the cost normal for well built items. it can also connect to 2 devices. however when the battery is weak it makes a very irritating loud beeping sound on a snooze cycle so when u least expect it in a song u hear a beep also it skips to the next song when its weak or maybe the settings.  i dont know much about the settings on this speaker i just connect it to my phone or my mac air and play the volume is touch in a circular manner. its a good speaker you wont regret buying it.
4,This speaker has great sound quality we haven't had any problems with it for almost 2 years. Now it seems like the power button is sticking or something it chimes to pare with devices all night and all day kind of annoying. How do I fix this problem? Or is it junk now?
4,out of the box this is a good speaker. My only issue is that it doesnt have a shuffle feature. With a little research I was able to find a firmware update that will put the speaker in shuffle mode when micro sd card is inserted.  once it is in shuffle mode I think that is permanent.
4,Update... They resolved the problem quickly and all is good in the world. Product works and sounds great! I ordered this for a Christmas present for my daughter and I ordered it fairly early  but I didn't give it to her until Christmas. She opened the box and followed the instructions and the product did not work.  We checked it several times and it still won't work.  I wanted to return it but it says this item is nonreturnable.  So  now I'm stuck with a broken speaker and no way to return it.. Bad business!!!  I am a very unhappy customer right now.
2,Broken after only a few months. :(I loved this speaker so much. I never had any issues it worked great sounded great the only issue I had really was that it would turn off if nothing was coming through the speaker even when it was plugged in (I feel like if it's plugged in it should stay on forever..but anyway no big deal).My main issue is I ordered this in March and here it is in September and it is now malfunctioning. It's turning on and off constantly and there's no way to leave it on or off because it's doing this on it's own. So it is essentially broken and now I have to find a new speaker :(  I used this speaker for my computer so it sat on my desk the entire time so it didn't get damaged in any sort of way and it wasn't even used every single day because I also have headphones that I use frequently as not to disturb others in the room.
5,Easy to set up & use.  Sound is ok for as small as it is. Don't know about battery life yet it's too soon to tell.
5,This speaker is complete AWESOME-SAUCE!. My family decided to have an end of summer/Labor Day BBQ and I immediately realized that I needed a new Bluetooth speaker because I had no idea where my other one was. I started searching Amazon for cheaper (under $50) Bluetooth speakers with a big amount of wattage so that the music would reach us all regardless of how many family members showed up. This thing really met my expectations and then some. I left the speaker on the tables at the picnic area many times while I sat at least 30 feet away under a tree with shade. My cousin and I were able to hear the music perfectly and it wasn't too loud for the other groups enjoying the park. Great purchase on my part.
5,Very nice product and looks good too.  Easy to set up and great sound for its size.  Good sound quality through full spectrum and no distortion unless you turn up the volume to max. The battery is also pretty good charges quickly and lasts over 10 hrs with continuous use.  I normally listen to it while I'm working and found it very useful for conference calls shame it doesn't have a microphone...  I also like the SD card feature which helps draining the battery on your cell phone.  Overall I am very pleased with the product and would highly recommend it to anyone thinking of buying a portable wireless speaker.  Its compact aesthetically pleasing has good sound quality and is reasonably priced.
2,The Doss SoundBox Bluetooth speaker worked well the sound was great then the battery stopped holding a charge and stopped working.  I used it occasionally at home for about 10 months.  I was very disappointed because I rarely used this device.In comparison the cheaper Hizek 2400mAh 4.0 $20 Bluetooth speaker I purchased in February 2017 I used nearly every day at work for 3 years then brought home where I use much less now but it is Still Working (11/21) as well as it did when it was new!
5,I used this speaker to connect it to my projector because it had bad sound quality. I absolutely love it. Sounds super clear and the Bluetooth works great!
5,Purchased speaker hoping to pause and resume audio content quickly between phone calls. The top mounted touch controls are stellar for this purpose. One quick tap works the controls every time. Sound quality is excellent with surprisingly good stereo separation considering the speakers are only a couple inches apart..Highly recommend.
5,I got the deal on prime day for like 20 bucks. Listen best 20 I spent on a Bluetooth anything.
3,This speaker has great sound quality but it got left behind on the pool deck in a rain storm and it’s completely dead.
4,It connects fast but the sound quality is not good
5,Not quick to right a review I purchased this speaker back in June of this year. I have used it for months now and have been very happy with the item and purchase.Sound clear crisp with adequate low end (base) given its size. After all it’s just a small portable speaker.Battery run time is good as it has lasted for day trips to the beach pool etc.Bluetooth connectivity allows you to make and take calls hands free using the speakier itself to talk and listen.Design and footprint is compact with lighted touch controls on top that allow you to adjust the volume pause/play switch mode play previous/next song and take/end calls.Having had this speaker for 6+ months I would strongly recommend and purchase again.
5,I am using this speaker with the Amazon Echo Dot 2nd Generation. It is easy to connect and the difference in sound is amazing. This little speaker has great sound and good volume. The speaker will automatically power off if it is not used for 15 minutes. Since I am using this speaker to stream music with an Echo Dot this works well for me. You can contact the manufacturer to get a firmware upgrade to disable the auto power off if desired. After you have paired the speaker with the Echo Dot you can reconnect by powering up the speaker and telling the Echo Dot to connect to speakers and they will reconnect. The ease of use and the quality of sound makes this a great bargin.
5,I'm amazed at the sound this speaker puts out for the money. Great bass that you can actually feel crisp sounds all around. I love it.
4,Poor sound quality
4,Yoooooo I thought this was the best thing I have ever purchased in my life. Bluetooth is the way of the future! But G damn!!!! It started making the most annoying sound every two minutes. Like a busy tone for a phone. Jesus Christ in Heaven someone help me. I emailed the manufacturer and so far no response. I’m literally about to chuck this thing in the TRASHHHHHHH.... EDIT!!!!  Finally got in contact with the manufacturer and they helped me fix it. I was literally about to die. Wonderful speaker but that damn noise was driving me insane!
5,Very Happy with this little speaker - easily fills my office with good sound and about 50-60%
5,Nothing
5,Heavy duty better. Sound is extremely loud. Literally feels like you're in a movie theater with this speaker four feet away. I've had this speaker for quite some time. Used it at a lot of plumbing and construction sites  dropping it on concrete flooring getting it dirty throwing it around (dumb I know). Just recently dropped it inside a pool a week ago. Nearly had a heart attack until it kept going after an hour of letting it dry out. I must say this company has built these things tough. They may not advertise it but it may survive a nuclear bomb. I am now a greatful costumer and am glad that I finally have a device built to lost. Going to buy newer ones from Doss.
5,I absolutely love my speaker. I used to have a white one that lasted YEARS and been to baby showers bday parties picnics family functions my kitchen shower- everywhere. Super small cute and convenient. Good price too. Shopping came on time and without issue.
4,I LOVE my speaker I use it every day but I don't like two things about it. I can't play my songs to the maximum volume because if the bass is too much it'll change or pause the song due to the touch keys on the speaker. The second thing is when it's dying it tells you every two seconds that it is dying which is pretty annoying when you just want to listen to music. I love how I can go pretty far & the speaker won't skip. Overall the good out weighs the bad so four stars from me. I will recommend
5,I bought this speaker for my daughter for Christmas last year.  It has been the most used Christmas present she received.  She takes it wherever she goes.  She takes it to the bathroom when she showers just about every morning.  The sound quality is pretty good.  For the price paid it's great.  I chose this one based on pricing size and the fact that it was white so it would match her room.  It has served her well with no issue.  She loves it.
5,Have had this speaker now for about 6 years and still works great. Have had no issues with it. Battery life is surprisingly long even now. Had some issues with Bluetooth connectivity at first before I learned which button to push. Works if you hold to play button at the same time you click on your phone to connect to the speaker. Very cool looking and I like how you just slide your finger to adjust volume.
3,The speaker needs more bass but it's very loud. The slot where the SD card goes into is not secure which make it unsafe to remove  the it. When pushing the SD card it flies and can be lost  forever. I give it a 3 stars because for lack of quality control.
4,Works well and easily portable.
5,Honestly haven't had one problem with connectivity battery or sound! I throw it in my beach bag and take it to the beach literally every weekend. Just throw a towel over it so it's not in direct sun! Hasn't died once and usually I'm late plugging it in to charge so I don't think it has ever been fully charged! Still no issues!
3,Sound quality is really great but doesn't have as much top end volume as I'd like. The volume control is very convenient and is MUCH better and easier to use then the tiresome buttons that most bluetooth speakers have. The charging light is poorly placed below the charging cable so you have to pick up the unit and look underneath the charging cable to check if it's fully charged. Fit and finish is very nice but my biggest gripe is the tf slot (sd card) which is not labled. Neither the instruction manual nor the unit itself shows which way the card goes in so I guessed based on which way is "up" for most sd card slots. As soon as I placed the card in with a minimal amount of force it just dropped down inside. I had to open unit to get it out as it was rattling around. Turns out you have to put the card in upside down with the printed text facing downward and the gold contacts facing up. Got it working but having no label cost me an hour of work.
3,Ditto this comment from 2 yrs ago. Same for me except I won't be returning. My daughter's phone iPhone 11 Pro Max pairs just fine. My Samsung Galaxy 8 does not. At all. Very disappointed.A: You can't. Maybe I bought a lemon but the blue ring is flashing the pairing sound rings...and then DOSS never appears in my phone's device list even if I hold the Blueooth receiver right next to the unit. My phone pairs just fine with literally everything else. Garbage. Returning this bitterly disappointed.Nynaeve Al'Meara · 2 years ago
5,This speaker is really good. The bluetooth connectivity is easy and stable. It has a very long battery life before the need for recharging. Recharging does take a few hours. But it easily lasts for several hours on one charge.
5,Fills a small room or area with very good sound. Battery seems to last the whole day long. Charges quickly too.Received first as a gift. (Black). Bought another for the kitchen - white. And Ill probably buy another for my porch - red.
4,The speakers came on the day expected with careful packaging. The sound quality is pretty good for $30. The only irks I have is when I try to pick it up sometimes I accidently touch the top controls and change the song and when a track is playing but there is no music yet you can hear some high pitched static/noise. Yes there is an announcer voice on this soundbox. I emailed DOSS for the firmware to remove the voice announcer and got a response with the firmware file attached to the email (the firmware also removed the cool sound that happens when you turn off the speakers which is a bummer...). Great customer service.
3,I like the speaker a lot for the price. The battery seems to last for a long time. But all of the sudden I am having this issue where the speaker will randomly unpair from my iPhone. It's annoying AF and I don't understand why it's happening. It will unpair every 10-20 minutes and I have to go through the process of pairing again. It's not a distance problem as the speaker and phone will be within a few inches of each other. If it wasn't for this issue it would be a 4.5 star review.
4,For the price is a good item. Obviously it can’t compete with a Bose but you aren’t paying $200 either. Sometimes it’s hard to connect to it but....
5,This speaker is good.  It is loud enough.  Connectivity is easy.  Great value for the money.
5,Fantastic speaker! Whenever I use it I get compliments on how loud it goes and how clear the sound is. People think it's much more expensive than it actually was. The bluetooth works great although it stopped connecting automatically. I've also used the AUX cord it came with and that also works pretty well with it. There is a fun voice that says "Power on" and "Bluetooth mode" which I love though others may think it's annoying. To turn the volume up you rotate your finger on a lit up circle in the center of the top of the speaker. Sometimes I have difficulties with this but most of the time it works perfectly. When I turn the volume all the way up I have no problems hearing it from one end of the house to the next. Overall a great purchase.
4,I replaced an iHome dock as I went to a wireless charger and just needed the bluetooth speaker. Love the sound quality from such a small speaker. Easy pairing. My only negative is that the unit switches off (fairly quickly) even when the AC adapter is plugged in. I understand the need to conserve power when it it operating on battery but it should stay on when it is plugged in...
5,I purchased this has inexpensive xmas gift for my son in-law. I was helping them move and he had his music playing on it. I was so impressed by the clarity and battery life that when I got home I purchased one for myself.Best money could buy.It's refreshing to see someone come out with a great product and not be overly expensive. Great job!
5,I wanted a speaker for my iPad in order to listen to pod casts.  This is a perfect solution at a great price.
5,This is the second speaker for Doss.  I ordered one over 2 years again.  It was a gift for my water aerobics instructor she uses it for our classes with music.  I now have another instructor and I bought this one for her.  The first one has lasted and still works great.  The second one has new updates and is improved.  Still a great speaker for the money and I will buy another when needed.
5,We purchased this to connect to a variety of devices. The connection is easy and the sound is great. Highly recommend for the price
5,I was having an audio issue with one of the soundboxes..I had bought two of these. The other one has been functioning perfectly fine. I was promptly contacted by the company and offered a replacement. They stand by their product and warranty 100 per cent. I received the replacement product quicklywhich was retested before sending and works perfect. I have to give the product and company five stars for the  quality and going the extra mile to take care of any issues. They truely stand behind the product. I have to say that this is an excellent soundbox and I really love the memory card feature which enables you to put mp3s on the card and play music for hours without  being connected to Bluetooth.
4,This is a gr8 little portable speaker.  You can use the bluetooth or use the line in cord that is included the light is red when its being used and turns green whenever its fully charged.
4,I bought 2 of these and so far they are working great. My daughter is using hers for her turntable and i am using mine in my room and they are loud. I love the colors and the ease of using them.
5,This are by far THE MOST AMAZING speakers I've bought! I just came back from a trip this weekend and we used it for 2 days straight with no probleem. Other than the full charge before the trip I only charged it like 30min while using them and was more than enough. I honestly recommend this speakers to EVERYONE!
5,Music
5,I bought this to put in my barn.  I didn't want to spend too much money but I wanted to be able to hear my music and podcasts when I'm working.  This is a great speaker for the money!
3,I absolutely adored everything about this device....until it spontaneously stopped holding charge after 6mos. The 20+ hour battery life is now 6-8 hours on a good day...no changes in functionality or sound quality otherwise. It has been my favorite portable speaker I just wish it was still holding the charge it used to hold.
4,It has an amazing sound you can adjust the  volume and clarity the way you like. But it kept on disconnecting from my phone and stutter. So i don't know what to say
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I didnt like how the power button is so small not so accessible its the back of the speaker would be nice if its a big button on the top of the speaker. Problem with volume is you have to find the sweet spot for it to work if you turn the volume down or up. No base but it sounds ok.
5,Love this little speaker.  There is no delay between mouth movements and audio as I have experienced with other bluetooth speakers.  Quality and volume is good.  So nice to be able to move the speaker to the kitchen and listen to my show without raising the volume and disturbing the entire household.  Excellent purchase!
5,For the price I am very satisfied with this speaker. I like the shape because it’s a solid foundation (I also have a round speaker that rolls). I use this speaker in the house outside in the yard and by the pool. It stays charged for many hours. Sound quality is very good for such a small speaker. I would buy it again.
4,I was originally very happy with the DOSS Touch - easy to setup and decent sound.  However the day after I ordered a second unit the first stopped working over Bluetooth.  It will continuously act as if in pairing mode but it is not visible to any other device - including the Amazon echo with which it had been pair and working until that day. It stopped working about 12 days past the Amazon return period.Update:  Wonder Tech customer service proactively reached out to me based onthis review and offered a replacement speaker.  The new unit is working well.
5,UPDATED 11/1/2018Shortly after my speaker stopped working I contacted customer service. They are amazing; sent me a new speaker with no hesitations. This speaker is still working great as promised. I still love the features. Its very sleek and the touch top interface is seamless. Thank you!-----------------OLD REVIEW 1/2018I had high expectations with this speaker as it is amazing. Sound quality clarity and feature are amazing. But unfortunately mines became defective in a month. I cant use it now. The place to insert the charging cord is loose and I can't charge it no matter how I try to angle the cord.Its completely useless now and I'm very unsatisfied. BE WARE!!!!!!WILL UPDATE REVIEW IF I CAN GET A REPLACEMENT DEVICE!
5,Small speaker with incredible sound quality (even when. Plume is pumped up).  Add claims it is also waterproof which means I can use it outdoors - we will see if that is true
5,I’m always impressed every time I turn the speaker on. It’s surprisingly loud for how compact it is. Decent bass (though I’m no audiophile) and can get very loud. Easily connects to my phone. I love that it has touch volume control on the top. Battery life seems pretty good.
5,I bought this speaker because my laptop speaker just isn't loud enough for me. Quality is very good easy to use. When I went to pair with my laptop it found the speaker with no problem. Sound is very good for my old ears. I would highly recommend this as it is my third purchase of this same speaker. I bought one for my son one for my wife's Kindle and one for my work computer.
4,I really love this product; however it sporadically skips in the middle of songs and goes to the next song. Sometimes it plays correctly and other times just keeps skipping. I would rate this product 5 stars if it would stop doing that! I called customer service and had to leave a message. I emailed them as well. Waiting on return call or email to see if there is a correction. So...just got a call from Doss customer support on the same day I left the phone message. They are sending a new Soundbox. Thank you!!!
4,Handy small decent sound I bought it for the office of course you could buy a Bose if you like but this one I STILL HAVE . .
4,I sound is good and clear.
5,This device is well worth the money. The sound is clear and audible. At its highest volume it still manages to give excellent audio that is clean. Don't underestimate this small device as it packs a big punch. Glad I made the purchase
5,Right off I have to admit I'm addicted to bluetooth units. I'm less than thrilled with most of them - they shall remain nameless. I have eleven different units from various makers. This SoundBox is phenominal. Not only does this one sound terrific and punch out at good volume with NO DISTORTION but it has unique features which are 'lighted' - imagine that - 'lighted'. A feature I absolutely love is the allowance for use of a memory card (the tiny ones) to play your music. I've installed a 64 micro hdhc card with about 50 Broadway musicals. Great sound. Great convenience. I have one suggestion; add a feature that allows me to go from album to album and not just track to track. That feature would be the proverbial whipped cream on the dessert.
5,MY SON AND DAUGHTER ARE VOCALIST AND ONE IS A PRODUCER SO IM ALWAYS SURROUNDED BY THE BEST EQUIPMENT RELATED TO SPEAKER SOUND.  I WANTED SOMETHING I COULD TAKE OUTSIDE WHILE DOING THINGS FROM HAVING LUNCH WITH FRIENDS OR LOOKING AFTER MY GARDEN. INSIDE WHILE SHOWERING  ETC... I WAS HESITANT DUE TO THE PRICE AND SIZE BUT I'M SUPER HAPPY I BOUGHT THIS! I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! FOR THE PRICE AND SIZE IT'S THE BEST SOUNDING BLUE TOOTH SPEAKER IVE HEARD!!!
5,this is the second one Ive bought  the other lasted a couple years used a lot I will buy another when this one gives out
4,Use it on my patio works very well
5,This speaker is more than expected ... My wide bought one from Brookstone years ago for about $75 ...  That was impressive for the size ... This is a little bigger but the sound is great for it's size ... Battery lasted at least 8 hours at pretty decent volume ... Can't beat this for the price ... Would easily buy another if need be!
4,I would have rated this little device higher if it hadn't taken me several weeks to figure out how to connect it to my Alexa. The design is sleek and modern and easy to use once you get the hang of it The sound however is really phenomenal
5,Great sound and great value
2,Features are cool but the sound quality is lacking tremendously. Absolutely no bass with this speaker their is no depth to the sound. The touch panel doesn't always respond either especially the volume control. So with all the cool features it touts it was a huge let down on performance. There are a few pluses is its great for calls the clarity is great on both ends. Battery life is great but when its down to the end it reminds to charge every 15 mins. Connecting is easy and has a accurate range. The speaker is also pretty solid and sturdy. If your not looks for a full body sound this the perfect speaker. If you are a music fan and looking for that balanced sound you are going to regret it. Even with all the features it definitely falls short of its purpose.
1,I use this with my tv.  After one month the speaker cuts out for a second about every 10-15 seconds. Very annoying when watching tv or a movie!  Not happy with this product and would not recommend.
5,I use it every day. For  cleaning cooking and dancing with the kiddos. Easy to pick up and move around with better yet is I just have to touch the button and it plays or skips songs. Easy and affordable. I’d recommend it to my family and friends.
5,I bought two of these Doss speakers. They both had static within a few days of use. I contacted the seller on Amazon who was very helpful and said I could return them for replacement or refund. I said I'll give it a while to see if static improves.  I waited too long and went past the 90 days or whatever the time limit is for returns so of course was unable to return. So I contacted Doss twice directly since then by phone left messages. I still have not had a return call so their warranty is worthless. I would recommend investing a little more money into a quality speaker that has a real warranty and manufacturer that stands behind their product.
4,The speaker was very easy to setup and pair with my iPhone. I purchased this device after my Bose Soundlink speaker quit. I use it primarily for music while I am working out. The volume level is great and I would say the sound quality is pretty good just not as deep or pure as the Bose (but way less expensive!)
3,I’m not very tech savvy. I couldn’t get it to connect.
5,Used this speaker for music around my pool.  Was perfect for what I needed
5,Bought this few weeks ago and had no problems or issues with it. Awesome sound quality portable and convenient. The speaker can get my phone’s Bluetooth signal even when I am at quite a distance from it. A little note: rather than using the charger included in the box I use my phone charger to recharge the speaker and it still works nicely.
5,I just needed a speaker so we could hear the movies playing on my laptop. It works great for that and the battery life is good. What I hadn't expected is that I can stop or start the movie from the box. Very helpful. Very pleased with this purchase.
4,I love it! But it’s a little too much base for me (you can’t change the base or treble).
5,Great little speaker!  Bought it for my daughters pool party since it’s waterproof and the sound was great!  Can’t beat the price!
5,Boy oh boy the hours of my life I looked for an affordable Bluetooth Player until I found this one.  For the slick looks lack of complaints and $30 price tag this one was a no brainer.  So for the pros great battery life looks great gets pretty loud.  This thing is a little more durable then it gets credit for I have taken it out on my bass boat in the heat and got water on it and it hasn't missed a beat.  The only complaint I have with this is when listening to loud BOOMY music with BASS.. the volume tends to distort pretty good and it the volume weakens until the bass is over.  All in all what did you really expect for $30? This is a great value highly recommend!
5,Honestly I can’t complain. I would definitely recommend this! I couldn’t find any flaws with mine
4,But as a gift for my mother for Christmas she loves it it’s perfect for her needs she uses it in her kitchen
5,I had a problem with the battery not holding a charge in the speaker.I emailed the company and they took care of the problem!!!!!!They sent me a totally new speaker!That is GREAT customer service.I have been using the new speaker for over a month now and it works Great!!!I recommend it! It sounds terrific ....Clean good audio!
5,This is a great little speaker that we use in many different areas. Poolside working out in the kitchen cooking…It’s attractive indiscreet and has a really good sound!
3,It does last a long period of time but it wasn't as loud as I expected. I have a way smaller speaker and its almost as loud as this one. Its cute for kids but not loud enough for me.
5,Bought this as a patio speaker and I’m not disappointed loud crisp and clear. The volume control takes some getting used to. Very easy to connect to a smart phone or Alexa I’m very happy with the battery life.
3,It sounds like an AM/FM radio alarm clock on its highest volume. Couldn’t tell if the one I got was defective or if it’s the unpleasant noisy alarm radio clock
3,Does not produce enough sound for larger areas...if that makes sense. It is great for a small office to enjoy music while working but will not provide the volume needed for a presentation in a classroom.
4,I like the sound of the DOSS SoundBox Touch Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker but the battery life is a little weak.
4,Nice smooth design and very easy to sync to your device. Reading previous reviews cleared up confusion on how the volume works (run your finger clockwise around the illuminated circle on top to turn it up counter clockwise to turn it down. "Busy signal" tone indicates you've reached max volume). Clear crisp sound and decent range but not as loud as I'd like it to be. Great speaker for listening to music while you're hanging out at home or taking it to a picnic/beach with a few friends but not loud enough to use for a party... Which is kind of a bummer because that's the reason I purchased it.
5,My husband loves this speaker.  He uses it outside on the patio and the sound is great.  A great value for the money.
5,Overall this has been a great buy. I use it when working on projects or need handsfree and can't use earbuds/headphones.The unit doesn't contain any flimsy or apparently weak materials and it looks like it was put together well. Overall solid construction and appearance.The sound quality is great and the volume is good. This Bluetooth speaker also has an option for taking cell phone calls through the speaker at the press of a button; a convenient feature if you work alone and need handsfree.The buttons are digitally controlled and are located on the top.Overall this has been a great deal and a good buy!
2,The battery life was good and it hooks up to your Bluetooth easily. The design and controls are easy to understand. My issue with this speaker is that it (at max volume) is not very loud. I was super disappointed with it.
5,I am so excited. This speaker is so wonderful and it's got such good sound I can take it with me wherever I go I use it this morning while I was cleaning I love it thank you so much for coming up with this product merry Happy Thanksgiving and Merry Christmas thank you
5,I really do love it! It has great sound and bass.
5,I love this speaker! Works great at the beach and at the campground! Good size for traveling. Battery life is good too! Would definitely recommend!
4,Good sound from a small box.  With twin 6W amps and small speakers sounds below 100 Hz roll off steeply so do not expect this to sound good for music that requires a hefty bass punch.  It does sound good for rock pop and classical music.  Small and unobtrusive it is a good value for the money.  The waterproof (not tested) carrying pouch is a nice touch.  Volume control is not obvious but enables the box to be very sleek without the need for a rocker or slider switch.The micro SD card slot is great for situations where Bluetooth connectivity is not possible.
5,The speaker sounds great it was easy to connect to Alexa and plays great. It is rechargeable by USB which saves on batteries.
5,Bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it. Takes it everywhere with her. No complaints
5,I really like the sound and quality of this small radio.  Just wished it came with a bag or a sleeve to carry it around.
5,I bought this speaker because of two reviews:"Too much bass!""Comparable to Bose"I love it! Crisp and clean listening to Adam Carolla's Podcasts and great sound quality with music. Tested it side by side with the Bose mini while listening to Rush and Third Eye Blind and it's tough extremely tough to tell which is which. Easy to use easy to set up & comes with all the cables you need. Except for a power brick to charge USB. Only flaw I've noticed was it did take quite a while to fully charge (2+ hours). But you can use it while its charging so it doesn't bother me.All-in-all great speaker it deserves another star. For the price I might even get another one! Definitely worth a lot more money great deal.
5,I mostly use this speaker to listen to the radio via bluetooth when I'm shaving showering in my bathroom.  the sound is excellent.  My only caveat would be that the on/off switch is a little fussy.  sometimes I have to press it several times before it will shut off.
4,You like music on doing choirs around the house you need one of these
5,Woooow!!! is all I can say. I read all the reviews and decided to take a chance on this product. DOSS out did themselves it truly sounds like a stereo system delivering clarity in soundBass is unbelievable. I live in a 3 story home and you can hear it throughout with clarity. WOW!!!! LOVE THIS PRODUCT ITS A MUST BUY YOU WONT REGRET IT AT ALL.
4,After a few days of use I am very satisfied with the sound and various modes of this speaker compared to 2 or 3 other external speakers I have bought. Its also at a good price point.
5,The speaker was exactly what I was looking for and as described. It was delivered in good condition and on time. It was easy to sync the Bluetooth to my phone which is why I needed it.
3,I used this for my kitchen tv sound.  Plugged it in from time to time also used it on my kindle great sound.  I bought it years ago five or so.  Now it won't work for more than a few minutes.  I read the battery issues.  Since it is only $20+ I am going to take it apart and check the batteries.  The screws are underneath the bottom feet so I will pull them out.  I will try to update this review since now batteries are more superior than back in 2014 or so.
4,For this price it is hard to go wrong.  The speaker is small and loud and easy to set up.  For my purposes of playing spooky Halloween sounds it will work perfectly.  For playing music though sound is too bright and harsh.  Playing "Liztomania" by Phoenix I noticed that the snare and hi-hat were harsh and piercing where on other music systems they are pleasing.  It would be nice if the unit had a treble/bass adjustment to make the sound more pleasant.  At high volumes the sound starts to break up and get distorted.
2,I was pleasantly surprised by DOSS SoundBox Touch Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker with 12W HD sound.  It was clear and had good sound quality.  The sound quality was better than other Bluetooth speakers I have purchased but after the return expired the charging port would not match with the original charging cable and I had to use another and tape that one to keep it charged.  It eventually stopped charging due to this poorly made product.
5,I just use it whenever I need to in the shower in my bedroom when I invite guest it is so reliable
5,I purchased this Doss Speaker two years ago and like it so much I purchased another one to have in my garage . Well made  dependable and wonderful sound !
5,This speaker is a must buy. It's very loud ! You will not be disappointed.
5,I love this speaker. Iv only had it a few hours. But for the price the sound is good. It’s not amazing sound and we should not expect anything amazing for this price. But the sound is decent and it feels solid. Best of all everything works quickly and easily
5,Great sound quality
5,I was so excited when I got the speaker that I used it right out of the box with my iPod Nano 7th Generation. For such a small speaker the sound is pretty good. Remember folks you get what you pay for. For example it shouldn't be compared with a Bose speaker.  You will get the full effect of the speaker when it is "fully" charged. Thanks to reading these reviews I figured out how to pair the device with my iPod again after the device was fully charged. If I had to critique one thing I wish that it would charge my iPod as well but since that is not what this speaker was designed to do then it still earns 5 stars from me.😊
5,Its amazing.  The battery life is amazing. It lasts for days! I cannot remember when I last charge it and I use it every night! I love the sound quality but it doesn't connect to my computer very well. I have to physically go into my settings and connect.
4,This speaker is just as good as one I almost bought from Best Buy that cost $165.  I really didn't want to spend that amount of money and thought I would give this one a try first I am so glad I did!  I would have given this 5 stars however the volume does fade from time to time only for a few seconds then it is back to full volume!  Not a huge issue to me I think it is a defect on Bluetooth only.  Other than that small issue it is the perfect little speaker for the price!
3,It's alright for such a small speaker.  You get what you pay for. Its loud enough but the sound quality could be a whole lot better as well as the bass. I'm definitely not impressed with the sound quality. The volume is great and it's a really nice looking Bluetooth speaker but the quality is definitely not what I expected. I bought a Bluetooth speaker for about the same price maybe $29.99 a couple years ago and the sound quality was amazing as well as the volume and everything about the speaker. This Bluetooth speaker was roughly the same price but the sound quality is nowhere near what I paid for the same price in speaker but different brand a few years ago. I'm thinking about returning this only because the quality could be better but it definitely does do the trick and it is good for what you pay in price. It just sucks when I paid about the same amount for a Bluetooth speaker that lasted several years and the quality and everything about it was amazing. This one is okay.
5,Fantastic sound for such a portable speaker. I'm a musician and very picky about my sound quality on items like this. This little guy puts out great high mid range and low end quality sound.  Great for all around the house travel picnics in the park or at the beach. I have easily done about 8 to 9 hours of continuous playback on a single battery charge which I think is great considering the big sound it puts out. Really great little speaker. And it even connects to my phone for hands free calls in my bedroom for when I'm just too darn lazy to hold my phone late at night and I'm talking to my honey when he's stationed overseas. Worth it. You won't be disappointed.
4,Listening to music
4,There was a problem with using my model tablet which didn't happen with my cell phone so I've edited this review to point out that 'my mileage may be very different from yours.'Original rant -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Defective speaker. Defective email support. What's good?Got speaker. Charged to green. Bluetooth connected. Activated audio app. Played music. OK. Adjusted volume with touch ring. Complete audio breakup. Same for a couple of minutes till some regular playing. Then silence as if paused .. then audio again. Defective touch interface? Email DOSS support. Invalid email address. Now the joy of the return process.
5,The battery lasts way longer than you'd expect. The sound is also really good quality for the price. Perfect garage speaker.
3,First off I couldn't pair the soundbox with my computer (although I was able to pair and connect to my Kindle) but I had an oldish computer running oldish apps. So I got a Bluetooth adapter and still couldn't pair it. I tried two more Bluetooth adaptors and nothing. I wrote to the company several times asking for help but nothing worked.. They sent me another one for free though so that was nice. But I still couldn't pair the new one.Then I ended up getting a new computer. Not because of that but I just needed one and then I was able to pair and connect.The sound of the Spimdbpx is nice and full but my main complaint is it doesn't go loud enough.The blue circle in the middle is the volume and you dial it up or down like an iPod. But those four white icons around it? They don't seem to do a thing. There's no indicator of battery life either so you don't know when you need to recharge.
4,Quite frankly I was not expecting much in the sound quality department but I ended up being pleasantly surprised.  The mid and high ends of the range are good at mid-volume level but pitchy higher than that.  The great part is that most people will seldom have to raise the volume above the middle.  EDM Country R&B you name it it sounds good on this cute little speaker. If you are looking to hear every minute sound made by an instrument this is not your speaker.  However if you want a device that gets it done admirably then chose this one.
5,I have bought about 5 bluetooth speakers within this price range and this one by far is the BEST one I've had.The housing is very stylish with the convenience of the lit touch buttons on top are great. Volume is exceptional. I have a Bose speaker I borrowed from my son and I actually like this one better. Now I do mostly use it to hear my TV. So the voice clarity is best on the Doss.I am going to purchase a second one for my living room TV since coming online it is $5 lower in price what? Yup just over $20!You will not be disappointed with the GREAT SPEAKER.
5,Works perfectly a Good buy
5,This is a great lower cost Bluetooth speaker! I’m very happy with it! I’m not sure how long a charge lasts because I keep it plugged in frequently but the sound quality is good easy to set up and doesn’t take up much room! Great for the price!
4,At this price point I'm pleased.  The bass is deep and the volume will get quite loud if one wishes.  I really like the phone control features on the speaker itself.  Want to pause?  Tap a button on the speaker...same with skip.  Nice touch.
4,I really do like this speaker. The sounds are crisp and clear. The only downside is that the speakers are only in the front. The design makes it look like its surround sound and its not.
3,Overall pretty impressed. Good sound and battery life minimal distortion at high volumes. But the god damn engineers strike again. Lets use touch style buttons instead of traditional buttons. Why I don't really know. Maybe these are features DOSS figured would be appealing and increase sales. However i have to attempt volume adjustments about three times before I can get it where I want it on the slider. Anyway its a pretty good product. Also struggles to reconnect if I turn off blue tooth for a phone call. I would buy it again it sounds good for the price. Seems well built. Just shitty buttons
3,After two years the soundbox just freaked out one night! It would not shut off even when I disconnected it from my iPhone. It would blink and make sounds as if it needed a charge. Will put hammer to it tomorrow to stop it😂 before going in the garbage! Two years!
5,This is a great speaker for the Echo dot. We have it in the kitchen and even being an open kitchen it will and can fill the room with sound. It sounds much better than I thought it would at this price point. The only problem I had was it has an auto shutoff feature that shuts it down after 15 minutes of inactivity and this deletes the purpose of using it for the Echo dot. Contacted the manufacturer and had new firmware the same day to turn that feature off making this a 5 star product in my book. I've only been using it for a week so I can't speak for the longevity of this speaker yet. I will add to this review if I encounter any problems. Great speaker and great customer service.
3,Just got it need some time
4,Sound is good for what you buy.  Good quality and reliable.
5,Have only had it a few days but if you are wanting the best sound quality for the money this is the right speaker for you. The Bluetooth works flawless no matter where im at in my 2 story 1600 sq/ft house and it is plenty loud to fill the entire house with quality sound. I mainly got this for the house and to take outside when i go shooting or other activities and it is awesome.
4,Battery is average. Sound is good- using it for outdoor activities. Haven’t left it exposed to extreme weather so can’t say if it could handle intense heat or moisture. All in all very good value for the price
4,This was my first Bluetooth speaker purchase. Its okay for what I use it for. I use it to listen to my phone in between deliveries.  As for sound do not listen to the person who posted about it being like a Bose. I bought two based on that review. One was for a gift. The sound if up too high is distorted and muffled. It has to remain on a low setting to work properly. It is not water or weather proof. Its meant for indoor use.
3,At first I enjoyed it. It sounds really good for 24 dollars. Just a couple reasons why i gave it three stars. The lights dont turn off. Everytime i turn it off and then back on the volume is reset(kind of annoying). Its not really a bass speaker but thats not my issue. The issue is when a bassy song comes on it interferes with the mids and highs. The way i can explain its almost as if when you have lights on and then you use a blender or vacuum and all the lights dim for a sec. Except its just not momentary for the speaker it goes on and off throughout a song. Kind off messes with the listening experience. For a little extra bass i put it on top of my dresser. The hollowness somehow boost the bass. Honestly the speakers sounds like it was made for speeches. The voices definitely come out clean and clear (except for bassy songs)Again not bad for 24 bucks. Anything over that i would probably consider something else. Especially if you're looking for more bass.That's all folks.
5,Great sound out of a small box
5,I really did love this speaker - have it it my pool area - loud enough and I control it with my phone -
4,i must say the first one that i got for some reason did not last long  (after a couple of weeks it did not charged any more) but just after posting my review they did send me a new one even doe i didn't ask for a refund or a replacement so i must give credit to their support department and i hope that the first one i got was a lemon and that the one that i got know will last ill be post an update just in case the one that i have received know fails to fingers crossed
4,I used this product around my friends for picnics or just hanging out most of them complimented the looks of the speakers. It ha a good sound quality and is loud.
5,Works great for background audio in a machine shop. Connects easily every time with battery life accessible on my phone. Lasts through a 10 hour shift and then some on a full charge. The volume control might be a bit unwelcoming for repeated use I would much rather a button than a touch sensitive dial. I use my phone to control it anyway so this isn't an issue for me. Might get another for camping trips.
4,It lasts so long and plays really well. It’s a great steal for this price. Could get a better portable speaker.
5,I hate leaving a review as soon as I get something but man this speaker is awesome.Set up is easy and took 15 seconds.  The sound quality is insane.  It’s nice and heavy so won’t fly around in my golf cart.  Plenty loud for the beach home golf or whatever.  Looks mad good in red too!Thanks!  Very satisfied.
4,Nice portable device. I guess I thought it was going to be bigger but it's fine. I like that it doesn't make a lot of loud noises when you turn it on and off. The sound is good for the size of the unit and the volume goes quite high without distortion. It is perfect for a bathroom or any other room in the house. Or to take camping or on a boat or to have in a hotel room. And you can plug in an aux. cord so if you don't have Bluetooth you are covered. And it was on sale so the price was great.
5,I purchased this speaker for my son who is out of the country.  I specifically purchased it for the micro SD capability.  When I first purchased the speaker and made the attempt to use the micro SD card the speaker would not work.  I contacted DOSS customer service.  They trouble-shooted the issue with me and determined the SD Card has to be facing down (electrical leads facing up.  There is no mention of this in the instructions or on the speaker itself).  The speaker worked great.  Sound was excellent for the size weight and cost.  The DOSS customer support was excellent as well.  I purchased another one for myself because I liked it so much.
3,I bought this to go in my barn so I could have some tunes while cleaning stalls and tending to the horses. It's a 4-stall barn so not huge. I find I have to move it around with me to hear it even when the volume is fully up. Other than that good value and decent sound. Take note however if you have any music on  with a decent amount of bass it will vibrate and move (and subsequently fall to the ground in my case) from where you place it. On a good note dropped 3x now and still alive!
5,My brother had bought these speakers for himself and one for our Dad. Dad wanted one to have in the living room by his recliner but didn't want wires. Bingo! My brother had his in his master bedroom on his wall unit headboard. That is where I wanted mine also. Got mine and my bluetooth transmitter and was easy to install. Easy Peasy. Now I don't have to the volume turned up so loud to hear our bedroom TV. It sits across the bedroom on the Wall and we are able to hear it clearly with this speaker. Easy to turn up or down the volume and doesn't take up much space and no wires!
5,This speaker is all I could have ever asked for. It’s not super expensive but it sounds like one. Having it be totally touch based is great. The Bluetooth is great it catches my phone every time but does take a minute to connect. The volume takes some time getting used to but if your looking for a cheat and great sounding speaker this is the one for you.
5,I love this speaker.  I haven't had anything my house in a long time to listen to music since the stereo I had became obsolete to be when the new iPhones came out with the new plug in.. the idea of a wireless speaker popped into my head about 3 years too late but I went straight to amazon when I got the idea and I chose this one based on the price and stars and product description and I was not disappointed.  I love this little guy it packs a punch and is loud and sounds clears. its super easy use and set up and the charge lasts for a very long time. great for indoors and out of doors.
5,Compact and easy to use.Great quality.
5,Man what an amazing little speaker. This thing has great sound quality. I was skeptical because of the price of it being quality but I love this thing. The battery lasts a long time. I wish the Bluetooth range was a little bit longer. But I absolutely have no complaints on this one. I love the touch screen to lower and raise the volumes and use the functions and it is super easy to connect to any device With Bluetooth. Would highly recommend this speaker to anyone looking for great sound that won’t break the bank
4,This speaker has some heft to it.  For what i paid for it i am very content.
5,I have two of these speakers. The first one my young adult son love it so much he took it over. So I had to purchase one for myself to use.
4,For a little speaker system this has a great quality sound. It’s not Bose system quality by any means but it’s great for my teenager who likes to have it to link up to her iphone when she’s working on her art. Sound is clear hooks up to blue tooth easy modest base sound. I ve had this  for over a year already and it still works great. Bought another because my older at daughter and my middle who already owns one  started fighting for its use!
5,This speaker is fantastic. Love the versatile function of it connecting to all sorts of devices. I usually do not review electronic devices but this one is a great little gadget that is a must have. Our first one was stolen in a restaurant with a jacket. I am sure the person who stole the jacket is happy to find this in the big side pocket.
4,Just got this little speaker and so far it's perfect.  It's not a big expensive BOSE system that sounds like I'm in Carnegie Hall but for my little Condo and easy listening it's perfect.  And very easy to set up.  I bought it so I could expand the sound of my computer but once I found how easy it was to pair with my iPhone I just did that and happily listened to music all night long.
5,This is my favorite tech item I bought this year. Excellent sound quality and the battery lasts forever! It's has made my time in the truck delivering packages something to look forward to! Can't recommend it too highly! Also I've dropped it multiple times and it's still works great!
5,I love this speaker I use it almost every day loud enough for inside use and ok for outside set in the table  while we socialize considering I love loud music the bass sound is great I’m really happy with this purchase overall it connects to the Bluetooth pretty easy and the battery lasts pretty good I like that the percentage shows on your phone display and and when it’s low battery it makes a busy tone it throw me off I thought someone was Trying to call me lol
5,Grabbed this as a gift for my wife while she was traveling this summer.  I was blown away how well this thing works as a relatively inexpensive BT speaker:LIKES:- Great sound- Projects enough to easily fill our open dining room/living room with ease- No problems connecting to either my wife's phone or mine (yet)- Seems to legit hold a charge for 12+ hours of play timeDISLIKES:- Buttons are bit hard to figure out the first time connecting your devicesOVERALL:Very satisfied with the purchase worth every penny!  The perfect little BT speaker for camping around the house in the garage.
4,the bass is dope !  it blasts the quality of the sound is good but the sound as a whole to me does not go as loud as I would have like it even though the bass does the other sound types are not as loud or deep to me.  but then again its not expensive either !  decent speaker!
5,I love everything about this speaker! It’s light has great sound quality modern looking has great battery life and I can hear it outside of my one bedroom apartment with the front door closed. It really was a great investment. Also the red looks so sleek! Buy this.
4,Great quality good sound easy to use.
4,This speaker was delivered as promised was very easy  to set up and sounds great for a small speaker. Connecting to the Amazon Echo with Bluetooth worked well.  Volume is very good and quality is not seriously diminished at full volume.Controlling the volume is a little cumbersome without a physical knob and there is no indicator to tell where you are on the level scale.as far as I can tell.Did not try the microphone yet to answer calls.  I am disappointed that I can not talk to "Alexa "with the speaker's microphone.
5,This is a nice good quality speaker for the price. Its small enough to travel with and the sound is nice and loud. The battery life is also good I havent had to charge it since I bought it.
5,This is a great little sound box. It works well battery lasts a long time and it sounds good. It hooked up to Pandora on my phone easily. I bought a case for it which I would recommend to keep it clean and safe especially if you travel with it.
5,I wanted a small bluetooth speaker for the backyard while I enjoy the pool.  I searched here and found this little jewel has awesome reviews.  While I like to believe the reviews are accurate I'm usually at arms length but in this case I decided to take a shot and try this speaker.  It arrived free one day shipping and it arrived early in the day so I could still test it out in the backyard.  WOW!  This speaker packs a punch!  It's like a party in a small container!  Good bass and great clean crisp sound.  If you're looking for a small bluetooth speaker this is the one people!
5,Bought this a long time ago and forgot to write a review. It's been with me on a lot of travels and still holding up really well. Never had a problem with it. Sound quality is good as ever. Recommended.
4,It works good and sounds good.In a way its a lower quality speaker but still sounds pretty great.Definitely worth buying.
5,Bought this speaker for my senior citizen mother-in-law and she absolutely loves it! It’s simple for her to use as she enjoys listening to music apps on her smart phone. If you are looking for a great gift idea for the senior or anyone in your life this is the item for you! The sound quality is magnificent and the price point is perfect. 👌I promise - you will definitely be pleased with this purchase! 👍
5,This is more than. I expected. Very loud connects to every device so far and it holds a battery for days. We’ve had it for months now and it’s great
5,Nice low priced bluetooth speaker!  Connects to bluetooth easily and has simple functions.  Great all around option for sound.  The speaker has a nice solid feel and looks great too. iPhone 7 connected in seconds and reconnects perfectly every time.  Sound is good for the price range.  If you are looking for exquisite loud sound you would need to move up the price range- ie: Oontz Angle 3XL for $109 (larger and super loud speaker).  However this has great clear sound for all your basic needs.  Great for bedrooms and patios.  Battery lasts plenty long and bluetooth range is on par for bluetooth devices.  This is a quality unit that sounds nice for the price.  Love it.
5,the sound quality is super impressive. my house has wood floors and ten foot ceilings so it's like a big drum. This machine sounds like a super sound system because the acoustics are so good where I live. I like that they do put a technology that allows the bass to be featured. there is a significant difference from other bluetooth speakers that don't have the bass technology. I like that it is super portable also. If i were to have one gripe if you were to play music directly from the micro tf slot it won't read mp4 files. but i primarily use the bluetooth and headphone cable to play music. so for my needs I like this product a lot.
4,WOW! Just got it a couple of days ago because it was the deal of the day and so far I’m extremely happy. I LOVE the pink color. The sound quality is amazing!! And it was super easy to connect to Bluetooth. Hoping I’ll still be happy with it in the future. Definitely recommend!!
5,Already posted my review. I like the speaker it works well comes with a usb cable and hard wire cable which I am not positive works. Also comes soft pouch plus there is an optional hard case designed to fit the speaker.Update 10/25/2017: I emailed support today asking for the firmware in order to disable the auto-off feature which powers down the speaker after approx 15 minutes. If you are interested you must have a micro sd card (32gb or less) to insert into the speaker. They responded today! They sent the file as well as a short video demonstrating how to insert the sd card.I recommend this product - I am happy with the product and the excellent service they provide!
5,I purchased this speaker for a small available space in my living room.  It had to be small but it had to have good sound quality across the range treble to base.  It delivers.  Set up to work with Alexa was simple.  The speaker can be configured to be non-portable (as I use it) with software downloaded from DOSS.  I had a problem after a year and the technical service people responded within a day and eventually replaced the unit free of change.  You cannot go wrong with people who stand behind their product.
5,i was a bose gal and after my bose stopped working it was taking me a long time to re-commit to spending $200+ on another speaker. i found the DOSS and figured for $30 i could have a bluetooth speaker and i really didn’t have huge expectations.the sound blew me away it’s lightweight and i actually am so so happy with the purchase.the only thing i don’t like is how sensitive the top buttons are to touch. i carry it upside down so i don’t accidentally pause or skip the song.other than that great purchase. interested in seeing what it’s longevity is like!
5,I initially looked up HK speakers until I read the amazing reviews for DOSS Touch Wireless Bluetooth V4.0 Portable Speaker with HD Sound and Bass. I said to myself since its more affordable let me just try this one. I couldn't wait for my delivery (which had to be rescheduled) but 2 days wasn't so bad; I charged it up followed the pairing instructions & found my favorite youtube video on my cell and BOOM.....I WAS DONE! The sound was so incredible I couldn't believe it was coming from this little box. Although I haven't had it for 24 hrs I won't be returning this little gem. I am very pleased with my purchase.
4,Amazing speakers. The battery lasts long and the sound gets very loud. My only complaint is that sometimes it cuts the very first beat of certain songs short (just the start of the song) creating a stutter which is frustrating but minor.
4,I think.... this little speaker is pretty good. I bought it really for my laptop because it has very low volume. I've bluetooth it with my laptop and my cell phone. Good sound. I've used my cell phone via auxiliary cords. Sound good. Some songs sound louder than others but that has nothing to do with the speaker. That has to with the quality of the music itself. When I watch stuff on YouTube movies or anything on my laptop it gives it that extra 🔊. Overall I give this little power house speaker a 4.1 out of 5 stars.
4,This little bluetooth speaker is great it's perfect for my small apartment. I was looking to replace an old docking station that was no longer compatible with my iPhone. The battery lasts forever and the sound quality is really good and the volume is substantial. The only thing that I find slightly annoying is the volume dial on the top its a little odd to get used to having to swipe your finger around to adjust the volume rather than a button but now that I'm used to it its alright. Its light portable and just what I was looking for!
5,I want to update my review - I had a couple issues with the first unit I received and I gave the product 3 stars.  I liked the unit but was disappointed in it.  Since my review DOSS contacted me and ask to make it right.  They did by replacing the unit. They wanted to make sure that I was happy with their product.  I have increased my 3 stars to 5 stars because they value their customers to make sure that they are happy. There were no charges - just a new speaker at my door.  They get upgraded to 5 stars because of their customer service and the new speaker works great.  Thank you BOSS
4,The bass on it is amazing but if you turn it all the way up it sounds bad and I had this for a year now and it sounds like the sound has gon down when I first got it I turned it all the way up and it was so loud and clear now it doesn’t sound as loud as before and I have been taking care of it I haven’t dropped this once or anything
4,Sounds great my only issue is that while it's Bluetooth connected there's a subtle whine added to the sound though while it's connected by aux the sound isn't there. Otherwise if it's loud enough it doesn't bother me.
5,The Doss sound box was a great buy. I had gotten another speaker of this type and it was a dismal let down. I'm very pleased with my Doss. It is easy to use has great sound and looks good.
3,I bought this because it was supposed to be 'loud' its not.The volume control you can't tell if it is working or not and doesn't seem to make any difference.Sound Quality is ok but not loud enough
5,Update: I didn't even ask for a new replacement  and I was pleasantly surprised when an amazon box showed up on my porch and I found a new speaker inside! It has been working great!Two stars instead of one because it worked nice when it worked at all. This speaker sounded awesome connected wirelessly to my phone automatically and easily felt like a durable and well made product. I've used a few other name brand Bluetooth speakers like this one. Quality seemed pretty comparable at a much lower price point. Everything about it was great for two months until it stopped charging. I can't turn it on even when it's plugged in. I've tried a different power supply and multiple USB cables. Now it is useless considered garbage.
4,The sound is amazing coming from this box.... and Alexa pairs up quickly with it.  It's only getting 4 stars because when we first paired it up to Alexa the microphone was working and we could talk to her while we were outdoors with the speaker.  Now it's not working like that.  The pause button and the fast forward/reverse buttons ( <<  >> ) work to get her to skip songs but she can't  hear us through the speaker's mic.  I haven't tried unpairing it yet to see if it fixes the problem.
5,So far I like it. It's a very good item despite the low price.
5,Great sound. I use it for my  wall mounted TV which has awful sound. With this I can have it next to my chair with the volume turned down. I have it plugged in to power all of the time so I have ask for the software update to stop  the auto turn off after 15 minutes. Otherwise it will turn off after the TV is off a while.The chat support new nothing  about the update. HmmmmI contacted DOSS Support and they emailed the update to me and I have made the update.The support was the best. Great Support and device.
5,Wasn’t sure at 75 sometimes tech is too hardl. But setup was so easy. Keep on kitchen table for podcasts & I love it!
5,I love this soundbox so much I bought another one for my office at work.  These have great sound and are well made.  They last quite awhile (hours!) on a single charge.  They aren’t made for large areas but are great for music and podcasts audiobooks and entertainment in the yard porch office or any room in the house.
5,These are great little Bluetooth speakers. I bought one for myself to take along in my small camper and it works great keeps a charge for several days and is easy to pack. My niece liked it so I bought one for her birthday. My son tried to trade me for a big speaker he had and I said “nope”. So it was on the daily deal one day and I got one for him as well.We love them they are perfect for what we need.
5,I bought the speaker for my husband. He love to cook out side and love ti listened to music while he cook so I decided to get him a wireless speaker that is loud enough for outside. This speaker is perfect. I love the color red and I love how easy is to connect to our cell phones plus the clearness of the music is really worth Im every penny I spent. I love it and most important my husband is very happy with it.
4,Decent sound turning down the volume swiping counter clockwise doesn’t work. I. An turn the volume up but the functionality to turn it down does not work.  I have to use my phone to turn the volume down otherwise the unit serves its purpose
5,We love it. We bought it to take out on the boat. We were hoping it would be loud enough to hear while fishing. It is and compact.
5,I liked the sound and size of this speaker. Used for a hotel room speaker for background sound.
5,This is a FANTASTIC product. I've had it for over a year and it's as good as it was out of the box. I first used it for my phone but now I'm using it instead of a set of speakers for my PC. It's on my desk and I can feel the bass through the floor. Add that to the fact DOSS will write you custom firmware if you have a complaint (ex. to dim the lights or keep it on all the time when plugged in). The touch buttons on the top work perfectly although the volume wheel takes a little practice.Conclusion: Great sound great price great customer support. I will never understand why it has ANY reviews under four stars.
4,Great sound quality and I like having access to fast forward buttons and volume control.  On the downside it takes this speaker much longer to connect to Bluetooth than others I have and it only successfully connects around 2/3 of the time.  Since the controls are flat into the top they are difficult to use without looking right at the speaker.  The unit is also larger and heavier than I expected.  I would recommend it more as a speaker that is used in one main location rather than truly portable.
4,Sound quality and volume great but took 4-5 tries to pair with blue tooth.  Once paired the speaker retained the blue tooth link to my phone
2,This was a quality speaker which was used in my son's small gym. It worked great for 4 months now nothing. Too late to return for a refund or replacement. I will search for a different brand.
5,Nice quality sound and control.  I like the control panel and ability to skip songs.  My only complaint would be the weight and size.  BUT that’s not a valid complaint as sound and easy of use is awesome.  Stays charged for a long time.  I do recommend this for the value and durability.  We use daily and would buy again!
4,This nice little speaker sounds great! My brother has had both Bose and Sonos speakers in the past and I would say this speaker is easily comparable to those at a fraction of the cost. One small problem is it does tend to get a little stuttery when the battery is low but so far I've used it for hours on end. Love it!
4,I purchased this speaker in September 2017. First impressions were positive and I was satisfied with the purchase. However after three months the charging port will not hold a charge unless the cable is held at a specific angle. On aux mode even the slightest touch of the cable will distort any audio or create an irritating static noise. Based on all the positive reviews I assume I may just have a lemon so I’ve contacted Wonders Tech to address this defect. I have not received a reply as of 1/5/2018.** Replacement received 2/2018
5,I bought this wonderful speaker back in September 2019 in the last week of February 2020 the charging port stopped working. I contacted Doss customer service to make a claim under the 1 yr warranty they were so pleasant to deal with and in about 4 working days I received my replacement unit I have never dealt with anyone as nice and quick as they were! I can say I'm a happy customer!!
5,For what my opinion is worth I am impressed with the sound on this speaker. For $30 it is exactly what I was looking for. I listen to a variety of old rock and blues as well as other stuff and again I personally think the sound and power on this is very good.
4,Update: March 2019After two weeks of use it wouldn't connect but my daughter was able to get it working again so we didn't return it. I'm going to assume it was a glitch because it's worked fine ever since and she's happy with it.I'm hoping that I can give an update review later after we replace this. I bought it for my daughter for Christmas and within two weeks it quit working. It won't allow her to connect.
4,This is a very good speaker for its size and price.  Its better than most small portable bluetooth speakers. Bass treble and mid-range are all clear. I returned two other brands that were not as good. Volume is very good if you are using it indoors. Touch controls with sound volume is a bit imprecise.
2,I connect this device via bluetooth to my phone.  Unfortunately when I am using the device to listen to music etc if a phone call comes in the microphone is terrible.  Everyone complains to me that my voice cuts in and out.  With that in mind I have even tried it by holding it right in front of my face when making or receiving a phone call to talk.  Same issue.  So if you intend to use the bluetooth feature for phone calls the microphone is terrible.The other issue is that even when connected to a device via bluetooth the device will decide to disconnect after some period of time if there is no sound playing.  I guess it is going to sleep or turning off to save battery.  But again if you have it bluetooth connected to your phone and multitasking it will just decide to turn off.For a small sound box the sound quality is better than expected.  So if you are just listening to music and stuff you may still want to consider this device.
5,I got this sound box so I could listen to my music loudly as I clean my room or anywhere around the house. I love it! Its loud enough to hear throughout my apartment. I'm glad I got this instead of a super expensive one. I will invest in a "fancier" one in the future but this one definitely does the job. It's not AS crisp as a Sony or Bose would be but it's pretty darn close for the price. I highly recommend this. I literally just got it like ten minutes ago so I cant tell you much about the battery life yet but it has some charge fresh out of the package.
5,Very happy with this speaker.It is easy to use and sync to my iPhone and other devices.It has a good sound quality it has a quality feel to it.I would recommend this to friends in search of a good speaker for a good price.
5,I wanted something to provide a little more volume for when I played my guitar using my Iphone or Ipad and playing along with the radio/youtube.  This thing pairs up quickly and has great volume and clarity.  It is easy to adjust the volume also.  Very impressive little device.
5,I like to lay in bed and watch YouTube Video's.  I needed a bluetooth speaker.  Bought this product.  Compact little device put out great sound.  It is fantastic listening to music.  I am amazed the distance I can get from the speaker to the smartphone.  I have had it for a week and still have not charged the device.It says keep it away from dust so I put it in a drawer when I am not using it.  I tried to buy a case for it.  I bought Bovke case for it but it smell so offensively I returned it to Amazon.
5,This little box is full of sound. Best Buy ever!!!! So happy with quality. Highly recommended for anyone who loves music 🎶 or audio books.
4,I have the speaker hooked to my Mac. It sits on a stand near my bed. Depending on what I’m watching I have to turn the noise level down pretty far as it can get really loud. For price and size of speaker it is definitely worth the money. I’ve had it for just a few months. I gave it 4 stars because every once in awhile it starts to act up and I have to power it on and off once or twice but nothing major. So far I’m satisfied with the purchase.
5,The sound is very good for such a small speaker. We listen to a lot of jazz on it the sound reproduction is terrific. My wife fell in love with it and it been carrying it around the house from room to room playing music off her smartphone. Would highly recommend.
4,I bought this speaker to use with my old I-pod.  That way I could listen to music as I cook or when sitting outside.  Followed the instructions for set up and it worked perfectly.  Sound quality isn't the best but it's pretty darn good.  Love the top controls for volume and song selection.  Would recommend this product.
1,I bought this speaker hoping it would last a long time but unfortunately almost a year later the quality has gone bad and became muffled and low in volume. I contacted the factory but they're saying that the seller here doesn't give us the warranty. If I knew this beforehand I wouldn't have bothered purchasing this product. This guy's a third party seller. Not worth the hassle in the long run.
5,I got this about a year ago and it still works like a dream. I love it more than any Bluetooth speaker I’ve ever had. Definitely worth the money
5,Easy connectivity great sound and easy controls.
5,The speaker sounds quite well when it works. However it works only at random. Sometimes I spend several minutes trying to turn it on to no avail. Other times even when the blue light is blinking and it seems to be ready for pairing none of my devices can connect to it. All this is very frustrating but I get even more frustrated because I know how good it sounds when it actually works.08/23/2017 update: After leaving the above review Wonders Tech customer support contacted me and offered me a new speaker. The new one does not have the issues of the old one and has been working perfectly. The sound quality is great. So I updated my original rating of 2 stars to 5 stars.
4,I do have one issue with mine where once or twice a day it'll stutter for a few seconds no rhyme or reason I've tested it with multiple devices and it does it with all 3. It's not debilitating but I'd be slow to recommend without telling others about it.But when it does work it's very efficient very quick and sounds pretty good considering. Even with the occasional stutter it's a solid little speaker...but it's not perfect. For me at least.
5,Great product. I didn’t expect it to be good. Love the how small but loud it is. It great when I am in the bathroom taking shower or bath.
5,This speaker is pretty good for the price the best one out of many  i ordered. I wish it would be a little louder but the sound quality is awesome good town of bass too. I have had this for about 3 months and was using it at work the other night and had it sitting in the cab of a locomotive on the control stand had volume at about 75 percent and just from the hard bass it vibrates off the control stand to the floor witch is about 7foot drop and didn't hardly do any damage and still works and functions perfect. So it is also durable. On that note they need a sticker base or a bigger grip pad on the bottom.
5,I'm extremely happy with this speaker!Portable lightweight charges quickly decent battery life easy to set up & connect to. Has user friendly functionality & surprisingly has good strong bass. Clear sound as long as your device isn't too far away. The favorite feature amongst our circle of friends has been that you slide your finger around the blue circle to control the volume!
4,At first it worked fine but about 2 weeks ago the speaker blew out. Now it’s just so much static and can’t be used. Apparently I am no longer able to return it. I have had it for about 6 weeks only. Not worth the money.The company did reach out to me and gave me a list of things to troubleshoot. I tried all of them and it still didn’t work. I let them know and they send me a new one. Great customer service. Thank You!!!!!
5,I haven't tried it outside yet but it really improves on a phone's speakers. Easy to connect ridiculously cheap. Recommended!
5,Love love love this product it’s small enough that you can take it everywhere it has great sound charges easily holds a charge for quite a while makes a small room sound like a theater get one
5,The product arrived earlier then scheduled. I am already in love with it and the speaker carries great sound. It is plenty loud which I like loud.
5,Ordered to use with my Echo Dot.  Was concerned about mixed reviews but found that it works perfectly fine with the Dot after pairing in my Alexa app. Super easy. I plan to keep my speaker plugged in.  So far after a couple of days everything is still working fine and the speaker stays connected so that I can just use the Dot without having to reconnect unless powered off by me.  The sound is fine for me I use it in my bathroom for listening to the radio in the morning when getting ready for work mainly.  I am satisfied with this purchase so far.  Some others who posted comments said it does not work with the Dot but that is not accurate.
4,This arrived quickly and I've had a lot of little portable speakers but this one is tops in my book. It has rich full bass without distortion and I can hear it all thru the house with ease.  I enjoy the functions it has like the fast forward backwards and answering my cell! It's truly an amazing little speaker and I use it outside as well and can hear it from my deck out into the backyard. Get this little guy you'll love it. It even came in a travel bag...BONUS! 😁
4,I will send a better response as soon as I have time to hook it up but it’s what I wanted.
5,I am delighted with this speaker which I bought for use in my small apartment. I was able to easily use the clearly written instructions to use my speaker. The volume works great I had no issues figuring it out. I read on Amazon a couple of reviews that it was not loud enough. These people were obviously expecting it to work in too large an area with too much background noise. I have found it more than loud enough to hear all through my apartment. For such a tiny speaker it has excellent sound quality. I not only use it for music but for audible books and movies from my Kindle  and hook it to the tv . No matter the application it's been delightful.
4,Very surprised that a majority of the reviews were accurate considering the cost. It was perfect for my bathroom while showering
5,This is a great little speaker that packs quite a punch. The sound is great quality and it goes very loud. The Bluetooth connectivity is easy and quick. It’s very portableeasy to carry ( you can order a carrying case for it for about $10). I’m very happy with this purchase and would greatly recommend. P.s. the Red color model is fantastic looking and I would go with that color though you can order from Red Blue Black and Grey.
4,Great speaker for the price basically used around the yard.  I can't complain about anything. battery life is good sound quality is good perfect for my needs.
4,I love the packaging it came in so far no tear brand new love the sound quality cute as a botton  love the answer button  the only thing I having trouble is the fact that I cant listen to my local radio in the speaker even though it came with a jack  I only can hear it on my phone that's the only  bomber. Overall is pretty decent I recommended for the prize is pretty good.
4,Sounds good for 12 watt speaker. wish I had bought 25w unit
5,Fiance loves this and it gets loud enough for him to hear at work.
5,I literally just bought this as a bedroom speaker today.  I must admit surprisingly this stylish speaker packs the perfect punch of bass without overpowering the speaker. This is great considering no blown speakers over here plus it's super cute 😍😍.  The touch interface is works smoothly with just a light touch. I'm in love. It's worth the money. Ive already received a lot of compliments on the sound. Not to mention  Ive already have had friends over and they thought it was a whole sounds system because they could hear it from other rooms in my house. Definitely a recommendation to all especially those that aren't trying to break the bank 🙌🔥
5,I bought the DOSS Touch Wireless Bluetooth V4.0 Portable Speaker because my UE Mobile Boombox was just short of where I needed it to be in terms of loudness.  While sound quality was  about the same when  I compared them side by side the DOSS speaker seemed about 30% to 50% louder than the UE Mobile Boombox (which is really quite a good speaker).  I liked the Circular Touch (as compared to having a knob) volume control.  Just kinda cool.  This speaker  is about 50 % larger and also heavier than the UE Mobile Boombox for me a welcome trade-off for the increased loudness.  Paired with no problem.  My recommendation BUY IT!!!! A great value
4,I didn't get the charging device or charging cable that comes with it this is the third speaker that I ordered the previous ones have their Cable in the Box not this one though
5,This little speaker can not be beat especially for the price. There are even firmware upgrades that will allow you to create a shuffle mode for the micro SD Card. There are other firmware upgrades but this is the only one that mattered to me. By upgrading the firmware and including a microSD Card slot on the speaker I have eliminated the need to carry my mp3 player. My microSD Card is 32 gigs while my mp3 player was only about 8 gigs. This speaker has great sound is portable will play a micro SD card. The speaker is easy to operate with adaptive touch features and well lit icons. Thank you DOSS for a great affordable audio speaker. I highly recommend the DOSS Soundbox for personal use.
3,After about a month of not even daily long or max volume. The speaker now sounds like it's half volume. When at max. never dropped.
5,very good sound and connection also good
4,Just fine bluetooth box. Very little bass which may be normal for a small unit but otherwise pretty good.
5,Sound quality is great for its size. Battery life is good. Easy to set up with Bluetooth. I bought this to use in my 62 Oldsmobile that only has an AM radio so I can play my 50's and 60's music thru my  cellphone. So far seems to work good for what I needed.
5,I enjoy listening to music while I work out but at home I don't want to have my headphones in so I usually play music on my phone but its not loud enough but this little speaker gives me the perfect amount of volume. And I can get through my workout no problem so its perfect for a home gym. And saves up so much space by not having to get a big stereo setup.
5,liked
5,Rich sound. Was looking for a better listening experience than an I-phone speaker and freedom from earbuds. Was very pleased. Learned how to set it up easily and quickly. It can disengage and engage with the Bluetooth signal easily and quickly. It has a long battery life. Lightweight and durable. Great price.
4,Will not hold a charge with less than 1 year of usage and about 2-3 battery cycles. I contacted the manufacturer and they want brook by video ??? I do not recommend it. Buy a more reputable brand.Update: 04/02/18They have reached out personally to me to fix this situation. They sent a replacement speaker that does not have this problem. the original speaker had a faulty USB switch. Every company will eventually have a faulty product or two these guys really stand by their products. Thank you !!
5,En casa o en el auto super ventajoso
5,I needed another Bluetooth speaker and opted for the Doss SoundBox.  Really love this speaker. What sold me the most is the touch controls on top.  Ease of use is a dream!  The speaker is heavy weighted and stable. The sound is HUGE.  Good treble and bass from this. I purchased a 2nd one as well now. I highly recommend this speaker for it's size sound and quality of features.
5,Love how it gets loud and doesn’t messes up!
4,really like this speaker use it in the bathroom bedroom and outside when working on my garden.  Really good battery life and loud for its size.  Not for parties or when around lots of people.
5,Charging port went out. No way to power.  No way to send back or get customer service.  Looks like they may have upgraded since this seems to be a reoccurring problem.  I wouldn’t buy again.
5,I just received my DOSS Touch Wireless Bluetooth speaker this afternoon. It is recommended that you give it a full charge before using it the first time. I did that. Not only is the sound quality excellent but the user interface is highly intuitive. I have other Bluetooth devices and pairing them with a source is always a hassle. The DOSS V4.0 paired with my iPhone immediately and I only hope it does that forever. The bass is deep and there appears to be very little distortion. I'm obviously a happy camper today. Perhaps I should have waited for some time before doing this review but as of this minute I find nothing to complain about. Go ahead and buy it. If you don't like it send it back. I'm keeping mine.
4,Pretty good sound quality and comes with an aux cable and USB charger. Bluetooth connects fine to my phone and can play music for several hours or so until it needs charging. The only issue I have is the beep noise that lets you know the speaker needs to be charged startles the heck out of me but that's just me. I'm surprised by the quality of this speaker for the price as I wanted a decent portable speaker that wasn't way overpriced. I mainly use it around the house to play music from Spotify.
5,The sound quality you hear in the little mini videos does not do this baby justice!!! It does automatically turn itself off if it hasn’t been in use I think it’s 15 minutes. It’s not a loud click at all I don’t hear it half the time when it shuts off. Bought for my IPad. Extremely easy set up. I will buy this brand again!
5,I have tried many Bluetooth speakers most of them sounded muffled the batteries didn't last long  and the range wasn't great. WELL this speakers sound quality is exceptional the battery last forever before a charge and you can control the volume either by the speaker or your phone. I am going to be buying a couple more of these for gifts. My daughter has a an expensive Bluetooth speaker and when put side by side you wouldn't know the difference read the reviews and just see for yourself.
5,We got this to pair with the Echo Dot in our nursery. It's perfect for that purpose. Sound quality is great and it gets far louder without distortion than could possibly be needed. I reached out to the manufacturer for the firmware upgrade in order to prevent the auto-idle shutoff. They responsed right away with the requested software and instructions for loading. However it didn't end up being necessary as it (my unit at least) appears to stay on once paired with the Echo Dot without the firmware upgrade. So it's seamless. As other reviewers have noted the top of the device remains lit when on and it's quite bright. So we'll have to cover that up if baby isn't a fan. No other complaints at all--this is a great value!
4,The battery life lasted from the time I started work till the end of my shift!
4,I honestly like this little speaker. I have a tailgater which is a lot bigger and packs a banging sound. This DOSS has a really nice volume and depending on the song the bass is like a big speaker. If you don’t want to spend a whole lot on a speaker this actually works perfectly.This is my second time buying it because I got water on my black so I ordered a white one jus to switch it up.
4,Great product for the price. I use these speakers every day for hours. Louder than what I anticipated it would be while maintaining audio clarity. Only thing i wish it had was a way to adjust base and treble but it isn’t terrible by any means. Exceeded my expectations.
4,The sound from this speaker fills my kitchen which is what I want. I'm satisfied with the price and the product.
4,I was amazed at the sound quality especially for the price...  The base is deep and the highs and mid range are accurate for such a compact system.  some people complained about the touch dial on the top but I had no problem with it.  The base is deep enough that my wife felt the base vibration at the base of our outside dining table.  The overall volume was better then adequate but not especially loud.  This is why 4 instead of 5 stars.  I would recommend this unit to anyone looking for a small Bluetooth speaker system!
4,The speaker is definitely good quality and has a good solid weight. Not cheap looking like some other portable speakers. It could do w/o the beeping when the battery is low like another reviewer mentioned. But overall a good deal👍
5,Very happy with this transaction so far.  Didn't answer the battery life question since I just received the product and am only using it for one week and it's been used with plug not battery operated so far.  Sound is great and love the look for the price!  It was a great buy :)
2,Other reviews have mentioned the annoying "busy signal" sound the device makes when the battery runs low. Mine periodically does so even when it is plugged in; for the record: I have ONLY had it plugged in. There would be no reason for a battery drain. Sometimes it fixes itself with a reboot or changing the outlet. But now none of those tricks are working. I hope someone reading this knows why this is happening and can offer an assist; otherwise don't bother.
4,Disclaimer: YOU ARE BUYING A $35 WIRELESS SPEAKER DO NOT EXPECT ANYTHING MORE. With that out of the way I am fairly impressed with this speaker. My biggest problem with it is the audio 'ducking' during bass heavy parts. I haven't been able to fix this with EQ settings only by turning it down to 3/4 or so will fix it from what I've found. Very little to no low end but again what do you expect? This is a great speaker for a bathroom bedroom etc. Don't buy this expecting a Play 1 competitor and you will be happy.
5,Perfect for what I wanted. An inconspicuous easy to use wireless speaker for my living room. I got the white one for my white mantle. Out of the box it was actually too loud. I've only used the bluetooth function with my iPhone so far and it sounds fine. Setting it up was very easy. I walked out of line-of-sight about 30' away and still no problem picking up the signal. It's smaller than I expected but feels substantial. It says to fully charge it before use. Only took about an hour and a half. This is not window rattling stereo but for the price well worth it. Now should I bite the bullet and subscribe to a music service?
5,The sound is great and it gets really loud!! It connects very fast and the quality is 10x better than expected! High recommend
3,It won't replace a good set of 2 separate speakers for your sound. Single unit bluetooth sound boxes all suffer from the same muddy sound from consolidating sound channels into one and this is no different. Adjust your expectations accordingly.Also I know a lot of folks who reviewed this were happy with the old iPod like touch controls but when I move the box on my desk half the time I forget they are there and I hit the controls- like moving it to the next track or cutting it altogether. I'm not super thrilled with that.So 3/5 overall for me.
5,The speaker is very sleek and it is compact. The sound quality is very remarkable especially for only a $35 speaker. I would highly recommend this speaker for birthdays or even kids who enjoy listening to music on the go. Even on high volume the sound quality is very crisp and clear. The bass on the speaker is also very good. I can't say enough about this product and I do hope that many people will be able to find this useful for their purchase. As a matter of fact I had a friend compliment my speaker and for his birthday this week I ordered him one and he loves it. I am very pleased wth this speaker and I would buy it again in a heartbeat.
5,Got this to connect to my tablet for my mother to help her hear her virtual church services since she cannot physically attend. My mother has hearing loss and this transmits the sound clearly and with enough volume for her to hear very well. I am extremely pleased with it.
5,my absolute favorite color is pink. i’m a big music fanatic and a good bluetooth speaker is a must. i was on the search for a new one preferably to go with my new pink room decor. i NEVER imagined that i would find a speaker of such amazing quality in bubble gum pink at such an unbelievable price. the controls are even more advanced than my JBL speaker. buy this speaker you won’t regret it!
5,This is a great bluetooth speaker. It has a great sound. I have a large California split home and when turned up it can be heard from a few rooms. My husband is a music producer so he is critical on speakers and sound but this speaker was for me so I didn't care if he liked it because I bought it for me to listen to while in the kitchen until our surround sound is installed. He heard it and said that little speaker has good sound and really "thumps". You can hear the bass in the music and it doesn't rattle. I'm glad I went with this speaker. The only reason I bought it is because the brand was actually my last name so I really lucked up.
5,Considering it's size the sound quality is excellent.  I've had no issues connecting via Bluetooth.  I haven't used it enough to need to recharge it.  I'm very happy with this purchase.  I like mine so much I bought one for my wife!
4,Overall it's a great speaker. I use it for my college dorm and it's a good punch for a smaller speaker than some large sound systems. The only reason I didn't give it 4 or 5 stars is occasionally on higher end songs which have heavy bass I hear static that's not part of the song. It can get annoying if it's your favorite song and the bass is the best part though for songs it's AMAZING. Overall I'd definitely reccommend it for people who listen to lyrics oriented songs more. I've had a UE so I do have some minor bias.
4,I finte received the usb cable for charging. It’s a good speaker.
5,Works well sound quality is good. It paired easily with my phone. Remember to turn off your notifications sounds in your phone or they will keep interrupting your music. For a little more bass sound place the speaker about 1" or 2" from a wall. Great value for the price.
4,Just got it.  Came with a half-charge so I was able to use it right away.  Paired with my Android phone easily sounds very good considering the price.  I have been involved in professional video and audio production for 27 years.  I am a fairly critical listener and I can say this little unit far exceeded my expectations.  Don't get me wrong.  I'm not saying this device produces professional sounding results...what I'm saying is that it sounds really good for the money.  I wouldn't hesitate recommending it.
4,Not thrilled with sound quality. Bass is weak making it sound tinny.
5,UPDATE:We use this speaker at work literally everyday for 14-16 hours nearly everyday I bought this 7 months ago and usually speakers only last us 3-4 even the fancy ones. It just started to finally mess up and sound slightly busted. This is an awesome speaker for the price!!!!Sound is actually really great get super loud. I work in a restaurant and we have no music behind the counter. It gets loud enough to hear over the bustling of business! Easy to use and design is great! Worth the money for sure!
5,The product arrived on time and as described by seller.  The material is sound and of good quality the sound is loud for the size of the speaker and the reception is great. I connected in my living room left the phone downstairs and took the speaker upstairs and there was no static or distortion in the sound.  I cannot certified that the playtime is 12 hours as I did not time how much I used it but I charged it when I received it on a Monday and had to charge it again the following Monday.  I am very satisfied with the speaker no complaints.
5,i am  really sorry i didnt buy this speaker long time ago. great   clear powerfull sound. Much better then just my phone speaker.
4,This was on sale on prime day and is an excellent Bluetooth speaker with long lasting battery life. I have had it for a week and the battery is still going strong. I've used it for probably 6 or 7 hours so far. Sound quality is truly awesome and carries decent bass for its size. Only reason it's not 5 stars is because I sometimes hear the speakers crackle when dialing volume. Not a big deal but worth mentioning. Makes me wonder how long it will last. For what I paid I'm 10 stars satisfied.
5,I really enjoy my new portable speaker.  It is lightweight compact and perfect for my diaper bag.  I am a fitness instructor and sometime the sound systems at the gyms are horrible and this one works so well so I do not have to worry about my music not working.  Who wants to do Zumba without any music???  It also works great in my aqua classes as the sound carries so well over the students splashing.  And added bonus is it came with an auxiliary cord so I can plug the speaker directly into my phone if needed.  Was not expecting that.  Overall very happy with my purchase.
5,My wife loves it. Sounds good battery life seems to be pretty good but battery life will depend on volume during use. Well made.
5,I have spent so much money in the past for Bluetooth speakers just for them to run our of battery life after time and eventually not hold a charge at all.... I bought this speaker because of the price and the battery life is great with a big sounds as well for the price. Highly recommend if you’re just looking for a speaker for the room or bathroom to get ready with some music.
5,This is a great speaker! The price is very reasonable and I love the touchscreen volume button. The sound from this is as loud rich and clear as a much larger and more expensive Bluetooth speaker. Definitely recommend this one.
5,Sits right on my end table so I can position it any direction I like even on the arm of my chair.
5,I own speakers with better sound on the low end but for the price nothing touches this Doss speaker. It's fine for smaller spaces.  I use it in our camper.  I was pleasantly surprised - especially with its looks.  A quality Bluetooth speaker.
5,This is a great little speaker at an excellent price. Has very good sound quality; I can't comment yet on the battery life as it has yet needed to be recharged. This was an excellent purchase for me!
5,Very happy with my purchase. Sound volume and quality exceeded my expectations. This unit is solidly constructed and although small it produces big sound. It's an amazing value. I researched many different speakers and I'm glad the reviews and videos pointed me to the Doss Touch. Would purchase again and highly recommend.If I could change two things ... 1) Wish the default sound level when turned on was either at the highest level (I can always adjust the sound level on my phone or laptop) or perhaps better if it would just remember the last used sound level and resume that level when starting up again.  2) The auto-shut off time is something like 15 minutes of inactivity. Wish this would be extended to an hour.
5,Used it for the first time yesterday. Sound was amazing and I could hear it all over the house even though volume was at 3/4. Bluetooth connected immediately to my phone. Don’t know about battery life yet.
5,I've really enjoyed using this! It's durable easy to connect to phone through Bluetooth can see battery level on Bluetooth display in phone good sound. We use it much of the day ever day.
3,This is a mid level blue tooth speaker that was used 8 hours a day 5 days a week in an office setting.  Never played at full volume.  It stayed plugged in most of it's life.  Yesterday it decided to no longer charge.  The warranty is for one year.  It lasted one year and five months.  Not sure how long I expected it to last but with no moving parts I expected longer.
5,This speaker is AMAZING! It has great volume and its at such a great price. The quality is 10/10 would recommend.
5,I just received it yesterday. So far so good. It does sound clear. I was able to use a wall plug unit that has the usb port on it to plug it up to charge it. My previous blue tooth speaker only lasted for 9 months and I didn't want to take the chance on purchasing the same one and it lasting for less than a year again.  This one is good but the bass isn't as defined as my previous one. But I'm happy with it. I know someone who has this one and has had it for over a year so I was glad to hear that!
4,Couldn't pair the two speakers together
5,I purchased this product looking for an inexpensive blue tooth wireless means of connecting my Alexa Dot so I can have a bigger sound in my living room than the Dot itself.  The devise is a perfect size the sit nicely on top of my center speaker in front of the TV.  The sound is amazing.  Big bold and crisp.  Much better than I imagined.  Was very easy to connect and can move it from room to room.  Operation is extremely simple and it happens to be quite stylish too.  I strongly suggest investing in this unit if you want something well made that won't cost you a big buck.
5,Had one of these for years. Great quality durable never let me down. The whole speaker feels very well built and high quality. Batterey life is excellent i never worry about it. Bluetooth connect works but sometimes you have to try twice no big deal. Highly recommend especially for the price.
5,I took a chance on a lightning-deal to purchase this speaker. I had read reviews about the bass sounding 'tinny' but I didn't find that was the case. I was pleasantly surprised at the clear full sound this small speaker produced. It comes with a soft drawstring bag for storing but I bought the BOVKE for Doss hardshell case for $7 to go with it. I absolutely love this speaker and I'm so glad I bought it!** The only downside to this speaker is that only one phone can be bluetoothed to it at one time. However one of us just disconnects and the other person connects. It's no big deal for us certainly not a dealbreaker.
5,I bought this for my wife for Chtistmas. She loves the red color one and I was impressed by the sound for the cost. Great looking little speaker and functions well. I would recommend it. After a few family members saw they they ordered as well.
5,I bought this in 2018 and have used this at the lake on hikes and everywhere In-between and this has been nothing short of great. Is it the best portable speaker? Probably not. But this is durable loud and easy to connect.
5,It easily connected to my phoneI was accidentally able to test it Waterproof Worthiness by leaving it Out During our recent tropical storm.Still functions Perfectly
5,I purchased one of these because they were cheap.  However I have been surprised by the quality of sound ease of use and battery life.  It was so good I bought a second one.  For the money you can't go wrong with this little unit.  Very solid construction and has worked flawlessly.
5,I bought this for my daughter to use as the sound output for a new vinyl record player. It is a great size had clear sound across a wide spectrum of tones and was simple to connect. She is pleased with it so I am too.
4,The speaker sounds good and looks great.  Like the interface features of the device.  But how ever I can only give it 4 Stars due to the fact it does not work with Echo.  The Device had corrupted the Echo device even took the Voice commands away to where I had to reboot the Echo device.  So If you want a good speaker for the price this is a good box.  If you need one that will work with your Echo device this is not the one.
5,I was contacted by support team and they shipped out a new unit to me.Pretty happy that they reached out to me.The new unit works much better and I'm pretty happy about their customer service support team.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Returning this because there is a lot of background static.Yes the sound it emits from music is good.  It's loud and sounds great.But it also emits this static/buzz/high pitch noise along with the music.  It bothered me greatly to the point that I'm sending the unit back for a refund.I tried it connected it on my Note8 and my sisters iPhone.  Both times there was buzzing/static/high pitching noise in the background.
4,I like the style and light weight but battery wasn't very good and sound was good but wasn't really loud.
5,it won’t make your table shake from bass but it sounds damn good and i charged it once for like 15-20 minutes and i’ve been using it almost every day for hours and it still isn’t dead.
5,I'm hoping that the company reads this review I was very happy with my purchase after I connected it and heard the crisp sound coming from the speakers. But now only a week later I'm expressing utter disappointment the speaker shut off and will not turn on. I have no idea why it was connected via Bluetooth and playing and then it just shy down I charged it until it was fully charged but it's not coming on. And I cannot find how to contact the manufacturer. Just a follow upI got in touch with the manufacturer and they sent me a replacement within 2 days. Havent opened the box yet will let you know how it works. Very pleased with the response.
5,Never knew I needed a bluetooth wireless speaker before last week. In that time I stayed with friends who had one that played music from a phone and visited my family who played music in the back yard. I immediately looked for one and found this one. It is so easy to use and sounds good. I use it with my ipod pandora on my phone and with my internet streaming device when I watch a movie. I keep the speaker close by so I can hear it clearly on the couch. The Doss speaker has a higher wattage rating that others I looked at and it really made a difference. The price was great and I would recommend it to my friends.
5,Really happy with it I got 2 one for my daughter and one for me the sound quality is great no problem with connection battery life is great. .
4,No bluetooth speaker is going to have GREAT sound but this one is very good. I'm very happy with it.
4,I am very happy with this speaker...it is small but the sound is great and it has bass too. For the price it's a good buy.
5,What I like about these speakers are that they are very loud and have pretty good sound quality. The Bluetooth connects really well and the battery life last for reasonable amount of time. I really recommend it
4,This speaker seem to be made of good material it is solid and the sound is ok. For the price you can't go wrong no distortions ranges seem all right it would be nice if it had higher volume available (when you hear that great song) but not possible to crank it up. Perfect for Meditation looks good on the outdoor table and works perfect for background music if the volume could go higher it would be a 5 star. Easy to pair with Android and Apple alike.
5,Every Single person In my family was surprised by the superior quality and performance of the speakerHow such small thing could deliver that much power and most importantly without any sound distortion 🤔I'm extremely happy with my new speakerbox 😍😍THANX DOSS✌🏻THANX AMAZON ✌🏻
5,If you knew how busy I would you would appreciate this review because I don't have time to write them. But this thing is really nice. I travel a lot and my stupid old car doesn't have Bluetooth so I just put this on the dash and play my XM through my phone and have had 12 hour trips with it playing with no interruption. And when I have my Waze going it interrupts the music to give me my directions. You won't regret buying this one.
5,The quality of this speaker is so good. The sound is sooo good and there is really good depth to the sound. The battery life is long and its built sturdy. This is a really good product.The only complaints that I have for this product is that I've had issues connecting to the Bluetooth on occasion and that the speaker's sound level always resets whenever it turns off and I always have to raise it which can sometimes be annoying.Even though I have a few complaints for the speaker I still think that it is a really good purchase. The quality for the price is so good that it makes up for the imperfections and deserves a solid 5 Stars!
5,This Thing Is Sweet!!! I was shocked when I opened it and saw the size. It was about half the size I thought it was going to be. But don't stop there... The sound is fantastic. I love all kinds of music. And this little box makes me smile though the whole gambit. The clarity of mid-range and treble is great. NO it doesn't have a 12 inch bass speaker. Get over it!... What it does have is enough bass to make me feel like I didn't waste my money on a P.O.S. little box with no engineering thought. These guys did a fantastic job of combining good bass in a little form factor. I am going to be very happy with this puppy for a long time.
5,I'm very surprised at the sound quality and the clarity. I could play this all day doing housework I could take it to work and play it all day and the battery still good the next day I don't have to recharge or from Maybe like A-day a couple days later. Very impressed.
4,Wonders Tech sent me a new speaker that DID NOT buzz or have static like the original I received.  I am happy with the purchase.OLD REVIEW Sound quality is NOT good on this unit.  I have played different types of music through both Bluetooth and analog connection; and there is static and distortion at all volume levels.  You will be disappointed with this portable speaker.  I watched several reviews on Youtube and these ARE NOT accurate.  These reviews present that the DOSS unit has good quality sound; it's just not true.
5,Bought this for my husband to use in his UPS truck...it has fallen out of his truck a dozen times bounced off the road and it is still working like the day I bought it. It has been 2 years since I purchased it and he wanted me to  write this review because if the beating it has taken and still keeps on working. Can't beat the price either.
4,i love this speaker i’ve had it for years the only issues are thay the battery doesn’t last that long and you can’t even take your phone into the next room without it breaking up.. but the sound quality is awesome
5,The sound is good and loud when you need it to be. The battery charge has an all day life. It beeps to let you know the battery is getting low which I really like! The controls are very easy to learn and it is an attractive unit besides.I love the unit and for the pricek I think it is a bargain!
5,Great little speaker. I can take it to the pool 5 hours a day for 4 days before recharging.
5,Excellent product! Worked wit easy setup. I use it in my workshop all day without having to charge.
4,I'd give it a 4.5 if I could because it has two small issues. Every time it's turned off it doesn't remember your volume that you last had it at. Also it takes several hours to charge. Other than that it is great. The sound quality is very good and it can get pretty loud especially for its size. Even outdoors it is still loud. It is very durable. It had a 3ft fall onto concrete and all it received was a few scrapes. It still works fine. It holds a charge really well.
5,The sound is surprising for the size of the unit and at what I believe is an excellent value. Bluetooth connectivity is a little slow for me at times but when connected I have zero complaints as I consider this a value buy.
5,See update!!The bass was okay on this device. My biggest complaint is that the speaker skips and pauses randomly. I tried resetting it via the button in the back wiped it down with a dry cloth to ensure that there wasn't any debris and the problem still persists.Update: the company sent me a replacement speaker. I was pleasantly surprised as it was completely unexpected when I came home one day. The speaker is great! No issues so my original one may have just been a defective one. The range of the Bluetooth connection is great. I can have my phone on one floor and my speaker on the next and the connection is still great. I'm very satisfied with my purchase.
2,The speaker sounds good and has good quality if you only want to play music but they built in a very stupid function.  When its in bluetooth it automatically shuts off every 15 mins.  They say it's when not in use but that wasn't my experience.  When I played music it stayed on but I bought it for conference calls on my computer and even though I was either talking or listening to someone else talk on the speaker it would still shut off.  Thats hard enough but it takes a while to come back on so you get cut off mid sentence and everyone is watching you and waiting till it comes back on.  I researched it and there is a way for you to turn it off but you have to buy a 32 gig SD card go to there website and download an update and then push some button sequence which I never did figure out. Their instructions are HORRIBLE.  Iam returning it. It's not worth the hassle.
4,Haven't used it enough yet
5,Paired with a "TaoTronics Bluetooth 4.1 Transmitter" available here at Amazon I now can watch the TV on the opposite wall of the bedroom without having to blast the volume into the hallway and other rooms.The quality of the sound is amazing considering the size of the unit.  The sound is also in perfect sync with lip movement on the TV important to me as I have had some small delays with other devices that made watching a rather disconcerting experience.With the capability for internal battery recharge I have it permanently plugged into a wall adapter for USB power so the only thing I have to turn on is the TV and the transmitter double-stick taped to the front corner.
4,I am changing my review because the company personally reached out to me and gave me a working device.  The first one I ordered didnt work at all the company then called me and replaced the device free of charge.  Its a nice little speaker for the price.
5,Haven’t tried to max out the volume. Sounds great in my garage which is exactly what I wanted. Decent bass and mid range sound. Haven’t heard any distortion at all.  Paired easily with the phone you’ll need a separate USB brick if you plan on charging it on an standard 3 prong outlet but those are too easy to find to really be a knock against this product. I would buy again or as a gift.
3,Ended up returning this as the one I was looking to replace still had a better sound quality.  Good value for the price but not exactly what I was looking for.
5,I love this thing. I can be cleaning outside and listening to my beautiful amazing Bolivian 🎼🎼 sound very clear and loud.!! It came on time..👏🏻🙌🏻
5,I initially had a few bluetooth issues which were resolved with a firmware update sent to me by the customer service center. The agent was amazing and went above and beyond to serve me. I am a customer for life. For anyone interested I have a Samsung Galaxy S8.
5,Very loud for its size and easy to use. Battery life is superb as well very pleased with it overall. Update: it has held up for a year including a few drops and falls. I have bought a second one which is just as great!
4,It's great for the price I pay.  The sound quality is great though the volume isn't quite impressive it does its job amplifying three times the sound of your cell phone.  The weight is quite light for the size which is a plus considering other portable speakers...
3,There’s good and bad: the speaker is easy to setup and control. Bluetooth pairing was quick and painless. It’s plenty loud. The downside is significant: sound quality is mediocre and would best be described as a little “muddy.” Really lacks high end response and was not crisp at all. YMMV perhaps but I was disappointed. Wish I’d bought another Anker Soundsource which is a decent little speaker.
5,This is the second soundbox touch I have bought. The 1st one still works great. This one is on my desk at work and gets used nearly everyday. The sound quality is crisp and clean. The battery lasts almost all week. The speaker connects easily. Pairing is very easy. I would strongly recommend this speaker.
5,Good quality speaker. Bluetooth connection is good only occasional issues if I get too far away from the speaker with my phone. The aux jack works well also. I've had this guy for over 2 years and haven't had any issues. I can connect to my laptop my cell phone and even to my old iPod. Batteries life is also good. I charge every few weeks or so. I do not use mine on a daily basis or for long periods of time so keep that in mind.
5,I’ve had a few weeks and love it so far!  Connected via Bluetooth right away sound quality is good.  I use mostly in the kitchen and take outside on the patio.
5,I love these. I bought one and just love it. Later bought one for each of my two sons on their birthdays.Would be nice if you the light was dimmer or could be adjusted. I can walk in the dark with it as a light though. Only an issue if use in the dark.Cons: I use with an SD Card loaded with music. You can only Rewind Forward or Pause songs with an SD Card. Can't tell it to start over again or nothing short of Rewind Forward that I found. I still love. Just need to buy smaller memory cards and load by preference of the day.
5,I have been using this product for 3 years plus . I have 2 of them. I can tell you this beats all thie marshals  jbl  bose whatever hands down in price quality and customer service. I had a defective unit that I used for six months. One email to the customer service and i got a outright earranty replacement. So my advice to you audio connoiseurs out there save the extra bucks on those jbl and bose and get one of these. Just for info i am just an independent every day user no assiciation with this company.
2,I tried to like this speaker which I got as a replacement for an Amazon speaker that was discontinued. It has a nice shape and solidity but the bass is weak so it's not good for music. It may be okay for podcasts or Zoom meetings. It also has irritating alert sounds: a high-pitched beep when you reach top volume and an annoying phone-like sound when the charge is running low. The flat finger-touch volume circle on the top is also not very responsive.  I had to buy a different speaker because I got really tired of this one.
4,Given the price it's ok.
5,I'm very happy with my DOSS Soundbox.  An additional perk is that I can answer the phone with a touch which comes in handy when cooking.
5,I use this on the shelf above the bed using meditative/sleep music. The battery life is great for this but I usually set a 2-3 hour timer and the DOSS SoundBox will shut off automatically minutes later. I'm not a bass person but sometimes lows can be distorted because you have to turn up the volume from the device usually around 60-75%. Otherwise music is very enjoyable! Connecting to two devices is fine but of course not at the same time. It's a solid buy!
4,Overall good speaker. Looks nice. Plays very loud which is good. I have now had speaker for 2 months. Battery life is like 6 to 7 hours. Still not bad. My only complaint is that it takes so much power. Charging takes like 4 hours..  Just to I try it out i charged speaker with 20000mah power bank. It sucked all the juice in like 2hours. Had to finish charging in the wall.
5,Good for the price. I love it. Gets pretty loud. The volume sensor is kind of annoying to use at first but it works fine.
5,This was a Christmas gift for my husband. It is now May and the unit is still going strong. My husband uses it to stream music and videos but not the card slot yet. The sound is excellent for a speaker at this price. You can hear it well indoors or outdoors. The unit pairs by holding the on/off button on the speak after turning the Bluetooth mode "on" in his computer (tablet etc.). The controls aren't super sensitive (which can be either a positive or negative depending on what you need). The size is nice because it fits anywhere. He has no complaints with it so far and really likes it.
4,Bought this speaker in February and it worked great for a while. It’s November and it’s not charging anymore. Bought a new cable still not charging! However it’s December now and the seller sent me a new one and it came with new cable. I tried it and it works great! I’m pretty happy with the seller’s action and the fact that he sent me a new one thank you so much! It sounds great too. I’m happy Merry Christmas!Update: it’s September the 29 and my speaker still works great👍🏻👍🏻
5,My phone
5,This box worked great out of the box. I have had it for several months (didn't get to review earlier). It is still working as it did when I first got it. Excellent battery life. Great connectivity. Good sound quality. I've pictured it beside an AC remote to give an idea of the size. It fits perfectly in my handbag.
5,This unit replaces my older Bluetooth speaker that had exhausted its useful life. Sound is great and it pairs seamlessly with my Xfinity tv. My old speaker had lots of connection problems with the tv but this one connects as soon as I turn it on. Controls are simple and easy to operate.
4,This is a pretty decent speaker for it being a lower price. I like the portability and the sound quality. The only thing that is wrong with it is that sometimes the speakers just 'pop' every now and again while playing a podcast or music on it. The charge is pretty good on it too. I get at least a few days of charge for moderate use.
3,I have had mine for a year.It was a great investment at first.Now it is very annoying.The battery life isn't good.It starts to play songs half way through then skip to the next song.I realized it was because it needed to be charged.I will charge it but now even on the charger it still skips.The quality is low now not a vibrant sound.I will be investing in a better quality speaker.It is good for about a year after that not so much.
4,I love this product! The sound quality is excellent and it has a great range.  It sometimes turns off by itself but can be quickly turned on.  Setup was extremely easy too.
5,This packs a lot into a small box.  If you need laptop speakers and don't want to spend a bunch of money this is perfect.  I love it because it allows me to listen to music at a nice volume even if I'm not right in front of the computer.  Pretty good bass too.I'm a huge fan of Creative Labs so it took a lot for me to order something different.  It's not as great as CL but I'm still impressed and a steal for the money.
5,Great little speaker and sounds amazing!  I was skeptical how a little 13W speaker would sound but there is a richness to the overall sound.  You can hear the bass well and there is a really good balance to the sound.  This is a very good deal for this Bluetooth speaker.The convenience of not having to plug it in is great and the battery life so far seems really good and the size perfect for taking it with you sticking it in your bag etc.Overall I would recommend this speaker to anyone looking for a wireless speaker for their device.  I'm very fussy with how my music sounds and this speaker is great!
3,Bought to use for my work this fall. It seems like it has good bass and definitely gets louder than my current Anker Soundcore which is exactly what I was looking for. It's about the same size as 3 big ice cream sandwiches stacked together. I am giving it three stars because it will shut off too quickly if no sound is playing through it and then I have to reconnect- which is a hassle if I'm not near it. It should have a constant ON setting.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I'll update in a few weeks! But my initial reaction is WOW. For the price the sound is great. The base is not bad either. I can feel it on the floor from where i was standing.Only "con" when you reach max volume the music pauses for like 2-3 seconds meanwhile the speakers will play a tune to let you know max volume. Why cant the tune play over the music?
4,I use it to connect to my AppleTV so I don’t disturb the family at night while the sleep. It’s hefty keeps a charge for a long time and can pause and adjust etc on the system. Very happy with this choice.
5,Bought this speaker back in august 2017 and it’s still just as reliable as it was then. It’s been through so many falls and vacations I can’t believe it took me this long to write this. For the price you get way more than what you pay for. It’s tough has good base and amazing sound.
5,This Bluetooth radio is great. The sound is good and the battery lasts for days. If not in use it will shut off after 5 minutes which is a nice feature. I bought 2 of these on prime day figuring I couldn't go wrong with the special price. I since purchased one more for a friend and he's happy with his. He uses his radio out on the shop floor and he can hear his music over the machines. Another friend bought hers after seeing mine for the poolside. The radio comes with a waterproofed pouch. Another nice little extra. She said the Connection with the Bluetooth reaches from her house where the phone is to the pool and the radio.I would definitely recommend it and have.
5,I love this speaker it’s the only one I use now
4,First off the speaker looks high quality and it looks great in white too. For the size of the speaker the sound is potent and full. The bass is good and the music is also pretty clear so you get your money's worth out of it.
5,This speaker is fantastic. I love it. The sound quality is pretty good to fill a room no real bass but good quality sound. Easy to take phone calls and callers said they could hear me fine (felt weird talking through a speaker though). The controls are very easy and light up so you can use speaker easily if it is dark. My only complaint is that the buttons are easy to press accidentally if you are carrying the speaker but it hasn’t really bothered me. Pairing is a breeze with my iphone 7 ipad and iMac. Cannot use 2 of these speakers at once though.
5,I got this speaker during the “Deal of the Day” and it has been one of my best buy from Amazon. The quality and sound is clear sharpe and can get very loud. The box is compact with a nice shape and glowing lights during functioning. I found it really easy to use right out the box. Wish I had bought more at the time but will need to get two more.
5,I thought I wrote a review for this product so I'll write another one.  This little speaker packs a punch.  it's almost as good as the small bose speaker I have.  the battery so far has lasted a while.  i'm still running on my first charge.  it came charged already.  it always connects to Bluetooth as soon as i power it up.  i am very happy with this speaker.
5,I bought this for my wife for Christmas since she wanted a wireless speaker for her kindle to play music while working around the house. I chose this one since it promised power and 12 hrs. of playtime at 50% volume. I'm impressed. This little speaker threw out enough sound to scare the cats under the couch! The quality of the sound is impressive without any buzz when the deep bass cuts in. I'm planning to get one for my laptop for when I watch movies on it. My only beef with it is that the only way to charge it is off a laptop or other device unless you have the wall adapter for the usb cord. Luckily the Kindle charger works fine.
5,I bought this for my husband bc he likes using a speaker when talking on his cell phone. He absolutely loves it.
4,I like this speaker!! I can't tell if it's louder then my last one or not!! But it holds up well yes I've dropped it a couple of times & it's fine still looks & works the same!! My son whose a teenager says it's definitely loud enough...Is that because it is really loud or just because he doesn't want me to turn up my 80's music any louder?? Hard to say!! But I like it!!
5,I ordered this speaker because I don't have one in my new place and wanted something cheap but effective. Reviews are excellent so I decided to take a leap of faith: I'm not disappointed at all; quite the opposite actually. Great sound loud and crisp (as loud and crisp as you could expect from a $30 Bluetooth speaker). It's small and practical but it packs a punch. Lights up with a pretty cool white/blue interface and it's extremely easy to use. Battery life goes from 9-12 hours which is actually impressive. I've also tried it with phone calls and it does work like a charm. Basically if you want a speaker for your parties/reunions or even just for yourself this thing surely does the trick and it's $30.
5,I bought this to listen to music in my office and it works perfectly. I read that there was a firmware version that stops the unit from timing out when there is no music and so I sent an email to the manufacturer. They responded back within hours with a firmware version that keeps the unit on regardless if there is music playing. I then asked them for a version that does not make any event sounds when I turn it off on or connect it to Bluetooth device and again within hours they provided a firmware version that did this. I am very happy with the device and the support from the manufacturer and would recommend this product.
3,I don't really like this speaker.  it barely has any bass so the sound is superficial.  My iphone 11 has richer sound.  plus it arbitrarily disconnects from the bluetooth. and it looks delicate I'm afraid that it will break the first time it falls. If i'm still within my return window it's going to go back.
5,Nothing I dislike
4,I purchased this on sale for 29.99 and got exactly what I paid for a 30 dollar portable speaker.  I plugged my old ipod in and listened to music while painting.  It seems to hold a charge for quite a long time and warns you when it is time to recharge.  I doubt that an audiophile would rave about this speaker but for a regular Joe in a one room environment it works perfectly.  Great for painting as it does not need a power cord and you can put it practically anywhere.
5,Worth the money great battery life
5,Sound clarity is great for the size of the speaker. Bluetooth makes it so convenient to use.
5,build quality good.  simplicity of use good.  sound quality as good as i can hope for in this price range and size... bass depends on surface you place it on and what is behind it and is actually surprisingly bass-y in a good placement.  if you are thinking "but i want really good bass regardless of where i put it" then you need to look at bigger and more expensive speakers.  i knew i was shopping for about this size speaker and price range number of reviews pointed to this having one of the best overall sound quality and best bass response.
5,I bought the blue version of this on a lightning deal and waited until I got it before ordering this one. I really like the way the volume is controlled by a simple touch on the top. I bought this one for my mom and I wanted the controls to be easy to access and use. She doesn't always have her glasses on so multi use controls aren't good for her. The volume wheel lights up when she touches it so she knows what she's touching.The sound is surprisingly good too. We listen to audio books almost as often as we listen to music and the sound on this is good for both. this is not as common as you would think either.
4,i bought this for a cheep alternative to my echo dot speaker (very poor for music). this speaker is plenty loud enough but has week lows bass is very week. for the price and ease of hook up it works well and sounds satisfactory. we use it in kitchen dining area so not needed for " quality sound"
4,Very good speaker for the money. No complaints on quality of sound. One bad thing is when battery is getting low the "phone off the hook" sound is very annoying. This happens when the battery life is at 20%. Otherwise good purchase.
3,It does the job for just being a little speaker in my house but the sound quality is poor.  Almost like it's muffled.  A little disappointing but I'm only using it around the house so it's decent for the price.
5,I absolutely love this little guy! Perfect size to go anywhere (sits on my window in the kitchen) seemless connectivity.  I love to listen to audible books on it. Great sound quality. Travels easy for music outside. Still on the 1st charge and I've done atleast 15 sound hours.
5,This speaker is AWESOME and aesthetically pleasing too. Definitely worth the buy. It’s super cheap especially when you compare it to more expensive brands like beats. My brother has one and I don’t think the sound quality between the two is is different that is pay an additional $300 plus dollars. I’ve had my first Doss speaker for three years now and it still works great. I bought two more for friends and family and they love em as much as I do. If you’re reading this definitely try it out!!!
5,Great sound for such a small speaker ! Very easy to connect via Bluetooth. ( I have an LG V30 phone). Also comes with a 3.5 MM cable to connect non Bluetooth devices. (See photo) I use it in the gazebo on my deck so I can't comment about how it holds up to the elements. Perfect for my needs.
4,Works great as expected
5,The size and ease of connection is perfect! The color is also very vibrant and just as I'd hoped. The only downside is would say is that the volume is lower. You can turn it up but for an outdoor area it doesn't go super loud. Good for indoor home use!
5,This was a really great little speaker for the money (my "real" speakers are B&W) but it conked out after 2.5 months. Will not hold a charge and will not even work when plugged directly into an electrical outlet. My return window has passed so I guess I'm going to have to buy another speaker. I probably won't give this brand another chance though.Update: I am amending my earlier review to reflect a 5 star rating.. When I contacted DOSS customer service they diagnosed a hardware problem with my speaker - which was still under warranty - and within about 48 hours I had received a replacement. The new one is working great.
5,12/27/28 We have been searching for a Bluetooth speaker for a while and saw this one on sales. we just got the speaker today. The sounds are awesome especially for the price we have paid for. Looks and sound great. You can still hear it very clear from a far distance if you blast the volume. Overall it is a good product for the price. We are using it as a regular speaker nothing extravagant.Not 100% sure about the battery life as we just got it today. I assume the battery should last based on what it is advertised. If not will edit my review.
3,Sadly after emailing back and forth with them they won't replace the speaker since it past the 1 year mark. The bluetooth module got messed up and the speaker stays on all the time all while trying to pair. It makes all these noises in the middle of the night and I have no way in turning it off as the reset and on/off button don't do nothing. I loved this speaker but then for it to act all weird like that it sucks. I won't get a replacement or purchase a new one neither because I paid $19.99 for it and now it's almost $30
5,Sound is great. Good Volume. Used indoors outdoors and sporting events.Would like to have another to link up.
5,I bought this on Amazon Day and it was a great deal but I was not sure how it sounded and waited anxiously for it to arrive so I could see if it lived up to the reviews. It was way more than I hope for. The sound is great and I can crank up the volume and not lose any quality. Since I am older I don't listen to too much heavy rock and roll but the songs I played were incredible and filled the entire first level of my home let alone the 2 story family room. I also took a phone call while I was setting it up and the quality was great. This is one of the best values I have purchased on Amazon.
5,I've had this for almost two weeks.  It's a great little speaker to pare with my Echo Dot.  The Dot speaker is not the worst but not great.  I wanted something with a touch more base not tinny.  Great deal for $25 price jumped to $35 a day later.  How lucky could I be?  Works well plugged into my obsolete mp3 player or using Bluetooth with my Dot.  Moved it out to the back porch with the Dot indoors didn't miss a beat.  I'm impressed so far!  Charger is just a micro usb to standard usb cable so needs a pc to re-charge but I havent had to do that yet.
5,Just received this speaker and it sounds great! It was easily connected to my bluetooth devices. I purchased this for my office and it looks perfect it's sleek design fits in with the rest of my office decor. Cant comment on battery life just yet as only had it for a few days but I do like that when it's connected to my phone it tells me how much battery life is left.
4,I love this speaker! I bought it initially for a music festival and figured I'd probably be pretty useless after but it made it through the festival and has been amazing. Battery life is out of this world literally I forget the last time I charged it and It's going strong still. The sound it wonderful for the size and you can actually understand people when talking through Bluetooth connected to a phone. It's stylish and gets the job done well. Buy the speaker!
5,love this speaker works great
5,This little speaker is great for what I purchased it for!!! Great sound!!! Nice& clear even on the highest volume!! I love it!!!
5,The speaker is great to take wherever. However how can you tell when it’s charging/charged because there is no light showing where it’s supposed to under the charging port? I plugged it in when it was both on and off and still no light. So how will I know it’s charged?
3,Funny all these people reviewing this must be used to some pretty poor audio.  Or perhaps I'm missing something.I was rather disappointed with the device.  Despite the weight -- which would speak to the construction of the speakers -- it's all treble.  There's virtually no bass response (connected to an Echo Dot).  I expected more based on reviews and the heft of the device.**UPDATE August 2nd: The seller actually called me -- yes called me and left a message -- about doing a warranty replacement of the speaker.  I would add one star for that kind of effort on their part if the person for whom this was purchased as a gift didn't listen to the message before I did!  A word of advice: EMAIL PEOPLE!  It's more private certainly less creepy (how did you get my telephone number?) and you don't broadcast the purchase to anybody who has access to the answering machine.
5,This little unit has great sound. I was really surprised!
5,I wanted a Bluetooth speaker to aid in watching Youtube videos because my old Macbook speakers are shot.  I also thought of streaming radio while in the shower.  It works perfectly doing both.  I don't keep the speaker in the bath.  I carry it in and out.  So I don't test its water reststence.  For the price it's hard to see how this could be beat.
2,I can't get more than about 10 to 12 feet from the speaker before the Bluetooth connection starts messing up. I have tried it with multiple devices and same result. I'm ok with the sound and battery life but being stuck next to a "wireless" speaker is a deal breaker.
5,Arrived today charged it paired it and pure awesomeness started pouring out of this little box. I am picky about the sound my speakers produce but a professional ear I don't have. This little speaker has increased my Echo Dot experience 100%. I was a little iffy setting up the bluetooth for connecting the speaker because I was not sure what the tones were indicating but it paired very quickly. The small speakers produce rich full sound with a ton of volume. I haven't cranked it all the way up because there has been no need to blow out my eardrums as of yet. The price is right and the speaker is awesome. Worth the money. Nice work Doss.
4,I listen to podcasts while I work so this works like a charm. If you want to listen to music however you have to be pretty generous with what sort of quality you expect or need because music gets pretty tinny easily through this speaker. It also has a little rattle at times. This is great for simple audio like podcasts or for outdoor settings but for any kind of halfway decent music experience you'll need to upgrade...as I plan to. Battery life is pretty good too.
5,I love the little speaker. Easy to use and very convenient to use. We camp and I took it outside and worked great.
5,I purchased this speaker to listen to things while i am sleeping.  The unit does light up and stay lite while playing so I have had to place it where light will not interrupt my sleep.
4,Pretty bad experience with this speaker. The charger port had a rattling sound when the volume was turned all the way up and now it won't connect via Bluetooth or auxiliary cord. Used it for about one month.Update: even though return window expired I was really surprised to receive in the main a new speaker I didn't even inquire about getting a new one. A pleasant surprise! I haven't tried it yet but I think that was pretty great on there part.New speaker has been working great thus far!
4,For how inexpensive this it it sounds great!  I use it in my office at work and it blocks out the sound of my phones ringing so that's not too bad.  Listen to a variety of music and nothing has sounded bad yet.  The only annoying thing is that I have to repeatedly manually connect my phone to it. There's probably something I can do to fix that but I haven't bothered yet.  Going to get another for my kitchen at home.
5,Really like this speaker. I'm an over the road driver and while I like to watch movies on my tablet  the sound left much to be desired. No more problems thanks to this speaker i can set it up and habe great sounds while watching movies or tv shows. Would highly recommend this speaker hopefully I can get home and load my music collection on SD card to have music to listen to at stops.
5,I just recieved this today but want to dispel some ideas on what comes with this speaker.  1) simple instruction manual but more on the website. 2) The Unit itself. 3) double ended cord for plugging unit into en earphone jack or other compatible  device. 4) USB cord for charging. 5) waterproof cover.  Charge it up when you first get it pair it with your bluetooth device sit back and enjoy.  At first I thought it had no volume but my iPhone volume was down.  This unit has volume and also a lot of bass for a small unit.  I would buy it again and recommend it to friends.
5,I live in a dorm that’s why the desk looks like that lol but the sound quality is amazing and I love the sleek design ‼️ It came with 90% battery out the box. You can use it while it’s charging.
4,After using for several days I found several pros and cons:Pro: Easy to use. Long last battery and the design is nice.  I also love the sound and bass.Cons: Unable to turn off the button light.  It is very bright in the dark and there is no way to adjust the brightness.  It only allows only 1 bluetooth connection (you may find it in the description). I have to turn off another connection in one phone before using on others.Verdict: I am strongly recommend this product for its price.
5,oooomg i love this powerful thing. I bought another product like this only a round shaped smaller one and I had to buy again because it wouldn't charge. I bought cheap and bought twice! I should have seen this product earlier It's sleek classy and just awesome the sound packs good sound especially in the home i am not sure about outside for parties. I love the phone connection. The pink color is just fab! Couldn't wait to fully charge it so not sure about battery life but I am sure it will play when plugged in.
4,Great sound but shuts off so quickly if not in use. Still looking to see if I can reset this issue
5,Very good
5,So impressed with the sound quality for the price! Very easy to connect to your phone and the battery life is great!
5,I’ve ordered two of these and I absolutely love them. One I’ve had for over 2 years the other for about a year.  They connect easily the sound and quality is great and the battery lasts forever and they charge quickly. I live in Hawai’i next to the ocean and have brought them to the beach used them in the bathroom while showering and while they’re not waterproof they’ve handled well in a humid area.
5,I had no problem connecting this both wired or wireless.  I got it because I want to reduce the amount of wireless transmissions going on around me and use it in the car so I don't have to bother with a wired headset.  It would be nice if the speaker would have a display of what "mode" it's in instead of my having to fish around to figure out which one it's on or whether something's not connected.  But otherwise it works like a charm.
5,To be honest quality of this product went beyond my expectations. Decent sound quality and great battery life. Connects to my iphone 11 without any problems and range is pretty good. It can get quite loud when it is needed with its 2 X 6W speakers.
5,This speaker is not what I thought it was but that was my fault. I should have paid more attention to the description. Even though I got it wrong it is still a great speaker. It had good sound and the charge lasts a long time. It sounds as good as my big speakers.
5,I've been looking at speakers for awhile and when I looked at the reviews for DOSS I decided to purchase it. When I received it functioned well but not after a week it started to automatically skip while still in play and eventually the light signs were flashing too. Therefore I got in contact with the company regarding the defect and they were willing to exchange it for another exact one. After the exchange the one I have now has been great so far for the last 2 months and a half
4,The battery life on this speaker is great if you're using Bluetooth it'll last about 12 hours. If you're using aux it lasted me about 17-19 hours which was awesome. My only wish is that it got a bit louder but for the most part I don't have to turn it up all the way. Also it's a great size easy to carry in one hand and the controls are easy to use
5,Excellent unit for the price. Good range great battery life and connects easily to my apple devices.
3,Was expecting it to be louder at 10 watts compared to my old 3 watts BT speaker.  Bass at a full volume sounds distorted depending on the song.  I raised  my rating to 3 stars because I suspect my phone had something to do with the bad sound quality I was first hearing.  After a few phone updates the sound quality is up to par now.  If i could give it another half star I would but my disappointment is keeping me from giving it a 4 star review.UpdateFinally got around to using it for my intended use.  It is definitely loud enough although the sound quality is really not that good.  It does not get drowned out by all the noise in even the loudest areas of my workspaces.  If I was not so lazy I would return it and try my luck with another product.  My 3 star review stands as is.  Loud enough with the sound quality lacking although passable.
5,Great speaker easy to connect and has good sound. A bargain for the price.
5,This stereo is very disappointing. Stops my music changes the song battery dies quickly and takes very long to charge.Update: After receiving a replacement I now realized that the first soundbox must have been defected. The replacement sounds a lot better does not randomly change my songs and the battery lasts for about 7 hours in my personal opinion. Also the volume is mirrored from my phone. The defected soundbox required me to manually trace my finger over the center to max the volume very time I turned it on. Then turn the volume up on my phone. I am really loving this replacement and as so I have changed my initial 2 stars to 5 stars.
4,Loud enough to play outside but my only complaint would be how the volume controls are not an actual button. The whole finger in a circle thing is just a little over the top.Sounds good for the price and would buy again if volume actually had buttons.And lastly people stop complaining about the sound. Look what you paid for it. If you want crystal clear high mid and low range then stop being cheap and cough up some extra money. Don't give bad reviews just because you purchased a Daewoo but expected a Porche.
5,I received the product SUPER fast. I love the sound clarity & depth of sound. It does NOT have a lot of bass which makes me happy; I don’t like too much bass. Easy to connect to cell phone.  I got the white speaker & it blends in so nicely. I cannot speak to battery life just got it. This is exactly what I wanted & saved me a lot of money over other speakers I considered. Good sound at a great price is a win win!
4,I love the sound of the speaker and the features available however I keep experiencing a problem with maintaining constant Bluetooth connectivity.... it will quit playing (at least audibly) then start back up.  I use  Rhapsody from my desktop computer and it is not a  matter of distance because the problem persists from 5 ft. to 15'.  Very frustrating!  If anyone has any idea(s) of what the problem might be PLEASE advise.  I've double checked my computer Bluetooth settings all good.
4,All in all I am happy with my purchase. Gets pretty loud for an economical speaker. At its loudest the bass gets scratchy hence the four stars. Played at normal levels sound quality is superb. When plugged into the T.V.  it adds a surround sound affect and sound quality is actually better than my TVs. All in all its a great product at a great price. I definitely recommend.
4,I finally got it in today and its only been a couple of hours but... it's a strong little box. I love the bass and the clear sound. So far I'm very impressed and absolutely happy with my purchase. I love how sleek it is.Update: It can be annoying how often it powers off but I do think it's also a good feature so if you were to leave the room or your mobile device stops playing music it can save power by shutting for automatically.
5,A wonderful product.- Very affordable price great value for the money- User friendly easy to use "speaks" to you when pairing or changing modes- Great rich sound bass is very reasonable for such a small speaker- Great looks / style (I got the black version)- Can play both via bluetooth (e.g. from your smart-phone or tablet) or memory card (optional can be plugged in in the back)- Nice touch volume control- Long battery life on each charge (many hours) but can leave it plugged to USB chargerI find the memory card (purchased separately) mode the most convenient: just copy your favorite music to a TF card and you can play standalone (no smart phone necessary) for many hours.
5,I received & starting using this DOSS Wireless Bluetooth Portable speaker on 06/01/17.  In the short period of time in use it appears to be everything one could want in a speaker of this type.  The sound is superb and the design is most attractive.  One minor critique.....the position of the LED  charging light makes it difficult to see as it is located directly underneath the cord when plugged into the charging port.  This speaker has performed flawlessly so far. It turns on & connects to Bluetooth with a short musical tone instead of a recorded voice and I especially like the auto shut off after 15-minutes without audio input.  My limited time of use notwithstanding I am highly pleased with this product.
5,I use this speaker when I'm at work. It projects fairly well over the loud noise and has made my typically 12 hour days go by much faster. The battery usually lasts most of the day as well.
5,Awesome buy for the price! I even went back and bought 3 more. Great speaker for a bedroom or living room sounds clear and loud. Haven’t tried it outside yet but I mainly bought it for indoors. I recommend this speaker for a teens bedroom or college room. Great Xmas gift price is good quality of materials is strong and sturdy. Not cheaply made. Only downside is you only get a small usb cord to change it. But other than that. Great buy.
4,First song I played sounded pretty great. Next one on my playlist was quieter so you can definitely hear the little static sound that some people talk about in the reviews. It also came with a mark on the front? I ordered the white one so it’s a pretty obvious grayish mark on the mesh part of the speaker. It’s pretty great for the price. Easy set up good sound just a few small things I’d change but for the price it’s nice.
4,This really is a great little speaker. The sound is good and it hooks up quickly.  I've used it when camping driving and in the office.  It's easily portable and doesn't take up much space at all.The one drawback is the volume control.  The blue circle is the touch pad for the volume and you need to draw a circle one way or another to control it.  It's not that user friendly and would have been *much* easier to just put a plus and minus touch pad.
4,Really wanted to give it four stars but the speaker phone use is poor and unfortunately this is one of the reasons why I purchased it.  Everything else about this little portable is a gem.  Clear clean sound with nice bass it belies the price and delivers audio like a high priced portable.  The waterproof bag is also a plus for outside use.  I decided to keep it because the sound for music is great and I like taking out on the patio with me especially for the price.
5,This is a very nice portable speaker.  Having tried a bunch of them the thing that stands out most is the top notch sound quality - sound from the DOSS Soundbox is very very clear.  Absolute volume is not as high as some other similar speakers but it more than makes up for that in sound clarity which is on par or better than far more expensive units.  Aesthetics are also very pleasing: the unit looks sleek and controlling the volume etc. using the blue ring on top feels "futuristic."  It also takes a micro SD card so you can play music without network connectivity.  Awesome unit all around.
5,We purchased the sound box to watch and listen to baseball & basketball games on our phone in combination with a projector. The sound is great for our purposes. We haven't used it to listen to music so can't speak to that.
1,I bought this speaker to use for background noise in my home office. The sound is not that powerful. The the connectivity is garbage. The speaker disconnects from my MacBook Air automatically and shuts off if you stop playing anything. So if I turn off music for a work call to play again I have to go over to where it is placed (another shelf away from my work station) to manually turn the speaker back on and wait for it to connect.So I contacted DOSS customer service and they provided a file to upgrade the speaker firmware. TOTAL FAILURE! The firmware updated and now the speaker only connects for 1-2 seconds then completely disconnects from Bluetooth. Basically it is a brick now.The level of hassle for this speaker is not worth it.Do not buy.
5,I purchased one before and loved it and let my boss borrow it. She liked it so much that I purchased another one to give to her for her birthday. Good quality and excellent price!
4,I purchased these speakers and after a few months had an issue with it charging. The company reached out to me and promptly replaced the item which I appreciated. It's a very small unit and is handy to take wherever needed. While you are not going to get booming output for the size and price the sound is decent and works well for a small area like one room. The bluetooth connected quickly and easily; it's so nice to have no wires connected or have to worry about a plug.
5,I've had my Doss soundbox for about a year.I use it nearly every day.It can drown out even the loudest of my children is easy to use the battery lasts days without needing to be recharged and the bass is pretty impressive.Definately worth the money. It's my favorite out of all my bluetooth speakers
5,This speaker is super portable has a nice color user friendly interface and has a clear sound. I am legally deaf and struggle to enjoy music so I was curious how well I would hear this tiny speaker. This speaker is sitting about 6 inches from me and I can hear it pretty well. My husband says it is REALLY loud but to me it just sounds good and clear. We received it yesterday and it took about 6 hours plugged into our laptop to be fully charged. Only problem we are having is the Bluetooth will not connect to the laptop only my phone so far. Not sure why that is. Besides that seems to be a good little speaker for the money.
4,If you need a bluetooth speaker for a small get-together or outdoor party this is a solid choice.  The sound will not blow you away or anything but it is clear and adjustable.  Product is well made.  If you need a speaker for larger gatherings or a dance party go bigger.  For smaller affairs this is a great choice in the 'under $30' category.  Recommended.
5,For what I paid for this speaker I thought it was going to be good enough for just listening to music hear and there. I was completely surprised at the quality when I had received it. First off it is a lot heavier then I expected and the full surround sound that it has is remarkable for the price. I will definitely be purchasing more products in the future from this company. One negative that I can live with is that if the speaker is about 30 feet from my Dot it sometimes plays the song broken up for the first five seconds but then is flawless. It's wireless so I just moved it a little closer and have no problems now!
5,When I purchased this on Black Friday for $30 I thought it would be fairly decent it has good reviews so it couldn't hurt. When I received the product and powered it up I was pleasantly surprised with the the audio quality. Yes... it is still a small and portable sound system. So the sound is not going to produce the same sound as something with a larger speaker. That said boy does this thing make good use of what is has. I'd buy it if it were twice the price. Lastly it is beyond simple to set up power it on and the device will audibly say "paired" within 5 seconds and you are ready to rock and roll. Thanks for reading!
5,Loud for the price. I like it
5,Works great.  Satisfying sound . Easy to operate and convenient size.  I love this speaker!
5,Se conecta fácil la calidad de sonido parece bien por precio.
5,Picked this one for a couple of reasons. It's red matches my tablet so that's cool. Company called Doss That's my name so that's cool got my name on it. It has Bass or as much bass as you can expect from something this size and price. Controls are simple and intuitive and pretty neat too.I like the ring for volume. This puts out more then enough for use in the shower hear it just fine over water and fan and can even go louder if needed. Haven't had a chance to wear the battery out yet. It charges fast and holds just fine. Will be getting another soon... hope they have yellow.
5,I live in a one bedroom and can hear it throughout my entire home. It’s definitely worth the money. The battery life is amazing. Days go by between charges and I’m easily connected to it 42% of the day.
3,This speaker is fine for listening to your favorite podcasts or audio books but I wouldn’t recommend it for music listening. The sound quality is mediocre.
5,This is the best little speaker! The sound is great and gets loud! Easy to connect to via Bluetooth and I’ve honestly charged it once and I’ve had it for a couple of weeks I don’t use it everyday but battery life seems to be good so far!
5,Perfect little boom box. Easy to take on the go. Connects easy to my Bluetooth. Sound is decent better than most in this price range but not super loud bass. Overall I am happy with it and it looks nice.
3,I HAVE 4 PORTABLE SPEAKERS WHICH I USE AT HOME AND WORK. (THIS DOSS A TRIBIT XSOUND GO A UE BOOM2 AN OONZ ANGLE) THEY ARE ALL OK. THE SOUND IS GOOD AND LOUD ENOUGH THEY CONNECT EASILY. MY FAVORITE IS THE TRIBIT AS I HAVE NOT ONCE HAD A PROBLEM WITH IT. MY LEAST FAVORITE IS THE UE BOOM 2  BECAUSE THE SOFTWARE STOPPED WORKING WITH MY DESKTOP AND ULTIMATE EARS DID NOT FIX THIS PROBLEM OR OFFER UPGRADED SOFTWARE/DRIVERS OR WHATEVER WAS NEEDED. THIS DOSS IS MY SECOND LEAST FAVORITE. AND THAT IS BECAUSE IT SEEMS MUCH HEAVIER THAN THE OTHERS WHICH MAKES IT INCONVENIENT TO CARRY AROUND. OTHERWISE IT IS FINE.
5,started making a long beep sound every 4-5 minutes- tried it on different devices- different locations- sound still persists! now it shuts off on it's own-when it worked it was greatmy fault that it worked fine for a week -then I didn't need to use for 3 months- that's when the trouble started- window for return or contact seller has passedI have contacted the company for support help- will update review when & if it is fixed.--ok- need to take it all back- evidently my box was missing a charging cord---contacted company- they shipped IMMEDIATELY! could not be happier with the support & communication of the company for this product
5,I am not a prolific reviewer I trashed a seller of ceramic drink coasters a few years ago - silk-screened a round image onto a blank at a canted angle 4x. That said this review is offered in support of the Doss sound bar. It is clear in tone and remarkably powerful. I have two home and work and a third was bought a gift. So there.
5,I didn't know if this was going to be a good BT speaker but let me tell y'all I will rebuy when this one goes out bc it is so awesome!  Wish it came in purple!Updated review on 6/12/17  BT speakers is still sounding wonderful!  Hope manufacturer does eventually make available in a range of colors including my favorite PURPLE!I HAVE HAD TO RESET MY SPEAKER ONCE OR TWICE BUT I USE IT A LOT EVERYDAY IT ALMOST PLAYS CONTINUALLY if I had let's say a Bose BT to compare this to I so would I even believe this would equal the sound but considering I will probably never own a Bose  [LoL] we will never know how it holds up/compares.
4,I absolutely loved this speaker! The sound quality is great compact and easy to pair. However the sound could be way louder.One problem I did start noticing that drove me crazy is that whenever it’s getting low on battery it skips or pauses songs within the first minute of them playing. This is one of the main reasons I stopped using it. I used it for a good amount of time though! Very durable just wish it wouldn’t skip my songs...
5,This is my second Doss Sound Box. We love the product and now use it at our lake house and home.
4,We really enjoyed this until it spontaneously blew up and caught fire in my kitchen.The Doss customer service contacted me promptly and made good on their product!! I appreciate what they did!!
4,This little speaker is awsome. It suprised the hell out of me by how loud it is. But not just loud. It has good bass. I use mine on my bike an love it. Only thing bad I can say is at loud volume it cuts back when there's alot of beat. You can actually hear it get louder then lower. But I only noticed this with hip hop music. Bottom line I'd buy this again an again because it works so well
3,Sounds awesome for the price. Very good for music.The only problem i have is that when im listening to podcasts it sounds like the first word of every sentence is cut in half or you cant hear it at all. Kind of like its struggling pick up the signal. Non of my other bluetooth devices have this problem. Its a bit nerve racking for podcasts but for music its awesome 👌
1,I should have saved my money and got a more expensive one this one sounds like crap. I guess you get what you pay for. Disappointed
1,This speaker has a mind of its own. It will not connect to my devices but randomly turns on and off on its own. No matter how long you hold down the power button it always powers right back up. One night it was downstairs and came to life connected to my phone which was playing a video suddenly blasting. It was right below an air duct which sent the blaring noise up through the vents scaring the bejeezus out of all of us. I was moving at the time and never got a chance to return it. I forgot about it for two years and found it the other day. After charging it it is now turning on and off every 10 seconds. 10/10 do not recommend this creepy speaker.
4,It sounds great and works great with my phone.  Can use it to talk on the phone and works better there on the speaker.
5,I was looking for a inexpensive Wireless Bluetooth speaker that I could use in several situations.  After reading online about several I selected the DOSS  Wireless Bluetooth speaker over others.  I am happy with my choice and in the time that I have had it I have found that it is sturdy responsive easy to charge and easy to use.  Its sound is better than I had expected from a wireless speaker this size.  I would recommend to anyone who is looking for an economical wireless speaker to give serious consideration to the DOSS Wireless Bluetooth V.40 Portable Speaker.
3,I was unable to connect the bluetooth. I couldnt follow the directions of dowloading the app and installing it... It just didnt work or I didnt have the app available.I'm not using the bluetooh everything else works great! I've had this item for 3 years already.On the third year the quality of the sound decreased. Volume doesnt increase much. It doesnt make much difference between my cellphone alone and with this speaker
5,I place it on my mantel and then play music through it from my iPad using Bluetooth. The sound is very good as though it is from a more expensive speaker. I think it is well worth the purchase. .
2,Don't like the volume button oops no button.  Have to use your finger to rotate the circle on top.  Does not work well.  It's more for bluetooth that mp3.
4,On the opposite ends of the spectrum. From the E-GO to the Sound Box DOSS delivers sound quality in style. Almost 10000 reviews it doesn't suck. In one of the most competitive product markets. Unless you want to take the time and money to find the one that might be right for you. This is a good place to start. The speaker can cause interference. My aging amp was buzzing never done that before. Moved the Sound Box everything's ok.
4,So far I'm impressed with this little blue tooth speaker. The sound is great and loud. I gave it 4 stars only because I haven't had it very long and I'm hoping it last without any problems
4,El sonido de los parlantes no son muy nítidos.... el resto bien
3,El producto tiene un muy buen diseño y la batería dura más de 12h excelente en ese aspecto.Sin embargo la calidad de sonido al máxímo no es tan buena y no tiene una buena salida de los tonos bajos (que es lo que más esperaba) el resto está excelente. se vincula fácil y sin problemas
5,This is a very good speaker for the money. I’m impressed.
5,I searched for a speaker for days reading reviews and compare and finally bought this one. I was skeptical but when it came I IMMEDIATELY feel in love. The look is amazingthe sound quality is mind blowing for it to be so littlethe battery life is so longyou can touch to turn the volume up and down. Plus IT IS SO CUTEEEEEEEEEE Love the color💕💕💕💕💕💕💕  I WILL Be Buying More
5,Got this originally as a replacement for another speaker that didn't work as well. This did not disappoint. My son uses this at college and he loves it. He only has to charge it once every 2 weeks and that's when used fairly often. The depth that the speakers can get is great and the little micro-sd slot in the back is a great feature. It connects well and has a good range. The volume control is such that he can put it on 100% and then control it with his phone volume. 50-80% with that is usually loud enough and full blast is very loud. In summary this is worth the purchase.
3,Sound quality was generally good great battery life and had no connection issues but one huge downside is when you're listening to spoken words; podcasts books on tape etc the sound hitches like it's powering off when voices pause. It's pretty loud and very annoying so much so that I ended up just using my phone's speakers until I finally bought a different speaker.
4,Not sure why the unit has dents on the face other than it was packaged this way.  For the price it is a great unit.  Not sure it is worth the hassle to return and exchange ... but it you are going to go through the steps of making the outside look so amazing should follow through to the product.
5,I bought this just until I could put in a different radio in my car and wow was I surprised that it exceeded my expectations.  Now I don’t feel pressured to mess with another radio.  It doesn’t go far but I don’t need it for that:).
5,I am old school .. This was my First experince with any Wireless speaker or Blue tooth device ..  It was better Than I Hoped for .. Take your time and follow the directions and anyone should be able to used it .. Trust Me .lol
5,Great product! The sound is amazing!! The battery life is good but it could be a little better. Towards the end of the battery life the music gets interrupted with a beep indicating it’s about to die. To me it’s annoyingly because I would just rather it play music until it dies
5,I really like this speaker! Sound quality is great and the volume seems to be plenty loud especially with the phone's volume all the way up. I like the circular touch pad in the center for adjusting the volume; super convenient and reminiscent of the old iPod. It seems well-made and sturdy enough and the size is perfect to fit into my purse and bring it wherever. The weird voice that announces when the speaker is turned on/off is pretty odd but it doesn't really bother me I guess. I haven't played around with it too much yet so there might be a way to turn that off that I'm just not aware of. Overall I'm super pleased with my decision to purchase this speaker.
5,Been using it for a few months now. Battery lasts a very long time between charges and sounds great for the price.
5,This speaker is small but pretty powerful. The volume goes up loud enough for me to listen to audio books despite loud home noises e.g. a microwave running sink water and noisy people.It’s small which I like see my pictures. Like my comment if this is helpful
5,Absolutely love the range and sound this box puts out! Very easy controls and switching sources is super easy as well.
5,I have had this speaker for about a year now and I never once have had any issues with it! It’s so good and the sound quality is great! I definitely recommend this speaker!
5,I like the product. It’s really cool.
3,This has a annoying feature ..... it automatically turns off every 15 min. It tells in the instructions  how to disable this but it requires you to download a fix on USB card then download it on speaker. I did get download info but I'm not a tech person so will probably have to get someone to help me do this. I know it's a battery saving feature but very annoying.
5,really pleasantly surprised by this speaker.Pros:1. Connects easily and never has a connection problem as long as my phone is within a reasonable range2. Great battery life3. Loud enough and sound quality is pretty good for the price(I'm not an audiophile though)4. Very pretty to look at5. Uses the volume control on the phone or the device itselfCons:1. Not waterproof2. Could be a tad louderThat being said I have used this while camping at aid stations for races and just around the house and I'm very happy with my purchase so far. I've had it for about 2 months now.
5,I’ve given my Doss Soundbox 5 stars all the way around!  I charged it for the first time today. Didn’t take long for the little green light to appear. The sound is rich and full for such a small thing and the price was amazing. I love the portability. I’ll be using it mainly in my bathroom but I’ll find many places to use it. I love it!
5,Overall: after much research for an inexpensive speaker to take on trips decided on the DOSS.  the speaker is slightly larger that i anticipated but the sound is amazing for the price.Sound: the mid and high tones are extremely clear but as can be expected the bass is adequate for a portable of that size. however the volume level is surprising loud with little distortion.Other Impressions: controls are ok but can be "miss pressed" when handling.  nice battery strength around 12 hours.  only negative; the instructional "voice" is a loud male voice which can be annoying. (only wish- "water resistant" like others)Conclusion: A great value!  I have a Bose Soundlink for home but take the DOSS bluetooth anywhere-everywhere.
5,I have purchased two of these great speakers. I use it with my Samsung Tablet SM-T813 the sounds is remarkable for the size. I brought it on our annual vacation trip and my brother was amazed with the sounds as well. When I got home I bought one for my brother as well. Great base excellent clarity for such a small unit. I was having trouble with it but it was my fault. The speaker was making a noise like a phone on call waiting about every 30 seconds. I finally thought maybe it is running low on battery which is was. So if yours makes this noise it just needs to be charged again. Great speaker!!
5,The speaker sounds amazing. I purchased two other speakers in the same price range and and with similar features and options this one was by far the best. I sent the other two back due to muffled noise delay and overall poor quality when it came to the sound. This thing appears to have Superior build quality and so far so good on the sound... I have only had it a few days but have used it quite a bit in that short period of time and I cannot stress how good this thing sounds... Good bass good highs good surround and stereo effects... Very impressed and I hope this thing lasts for a while
5,I order many things from Amazon and generally I am happy with them all.  Being a regular happy customer I do not get online just to write reviews on all the items. However when I turned this speaker on and the first thing I said outloud to my husband was "Holy Smokes!" I felt I should leave a review. The volume and quality out of this little speaker was amazing. I had to turn it down. And the price was great! It paired with my phone quickly.  I cannot speak of the battery life yet because I haven't gotten that far.  From what I heard though I am extremely happy with this product!
5,Bought this because I wanted something small to travel with and not to expensive if I were to forget it.  I absolutely  love this little speaker.  It puts out great sound and it was very easy to connect to my phone.  If I had a reason I would buy another one.
5,Bought this for my office at work. Works great!
5,The speaker has a great sound and it is easy to operate. But when I am listening to Amazon Music it skips several of my playlist selections. Very annoying as you are unable to listen a song until the end.UPDATED - 04/28/2019Great seller and great product.  The product I received at first was defective and the seller contacted me for a replacement. The second product functions perfectly and the attention to the costumer was unbelievably fast and effective. I'd by anything from these guys again. Thank you so much for your kind treatment! Keep it up!!!
4,Works pretty good!It would have 5 stars if you could use/charge it  via AC adapter since many applications don't need portability. Using  USB is a clumsy pain for something that is going to sit in one place most of the time (unlike a cell phone).A mute button or function would be great.The method of increasing/decreasing volume by moving your finger around the big circle is just plain dumb.  Plus/minus symbols on the keypad or a rocker switch would work far better for us mentally/digitally challenged folks.
4,I enjoy the deep bass and sound quality that this speaker provides. However recently when I plugged it in to charge it hasn’t been recognizing that it’s charging. It keeps making that annoying “low battery” sound however it works perfectly fine besides that. How do I fix this? I love this speaker but it’s getting annoying whenever I’m trying to listen to music on it!
5,WOW! Definitely a great product in the market right now I connect easily from my phone and it’s LOUD
5,Tengo varios meses usándola de vez en cuando y es muy buena el sonido no es nada extraordinario fuera de lo común por su precio pero es buena! La recomiendo.
5,It's a great speaker and definitely serves it's purpose for what I need it for.
4,All in all this seems to be a good little speaker.....It appears to be well constructed and has a nice rich sound....It was easy to set up via bluetooth and the volume ring is a cool touch.....One note I was disturbed to find that it did NOT come with a wall outlet adapter for plugging the USB cable into for charging...Not sure if this was an oversight or it just doesn't come with one....Purchased this to use with Echo Dot so its for home use and that's how it needs to be charged....
5,Connects every time no issues. Good sound. I'm pleased with this product.
5,Great
5,Sound quality is great blue tooth gets sycned without any problems battery life is long too!
5,Buy it.
5,i love this dossbox which has enhanced my music listening experience in such a positive way. i love that i am able to touch the circle to change the volume subtly or fast. i absolutely recommend this product as the bluetooth connectivity works great!
4,It’s pretty functional and it serves my purpose I haven’t used it much seems to be recommendable!
4,This does not have volume control except the volume you can use from the source.  Soooo- I was just notified by the company that you need to run your finger over the top circle clockwise to turn volume up and counterclockwise to turn volume down.  Hallelujah!  My family and I tried everything and couldnt figure that one out.  Therefore I highly suggest they include written instructions.  Otherwise this cannot be rated a 5 star product.  How many others have this item and don't know they can adjust the volume???
5,This product does exactly what I needed it to. If I go too far away with my phone is does affect the bluetooth but that is okay. It is perfect for when I'm cleaning house and do not want to wear earbuds.
5,Compact but big sound!
5,Perfect little Bluetooth speaker. Sound quality is good easy to connect and set up overall great purchase very satisfied!
5,I use this mostly when I am taking one of my cars that does have sirius radio.  I can  Bluetooth it from my phone and bam I am still in.  The only problem I see compared to the other one I have is when I move it around my had seems to touch one of the buttons that is flush to the front panel and I have to either unpause or turn it back on.  But that is just operater error.
5,The connection doesn’t go far and I haven’t had a reason to use anything but the Bluetooth function. The sound quality is awesome. The microphone sucks and may as well not be there. But the look and sound are awesome. Battery life is great too. I enjoy it for what I purchased it for.
5,It entertains everyone in a swimming pool here
4,It quickly connects to my iPhone and sound quality is good for the price.
4,It took me about a week to really like this speaker. The first couple days it skipped and cut out when streaming music from my Kindle Fire which was making me bonkers. I was actually going to return it but kept on reconnecting and pairing until it finally got "used to" the Bluetooth from my Kindle. Now it works great! And it' can get LOUD. A bit too much bass at higher levels and not as balanced sounding but at a medium-loud level it sounds great.
5,Hahahahaha !!! I really do enjoy this speaker!!! It has a quality sound unique size for the desk area to work around on. Just an amazing thing to have if I say so myself 🙂!
5,This bluetooth I connected to my TV. it paired up in a snap. the speakers are great! it does have a millisecond delay.  Works great I can set the speaker right in front of me in the Kitchen at the dinning room table or next to my chair in the living room.  I also purchased 3 more for family members to pair up to their phones. Great Price too.
5,Great little Bluetooth speaker. Connects super fast and very easily. Sound quality is great. Very good volume for the size. I like it so much that I’m going to buy another just to keep in the bathroom.
4,Love this little sucker it fills my whole room with sound - only fault I have found is that when it shuts off and I go to resync it to my Chromebook I have to go to my Bluetooth manage devices page delete DOSS SoundBox off there and go through find devices all over again every time. I haven't synced this device with anything else so it might just be a little problem between it and my Chromebook. Other than that nitpick I'm happy with it and glad I picked it out.
5,this was just what i was looking for. A portable speaker that is loud enough to jam out to but not large and cumbersome. Easy to use and hook up to lots of different devices. Great sound quality. Only draw back is the distance the device goes from the speaker greatly effects the connectivity. You can not go more then 10ft away before it gets a bit choppy
5,Excellent speaker for its size and price. Well constructed and sharp looking. Paired immediately with my smart phone. Also has an aux in and a micro SD slot which is a real plus and decision maker for me. I loaded a 8GB micro SD card with music instead of running the battery down on my smart phone. Other brands that I looked at did not have a micro SD slot. This little speaker is really amazing....it sounds great has nice volume  long battery life and a real cool touch control panel on top. As of now the only con I have is not buying it sooner. Another plus is the excellent customer support from DOSS.
5,I love my Soundbox! It sounds great for the price! The only thing is that it takes several hours to charge up before it should be used. Otherwise great product. Will probably buy one for a friend as a gift.
4,Product ( https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CQOV3YO/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0 ) has an excellent sound  battery lasts longer than competitors. It gets a little bit confused when connected to a device and a second device which it is also paired to is turned on. The top on the box is very sensitive to touching. When carried from one place to another the user has to be careful in avoiding a part of your hand to touch the top (it will either stop the song or move to the next one}.
5,It is a great addition to my office.
5,Other bluetooth speakers have given me a fit trying to connect but this one worked on the first try. Sound quality is not super-fabulous but reasonably crisp. I'm using mostly for podcasts and lectures and the volume control  is terrific -- my previous speaker only used the tablet audio control and it was really inadequate.
5,I love my DOSS speaker !!!I am already planning on buying another one.Best blue tooth speaker i have ever bought. Its very clear and loud just the way i like it.l cant believe how great it sounds.  I played Strangle Hold by Ted Nugget and i am pretty sure the whole apartment building heard it with me.  It wasnt in the top reviews. But i am sure it will be soon. You wont regret buying this speaker . Also connects so easy.
4,For certain apps it will turn off while you watch a show and also will not stay on if using it while on a phone call.
4,The USB port eventually gets loose and not longer get charge thas a problem because the speaker is really good but if is not chargeable not longer can be use
4,Update: Wonders Tech was very responsive to my concerns with this product. They sent me a replacement unit promptly and free of charge. I use this speaker when I watch movies on my home entertainment projector. The sound is crisp and loud. Surprisingly good for a small relatively inexpensive speaker!Original review: The sound quality was decent while they lasted... unfortunately I’ve only been using them for 3 months and they’ve already blown out after very rarely using them at full volume.
5,For 30 bucks you can't find a better looking or quality speaker! And this speaker is loud it can fill our small apartment no problem. Bass isn't great but if you're looking for great bass go spend 100+ somewhere else. The only downfall to these speakers is that the subs rattle a little at certain frequencies I don't know if that's normal or maybe mine came a little loose but regardless these are great and easy to use. The default pairing voice is a little annoying as well but apparently you can get that removed with some firmware that Doss support can provide. Thank you Doss for the quality and Amazon for the fast shipping that got delivered on a Sunday.
5,Great quality! Easy to connect and long battery life
3,Overall this wasn't a bad purchase. The main issue I had with the speaker was the sound quality. Some days it worked fine and sounded clear others it would be extremely muffled/static sounding or barely managed to play sound at all. Aside from that it worked fine for me. Connected with no issues to my phone and laptop the battery life was pretty impressive in comparison to other portable speakers I've owned. Will not be purchasing my replacement from here though.
5,I love my new Bluetooth portable speaker! My car unfortunately does not have Bluetooth an auxiliary port or a good enough antenna for picking up AM radio stations which I used to tune in to for sports talk radio in my previou car. So this is primarily where I'll be using my DOSS wireless speaker in my car on the go. Just as previous reviewers have written the speaker puts out a nice amount of bass and even more impressive is the clarity (mids) when listening to podcasts on YouTube etc. Overall I'm very impressed and satisfied with my purchase and I'll likely be buying a few more of these for family members some time in the near future :)
4,I really like the product quality sound (for the size of the speaker) and the physical appearance is very good. It is a well made product. Customer service the best. I asked for a software update and received it within a couple of hours. I would suggest that a couple of things be changed 1 eliminate the voice response 2 Reduce the intensity of the leds on the control surface they are way too bright even during the day. They are so bright they almost illuminate the room at night
4,I love the speaker but when I hold down the button to turn it off it turns off & then the light flickers on & off. And then sometimes it turns off but then turns on by itself minutes later even when no one is connected to it. Giving me a really hard time 😪
5,Love this! It’s been super nice to have in my office! It has great sound and literally lasted all day! Not sure how far it stretches for Bluetooth but did well across the office!
5,This was a great purchase for the cost.  The music is clear and the battery life is great!!!  I use this indoors and outdoors at the pool and I love it.  I also purchased the travel cover and it is great as well!
4,Sound is just ok.  Haven’t used enough to gauge battery life yet.
4,Im a street performer that uses this for backing tracks. Its loud in the subway but out side you have a hearing range of about 10 feet if your in a busy/ place like times square. Id say its range is much louder in your backyard. Even louder in the house. Perfect if this is going to be a personal speaker you use for workouts. Like basketball workouts at the park or chilling at the park.
4,*update!!Loved this speaker when I first got it. Had it only 6 months and the speaker is already blown and completely static.After writing my first review I was contacted by customer service and sent a new speaker since mine was still under warranty. Excellent customer service!!
5,Beautiful  sound. Beautiful  price.Won't be Disappointed!!!!
5,This speaker is absolutely amazing. It gets so loud for something so small. The sound is so clear. I needed a small portable yet loud enough speaker for my trip to Mexico and this exceeded my expectations. I love it!
5,I love this small easily transportable speaker. This is my second one. I dropped the first many many times. Not a problem with the speaker. You should see what I do to my computers. SMH
5,This was absolutely perfect for my laptop. Everything about it is perfect.
5,This is an amazing speaker with an amazing priceIv been using this for 2 years and it falls like every day and I use it nearly 24/7 and it last me 3-4 days finally after 2 years of amazing experience it fell and something broke it still works just not perfectly
5,Got this to play music in my office at work and I love it. Syncs to your phone easily sounds great and lasted almost 5 full days playing about 9 hours a day (I think because the volume wasn't super high)
4,Great value for money this little speaker sounds like it costs much more! Was easy to connect with my android phone charges quickly. My only complaint is that it makes an annoying beep every few minutes when the battery is low.
3,my car currently has no radio (because of a weird situation where it's locked/ thief proof) so i use this in my car. It has great sound however i noticed a decrease in quality of the speaker itself over time. after a while the speaker began to switch songs when it got to a certain percentage of battery left. I noticed this more and more as time went on however its so bad now that when it gets to 80% it skips every song at a certain point. And even with the aux it wont change the song but it will switch modes and do things like lower and change the volume. kind of frustrating but i guess you do get what you pay for. I can't really listen to music for more than 40 minutes now without having to charge it after that because then it'll skip my songs or stop playing anything entirely.
5,I bought this for a gift and had it mailed directly to my baby sister.  She just turned 14 and LOVES to sing and dance so I wanted her to be able to take music with her!  She loved it and loved the color!  It's fun for young teens yet still sophisticated in design and function.I haven't used this product myself but she was able to get this speaker working in no time without issues so it's definitely user friendly.  I've gotten nothing but raving reviews from my baby sister at how much she enjoys it.  She couldn't tell me enough that she loved it! :)If she recommends it I recommend it! :)
5,After testing over 5 bluetooth speakers in this price bracket I am glad to announce I have finally found the best one!Sound is crisp bass is decently good (although it could be a tiny bit better).In the pictures you cant really tell but the interface looks very clean and the sound ring really sets it a part from the rest.I have it hooked up to my Echo 24/7 and play music straight for hours (I have it plugged in charging at all times).I recommend this for anyone for anyone with Amazon Echo/Echo Dot or someone who simply wants an overall good speaker with crisp clean sound.
5,Works great! Love the music quality. It’s pretty easy to connect and play. Battery life is good too.
4,When the speaker came the instructions said to charge it first and when charging the LED charging light will be red until it's fully charged and then it will go green. I plugged in the charger however the charging light did not go on. The speaker is not charging and therefore useless. DOSS said that this isn't usual however I have since read other reviews that say the same thing.UPDATE:::: DOSS sent me a new speaker the following day. New Speaker works perfectly fine. Very happy!!!!!
5,I have another bluetooth speaker (Anker soundcore-(it's a very good speaker)) but this DOSS has better quality sound. It's bigger than Anker and heavier too. I think is a good option to have a micro-SD slot. About controls are very easy to use and colors blue and white are terrific.This speaker has enought volume to "fill" a large room without sound distortion (compared with the Anker soundcore it has a little more max volume).I am afraid about battery because I wonder is not as fantastic as Anker soundcore maybe because his brilliant lights and his caracteristics sounds when connected and desconnected.Definitely I recommend this speaker because his price and quality.
4,Love it so far.  Sound quality & volume are great. "Waterproof" travel bag is not really waterPROOF maybe water resistant; bag closes by a drawstring that does not create a water tight seal at all.Have not tested the battery duration yet but no reason to doubt it.An odd feature that isn't a necessarily a negative or a positive (or could be depending on your preference & love of Star Trek) is that I swear the voice when the speaker turns on is George Takei
5,The sound is excellent! I like the volume control. Connects easily to my phone's Bluetooth and even has a bit of range from my phone. I like that it has some weight to it. Works just was well plugging in an audio jack. The battery life is great! Lasts for several hours.
5,The speaker is great. I use it in my treatment room at the spa I work at and it stays charged for most of the week. The sounds quality is great.
4,Nice design and pretty decent sound. Worth the price. The only real complaint I have about the speaker is the touch dial at the top. It isn't always responsive and I've had to sometimes frantically rub my finger around the top over and over to get the music to turn down. Full disclosure:  two weeks after I purchased this speaker I was gifted an expensive UE Boom bluetooth speaker. Needless to say I don't use this DOSS speaker any longer.
5,Outstanding. It's a steal for the price. It plays loud I don't know how loud because it was to loud. The sound is amazing for it's size. It was so easy to mate that it was already synced before I knew it. The battery life seems to be what they say. It hasn't run out yet. I think it's a deal. I have not found anything disagreeable about it yet. And no they didn't give it to me and I don't very often write reviews I usually just ignore requests. I Just thought for the money it's good for people who are watching their money. I Hope you have as good an experience with it as I did. kj
5,Bought this for work in a physician office setting. The sound can be turned down easily but can still be heard well.Battery life is good usually lasts through a shift. Easily plugged into computer to charge. You'll need adapter for wall charging.
4,**Revising my review on account of finding out the issue I had was due to Spotify. Great speaker overall! Connects fine with all my devices has a surprising amount of volume for the size (although it does get a little treble-y at higher volumes on occasion). I would say this speaker generally works best with laptops or desktops as I do have issues with my phone sometimes which may be due to my Android software. And as I said last time fantastic battery life.
5,This speaker is awesome. We use it primarily in our truck because we live in a rural area without radio stations and our truck doesn't have connections for our phones. We are able to hear music or audio books while on the highway. The bluetooth range is about 50 ft and will keep connected through walls about 15 ft. Keeps a charge throughout the Minnesota winter and rarely needs to be charged. If I needed a second bluetooth speaker I'd order a another without a second thought.
5,This older model works really well There are two small speakers in the unit which allows for stereo sound. There is an updated model with lights that I have not tried but this one works great.
5,My wife and I are retired and enjoy using Alexa to listen to music at dinner or for a specific song now and then.  This little speaker works great and is very user friendly.  The bass response surprised me for something so small and portable.  For it's size it is a fabulous device.  We use it often and it has given us a lot of enjoyment!
5,This Bluetooth speaker fulfills our needs. At first I wasn’t sure about the sound quality.  As I continued to use it  I heard the quality of the sound and it is great.  I have a few devices I can use with it so I need to be sure to turn the Bluetooth setting off on those devices I am not linking.  Rather humorous to discover that after a few minutes of frustration!  Overall I am very pleased with this speaker.
5,Sound quality seems remarkably good to me for the size. Perfectly adequate for my use of providing background music during dinner on vacation in the rental beach house.BT seems to have stuttered a couple of times but nothing bad.  I haven't tried to push the distance.It has gone several hours on a charge but I don't know how long it will last.I am happy I picked this model. It feels very solid and is nicely finished.
5,Very nice item for the price...sound quality is great
4,Hi I returned Doss sounds bar is great but is not what I want. I would like to know if you received the products. Please let me know. Return the money to the credit card. I would like to purchase another items. I hope everything went good with the return. Thank you so much.
5,Does what it says.  I have it in my office.  Connects easily.  Sound is good.  Would purchase another one if I need to.
4,This is fitting our needs.  It is a nice size and has good sound but the volume is a little tricky to operate and sometimes we wish it was a little louder but it does fit the description as advertised and we are overall happy with it.
3,Love this portable speaker.  I love listening to music in the kitchen and before bed and the sound coming out of my Kindle is not great for music.  I connect the kindle with the speaker by bluetooth and sing away.  5th star if it came with a longer charging cord.  Only thing I wish is the sound it makes turning on and off was softer so it doesn't scare the crap out of me in the middle of the night when it shuts off after my "go to sleep " music is finished.  Also the blue light for the volume control is bright enough to be a night light for a babies roo.  If you are light sensitive you will probably need to put a dark piece of material over it.  I use a headband.
4,I like the speaker it has great sound - but if you are listening to Pandora  [free version] it will randomly decide to skip through songs after about 30 seconds. It's ok for me because I am not paying for Pandora so after 5 songs you can't skip anymore. If you are paying for Pandora I don't know how many songs it will not skip through.
5,For the price I think it is a good item
5,Good product would receive
5,This speaker sounds great just as good as the expensive ones I have bought in the past
5,This is an excellent product for the money. Even after reading the great reviews on this I was still pretty surprised at just how well this product sounded. The hard shell carrying case is well constructed. I just ordered three more as Christmas gifts for my grandchildren.  The different color choices makes them unique being I could order a pink one for my granddaughter. Go ahead and order...you won't be disappointed.
5,This little baby pack a good punch the bass on this speaker is great.  I recently purchase a $169.00 Bose speaker although I previously reviewed and looked at the Doss speaker but said to myself hey its Black Friday and Bose has an excellent reputation for sound not this time.  I returned the Bose speaker and said hey what the hectic if the Doss don't sound good its only $27.99.  Ha was I made a believer the music is great and I definitely hear my BASS.  I definitely will be buying another one of these babies.
4,Works pretty good I have 2 of them and both are fine.  The touch buttons can be a little wonky and the circle is a volume control which I didn't  realize until I inadvertently turned it all the way down and though there was a problem.  Read the manual and you should be fine.
5,I really love this sound box it sounds great and is small enough to sit on table or shelf.  Shuts itself off after I turn my TV off at night.  I do enjoy it and I was surprised how nice it is.
3,It works but there is a chip in the paint and the top portion is coming apart. Sound is loud but if you turn your phone up all the way it makes a screeching sound. It’s okay but I’m very disappointed it came out the box already visually defective. Almost like it’s used. Not sure if im going to return it or not.
5,This little speaker has excellent sound highs and lows. It sounds better than another one I paid twice as much for. This is a great value for the sound. I'm impressed.
5,Had purchased a 11in RCA tablet and the speakers were not the greatest so found this on Amazon and it had good reviews so bought it.  Had a freind over to share Christmas dinner and was listening to "3 hours of Christmas Music" on you tube thru the table and the sound was wonderful.  The bass was clear and beautiful as well as the rest of the scale but the bass is often not that great on computer equipment. This was really great and my friend said "I'm jeaslous the soulnd is so nice coming out of your speaker."  It was and is...  If you want a bluetooth speaker this is one to get.
5,******UPDATE******  I must say the customer service folks at DOSS exceeded my wildest expectations and replaced the unit I had they were proactive and I am thoroughly impressed.  The new unit I have works perfectly!  I have a few of these speakers but this seems to work the best with bluetooth but also is the loudest!  I will update again in 60 days.  ****During the 60 days that this speaker worked it was pretty good louder than the other ones in its class and It was on sale when I bought it...Anyway 60 days later it's a paper weight will look up warranty and update.
5,I’m very happy with my purchase! I listen to music on my phone occasionally but I did not want to spend a lot of money.  The sound quality is excellent and it was easy to connect!!
4,Great sound and depending on placement really great bass response (suprisingly good for its size). A little spotty when too far from my computer but when close enough it's a great and solid connection with great sound.
5,For someone who doesn't care if it's an intelligent system or not it's a great choice. Brought this speaker to a trip and we had a blast. Good luck :)
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This little baby is a monster. If you look at the video you will see that the bass is so mean on this speaker that it movea from it. It will fill up a room and with Surprising long battery life at that! I often lose track of how often i charge it because i hardly need too. Sound quality is a-1. Be advised i have caught this little beast from almost falling off my desk from some songs. Definately one of the best blu-tooth speakers I've ever had.
5,I have it connected to an old iPad with my music collection. The sound in incredible the battery lasts forever and it works just fine throughout our condo. Occasionally connect to the TV and once again it's perfect and well worth the $29 or sos that I paid.
2,Go beyond half way up and it sounds like garbage.
2,Bluetooth from an iPhone is fine but if you want to connect directly via the Aux input this is not a good choice. Aux input is acceptable only with a device with lots of "ummph". There is no volume control or Aux amplification on the unit. The Bugani M90 is a MUCH better alternative in this price range for this.
4,A great little speaker to keep on the boat or in the office or at the house.
5,I love my speaker!! Worth your money
5,My father has dementia so I bought this speaker for him because of the micro sd option and also I thought that the circle on the top was the 'on' button.  It is not.  The power button is on the back.  This makes it too complicated for a dementia patient.  But I am keeping it for myself because I like it so much.  It was very easy to set up with music on the sd card - less than 3 minutes.  It came at least partially charged and it has great sound.
5,I got this speaker for a male family member who recently moved away for college. He wanted the $160 "Beats Pill" that many of his friends have but I talked him into giving this one a try. Long story short he was blown away by the quality of this speaker!!  He told me that not only was this speaker louder and clearer than the beats pill but it also has a very futuristic touch functionality.  He told me that now he is the go-to guy for dorm-room parties because of his superior speaker! After hearing the way he was  glowing I would DEFINITELY recommend this speaker to any parent looking to buy for their young relative! Definitely 5 stars!!
4,Love the speaker & works well. I use it through my cell phone. If I get a call or something I usually have to go through a series of steps to get it reconnected to get the music playing again.
4,I love this speaker. I have it in my room connected to my projector and it does the job quite nicely! The battery life is very long. The only downside I found was when I wanted to take it outside to play music it was not very loud - which makes sense since it is such a small speaker. Indoors it is quite loud but outdoors it didn't seem loud enough.
5,Great speaker high quality sound 15 + hours of sound!!
5,I am blown away with how easy it is to operate & the amazing sound quality
5,This speaker is frickin awesome u can't go wrong gettin it love love love it u just have 2 turn up ur phon volume all the way but it grate
4,Sonido por encima del promedio. En cuanto a la distancia del bluetooth no tiene el alcance de la promoción.
4,Nice little speaker. Compatible with Echo Dot and I like the idea of being able to take the speaker to another room to listento my favorite songs through Echo. The sound quality is very good for a small speaker but due to its weight I think it gives a much betterbass sound.Its very easy to set up after downloading the app to my smartphone.I would recommend this speaker for anyone looking for an inexpensive speaker with good sound quality.
5,I'm in love with these speakers. They just arrived and I've only used them once but they seem to be working pretty welll. You definitely get what you paied for and 32$ for the sound quality that the device offers is very very good. Some of the isssues I noticed is that the sound isn't crisp at all. You can hear a little bit of background noise which if you're not paying attention doesn't really matter all that much. The device itself looks good but the material used feels cheap( remember its only 32$!). I will update my review as soon as I start using it more but so far its great!!!
3,This speaker is exactly what you should expect when buying cheap Chinese electronics. The sound quality is decent and the Bluetooth connection works as pretty well. When connected through the aux port the speaker controls (pause skip etc.) do not work so keep that in mind. The voice recordings that play when connecting your phone are hilariously bad. If you had any doubt that you were buying a Chinese product this will solidify it for you. You will hear "Bluetooth mode have been on" in a strong accent every time you turn the speaker on. The touch buttons work fine but I would have preferred physical buttons. To increase the volume you have to run your finger around the center circle. This ends up being pretty unreliable since you never really know how much you're increasing the volume by.All in all I wouldn't say that I regret purchasing this speaker but it's not one of the better choices even at this price point. I'd recommend looking elsewhere.
5,Initial impressions: Great little speaker for the price. Louder than expected. I've purchased inexpensive Bluetooth speakers in the past and this one so far (again after initial impressions) is the best. Build quality seems pretty decent. It has a little bit of weight to it. Sound quality is a nice equal balance of bass and treble. The only small nitpick I have is the circular volume dial on the top does not have the best response but I usually use the volume controls on the device I'm using to control the volume anyway. Hey it still looks cool. Did I mention it is louder than I expected? Oh yeah I did.
4,I bought this for my office and the sound quality is perfect and the volume is more than adequate for my needs.  Connection has been fine.My only complaint is that when my cell phone rings the volume of the ringer through the speaker is obscenely loud which I admit is probably due to my lack of technical understanding of this type of equipment. I'm still getting used to it but candidly it is perfect for the job.
1,This was a 4 star review before using the newer version - For years I grew accustom to the sweet musings of this box including the wonderful "Bluetooth mode has been on" and the ever famous "Now is Aux in mode."Instead they have been replaced by generic loud beeping noises. Literally 0/10 rating for this particular update. I want my broken english announcer man back thank you very much.In all seriousness (although I am also very serious about getting rid of my main man the DOSS announcer) its a decent speaker. It gets loud although if you keep it at max volume you can damage the speaker. Also if you are listening with bluetooth and have the sound near maximum the buttons will press themselves due to the vibration from the bass. You will constantly have the song pause skip restart etc. The battery while decent for a while also shits out after a year or two and you are left with a A/C powered speaker. I use it for my PC though so for my purposes most of these issues are avoided.I was happier when this was 20$ but 26$ with a coupon isnt too bad.Bring back my main man.My 1 star review is because it emits a HORRID high pitch squeal whenever on and plugged into an aux cable. I literally have an older model right here and it doesnt make this abomination of a sound. Returning the speaker immediately.
4,This is a great speaker for its price. I would 100% recommend. The only problem I have is trying to turn up the volume on the actually speaker. When I run my finger over the circle to turn it up it makes a noise but doesn’t turn the music up but it works fine when I turn it down. That’s the only problem and that’s not much of a problem since I can turn up the volume on my phone.
5,I really like this speaker and am happy with my purchase. I looks really nice and functionality is fine. I was initially worried about the touch volume control but haven't had any issues with it at all. The battery life is surprisingly great and the battery life displays on my Note 9 when they are first connected. I feel like it is lacking in the bass department but I didn't expect a whole lot out of a cheap bluetooth speaker.
5,These is an awesome little speaker. I use it outside near my pool and it projects music very well. I also use it often in my house. It’s easy to pair and I love the volume button on the top that easily turns up or down with your finger.
5,This portable blue tooth speaker is fantastic!  WE love listening to music and are often outside and this is perfect.  The volume is great the sound is fantastic and no problems with connectivity.  I would highly recommend this product!
4,I love this speaker. The sound is loud enough. The only two problems I have is the connectivity and when using it for a call. If I'm in the bathroom I can't answer a call because it's too echo. Sometimes the connectivity is thrown off. So I have to pair it again. But overall this speaker I love it.
5,LOVE THIS SPEAKER! I have them in my bedroom and my bathroom. I listen to audio books every night so mine gets a workout! It is on all day and all night. Had to order a new one for my bedroom so I also bought an extra because I can’t sleep without it.
5,this is a perfect little speaker for listening to the Bieber or when the kids want to listen to their hip hop have also tried country music and that was a big hit that Kenny Chesney is sure a hottie and it really comes through. I give it 5 stars but not sure how it’ll do on his latest album we’ll just take it one day at a time.
5,Got here very fast and works great. I'm amazed at the sound quality that comes out of this small package. I used to connect my iPad by cable to a couple of old computer speakers and listen to music and pod casts while doing projects in the garage and around the house. That was cumbersome and dangerous for my iPad. I even dropped it a few times. This SoundBox solves my problem perfectly. My iPad can now remain in a safe place while I easily connect it to the SoundBox via Bluetooth. The sound is loud and clear and with the twelve hour battery run time I don't have to worry about recharging it mid day.
5,Even though this more of an dislike I still like the product it more than likely uses an onboard battery that can't be replaced it is more of an throwaway and replace speak like the Metallic Speakers from Creative. I like the sound it gives but wish it had an lock button.
5,Great speaker and very good sound. For my requirements and purpose this speaker went above and beyond my expectations. All I needed was a speaker that could fill a room with good sound without breaking the bank or paying for more sound than I needed. This speaker did that and much more. I can hear this speaker clearly from any room in the house. What really sold me on it was its ability to insert a micro ssd and play from it. That option makes it capable of being a stand alone player. Many of the others in the same price range didnt have it.
5,Took 2 seconds to connect my phone and the sound is LOUD and CLEAR!
5,I purchased it and thought it was going to be a regular mono speaker situation. When I turned it on and turned it just half way up I was blown away! This speaker has tremendous sound! It has been a great addition to my home and I love it! It has a very long battery life sounds very clear can get very loud connects to Bluetooth almost seamlessly can be heard all through my house clearly and the BASS IS AWESOME! If you need a wireless speaker for functions the house or just because you feel like purchasing a bargain deal this is the one you should get! Satisfied customer!
5,This is a good value.  Inexpensive but sounds great.  I really like it.
2,Worked great for a month but then bluetooth connectivity became very spotty. Trouble shooting said speake needs to be 33 feet away. Still didn't work. Now to late to return.  I may still try to reach out. Very disappointed.
5,The sound and connection is great. No complaints here.
5,We had to have something to augment the sound coming from our laptop. Our laptop audio sounded so weak and tinny. The DOSS SoundBox Speaker made all the difference in the world. The additional bass made the music and speech from the computer sound so normal and full. The SoundBox also links up to our laptop via bluetooth easily and quickly. It is a delight to use.It plays a series of musical notes for each function it performs so you know when it turns on or off and when it becomes connected to the laptop or any other device. The bonus was the choice of colors from which we could choose.
5,The DOSS Touch Wireless Bluetooth V4.0 works as advertised and is a great solution to provide iPhone controlled music in a room or outdoors. The enclosure is very well made and the Bluetooth setup was easy. In my case I have it more or less fixed in place in my living room - so it's connected to power via the USB port - however having the ability to disconnect and more elsewhere is nice. The sound is very good for this size speaker. The ability is use the speaker to answer my iPhone is handy. In sum - I don't think you can get a better unit at this price. I highly recommend.
1,Worst sound on the planet! Look I kept my old tv you know the type without a flat screen for years and years before upgrading and it never bothered me! I’m not an electronics snob by any stretch. However this horrible speaker should have a lot more 1-Star reviews than it has and I question Amazon’s review approvals and averages now.What makes it bad?-the sound is tinny. I read other reviews on various speaks say this but until I bought this speaker I didn’t know what that meant. It sounds like a tiny band it playing in a tin can making it sort of high pitched echoey and without appropriate tone and bass.-the blue tooth connection is awful! I have a 2020 phone so it’s new. I’ve used other Bluetooth speakers without issue. The problem is THIS device. In the span of five seconds the machine constantly cut out and cut back in making the already terrible tinny sound all the more grating on the nerves.Finally I do not believe this was a one-speaker issue. Meaning this isn’t just the machine I received (which had fingerprints all over it so I assume it was returned by someone else). Read the 1-star reviews. This is the worst choice you could make. Try something else.
4,Purchased around 15 months ago. Frequent use 3-4 days per week around an hour each time. Sound is fine about as good as you would expect for the price. Battery died today - no longer holds more than 1 hour of charge. Doesn't matter how everything else is if you can't use it.Edit: The company got in contact with me and offered a free replacement and I have tentatively updated my rating in consideration of their customer service and good will.
5,This speaker is little but loud very attractive too compact for traveling and moving around the house. I simply love it!!
5,Does its job. Gets pretty loud lasts quite a while and pretty sturdy too. Actually left it out in a hurricane for a couple of days a few years ago and it still worked and does to this day. 5/5
5,We took this speaker to the beach and it held up charge and sounded great!
5,Great little speaker! Very impressed with the sound quality and it looks cute too. Great value! Highly recommend
4,I like this speaker. It works great and it makes sounds for everything. You always know when you need to charge it or when it is connected. Works great for me.
5,I was impressed with the sound that came out of this little speaker. I bought it to use in my classroom but I need a speaker with a mic. This would have been exactly what I needed if it had that.
5,Hahaha. I disliked this speaker for 3 weeks. HahahahaThat is how long it took me to "discover" that the volume control is tactile!!!Basically move the finger around in the circle in the middle.  Move it clockwise to increase volume and counterclockwise to decrease it.Now on to it:VOLUME LEVELS - Love it!!! Great volume can fill a midsized bedroom easy.VOICES - You can hear voice crystal clear.MUSIC - Packs enough of a punch.  I am a bass-head and it does satisfy me enough.VOLUME - 8/10SOUND - 8/10I doubt I'd find a speaker with better sound at this price range. Highly recommended in this range
3,I liked how long the speaker lasts and connects I just wish it had a richer sound to it with more bass
5,Love this thing. I use it principally with my iPad to watch streaming video. Works great and I can even pause and fast forward using it. One of my better purchases.
5,Very pleased with the product. A lot of people are using this speaker for their cellphones etc. I found it very good to use as a satellite speaker in our living room. Our living room is a long narrow room and the TV is of course on the short wall. I placed the speaker 3/4's of the way down the long wall and now the TV volume doesn't need to be as loud so everyone can hear it. Quality is also very niceThanks
5,This is for garage and works great. Great clear sound husband really likes it
5,The sound quality is not bad and the battery life if ok at this time
3,I ordered this speaker about a year ago and up until now it's worked perfectly. Great sound quality and the bluetooth connected easily. However it's suddenly stopped being able to charge and now every few minutes it makes a loud obnoxious beep. I've tried different outlets and mini USB cables but it seems like the problem is with the speaker itself. Overall it's a great speaker but may not last you as long as you'd like.
5,This is my 1st wireless speaker.  I purchased this speaker to connect to my  Apple Ipod and was very satisfied with the ease of connection and the sound Quality.  I also purchased a Ac adapter for faster charging.  I am greatly pleased with my purchase.
5,It's an extremely great product for a relatively low cost. You can have two speakers per device. I really enjoy my music videos and movie's since I made this purchase. Tonight I ordered my second speaker the seller is reliable and honest. The product was shipped speedily and charged I used the wireless system right away. You can also hardwire the speaker if you choose not to Bluetooth it.I wasVery satisfied and you will too. Enjoy your new Bluetooth speaker.
3,Battery life and Bluetooth Connectivity work really well for now (bought recently). I was most excited about the sound quality after reading other reviews. I must say the bass and low end sound is great for a small speaker but anything on the high end sounds tinny and rattles the casing. Audiobooks are a no go and musical ballads are done a disservice. I shouldn't have had such high expectations for the pricepoint but R&B and Pop genres do well with it.
4,I like the design. Don’t blast music to loud or you’ll blow a speaker like I did. Still works great. Just can’t max it out anymore.
5,Ok... where do I start?  This little speaker is right on Point!!  This thing is tough out the box!  Rugid feels very durable waterproof tested easy to pair up with the 5 Bluetooth devices I chose!  Very crisp sounding loud when you need it to be & great at low volumes as well!I could not ask for a better little speaker!!  I bought the DOSS Wirelees Speaker for my wife as a surprise gift but decided to get her something else after I heard it’s sound!!  She would not use & appreciate its sound & capabilities as I would!! 😙😇
4,I have bought a total of 3 of these speakers and loved them until I purchased my last one☹ I bought it as a gift and my friend told me it stopped working after only 3 months. I just purchased another one for her and I'm hoping this one will work!
3,The review has to be in line with the money I have spent for this.Sound of speaker:I am very happy with the sound quality. There is adequate depth of sound and also bass and clarity. It is quite loud as well and the sound does not distort which is great.Mic for using for phone calls:I found that the mic is not very good. I have to speak much louder than if I were using the mic and speakers on my phone. I will not use it much for phone calls which is not satisfying.Bluetooth Connection:The bluetooth is very easy to connect. The connection was stable and did not drop out when I went to another room. I love it.User interface:I love the user interface. It takes a bit getting used to to not have a pressure/tactile feedback but the buttons work great and no complaints there.Overall I would say a very good buy for the money.
5,I was skeptical when I first saw this speaker. I knew I wanted a Bluetooth speaker and I knew I wasn't trying to go broke by purchasing one. This one seemed interesting but I was unsure because I need something that can get fairly loud has perfect sounding quality a clean looking speaker fairly durable and good base. Finally I decided I wanted this speaker.. Turns out I was wrong. I didn't "want" this speaker. I "needed" this speaker. All those years of living without this speaker in my life were a waste. You want this speaker in your life. So go ahead and hit that add to cart button and you won't regret it.
5,Awesome speaker.... it's almost been a year last night we had a storm I left it outside ( I always leave it outside but covered) it blew onto the ground by the time I got to it was beeping and burping going off and coming back on I thought hope it will still work. I set it next to a heater and it got better over a couple hours used it that day and I'm so happy it works just great.I like the feature when the charging system is getting low it has a busy signal to let you know. I enjoy my DOSS....
4,Works well.  Sound quality is as good as other more expensive devices I have used.  Great battery life.
5,Sound is crisp and clear. It easily connected to blue tooth. Battery life is decent and it didn’t take too long to charge the battery. Overall it was a good choice for me.
5,It linked up with my iPhone on the first try. Sound is quite good for the price but not as good as my UE boom. However a UE boom is more than twice the price. I'm sure if you get a higher level Doss it will be just as good the UE. It all depends on what you're using it for. I just wanted a little music in the bedroom once in a while. The Doss is perfect for that. I will update if anything arises so far so good. I deem it a great value.
5,Great speaker. Superb customer service.I bought several portable speaker before but they all come with annoying voice announcing features. They drive people crazy. This speaker also has the voice announcing too. But upon contacting DOSS customer service they gave me a firmware update to remove it. It only took 15 seconds to do and now it is perfect. I emailed them Friday night and I got the firmware back by Saturday morning. Amazing customer service.The speaker is great too. It looks beautiful very well built. The bass is good for a little speaker. I cannot be happier. Thank you for a great product and superb customer service.
5,This thing is incredible!!  The sound quality is outstanding and I've listened to music all day and I haven't ran the battery out once( 8 to 10 hours at a time). Then it has the chip ( not included) and it so small. It was on sale when I got it so I paid 20 bucks which is really cheap for something like this.
5,I gotta say I'm pretty darn impressed with this little speaker. I bought it for my bathroom so I can listen to my music from my phone when getting ready in the morning. My wife probably uses is much more than I do and switching between devices is never a problem. It pairs with my iPhone quickly and easily. The auto-power off is very handy as I never remember to turn it off when leaving the room. The sound is awesome for such a small device. I honestly can't tell much of a difference between this unit an my Denon amp on our main stereo.

5,I read a million reviews on several products before purchasing this product. I almost got a lightening deal at a cheaper price but remembered how highly I thought of this speaker and went back and got it. I tested it on my phone and it worked perfectly. I ultimately got this for the Bluetooth to sync with my mac to watch movies on the projector as the speakers I had are old and not very loud. This works perfectly! You don't even need it up that much to fill a room. Other than not being able to pair more than one item at a time (which really isn't a big deal) this speaker is perfect!
5,As a violinist and a hi-fi enthusiast I know good sound quality when I hear it. While there's of course no comparison with my high-end stereo system that cost many thousands of dollars for only $30 the Doss SoundBox offers excellent sound quality and is extremely listenable. The Bluetooth connection from my iPhone was easy to set up (got it on the first try) and it was easy to use my iPhone to control the content and adjust the volume from my phone's volume controls. Highly recommended it fully deserves all of the positive reviews it has already gotten and I'm happy to add mine to the mix.
5,The speaker has very nice features decent sound quality and build quality.
2,I don't know why this speaker has so many reviews boasting great sound quality but I am very disappointed in the sound quality. I bought this for a small room that's about 300 sq ft so I don't need the volume to be that loud. Even at a softer volume the sound is very muffled in my opinion. I am returning this for a better quality speaker - I guess you get what you pay for.
4,speaker was great for first 6 months but recently had problem with it randomly turning itself on. Woke me up in the middle of the night with tones turning on and off.
3,I've had this speaker for 1 year and 3 months and for some time now. It has great sound and pairs well BUT it's force skipping my music. It changes to another song on its own. I thought it was my phone or the spotify app but after pairing my phone to other Bluetooth speakers I realize it's only this speaker. I don't know how to stop it so now I only use it to listen to the movies or videos I stream BUT i purposely bought it so I could listen to music. Guess I'm back in the market!!
5,This is an amazing bluetooth speaker. I have been using this with my 24 inch monitor as a makeshift TV before I buy a TV and the sound quality is incredible. The downside of using t as a TV is that the stereo speakers are too close to get the stereo effect when sitting from far but the sound quality itself is still amazing. Doesn't beat my Creative T20s but for $30 totally worth it compared to anything else at this price and possibly even after $60 speakers.Also the bluetooth works really well there is a bit of lag when pairing but it will pair. After it's paired I never have issues re-pairing on its own.
5,My tech-savvy son chose this speaker for me.  It has superb sound!  I tried making a video to show the sound but couldn't figure out how to attach it to this review.  But the sound is superb!
5,I usually purchase items to try before gifting them to others.  This bluetooth soundbox is great!  It connects to the bluetooth right away.  My husband and I both connect from our phones without any problems.  The sound is phenomenal. The system makes it easy to control from your phone or the soundbox too.  The price is an added bonus! I will be purchasing more these for gifts!
5,A very good product.  The only negative is the touch controls are to easy to touch if you have to reposition the speaker.  Just be aware of that.
5,Nothing about this product that shows product defect in quality in sound or workmenship
2,I'm very pleased with this speaker - it suits my needs very well.  That is until it stopped charging. I see this complaint in many of the reviews as well as in the questions.My advice is to only charge it as needed as the charge port is fragile.  I charged it every morning.You know it is charging as the tiny light under the port is red when charge completed it's green.  I can also see the charge status in upper right of ipod touch (when connected).I'm waiting to hear back from Manufacturer.  Let's see what they do.  I use speaker for audible books and podcasts mostly music when I'm exercising.
5,I love this speaker. I’ve dropped it a millions times and it still works great. Sound is great. I live in a studio apartment and it fills the whole room with sound. Only downfall would be that after a while the charge port starts to become a little finicky. But I find that problem with most USB charge cables so if you’re patient and can wiggle the cord until it says charging then you’ll love this speaker.
5,I have had this speaker for almost four years and haven't had one problem with it!  Battery life and sound is really good.  I would definitely buy another one!!
4,I actually really like it. It has nice sound and lasts for a super long time!! loud enough but not for parties and the like
4,When I'm reading reviews to make a decision regarding a possible purchase I hate seeing "good for the money" comments but that's what I would say for this one.  For what I use it for $30 is a steal.  It's very easy to use and sounds fine for the podcasts I listen to and Sirius satellite radio.  I would never and hopefully nobody does use it as a home stereo substitute.
4,Battery life is excellent. Outperformed my expectations for a $30 speaker for sure.
5,Oh my goodness! This speaker is amazing. I bought  one for my grandma and then I had to purchase one for my mom and aunt as well. They work really great! I’d honestly buy it again for a gift or something it’s really worth it.
5,Wonderful speaker with great sound and battery life! My speaker lasted for over 5 months on one charge and daily use!! The price is awesome for the quality.
5,It's great for taking it with you on the go or just need a little personal listening!
4,Love my speak! I used it in the bathroom at work while I’m cleaning etc! It’s small but is pretty loud. I’ve gotten many compliments on the sound and quality of it! Wish it came with a case or something to carry around in & just to protect it!
4,The overall loudness is not super impressive. I like how long the speaker lasts but the last 20% of battery life the speaker beeps every 20 seconds until it dies. For the price however I think the quality is fair.
5,I am updating my review of this item. I gave it a bad review because the speaker I received did not work correctly. Once the company saw my review they contacted me and wanted to make it good. Well  they certainly did. I received a new speaker which works great. Sound is perfect and no problems like I had with the first one. I also want to comment on their customer service and how impressed I am with this company. Once I received the new speaker they continued to follow up with me to make sure I was satisfied. Thank you DOSS and thank you Milla for great customer service!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                                                                                    A Great speaker!Sound is better than other similar speakers.Worth the money!And Also When I got the speaker on my handi feel like "is this speaker can hold my style?"I used the speaker with my favorite song for the first play.I felt like the song comes from nowhere which means this is not what i expected but its far beyond what i expected!Sensitive touch surface controllerand can be switched between 3 modes.What I surprised is "previous""next" on the surface can be used on every kind of player app.Falling love with my speaker.Worth the money!
5,I love my new speaker. I even bought another one a gifted it to a family member. The sound is clear and it is easy to connect to wireless devices. The only downside for me is that I wish it can connect to two or three devices at once with the owner having the options of switching from one device to another at the push of a button.
5,I have had this speaker for ten days now and well I think it sounds great and its loud! It's to big to put in your pocket but light enough to carry in your hand while you are walking. It supports Bluetooth and line in but I did notice using the line in cable that came with the speaker seemed to be noticeably quieter than when paired through Bluetooth so I just stick with using Bluetooth. Battery life seems great to me I use it for hours at a time throughout the day and I have yet to have it die on me! I would recommend this to a friend in fact I already have.
5,What a treasure this device has been. Before I struggling to listen to music and videos through my phone and now I can drive and clearly hear my music videos and audiobooks. Over the past couple of days the battery has lasted over 6 hours during my driving shift.  So far the sound has been great using bluetooth but when I attached the speaker to my laptop via aux cord the volume was lower and distorted. I'll have to get another aux cord to determine if it was the cord or not. Other than that Great device.
5,Its very nice. Its loud. But hubby has 1 a lil louder.  But to me this one is loud enough...  couldnt walk to far from source or it loses connection.
5,Winner!  Winner!  I've been using this dynamite BT speaker for about 2 weeks now and all I can say is Wow!The controls which are on the top and easy to read and function are just what an old-timer such as myself really appreciate.  My son has the Bose mini at about 5 X's the price and when he syncs his music to his and then switches to mine the difference is un-noticeable.  Set up and syncing was a breeze even for old grandpa. Did not even call my grandson once LOL.  Would I recommend this product to my friends and family??  Hell yes.
4,Bought this in hope it’d be loud enough to play for students during gym class and it wasn’t even close. Probably best for around the house.** update- received another Doss through their customer service and it worked much better. I was able to play music for class of around 20 students. It wasnt overly loud on the opposite side of where the speaker sat but it does the job ! Great customer service!
5,I use this speaker almost everyday and it works great every time.
4,Sound is great!
4,It's not as good as my last one but it is a great speaker overall for the price. We use ours in the kitchen; it sounds great but not quite as good at high volume. The bass could be a little deeper but overall a great buy! Downside; no plug in. It has a spot for DC plug in but they don't supply the cord. You have to use usb port.
5,Love this speaker!  Ordered a second one as a gift.  The sound is amazing and it's so easy to use.  I don't mind the announcements that others have disconnected. The only things I don't care for are the volume adjustment mechanism and that it's attached to the feature that allows the speaker to connect as a speakerphone.  Anytime you get to a certain place in the volume control it blurps out a beep like a phone's busy signal. Very annoying when using the speaker as I teach yoga.  All in all it's got super sound and is loud enough and clear enough to use in a pretty big hall.
5,Worth buying
4,Great clear sound and the speaker is aesthetically pleasing.  The only issue I have found with this speaker is that the light from the controls is overly bright and does not dim when in use.  I use this on my night stand to play relaxing music as I sleep and the light is a bit of a distraction. Had I known ahead of time I would have chosen a wireless speaker without backlit controls.
5,Bought this for my wife due to a sound bar I got her only lasted a month and her phone would no longer connect. The sound quality is really good and is holding a battery charge pretty well.
5,We had purchased a Bose bluetooth speaker for our son and daughter in law a few years ago.  It's very nice with great sound.I decided I would purchase a bluetooth speaker for our house too after hearing the great sound from theirs.I purchased this DOSS instead of a Bose as I didn't know how much I would use it.THIS LITTLE SPEAKER IS AMAZING!!!!!  I MEAN TRULY AMAZING!!!!Do you have Amazon Prime like we do?  Play their Prime music on your DOSS- the sound is as great as a Bose!  Believe me!SO happy with this purchase!  And with Amazon Prime music as well!
2,I bought this speaker to replace the internal speaker in my laptop which was developing a terrible static issue. The Doss speaker works great expect when I am in a zoom meeting it shuts off every 10-15 minutes and I have to press the power button to restart it. That is a pain in the butt! What a stupid feature. I will try to fix it with the software update; but it really irritates me that I have to do this and I worry it will make some other aspect of the speaker fail. Also it seems to be interfering with the function of my wireless mouse; so I loose my mouse arrow when the speaker is on. This is not a constant problem but the mouse arrow has disappeared multiple times in the course of a one hour zoom meeting.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I love listening music when I'm getting ready 😁 the sound is perfect. I recommend it.
5,I love it for when I’m cleaning the house
5,I got this for my oldest daughter for part of an Easter gift as she has wanted a speaker. I have an older JBL speaker and this one is louder than mine. Easy to use. Now I want one for myself! I also like that you can touch the speaker and use the next button to skip songs.
4,Works really well in the house but if I bring it outside it's not loud enough and it's really not loud enough for me to use at work since i work in a load factory and also the battery only lasts for about 5 hours when you got it max volume but it was a good price and it works well until it vibrated off the table and now it has a cracking sound
4,Sounds good only problem my speaker looks damage(dent on the front side) sucks because it was a gift.
5,Big sound for a little box.
5,This blue tooth speaker is amazing! It's small but powerful. I'm glad I am able to use not only my phone but also my old school ipod with the aux cord that came with it. I can't attest to the battery life because I keep it plugged in but the sound is amazing the size is amazing. I have no complaints about this speaker.
5,I've been using this for a couple of weeks now  I've played it 6-7 hours a day for 3 days and it never had to ge recharged and after the 3 days it still had 30% left on the charge.  Sound quality is so so. It's not like my ankor but it's still loud. I love this and highly recommended it. I connect it to my phone but different devices may have better sound quality
5,Pretty good speaker.  A lot of sound for a smaller box.  Bass isn't the best but it's perfect for what I needed.  Connects to my phone very fast.
4,I really enjoyed this powerful little speaker and it was easy to hook up to my phone and play music out of my phone that sounded like I was playing music out of a stereo!
3,This speaker is great for the first 70% of battery. The sound is great it's easy to connect to Bluetooth devices (and switch back and forth). If that was where the review ended I'd give it 5 stars.... At about 30% battery the sound becomes very tinny. At 20% the speaker becomes unusable. It "helpfully" tells you that it "only" has 20% battery left by playing a dial tone pausing your music/audiobook/etc. Every. Thirty. Seconds.I can't remember how many hours this thing claims to play for on a charge but whatever that is discount that by twenty percent.
5,This high quality speaker meets my requirements perfectly. Bluetooth connection to Laptop Aux audio from Desktop and playing mp3 from microsd card. Touch control makes it very easy to switch input source. I like the all connections are at the back of speaker.
5,I was very hesitant to buy a new portable speaker since I didn't know what to expect. I was very surprised after buying that the speaker quality matched the video description. I love the portability and simple to use buttons. The user friendly dial and easy access charging port made the quality top notch! I do recommend having a longer micro-usb cable on hand just because the one it came with was very small. Bluetooth had no issues and calls on the speaker were smooth. (Heads-up: the mic is on the back side of the speaker) overall very impressed.
4,It's a good little bluetooth speaker for the price.
4,Not as good as my Bose portable speaker but the price and the fact I can  fast forward music from the speaker is a winner.
4,Received an already opened item.  Outside packaging had smudges all over tape had already been sliced open instruction decal that is supposed to be on the unit was on the foam pad and no portable waterproof bag included.  Not even sure if I want to wait the initial 12 hours charge to test or just return.  Very disappointed.Update: Received a replacement unit that works perfectly sounds great and is well made.  Customer support from Doss was great. they went above and beyond to make things right.
5,Love my new DOSS Touch Wireless Bluetooth speaker. I am not an audiophile by any means but compared to another speaker brand I have the sound is rich and full not tinny at all.My only negative is that it turns off after not being in use for a while and I have to physically turn in on before it will connect.  My cheapie I have has no on/off switch. And it could be that I just have figured out the operation of it completely.  I would purchase this item again and in fact thinking of giving one to both my daughters for Christmas.
4,Nice and loud easy to use.
5,I ordered this for my dad and he loves it. The battery life lasts the bluetooth connects easily and the sound is really good for the price. Sounds like an expensive speaker.
5,The Bluetooth connectivity is so easy.I am 70 yrs old and usually wait for my GRANDKIDS TO DO ALL ELECTRONIC . I DID IT MYSELF IT WAS SO EASY...
5,Great companion to Echo.  I ask it to play  "This American Life" and Ira comes right up.  I ask it to play Beatles and I get the fab five pretty quickly.
5,Love this Bluetooth.  Connects fast and has awesome sound.  Highly recommend it
3,I bought two of these as they were a deal of the day and i wanted them in different rooms.  One of them stopped working about 2 months later (after return period had passed).  The other one is still working.One big complaint.  You have to press the button on the back of the speaker BEFORE you connect it to Bluetooth. So...compared to my Bose speaker which all you have to do is to connect it this is a hassle.  You can't just go into a room and click on your cell phone and hear music. You have to go to speaker and turn it on first.
1,This is one of the worst Bluetooth speakers I have bought. Doesn’t hold a charge
4,For the money you are making out on this!While this cannot compete with a Bang & Olufsen Klipsch Polk or Bose... it is a cute gift for a collegiate student or traveler.Sound is surprisingly full.Bass response is adequate for its price and size.Mid and High trebles are crisp and pleasant.You can’t go wrong for the cost. Battery life is decent.
4,I use this more with the airplay than with Bluetooth but it works great for both. I got as a backup speaker for my Bose sounddock I which broke - since I wasn’t sure if I could repair it but I’ve got a sound processor board on the way and will see if I can get it working again. If I can I’ll still use this around the house. Not bose quality but still pretty good!!
4,I am impressed with this little box. I like it more than I thought I would.The only drawback to it is that even though the box works with bluetooth it doesn't turn itself on once connected to a device. You have to manually go to the box to turn it on. Once it's one you could control the music from the box. I still enjoy it anyhow!
5,Love this speaker its sounds very loud connect easily have it in one room & I'm in another could hear the sound very clearly. Will buy again for someone as a present.
5,This Bluetooth speaker has many attractive features such as Bluetooth and 3.5mm stereo jack audio inputs. Plus Micro SD card stored media to play music. The one and only detractor is when the built in battery quits and if music playing is originating from the SD card the unit appears to corrupt the music playing track/file on the SD card. Once this should occur the DOSS Sound box will stop reading from the SD card at the point of where the corrupt music file is located on the memory card.  Good audio device overall.
4,I like to use this speaker both in the house and outside  hooked up to Bluetooth on my phone - either on Spotify or the music stored on my phone. Good sound for a good price. I like the way it looks too! I do find the on/off button a little difficult to engage. I need to use my fingernail (rather than just my finger) to turn it on.
5,OMG !!!!!! We just got this today WOW !!!! I bought this speaker for my son and it's crazy Good !! I have a Bose wirelessand my son wanted one but way too pricey for me to buy another one. So I seen this on a lightning deal fro $23.99 so I figured why not after I read the reviews I gave it a shot ! So glad I did !! It literally sounds better than my bose that was $130.00 on sale ! Wish I would have purchased more ! But I can't say enough about this speaker ! LooksQualityand Sound are all exceptional !!! I could go on and on !! Quality ..............
4,I thought It would have been a little bigger then the pictures. But I don't know how to look at dimensions and picture that in my head. So anyway  this little speaker box is pretty powerful. It gets the job done. Perfect for our barbecue get together's and the lake. And it was a good price. It scratches easily so put it in a place where it won't fall and don't  let small children play with it
5,Great sound!!  Connects easily and lasts the whole day at the beach.
4,First off if you plan on using this device with a cable then buy one.  The one that came with mine was incredibly shoddy and had a short in it out of the box.  Otherwise it sounds great and the battery life is way better than the Altec speaker I was using prior to purchasing this one.  Sounds great.  Def worth 30 bucks.
5,Worked great for about a month or so. Then it stopped. It pairs but no sound output. Other functions such as skipping songs or pausing is still functional. I tried to find a solution online but I didn't find anything.Update 1/27/17: The seller contacted me about my previous review and was very nice and sent me a new Speaker free of charge. The second one works great. i waited for 3 months of use before posting my update and frankly I can say it is a great product. I have not had any issues sound quality is good fills the room. It  connects to my phone echo or Macbook without any issues.
5,We love this speaker! It has great sound. This is our second speaker.....we accidentally left it out in the rain so it got ruined. We ordered the same speaker for a replacement since we loved it so much!!!
5,I was looking for something cheap to pair with my Taotronics Bluetooth splitter. I have a Sony HTCT-790 sound bar which puts out really decent sound but o also wanted something for my daughter's bedroom so she could hear our favorite tracks while cleaning. The Sound bar can share music through the house but only with other expensive Sony brand speakers ranging from $99 to $200+. This little wonder puts out more sound than the low end $99 Sony at a fraction of the cost! I paid $33! It doesn't have as good lows/bass but overall sounds better. I love the radial volume control too!
4,Bought this for my teenage daughter. Shes happy with the color and the touch features. No bass at all but the sound quality is good and clear even when turned up. No bass for me would be a big negative except its for the kids and Id much rather not hear that bumping from their music so it's a good & bad. All in all its nice. Good size vibrant color nice sound for the price.
5,I bought this to take on vacation and thought it was going to be cheap and that sounds good. I was so surprised! It’s very loud and I take it with me all over my home when I’m listening to my podcast. I even turn it all the way up and it’s extremely loud. When I use it at the beach the resort people told me I had to lower it down LOL. It’s very easy to use and sleek and it was a great buy for me.
5,OMG I am THRILLED with this Bluetooth. I have others but none give me the base I am seeking and this one is BEYOND my expectations!!!  Bought the white one and it's slick!  Sophisticated and kicks you know what!!!!!  LOVE MY PURCHASE!!!
5,I purchased this little speaker to keep inside my camper. It works perfect for what we use it. Good sound and compacted.
5,Me gusta el equipo por ser pequeño portátil y con calidad de sonido creo que es una excelente adquisición.Dependiendo cual ha sido la idea de la adquisición a si es el servicio que el equipo da.Por ejemplo mientras trabajo estoy escuchando música con calidad de audio.
5,I can’t express enough how much I love this Bluetooth speaker!  I have tried several more expensive versions that didn’t impress much. This thing sounds great is easy to use and delivers great sound quality. For under $30 this will be my go-to Christmas gift this year!
3,I own this Doss and my wife owns a Wonderboom. Hers goes thru at least 3 or 4 walls in our house before it will start breaking up whereas this Doss breaks up going thru 1 wall! Granted the inputs and features on my Doss are better than her wonderboom but it's quite irritating that I have to have the Doss and my phone within sight of each other in order to insure the music doesn't break up. Maybe I got a lemon who knows but it's cheap enough not to return and just keep as a secondary to her wonderboom as the auxiliary in feature can be used with my Alexa dot computer ect.
4,Great quality Bluetooth speaker for the price. Has more features than other similar priced speakers. Great bass and volume.
5,How can one tiny speaker be so utterly powerful with a battery that seems to last for days without charge? I have never had trouble connecting this to my phone's Bluetooth. It gives off cheery "on" and "turning off" noises that seem to emanate from the future. The treble/bass balance is superb. The actual amount of sound that it generates is off the charts. The highest volume would be enough to power a party with 50 or more people. I couldn't be more impressed. I had been searching for a Bluetooth speaker for so long. I'm glad I waited and stumbled upon this one.
5,Got 2 of these for the wife for Christmas she didn't want a regular radio in jeep because it's a soft top she loves these we use one for the jeep and one for kayaking 🤘🤘
5,I lo e this little boom box works very well and plays very loud
5,I've been looking for a speaker for a while now and bought this one on a flash deal. Personally I think the sound is amazing! If you are looking for surround sound you'd probably not be looking at this product anyways. However if you are looking for something to play background music or in the kitchen while cooking OR when you have friends over - perfect for that!
4,I really like this speaker! I only have 2 complaints. To turn it off you have to hold down the off button for like 15 seconds inconvenient when I'm in a rush to leave. The bluetooth connection goes fuzzy when I'm in another room or sitting on my phone in my pocket. Otherwise really happy with how easy it is to connect to devices and the sound quality portability battery life and volume. Overall a great purchase and beats my computer or phone speakers.
4,One star knocked because the sound - while good - is very directional. If you set it in a surface that is too low or too high it won't give you the best mix.Perfect for the price point and I'd likely put it up against anything in the $50-$60 range. Looks nice the surface touch points are easy to use and it has no trouble at all syncing up.
5,This Bluetooth speaker does exactly what it's supposed to do! The sound is crisp and clear with plenty of bass. I use this on my deck and wouldn't ask for anything else from this product it's great. The Bluetooth distance that I get is at least 50 ft. I understand that you can't buy two of these and pair them together but this speaker is so clear it's not necessary. I also haven't had any problems with battery life. I charge it about 1-2 weekly (plug usb into computer) and listen for a couple of hours each night. It's not complicated it's a good speaker and a good deal.
5,La verdad me ha sorprendido la calidad de sonido que ofrece esta bocina para su tamaño el diseño es bueno sin duda alguna me volveria a comprar otra cero fallas hasta el momento.
5,Update:  Doss contacted me after leaving my review of 1 star.  They offered to send me a replacement speaker.  They did so within a week and after using the speaker for a week I can report that it works as advertised.  Great customer service!Had a high pitched buzz when connected via Bluetooth.  Tested in different environments thinking it was interference.  Could not get it to stop.  Connected it to my phone with the audio cord and the buzz sound went away.  Defeats the purpose of having a wireless speaker! Returned it the next day.
4,Sound quality is great connecting to smart TV and listening to Spotify....worth the money
3,The bass is virtually non existent.  The product looks good connects easily seems well made and does what it says it will do.  It’s also very well priced.  - but the bass just isn’t there.  If that’s not a problem for you then this is a really good speaker.
5,My husband bought this speaker so we could listen to podcasts while we ride bikes in the morning. It fits perfectly into the small carrier bag he has attached to his bike and the volume is great so that even if I'm a few feet behind or ahead of him I can still hear it clearly. The sound is crystal clear and the bluetooth works with any device we have tried to connect with. It's an excellent purchase that I would highly recommend. My husband uses it when he works in his shop or outside it's very easy to use and well made. Good quality!
3,Got with a Lightning Deal and it’s sufficient for a speaker to move around within my house light weight and a decent backup if my other speaker dies.  Sound is not that good but not bad either.  Just not  a real rich sound.  No volume control.  Good for the price I paid.
4,Ligero y muy compacto el equipo muy buen sonido y la conectividad es excelente se recomienda su compra
5,Love this. I keep it in my kitchen for when I’m cooking. Good sound quality and linked up to my iPhone 11 very easily. Recommend this.
5,My car’s speaker system is messed up so bought this and used it on a 13 hour drive and never ran out of battery or gave us a warning of low battery. Very impressed!
5,Love this “boom box” especially the volume on top. I use it in the kitchen and it is easy to adjust the volume with a gentle touch.
5,I don't remember when I bought it now. It's a long time ago. I used it very lightly and today after another few months  I turned on it again. Amazingly the battery is still working even though I've never recharged for even once. No complaints. Amazing product with low price!
4,Good little speaker. Not as strong bass as I wanted. My phone indicated that the speaker battery was at 20% but the speaker was periodically giving off a busy tone that went away after the speaker battery was charged.
5,WOW !!!!!I was hoping for an "ok" speaker I were blown away the quality of the sound the sleek modern and elegant finish of the speaker is well worth much more than what I paid for. I will buy 3 more.
5,I love everything about this. It’s perfect for what I needed it for. I use it at work for me and my coworkers when we’re working and it’s amazing for the price that I paid.
5,I was VERY pleased with DOSS sound box. Compact and easy to carry around since I travel a lot. Sound quality was super. Battery life was impressive. Bluetooth connectivity was always great. Sadly it was stolen during one of my travels and I decided to buy another DOSS a bigger one which I AM currently extremely happy with.
5,Maybe not quite up to a Bose but still really good for a fraction of the price. We've only run the battery all the way down once so it must be good for at least 4 or 5 hours. No problems connecting to the Bluetooth.
5,Soundbox speaker is easy to use and sounds fantastic! A great buy for the price. The unit stays charged for quite a long time also.  I have owned it for about 2 weeks now and I use it once a day for about 30 minutes and so far have not had to recharge it.  Just one item the speaker has such powerful bass at higher volumes it will slide around on the table.  (could be good or bad depend on how you look at it.)  Make sure you set it in a secure place so it doesn't fall off.
5,Great sound.  I was skeptical of purchasing  this speaker.  It has great sound and bass.  Highly recommend it.
4,Good quality and high volume portable speaker. A bit bulky and heavy could not be used as an everyday portable speaker but it is a perfect choice for less frequent usage. I bought the blue coloured one and it's nicely looking as well. Easily identified by my laptop and cell phone and the controls are perfect.
5,Buen aparato de música solo a Modo de SUGERENCIA quitar el encendido permanente de las luces alargaría la duración de la batería aún más además me resulta un tanto molesta la luz ya que padezco de fotofobia.
5,The DOSS speaker was a pleasant surprise for its price. I have many BOSE products yet wanted something for when I go to the beach or just chill in my backyard. Im very happy with this little speaker.
5,Really great sound!! Good volume as well. I could hear it fairly well while running a table saw and vacuum!!! Have not tried out the battery too much. Kept it plugged in pretty the whole time.
5,It did very well until I plugged in the ear phone . Then when I turn it on it goes right back off ! I only used the unit a few times during the last year.I believe it is defective about the head phone jack. Don’t think I would buy another.
4,DOSS sent me a replacement speaker to sort out my issues with my first speaker. This second unit has no issues with dropping connection holds a charge over several days with at least 7 hours of use each day. The sound quality is good matches the price point in my opinion. The volume range is sufficient for my studio apartment and fills the room.ORIGINAL REVIEW: It drops connection and turns off after 8-12 minutes after full charge. Turns off if I try to change the volume.
5,Great sounding and long lasting battery.
4,If this was a radio from the 80s it would sound like one of those big heavy metal ones. The ones that sound better than a clock radio only because it has larger speakers ;). The bass is not fantastic but is improved when placing it on hollow and/or various wooden surfaces (or in acoustic room).The price is good. Worth $25 and wouldn't pay more than $38.Power switch on the back is annoying.The charge cable is SUPER SHORT but you can use a standard android mobi charger.
4,I use this to listen to music around the house when cleaning or in the backyard with the grandbaby
5,Very good sound
5,This thing has amazing sound.  I could play it in the same room and have the volume down and the music is clear.  I also used it today while I was doing work in the basement and the backyard.  This thing can crank up some serious volume.  I could hear it clearly while outside and the speaker was in the basement.  And also the battery life lasts a pretty long time.  I had it on for several hours today before it warned me of battery needing to be charged (and I had been listening to it for at least a few hours yesterday).  Highly recommend.
5,Just received this thing literally ½ hour ago.Nice box great looking product inside box.Connected to my phone right away with no problems and turned on the Pandora app. LOUD!!! Amazing bass even though you can't really feel it when you hold it in your hands but place it on a counter 😏!!!
5,I use it to for my vinyl and the sound is surprising for a small speaker. Not as bassy as some but has less of a rattle at higher volume. The touch controls work as expected.  Doss gets thumbs up
3,Not a bad little speaker but major vibration when volume up high. Not blasting even. Just medium volume. Expected more following all the great reviews
4,For the price great sound but product wasn't new.  Got white vs. black and brown stains.
5,We wanted a speaker for our pool area. Works great and is perfect for our use.
5,I love this thing!  I at first had it directly connected to my dot but was limited on where I could put it so I no longer have it connected and move it throughout the house as I please and no connection issues.  Now the only problem with it now being connected to the dot is I do have to turn it on but it keeps it sync and alexa can't control the volume but that's not an issue for me.  It's a great little speaker I live in small apartment so the sound fills my place excellently!
5,The sound on this is great. It gets loud enough to hear outdoors unlike some other speakers I’ve owned. The top buttons are touch responseratter than physical buttons which made me skeptical but I’ve had no problems whatsoever. The buttons are responsive enough to function wearing some gloves. The volume “knob” is sensitive but works great once you get the hang of it.
4,I like the portability of the DOSS speakers. Use it with my iPhone for music out on our patio
4,Sound is good with average bass. Only problem is Bluetooth phone calls. Answering a call that’s  connected to this speaker sounds so bad. A call to my mom sounded like a call to Mars and I was talking to an alien who was speaking some foreign language through a broken speaker while he was underwater. Everything else about the speaker is nice except answering phone calls.
5,This speaker surprised me in a good way. At first I thought it might be to small but after reading all the reviews I bought it and it has great sound perfect for listening to music inside.
3,I bought this item to improve my ability to hear my grandchildren during our weekly phone calls. It is well made but the sound quality is "tinny". For the price I suppose it is acceptable but it didn't help me hear the kids. It connected to my phone easily but it turns off after 15 minutes of inactivity so that one must turn it on either before the expected call or during it - not really workable. One gets what they pay for I guess.
5,I bought this speaker to replace wired ones I have on my desk and I'm thrilled I did!  This speaker may be slight but it's mighty!  Sound does not distort when turned up it was easy to pair and although I haven't tested out the battery life I just received this speaker I'm optimistic.  Overall a great purchase and I'd definitely buy again!!
4,Good sound - more than expected
3,Honestly wanna give it five stars but at 20% this thing gives off an obnoxious low battery warning EVERY THIRTY SECONDS UNTIL YOU PLUG IT IN. Now at 20% it’s got a good hour left of power. So maybe just have a warning at 20 again at 10 and then start the continuous at 5. May as well be dead when it hits 20 cause the music cuts out for a full 1.5 - 2 seconds for the low battery warning.Other than that I love this speaker. Bought a black one for my boyfriend and white for me. We love it and both use them all the time. Have to keep my iPad at half volume or less otherwise it’s going through the whole house. Which is good. Nice and loud and amazing quality.
5,I really like the design of the box. It feels heavy(2 lbs) and is really convenient.Pairing is really easy bluetooth connection is great and the aux cable works well too.The sound quality is great especially for such price and it is very loud. And it has rubber footing so it doesn't move around.It takes a while to charge for the first time and I'm not sure how long it will last because I have the charger plugged in all the time.One thing I don't like is that the box will automatically turn itself off after staying idle for a while even when it is charging (no need to save battery).
5,Update: I've had this speaker for 4 years and it still has the same sound quality and battery life as when I bought it!This speaker exceeded my expectations honestly the sound quality is great considering how small the speaker is I mean it gets SUPER loud. I love the circular volume button and I have never had low battery or connectivity issues because it turns itself off after being idle. I love it!
5,The sound and loudness is Phenomenal!
4,The only reasons I don't give it 5 stars are: adjusting the volume is a bit more complicated than it should be (but it's easy enough as long as you remember) and it's kind of heavy for its size.
5,The battery life on this speaker is amazing. We used it in the summer and only had to charge it once. It was also sitting outside the whole time too. We still haven't charged it since July and the speaker is still going.
4,Sound is fabulous but the device will not pair with my Galaxy S8 my husband's Galaxy S6 or my daughter's iphone 7. We have read the manual and done everything in it. We have pressed the phone button shut off the speaker shut off our phones and tried again. I read the other reviews and reset the speaker using a paper clip. Still nothing. Any ideas?
5,I'm not tech savvy. This speaker was super simple to set up works great. I use it for music and audio books. Love it!
5,I bought this to use in the classroom when my projector/smart board would not be loud enough to hear.  It hooked up to the Bluetooth quickly and has more than enough volume for the room.  Reasonable priced sturdy attractive.
5,I work in a procedure room like an OR I wanted something with really good quality that was small and easily turned on and off. We were using the computer for music but the sound is awful. I was so happy with the Doss system! It’s just what I was looking for and the price can’t be beat. Same sound as the Bose age a fraction of the cost! Thank you!!!!
5,Not bad at all
5,Ordered my first one and was to be defective as it had a background noise I send a recoding to DOSS and they asked me to send this one back to them postage paid by Doss . They wanted to know what cause this issue.They send me a replacement at no cost to me very quickly  this one is perfect  they were eager to please me a.s.a.p.I am very satisfied with the product and the personal were easy to deal with  the turn over was done wothout delay.Will buy again laterI strongly recommend them
5,This is a great company and great product. When I ordered it from Amazon I was shipped the wrong color but Wonders Tech went out of their way to make sure I received the correct color. I love the sound quality it's small and easy to transport and it very easy to use. For such a small speaker it boasts great sound and quality. There are no negatives here only great things to say about the product which is offered for a terrific price. I've purchased more expensive versions but this is by far the best! Plus Wonders Tech is a wonderful company to work with and stands behind their products. Highly recommend!!!
5,It is nice and load and superior sound I was not expecting the sound quality to be so good out of such a small speaker. it connects pretty good and quickly and lasts for a long time without being charged
5,These little speakers have great quality for the price and size.Work well with XM.
4,I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of sound. Very clear and the volume was absolutely amazing. Totally would recommend getting this device
4,I love this speaker I can take it anywhere
3,I hated to send this back but I did.  I thought initially for the price it would be a great bargain.  However there was a hiss to it as well as a noticeable lack of bass sound.  I compared it using Nick Cave's Into My Arms and my Bose Soundlink Color Bluetooth which I also purchased from Amazon.  There was simply no comparison.  The DOSS bluetooth speaker was virtually no better than listening to the song on my iMac whereas the same song on the Bose was like having Nick in the room.  Unfortunately the Bose Soundlink Color Bluetooth has been replaced by Bose II which I am sadly going to try.  I wish I had bought two of the original Bose when they were in stock.  They've added a microphone to the Bose II which I am betting diminishes the quality of the speaker even though reviews seem good.
3,Sadly I have to return this device. It started playing a random dial tone every so often whenever it's on whether I'm playing something or not. I have no idea how to fix it so I have to just send it back. Before this started I absolutely loved this. It was so loud and the touch features were top notch! I used it daily and am so bummed that I have to return it. I wish they knew what the problem was and could just send me another one. But on a side note if you do buy this you get a full refund for this dial tone issue. I do not regret getting it at all while it worked it was wonderful. All I can really say is they should look into this problem and fix it because other than that issue it's a great buy for a decent price!
4,Bought this on prime day based on originally listed price thought i was getting a great deal.  Not too bad for the money but based on my experience the bluetooth doesnt seem to bring out the deeper base capabilities of this speaker however it is possible this is due to the recording quality of my mp3s.  Dynamic range is awsome with a micro sd inserted.  Battery does last a lonnnggg time which is good.  Still wish I had gotten a bose or jawbone instead.
5,The sound is very good. The size is perfect for using in the house on the deck or our little travel traveler.  Easy to pair with any device.  Seems to be solidly built.  A full charge lasts 6 - 8 hours.  For the price this is a great speaker.  This would make a great gift for someone.  UPDATE: May 2019 Just bought a second one to keep at our lake home.  For the money and compact size...this is a great speaker.  I listen to a lot of podcasts with this along with music.  Works great.
5,Ok...look no  further. I read most of the reviews on these little guys. I was looking for a mid range bluetooth speaker for price and quality.WOW.....This speaker rocks! It's loud and has a good quality sound. The speaker has some weight to it and doesn't feel cheap.So...If you are like some you might be embarrassed to say you only paid $29.99 for this speaker and want to impress those that you spent 100 bucks. Go ahead ..dig deeper into your pocket and you may get better sound for more money...but maybe you won't. Good luck!.
1,Very disappointed.  I meant to use this for audiobooks but the speaker chops up the audio and cuts the first word off of most sentences.
5,This is a great little speaker for the price and easy to pair. It has a hiss which is heard on quieter music but good sound for power metal and symphonies.The music drops once in awhile. But it is definitely a nice speaker and good purchase. For all the negative reviewers. I challenge you to find a better quality speaker for the price. I am a professional musician and find the little speaker good for the size and price. It can fill a 30 ft. by 40 ft. room or larger. Great for camping beach and outside parties.
5,This was a very inexpensive purchase.  I wanted a Bluetooth speaker that I could use in my garage and shop.  This unit has an amazing sound for the price.  I am very pleased with this purchase.
3,Very cool compact Bluetooth Wireless Speaker. Needed something to stream music from Laptop in living room to our outside deck table. This has great sound for a small device with good Bass level and volume control. Only wish it used external batteries for longer playtime. 3 hours will not be enough when doing a 7-8 hour bbq smoking session on patio. Takes 3hrs to recharge that is the only negative. External AA or AAA rechargables would have been better design. When internal battery fails or wears out this will be a throw away. Also no way to verify what type of battery is on inside. Will use it a few times to decide weather to keep due to battery issue. Thought of connecting a USB charging block while using to see if that will extend the run time a couple more hours. Deducted 2 stars for battery issue
5,speaker is good.
4,Works good for my use
5,This is likely the best product for the price in this category. I had no problem pairing the speaker with a handful of Bluetooth devices in my house.The sound quality is not exceptional but good enough. Deep bass can only be generated with large speakers so there is no miracle here. The description does not clearly state that the power supply is NOT included. This is not a problem since most of us have many 5V adapters from old/new phones. I rather use the good quality ones instead of getting another cheap one with each product I buy.Product performed well so we decided to order another one.
5,We needed a speaker that could sit wireless next to my husbands chair so he could hear the TV which is across the room. Our home is open concept and sometimes i couldn’t  hear MY tv because HIS was so loud! His new tv has bluetooth capability so this was the perfect speaker. The sound is great! Plus he can adjust the volume on the speaker OR on his tv remote! Cant beat the price either! I might just buy myself one! Just connect to your bluetooth and its ready to go!
4,I use it in my bathroom it works great
5,This little thing is a beast! I've used it almost daily for a few weeks now and I'm obsessed with it. Great sound louder than most bluetooth speakers long battery life - I'm really happy with this thing. The only thing I wish (and maybe I just haven't figured out how to do it yet) - I wish I could also Fast Forward/Rewind as I'm using the speakers for dance practice and sometimes want to start in the middle of a song. I do enjoy the Play/Pause/Next Arrows. Volume control is easy and quick with the touch circle. Excellent value highly recommend.
5,So happy I bought this! I Was hesitant to purchase - but so glad I did. Sound quality is really good battery has only had to charge once so far - very impressed! I was going back and forth between buying an Apple speaker. Bought this for the price - very happy!
5,I've been wanting an external speaker for my phone to use while working out having dance parties with my kids or singing in the shower and with the abundant amount of amazing reviews I had to give this one a shot. It did not disappoint. I've used it every day since it arrived and I can't recommend it enough.
5,I’ve had this speaker for over two years and it has withstood the test of time. First of all it’s been dropped splashed you name it I’m not gentle or careful with my things. This speaker sounds as good as it did from day one and the battery life is still strong. The bass is amazing and sound quality is excellent. The only slightly annoying thing is when you turn it up all the way it beeps and the music stops playing but it’s well worth it for the quality of this speaker
5,Great sound. Well built and sturdy. Perfect for at home garage workouts or hangouts with friends. High enough volume for such a small speaker. And the battery life is long enough.
2,Sound quality: GoodAppearance and features: Fairly good standard speakerUsage: PoorThe forward button is broken. I don't mean I can't hit forward. I mean I'll start playing something and once it starts acting up every 2 seconds or less it will jump to the next video or song. It's maddening when you're stuck in the shower and suddenly the thing you were listening to jumps to something else to something else to something else.... I'd return this if I could but it looks like I waited a bit too long. Ended up just getting another Google Nest Mini so I can yell at it from the shower.
2,I have a problem with it cutting out and stop playing for a few seconds pretty frequently. I contacted support and was told it was a bluetooth connectivity issue and that if I use a cord it should stop having that issue which is all well and great but that's why I bought a speaker with bluetooth capabilities so I didn't have to have my phone connected by a cord. So that is a huge disappointment. I will try it out with a cord or try to transfer on to an ad card to see if that helps but I'm debating in returning the item. It's kind of pointless to have a wireless speaker if there is bluetooth connectivity issues. But battery life is decent could be better. Sound quality is pretty decent.
5,Great product for poolside adventures or grilling on the patio with family!
5,I ordered this item on a lighting deal without any hassle it was delivered promptly. I'm actually surprised at the weight of the speaker it feels really high quality and looks great. It is a Christmas gift so I will have to get feedback on the quality of it from my wife later but as far as I can tell it appears to be a great item.
5,I love it I’ve had others that stopped working after a while but this one is great use it all the time love the sound I got my favorite color red.
5,Great sound easy to use.
4,This is the second one I'm buying. The previous one lasted for about a year and a half. And then he just broke. Still worth it for the price.
5,I needed a speaker for playing music in my room really loudly to annoy everyone else in my house. This puppy works like a CHARM! Not only does my family hate me but they’ve all gone deaf since I made this purchase. For this price I’d expect minor hearing loss maybe not being able to hear high frequencies... but this exceeded all expectations. Never again will someone in my house have to use their eardrums again as they are all completely obliterated. Good sound thanks DOSS never heard of you but you really did it
3,This is the second speaker from DOSS having replaced the first one after about 6 months...they did in fact replace the faulty speaker and this one ( the  replacement) has been working fine until last week...just about 2 years from date of purchase (July 2016).I haven't done anything differently nor have I moved dropped nor in anyway misused the speaker and it's cracking terribly.I guess it's done since I can't find any reason in the FAQ for this to be happening.I googled "speakers crackling" and the general answer was wires loose or some other internal failure.SO it was good for two years and now it's garbage.Guess next speaker will be SONOS or BOSE
5,I initially got this speaker as a gift for a friend because she loves listening to music. She could not stop raving about how much she loves it and how great the sound quality was. I eventually purchased one for myself and I'm happy with that decision. There's a lot of power in this little box and the sound quality is also great. Easy controls and easy to pair; I've paired it with  my TV phone and laptop. Works great!
5,I bought this for my wife who is not enamored of electronics. She listens to her phone like its an old transistor radio (as do I sometimes!) but I thought she'd like this for her work setup. She loves it. It was a cinch to link the speaker to her phone and she is not intimidated by the simple controls on the speaker. And she's very happy with the sound. I took a chance on it--it's incredibly affordable--and I would recommend it. The footprint is a little larger than most portable bluetooth speakers but it's still quite compact. Might have to get one for MY work setup...
4,Works well. Sounds great. Can fill a large room with music easily. I use it with my Samsung phone Bluetooth and it finds the device quickly. The only down side if I have to find one is keeping the phone in the same room. If there is too much distance or walls between phone a d speaker the quality goes down or breaks up. All in all its a good deal and a good product.
3,I paid $34.99 at the time of purchase. This item is a bit tricky to rate because I love the idea of it but it is lacking in a few areas. I like the futuristic design of the buttons and volume. However the device tends to feel a little cheap. The more I played with it the more it started to look like a child's toy. Especially compared to the other two speakers I purchased. I tested the Anker SoundCore Bluetooth Speaker and Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3. The DOSS won second place but the OontZ was in a clear first place. The DOSS is loud! Its the only area in which this device competed with the OontZ. I wish I could get the build quality of the OontZ put into the innovative design of the DOSS as I love the buttons on this thing. Not a bad speaker but not the best out there.
3,Product is really terrific HOWEVER after a couple of weeks it started to skip songs sometimes after 30 seconds sometimes it would play two to five songs in a row for a few seconds each. After analyzing the source of the problem I finally figured out it was actually the DOSS speaker. This occurred after fully charging the unit; as explained in the owner's manual it may skip songs if it requires charging which was not the situation.I contacted Amazon CS explained the problem and they immediately refunded my purchase price and I bought a second unit.  After a few weeks the new unit is working perfectly. I would have given it five stars for the sound quality and value (I also own two Bose units at more than 5x the price each) but in light of the issue I thought three stars was appropriate.
5,Is not super loud but sufficient. At full volume there is little distortion and battery is awesome. Bluetooth connect always with no error or mid play disconnect. Really good prize. You get more than what you pay. Touch controls are cool and always work. I would only add/fix a no light mode since the led in the touch sensors are really bright. So if using for sleep music light might keep you up. Also a bit more bass if your lessening to bass heavy music it might not be of your liking
5,I have two of these speakers. They work great!! In fact the one fell off my Harley at around 55 mph and rolled down the road. I turned around figuring it would be in pieces. To my disbelief I pulled up and it was still in one piece and playing my music. Just scratched up a bit. Now that’s a great durable product!!
4,Works very well no problems at all.Good product good price. 4👍
5,This was the best 25.00 speaker. I have 600' of range  and the charge lasts a long time. I use it for my chromebook and can carry the speaker into another room without hauling my laptop around. I got a red one so I wouldn't lose it - lol.  Boots up as bluetooth in 10 seconds. Pleased with purchase.6 weeks later the speaker does not work
5,One of the best bluetooth speakers I've ever used. The bluetooth range is outstanding. I can have my phone on the other side of the house and the speaker still works. I noticed a few reviews expressing frustrations with the sound level. You can manually adjust sound levels by tracing the center knob with your finger either clockwise or counterclockwise. That easily adjusts the sound.
4,It's a good bluetooth speaker  batter life is long and has good sound quality.  Had unit plugged in charging power loss and unit will not operate must have took a jolt during outage now I have a paper weight.
5,I was really surprised that the sound that came out of this little speaker. What would have made it perfect would have been if it had a remote as well. But I still highly recommend it.
4,when using the bluetooth it causes the skip button to go off I guess so I always have to plug it up. doesn't get that loud if you like really loud music but its enough for everyday
5,I bought this to have a convenient wireless speaker that's easy to use and sounds decent. It fills the bill completely for my needs and the cost is very low for the quality in my opinion. It provides a surprising level of volume for the size of the speaker. CAVEAT: If you are an audiophile who wants high end concert hall sound with all the equalizer thingies then invest in one of those. This is great for listening to podcasts and general purpose use. (I did play a high-end recording of Bach cello suites through it that sounded remarkably good.)
4,This speaker does not have Bose quality bass response but it has excellent quality sound for the money.  I have very happy with it.  I use it all the time while working in the garage and at BBQs.  Very sturdy - like a little brick.  I don't worry about breaking it.
2,It worked okay for the first 14 months I had it. Sound quality is average nothing to write home about. Just good enough. Now the bluetooth search feature won't turn off it keeps looking for a bluetooth to connect to it doesn't find one then starts the process over and over endlessly. There are constant signal notifications coming from it at all hours. Once in a while the notification signal sounds that it did connect to a bluetooth but then it promptly disconnects again and the process starts all over endlessly. I'm about to throw it out the window. It won't shut off. I long press the on/off switch and I think it's off a few seconds later it has turned itself back on again. Super annoying piece of junk.
5,I was very pleasantly surprised with the sound quality and ease of connectivity.  As for battery life I have not had or used it long enough to make a determination.
3,I bought this for my really small outdoor wedding renewal ceremony.. That was at a park.. and you couldn't even HERE This Dang on thing Untill you were ALMOST RIGHT UP CLOSE TO IT!! WAS SOOO VERY DISAPPOINTED!! My Guest Still got the point Anyway. 🤦‍♀️ I ABSOLUTELY Would say.. If your Needing This For Something as I Needed It For... Do Even Waste Your Money!! Keep Looking...
4,Great sound for the price! Battery is good. Only issue is that when the volume is on max the “bass” causes it to play the next song...even when in the middle of the current song.
1,I would like a refund got in July and now it doesn’t connect at all. Kind of annoyed.
5,This speaker is great. I blew my computer speaker a while ago and I didn't really want to spend money on fixing it. The bluetooth is super easy. The charge is great. The sound is really good especially for the price. Highly recommend.
1,I am disappointed. This product is not turning on anymore and I only used it 2 times this supposed to be the 3rd time for me to use it and couldn’t turned on even with a complete charge still did not come on. I just got it from you in March. I need you to send me a return slip so I can return it and get my refund back. This speaker doesn’t look anything like what on the on the picture. I just watched it and the video. Totally different.
5,I bought this thing several years ago and i was skeptical about it because it was pretty cheap; However it turned out to be everything i wished for. It connects right away to my iphone battery life is pretty good i charge it once every week. The sound quality is awesome and it is quite sterdy i travelled with it everywhere.
5,Small but mighty! Incredibly loud for its size. And great battery life.
5,Looking for a great sound without spending $100? This speaker is for you. On spotify you can crank up the bass sound and this speaker delivers. Truly amazed that a speaker this small can produce such clear sound and the battery lasts a looonnnggg time. I've had mine for 5 days and left it on overnight once and the battery is still good. Dont waste your money on something stupid expensive. Doss figured it out. I want to buy one in ever color for every room in my house. Love it!
4,Follow up 10/13/17I just got a new one delivered today.I didn't even ask for it. don't even know how they knew about it.But I have to give them points for trying so hard on customer service.Thank you Wonders Tech.I'll give this a try.(below was my original review)Bluetooth connection is iffy.it turns itself offgot rid of it and got another one from Anker.Anker works much better.
1,I read a lot of reviews did some research slept on it for two weeks before I decided to purchase. It arrived as stated in order. No qualms there. I charged it as stated in the mini manual that came along. Supposedly it was at 100% but per my phone checking the battery it was only 90%. That’s a bummer already considering that it doesn’t state 100%. How am I supposed to know that I’ll be getting the supposed hours of playback as stated? Idk. The material and sounds quality were superb! I love how it felt very high quality and the sound was awesome. Major and most disappointing downfall....it skipped my songs a lot via Bluetooth connection. The next button would flicker as if touched and the skip onto the next song. It did this to me the first night. Of which I overlooked considering it could be just a one time thing. Nope. I was wrong! It kept skipping my songs. If I wanted a speaker to dj and remix my songs for me I’d buy a DJ table not a speaker. I reached out to the seller in regards about it. I did everything that I was told and then I’m told that it could be my WiFi connection that’s disrupting the Bluetooth connection. I was offered a possible replacement for a faulty product.  Used it a few times before I said whatever and returned it. I’m not going to chance that the replacement could be faulty too. Overall I had a bad experience. I can’t speak for everyone but in my personal experience I was really disappointed and will not purchase.
5,Sound is clear and loud.
5,Sound quality is clear and loud! The volume can be adjusted through touch. I had a another bluetooth speaker before this one which was not so great. It was a few dollars cheaper and messed up within few months. I eould rather spend a few more dollars and get a quality product. Im hoping this one will last long and continue to work the way it does. I will update my review in few months.
5,Very loudspeaker very durable and super easy to carry around the battery life is amazing don’t really have to charge all the time
4,I just recieved this speaker on Friday but i have used it for a few hours now so i have some experience with it. The speaker is just about 360 so the flow and sound is good for the price. I purchased the white speaker....but it comes it differnt colors. So far so good it looks good package arrived on time. No complaints from me yet! Lol....I'll get back to you after a few weeks.
5,Sound is great but not to much bass
4,Nice rich sound good volume and works good with Alexa
5,Amazing speaker! So glad I purchased it the sound quality is superb!
4,It's fine for the price.  You can't expect much from a device this size (I don't care who the manufacturer is) so as long as those are your expectations you won't be disappointed.  It provides audio that is of decent quality.  It was very easy to set up.  I can't say much about the battery at this point but time will tell.  Overall it meets my expectations for this device.
4,It's definitely a good deal for just $30 it's well worth it. My only complaint and the reason that I can't give it five stars is because of what happens when I try to stream stuff from YouTube or music for Google music. Sometimes when I try to play these the speaker will skip stutter and forward and at time it's can get very annoying. However when I play music that is downloaded on my phone the speaker plays no problem. But I would still recommend this speaker to anyone.
5,Easy to pairing and use. Sounds quality is very good . I like Battery playback time.
5,I was surprised how quick it was to setup. Little box with a powerful sound. Able to connect with iPhone and Mac laptop pretty seamlessly. It is pretty sensitive on the buttons so be careful moving it around during a zoom call.
5,I am a Bass Player and was really not expecting anything this small to put out bass waves. WOW! This thing RIPS! Really great sound. You will be very pleased I am.
4,This speaker has great sound quality and it's super easy to connect. The only flaw is the volume button is not a button it's a circular touch thing on the top. It sometimes does not work if your finger is wet (as I reach out of the shower to turn it up). Overall happy with it.
3,The sound is good but I found the touch buttons lacking. If you don’t hit them exactly in the right spot or if you hold too much or not enough they won’t work correctly. The volume is also pretty tricky to figure out how to get it to work. Overall I wouldn’t buy again
5,I always had a problem with little speakers because I like bass in my music. Hell I spent extra money on Bluetooth headphones specially for bass. I've used this for three days now. The bass is ridiculous! It shook my floor while playing "Thirty Seconds to Mars". I would recommend this to anyone.
4,Could be a touch louder but still a good value
4,Great little portable speaker  I originally bought these for a project at work.  They sounded great for the price so ended up buying for home too. Decent sound quality  loud enough to hear a couple rooms away.  Very easy to use  my son synced it to his device and userd it without reading any instructions. Pleased with the purchase  would recommend
5,I put this in my bathroom...it's perfect for that.
4,Would not connect through Bluetooth to Alexa had to go to app on your phone
5,I am very happy with this speaker. I was reluctant at first as i ready negative reviews about it but I just bought it to try it myself. This speaker is very cheap but the quality of sound is lovely. I have it for around 3 or 4 months now without any problems. I was also surprised that the battery life is good too. You can listen for around 5 to 6 hours continuously without charging it. I am very happy with this purchase and I highly recommend this speaker.
5,I had never bought a product from Doss until now.I will surely be checking into any other Doss products when shopping. This Speaker is the greatest value purchase I have ever made.The quality of sound is simply amazing  Much Better than my Bose Wireless speaker ever was.The interface is simple and we'll thought out.The battery has so far delivered 16 straight hours of use on a full charge and could have gone on further...it seems to be a solid durable piece and great for the beach the boat or listening to your favorite podcast....BUY THIS and you WILL BE HAPPY....Well Done DOSS...
4,Tl:dr; buy the speaker if on discount value for money bought at $24Pros:Wide frequency response treble and bass both are balancedSound doesn't distort at high/full volumeAmazing battery back-upAesthetic designCons:Tends to lose bass at outdoorsConsistent hissing sound noticeable at high volume when the song is not playing (main reason for giving 4 stars)Bass could have been little more (i have to put it at corner to amplify the bass)
1,I didn't use it all that much for the first 9 months or so.  After that I wanted to use it a lot more.  After just a few weeks it simply turned itself off randomly all the time - sometimes after 15 minutes sometimes after 20 seconds.  Made no difference if it is plugged in or not.  Then even after that it started making a horrible distorted sound.  So after a few weeks of proper use it's basically useless.  Don't buy it.
4,Just have this in use about a week now and so far so good.  I'm using this sometimes in a bathroom where it will have some humidity to contend with so I'll update this review if that causes problems in the future.  But the sound is very good for the price (best to keep the volume at full on your device and use the volume on the speaker to control overall volume.)  I'd recommend.
4,Sound quality was surprisingly good for price
4,Great sound and battery life....would recommend for anyone who likes quality sound on the go
4,I love the capacitive buttons and the fact that it has dedicated buttons for track forward & backwards. Not a lot of speakers have that option. The capacitive buttons are backlit but unfortunately the light went out on my track forward button. Still works but doesn’t light up. Overall it’s a good speaker for the price connects reliably to your device and has some decent bass.
5,I have had this speaker for two years and 2 months. I use it in the bathroom and I love it so much. Excellent quality and works just like it did on day one. I am for sure gonna buy another one if this one stops working!
3,It works but audio quality is not so hot. I would not recommend or purchase again.
5,I like that it’s small easy to use and to connect too
5,One of the best speaker 🔊 on the planet probably one of the most underrated. I’m in love with this speaker. I tried upgrading to an Altek Versa but the quality of sound and the bass didn’t come close to The Doss Speaker I did a review on on YouTube and from now on whenever I Review Speakers I make sure to compare them to the Doss cause the punch it packs for the price is unbelievable. SomePeople go for name brand but they will not find a speaker as good and as affordable as the Doss.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I think this speaker has great quality for the price. I was looking for something to connect with my Alexa for my living room and I have had almost no complaints with this speaker. The only thing that bums me out is the volume adjustment the touch-scroll function is a little jank but besides that I love this speaker.
5,Bought one for myself because of the highly rated reviews was very impressed. Told my mom about it and ordered one for her. She is veryyyyy pleased. However I’m looking into a louder one. Downfall: the battery dying sound is annoying.
4,I received my White DOSS speaker and its the perfect size to move around the house when I want to hear my music. The sound quality is very good but I was a little disappointed on the short battery life. It seems like 3-4 hours. I do plug it in which is no big deal just a little disappointed. Not sure if this would make it for full a beach day.
4,worked well as intended
5,I bought this just to get a simple speaker to stream music and I was surprised how well they are designed and work and sound for less then 30 USD. I might by another pair in white because the black ones really get hot in the sun outdoors. One wonderful feature is to preload a miniSD card and it just plays endlessly from there.One more hidden feature that it even has a microphone build-in and you can use it like a head set on zoom meetings etc.
3,I found this did not even last 2 years. As I read how to solve my issue with it not turning off it seems this was very common among users who bought this item. It just won't stay turned off. and keeps turning on and off all the time. annoying. I would not buy this product again.
4,Surprisingly good for the price
5,This speaker is totally amazing. I wish I could have got it a long time ago. Music is my passion. This is not an ordinary speaker it's one like I've never seen to be the size it is. I can't even turn it up half way lol. You can hear every little detail in the songs. This product needs 10 stars! It's got a bag to put it in if you travel. I can't say how much I appreciate this speaker and also the bass and treble and all that good stuff is amazing because it blends so great.
5,This speaker is great and is a really good price! It pairs quicly no problems. My son chose the blue one and it's really fun looking. The sound is amazing.
5,Works awesome really nice speaker.
5,Speaker works great it is really loud sounds like a huge stereo system we love it perfect product looks great sounds great I highly recommend it
5,I got a recommendation from a young friend and ordered it right away. I'm sure there are more deluxe wireless speakers out there but this little unit is just what I needed. Set up is very quick easy to the point of intuitive and it just works right out of the box. The sound is great for music podcasts audiobooks everything. I like how you can control volume play/pause and skip/go back from the unit or from my device or laptop. I've been using it for about a week now and it seems solid. All this for under $30!
4,The speaker it self works really well and I really do enjoy it but it came with bad cords. The charging cord could not charge the speaker fully so I had to find one that fit it and the Aux cord is not very good either it creates a lot of static but my own aux cord works perfectly well. It was just a little bogus that I had to have the cords to charge because the ones it came with don't work!
5,I love this thing. Sound quality is good connecting is a breeze. I play Pandora from my phone through it in my apartment and it does the job very nicely.
4,The speaker is really good especially for the price.  It gets really loud and the sound isn't distorted.  Very good if you're having a small get together.  The only thing is the blue-tooth quality could be a bit more stronger.
5,I like watching tv late at night while everyone else is sleeping this makes it so I don’t have to worry about keeping others awake! Works great!
5,I use this for everything from music to football games. The sound quality is awesome. I connect via my laptop so I can listen to football or music while working in the house. I am extremely pleased with the quality of the speaker. It's got a lot of punch for such a small box. I bought white. It's nice and clean looking. Good for the kitchen.
3,When using with my laptop(linux) If I don't listen anything for 10-15 min it's does turns off.Even when plugged in and charging.Then when I want watch video or listen something I have to turn it on pair change output in sound settings.Then I work on something else... and by the moment when I need to listen something else t's already off !!!Otherwise it's good device.Bass not very good but it's not a $100 device.
5,I loved it until the battery just stopped taking a charge suddenly after 9 months! This speaker has great sound for its size and price. It really is a shame the battery is inferior.Just an update the People frommDOSS contacted me after reading my review with the excellent customer service like this and a great product ( mine was just a defect) I have to change this review to 5 stars! I have a brAnd new speaker and could not be happier! All company’s should be so Thorough!!! I delighted. Thanks again!!!!!!
5,I listen to audio books via an app for my library.  This speaker is perfect for my small (10' x 10') workshop.  And when a phone call comes in it just switches over and I am able to answer calls hands free.
3,This speaker’s sound quality is good. However unlike my other bluetooth wireless speakers this speaker shuts off frequently if you’re temporarily not playing music and the only way to reconnect your device is to walk over to the speaker and manually turn it back on. This happens even when the speaker is plugged in. I’d rather it allow me to decide when to turn it off or stay on longer. Maybe I’m looking for a different song to play sitting on my couch and the speaker turns off during the decision and I have to get back up to turn it on.My other speaker would go on low battery power but stay on (plugged in or not) so I could decide to play music without walking over to it and manually turning it on each time.
5,The sound on this is awesome just like my Bose.  I was shocked.  I put my speaker in another room and connected in another.  The sound was clear and loud.  Perfect for a projector outdoors with guess watching a movie.
5,I really really like this.  I will be ordering at least two more.  The one I have now is in my office at work.  I want to order another for home and as a gift for a friend.  When it connects to bluetooth there is a loud connection sound.  I contacted DOSS and asked if there was a way to turn down the connection sound.  They sent me the update to take the sound down almost immediately. Really good customer service and the delivery was fast as promised.  This does not have a small speak sound.  Highly recommend.
5,This Soundbook is the ****! Bass and sound is on point and it easily connected to my phone via bluetooth. Sorry to any naysayers who do not agree but I am in love with this device!
4,Good loud sound but randomly wavers in quality. I haven't tried Bluetooth because I use it as my main sound for my PC so it's always USB connected. Battery life does kinda suck though so I feel like I have to charge it daily. Great price though.
5,The volume on the speaker is phenomenal.  I use it in the bathroom and it's loud enough to hear over a shower. Pairs easily with all of my devices and holds a charge very well when you use it outside without a power source.Update - after 5 years of regular use the speaker suddenly started malfunctioning and was unable to properly pair with my iPhone.  I decided it was well worth buying a replacement and am super happy with the the latest version of the speaker (may be my imagination but the volume seems even more powerful without any distortion).
5,This is the beat bluetooth speaker ive ever had now although i have had a jbl this doss is great its super great for the price im going to buy another one for a flamily member that keeps useing mine insted of his jbl like i said this is a no. 1 bluetooth speaker ..We all love it
5,I bought it back in September and had some technical issues with it. I loved the speaker then it put out some serious sound and bass when I used it. I contacted the store with my issue and they replaced it with no problem with super fast delivery! I told them about my issue Friday evening Jan 5th. I received my replacement speaker today Monday Jan 8th! Still putting out that amazing sound for such a small speaker with a great price tag! Thank you again Wonder Tech with your speedy response and fast shipping; this speaker is amazing!
5,When I received this speaker it came w/o any cables. I considered sending it back to Amazon because I've had horrible quality control from them recently but instead contacted the seller/manufacturer directly. The individual I spoke with on the phone was really helpful and even sent me a complete package (speaker AND cables) to fix the issue instead of just the cables which is what I had originally hoped for/expected. The speaker(s) have lived up to their claims and proven themselves useful in a variety of settings. Great sound balance and high quality.
5,Works great for such small speaker  has good sound and runs all day on charge . Money well spent !
5,I read many reviews before purchasing this speaker. I was stuck between this one and another one. I'm so glad I went with this one. IT WAS A GREAT PURCHASE! It's portable. It sounds great has some bass to it. Easy to use and easy to set up.
5,The speaker set works just fine.  The sound quality is better for lectures than full fidelity music however it is fine in my uses.  It does lack a charge indicator though unless I missed it in the instructions.
2,Great sound and battery life nice solid speaker but the charging port is very flimsy so now after charging a couple of times the charger port broke which makes this speaker useless
5,bluetooth is quick after first hook and I love the sound. It sounds real nice in my living room but best in my kitchen. I like to binge watch and also cook with video instruction. Easy to hear over cooking bustle
5,We love our speakers! I've seen so many super expensive speakers and I'm so glad we were able to find one that is like $30 and works great. We have small backyard parties occasionally with around 20-ish people and it works great for that. If you were looking to blast music for a HUGE space you might consider something else but for backyard BBQ's and every day purposes this is a great speaker!
5,I’ve been wanting a Bluetooth speaker for a while and haven’t been able to find a good one for a good price. But after reading the reviews for this one and reading how the customer service is great I decided to buy this. I’m very glad I did. It’s small but has a punch. I’m very pleased with the sound. My toddler loves it. She will point to the speaker and say “again!” And I’ll play her favorite songs. So that’s another plus! I’m very happy I bought this. Thanks!
3,My original post was for only 1 star because the speaker stopped working after only 2 weeks but because Wonder Tech replaced my original with a new one and the new speaker has worked without a hitch since I got it I upped my rating to 3 stars. The only reason I did not update it to 4 or 5 stars was because this does not seem to be an isolated event there are many posts on here where the speaker malfunctioned after only a short time frame or short amount of use. I am a firm believer that the first time should have been the last time I had to purchase or receive this product until I decided to get a second one or it just wore out over the years. Wonders Tech still has a ways to go for complete customer satisfaction but I believe they are on the right track.
5,great bang for the buck. I can finally turn it up and dance best purchase I've made. all around great speaker. i'm so happy with how easy it is to use and amazing sound. i recommend highly!
4,This is great! Just what I orderedandas good as I expected.🎶👍
4,Good little speaker for great price
5,The DOSS speakers are perfect for my garage gym. I had Oontz speakers but they died within about 6 months and sounded tinny. These are much better.
3,Well it did work great but I wouldn’t say waterproof. My sprinklers came on and got it wet. Now it doesn’t work.
5,No complaints it's performing beautifully. It has a full rich sound with easy blue-tooth connectivity and not to mention its decorative looks would do it an injustice. Battery-life has been excellent and lasting. We took it to the beach and it pretty-much carried out its functions throughout the day. I can find myself taking this to the office for some added ambiance with regards to background sounds. As a speaker device for cell-phone calls mine worked flawlessly. I used it for a three-way conference call and it handled that task without incident. And as I close let me add this little tid-bit. The price was right. It was money well-spent....
5,Nothing to dislike.  Nice compact size.  Paired with my iPhone simply and quickly.  Delivers really nice sound (decent bass) and volume for the size of the speaker.  I have not played it long enough at a time to run the battery empty so I can't honestly speak to how long it will run between charges.  The longest I have ever had it going straight was 3.5 hours.  I also ordered the case which goes specifically with the speaker and am very happy with it.
5,Sounds great for it's size. It's cool how you can answer a phone call using the microphone.
5,I got this for my teenager for Christmas and she loves it! She uses it everyday and it have great sound. It's also compact which makes it nice to take to the park or beach.
5,We have purchased many other Bluetooth speakers and this is our second one (only because we lost the first one).  The battery life on other speakers hasn’t compared to this one and the sound quality is good.  It’s pretty loud; loud enough for the average backyard party.
5,Absolutely love the battery life. The volume is controlled on the device not the speaker.
4,This speaker is better than I expected for a $30 speaker. It plays really loud if the room isn't that large and the touch feature is great. I sit and play with the speakers volume going around and around. Connectivity is really simple. I haven't tried the TF card feature yet. Only downside is the speaker dies after about 3-4 hours of consecutive use but charges after about an hour. Overall after 3 weeks of use I'd definitely buy another.
5,For what I paid I'm incredibly impressed. The sound is loud clear and rich. I know people with the Bose portable speakers and you can tell the difference but I can't tell $175 worth of difference. Not to mention I'm not worried about taking this places or the kids moving it or precariously placing it in the rafters of a pop up canopy whereas with a $200 speaker it'd probably never leave my kitchen. It's survived a summer at the beach and a handful of falls from the aforementioned precarious perching.Really like the voice feedback it sounds like Sulu to my poorly trained and badly remembering ear.
5,I bought this as a gift for my wife......I have a BOSE Sound Wave speaker that I paid around $200 for and use it a lot. She wanted a speaker of her own. I read some great reviews and decided to surprise her. She was and so was I......The sound is incredible for the price! The only real difference is the bass. Otherwise the two are hard to tell apart. I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a high quality sound at a very reasonable price! Enjoy!!
5,Got the speaker actually earlier than expected it automatically paired with my iPhone and it sounds amazing.  When I saw how small it was I thought it wouldn’t sound real good.  It sounds great!!!
1,Bought this for my girlfriend's all pink room. She has a modern Galaxy phone and after using the speaker for a handful of time she can no longer connect to it via bluetooth.Unfortunately we can no longer send it back and the troubleshooting just covers the basics like "did you try turning it on?" Bitch please.Also the sound is awful. Both her laptop speakers and mine rip this thing to shreds.You get what you pay for.
5,This is the second off these speakers that I've purchased. The first one was dropped and malfunctioned as a result but I was happy to replace it. The sound is wonderful quality for the size and price of the speaker. It fills the whole downstairs and is crystal clear. I also own the SoundboxPlus and it is equally as impressive.
5,79 years old no problem hooking it up. Keep it where I am setting to hear the TV WORKS GREAT!
5,I bought this for my 84 year old mother and she loves it. The buttons light up so she can see how to turn it on and make adjustments. Easy to use!
5,My PC doesn't have speakers with it so I wanted something wireless to enable sound (I have enough wires sprawling over my desk as it is).  This little box isn't particularly loud ie just wouldn't do for a party but it's perfect for listening to music whilst working and would work well when camping or on the beach too.  Charge lasts about 4-6 hours I think but it charges fairly quickly.  Easy to use with basic controls on the top/front and a nice LED light.  Powers down after about an hour to save battery life.
5,For the price point on this speaker the quality is very good. I am very impressed with the sound- volume and presence pleased me.  I am also pleased with the battery life which seems to last for me at 12 hours of playing. The speaker also has an automatic shut off if not in use.
5,This is my third DOSS Soundbox from Amazon. These are the best small bluetooth speaks I have ever had.  Sound is great. Long battery life. Excellent bluetooth connectivity. I have two for home and one for the office.  I am a lawyer and I used my office one at meetings.  It always impresses people. When I tell them the price they look very surprised.
5,We had another bluetooth player that was bulky.  I saw this one that was very compact and charges with a USB connection to recharge the batteries.  We have just had and used since Friday so we have to see how long the batteris stay charged.  I had also order a carrying case that goes with it.
5,I enjoy the simple fast connection to my computer's sound system and the excellent quality of the sound.  I recommend for anyone looking for a low cost speaker with no frills and great results.
5,I wanted a speaker for my classroom and so far I’m pleased with this small speaker - it has good sound for a reasonably priced speaker.
4,Great sound for it's size.  The volume control is really cool. For the money I did really well.
5,This is an outstanding speaker. It is easy to connect to iPhone or iPad. The sound quality is awesome it sounds like a much bigger speaker.  We are very pleased and I think my kids are going to get a lot of use out of this speaker.
4,This is my second Doss Soundbox I ordered. My first was for myself. I ordered this for my mother after she didn't like the sound on a more expensive JBL unit.  Returned it for this and she is happy!!  I don't think it would survive a drop or two but it works great and has a great price. I like that it can also take a micro sd card.
5,Good sound.  Easy to pair.  Easy to operate.  Haven't used it enough to comment on battery life.
4,Great sound out of this little speaker charges up fast hook up is easy for my Samsung phone will not work with my Fire tablet
2,I received my speaker- used it multiple times and never thought about the cord to charge it ( it came charged) when I finally needed to charge it no cord in the box. I contacted the company and they basically said " here is 5 bucks go buy a new cord". not thrilled with that answer but the speaker itself is pretty nice wish it had more of a bass sound but its good for picnics by the pool or camping..
5,This speaker is great. The battery life is exceptionally long I think I’ve only had to charge it twice now and I have used it A LOT. The Bluetooth works great and seems to have good range. The only thing I find annoying is the touch volume ring thing (that blue ring to control the volume). It’s a little annoying to use but not a deal breaker for me so I just adjust the volume from my phone.
5,First off you cannot beat this price. Very reasonable for your everyday causal speaker to jam out to! Great sound quality! Volume limit is limited it doesn’t blast if you’re listening from a distance. Perfect for your living room porch garage for simply listening to some good tunes. Battery life is exceptional! Well built. Phenomenal Bluetooth connectivity. Haven’t lost connection yet. I’ve went from basement to 3rd floor and it stay connected. Very pleased and you will be too!
5,Needed a boost in my home gym. Mostly wanted to listen to podcasts while I ran on my treadmill. Works great and I can turn up the volume and finally hear.
5,Only thing i dont like is the touch button. Its cool and all and I thought id like it but its just too easy to change the song or disconnect or anything when on the move or even if you grab it wrong. But overall 5 stars
4,My only suggestion would be a battery life indicator to know if it will need recharging soon
5,I love this little wireless speaker.  The instructions are easy to follow I had no problem whatsoever syncing it to my Alexa. The sound quality is better than I had expected.  I like my music pretty loud when I'm at home and the volume on this isn't as loud as I would like but it does the job.  I don't have any complaints with this speaker at all.  The case is a nice addition so I can take it with me if I choose to do so. I would recommend this speaker.
5,This sucker is solid. Heavy with nice bass. Seems like it is made the way things used to be made. Some people might be turned off by its weight but I like that it is put together well. Definitely worth the $30 I paid and unlike a competing product I bought recently at a major bricks-and-mortar retailer this connects to every single device (all five) that I own. My phone three mp3 players and my Kindle Fire. Love it. It's my go-to speaker now. I feel like I got the better end of this deal.
3,Ok.. I'm giving this 3 stars because of one reason... battery life.  It is not a 12 hour battery life like the description states.  "Long playtime: Built-in Li-Ion 2200 mAh rechargeable battery guarantees up to 12 hours playtime. Recharge in just 3-4 hours with included micro USB cable" which is really the only reason I purchased this speaker. I drive all day long in a company vehicle that does not have a radio and my shifts range from 10-12 hours so i thought hey.. this is perfect.  However after just 6 hours playtime the speaker just cuts out... Which would be fine had i known that.  The sound is 10/10 though and the size for the punch it gives is great.  Just disappointed in the battery life which is kind of a big deal.  Anyways  just thought I'd put my two cents in.
5,I'm over a year into this speaker.  Some reviews when i bought it said it would die out quickly but i have had no issues.  Great value and good performance mean I would recommend this product.  The one complaint I have is the bluetooth connection can be persnickety if the line-of-sight gets blocked.
5,The sound is great it connects well battery life is good. The only thing I have a bit of a problem with is turning it off.
5,I like that it is rugged enough to have on a job site or in my wood shop. Plenty of volume for its size.
5,I bought this for a welcome wedding party for about 60 people to play music. It gets very loud and has good sound quality. I don't think I even had the volume up 1/2 of the way and it was more than enough for our party. It is a great little speaker for the money.
5,I have the pink Speaker which I love the color it has great sound and quality I’ve had for quite a few months now and I love it I would highly recommend totally worth it! Only problem I had is that the cord it originally came with stopped working and I first thought the speaker was broke I used a new cord and then it was charging again just fine.
5,Good solid quality speaker. The only thing I noticed is when I play music there is an occasional popping noise that is a little buggy.
5,A friend let me use the black one I had to get my own. I love it! I love playing music so this is THE speaker to PURCHASE 🙂
4,Pretty good little speaker. Lacks bass. So if you're picky about sound quality this is not your speaker. If you just want to jam some tunes affordably this is it.
4,it's okay
3,I’ve had this system since March 2018.  It’s been a decent speaker system ...until it wasn’t.  The charging port has stretched out enough so that it can’t grasp the part that inserts into it.  It’s impossible to get it to charge for more than a few seconds before it slips out of the port. The sound on this unit is excellent but without being able to charge it properly it’s useless. Really disappointed... this issue is something that should be fixed.
4,Bluetooth not great if you want to switch devices.
4,Good outdoor use for workouts.
5,I never heard of DOSS soundbox but I have a JBL and a Bose box...the sound is very clean and crisp. I would buy others for my kids and family members.
4,Bought this for my office and it works really well. It was easy to connect and use. I connected it to Alexa as well to use in a different room in my house. So far so good
4,Dont get very loud but works just fine
5,Excellent sound for the size of the speaker. I love the long battery life!!! I had a small issue with the speaker 5 months after using it but Wonders Tech (the retailer) took care of me right away and replaced the speaker. Excellent customer service!
5,This compact blue tooth speaker system provides amazing clarity of sound and volume.  Setting it up is quick and easy even for a technophobe like myself.  I LOVE this little speaker primarily because I suffer from hearing loss.  My internal computer speaker is insufficient for clear audio.  This DOSS speaker is a God send.  No wonder this product has to date receives well over ten thousand positive reviews.  Thank You for providing such a great product at such a reasonable price...............LEO
5,Great little speaker. Rich sound. It's my second one.
3,The sound quality isn't great. It's weak on the bass and it makes a constant high-pitch but only slightly noticeable buzzing when you use it. And at higher volumes it distorts notably whatever you ate playing. All that being said it's not bad either. I think that weighing quality for value it is still worth it to give it a try if you don't intend to use it as your main audio source but rather for more casual instances (while outside exercising while cooking or taking a bath etc). On it's favor: it's very compact battery life is great connectivity is good (it does however although rarely stutter a bit). In sum I'd give it a 3.5/5 overall.
5,Good price. I put this in my car and it saves my gas
4,Nice little speaker feels solid connects easy enough to my devices. The sound is what I would expect from a $20 speaker. Bass is non -existent but it is clear and loud for its size. It fills my large room with ambient music.I also like the touch controls on top and the sounds it makes when I turn it on doesn't bother me.
5,Good value.  Feels likes it's built well.  The audio quality is reasonable considering the size of the unit.  Battery so far has worked very well.  Used it several times and have yet to need recharge.
5,Must say for the price this little box is quite the deal. The sound for it's size is really very good. I have it hooked up to our Echo Dot via the cable and it is infinitely better than the small speaker in the Echo Box. If I had any complaint it is with the Users Manual. There was no mention of how one adjusts the volume via the speaker (running your finger either clockwise + or counter clockwise - over the colored circle on top. I found that information only here at Amazon. All in all am very satisfied with our purchase.
4,This unit sounds nice and was easy to set up. Surprisingly it was almost fully charged out of the box. Hookup was a breeze and it sounds good. The base won't knock your socks off but as an alternative to wearing headphones this does the job.
5,The sound quality of this little one is like a mini movie theater speaker. Its pretty good definitely worth the money.. Hopefully the touch functions have longevity only button is the on/off switch.....
5,I’ve had this speaker for 3 years now!!! Works just as good as the day I bought it! It’s been through so many camping trips and day trips getting dirty and wet. Yet still works like a charm. The sound quality is great for the price and gets pretty loud.
5,DOSS Speaker works real well out the box. I used the Bluetooth connection to play music from my phone and had a good range of volume. With the volume turned up I could hear the music in the next room. I then used the AUX cable that is supplied with the DOSS Speaker to connect to a portable computer and once again the sound could easily be heard. I charged the speaker overnight with the enclosed cable and found I could use the speaker on battery all day.
5,I honestly didn't expect anything from this speaker. For this price....but I was very surprised. After my unpleasant experience with jbl speaker I didnt want to spend too much money for another speaker and I am absolutely happy with Doss. I love the sensor panel I love the sound ( of curse it could be better but c'mon..). Battery last....forever.
5,I've bought two of these so far and highly recommend them.  First one was for my wife who loves to listen to audio books but also enjoys her music while working in her garden.  The sound is amazing and the battery lasts forever.  I bought the second one for a friend who was listening to music on her phone speaker and thought she needed this. She was overjoyed by it and told us that it was the best gift that she's received in years!!!
5,Excellent product with a loud volume (and the bass is fine as well); most times I would have to lower the volume on my phone or laptop in order not to disturb other flatmates. Though my laptop blue tooth can't find it (maybe incompatible) with the cable provided I am able to connect my laptop to it. The quality of the sounds coming from the videos I watch on a regular basis online has improved tremendously. I'm so happy I bought the product.
4,Nice little speaker for good price. Bluetooth connection and sound Are great.  Not sure on battery use yet.
5,Great speaker. Sound is really good especially since it’s so small. The bass is amazing almost too amazing. The little thing goes so hard that it vibrates and oftentimes will vibrate and fall off the table I have it on lol. Just make sure to sit it on something that it won’t easily fall off of. But it’s a great speaker regardless.
5,I love this speaker. I use it all day everyday. In the car while I work out while I clean the house! Great buy.
4,It sounds good... just using it for a patio table.
3,We've had this product over a year and it's been amazing but recently he speaker turns on and connects to my phone randomly at all hours of the day/night or does really weird noises and there's no way to turn it off. I've tried everything!
5,Note: after looking at other review videos it appears that there are at least 2 different speakers being sold perhaps depending on seller. One that starts with a boop de coop type sound seems to consistently have trouble. Mine starts with a voice announcing that it’s turning on (also when connecting to Bluetooth and low on battery)Great sound quality not sure how all the buttons work so I haven't tried all it's functions but just for listening to music over bluetooth is fine. Sometimes it has trouble connecting but that could be my phone or me. Happy with my purchase.
5,Connected to a Bluetooth transmitter to my TV.  Once I figured out the right settings on my TV this connected easily and quickly.  Sounds great!
2,I know what you're thinking: 1) I must be overdriving it and/or the distortion is already there in the source.Neither is true. Multiple known and proven sources that sound fine on other similar speakers (and headphones) sound fine.It also happens to perfectly good high-bitrate MP3 files played on MicroSD card that sound great played on other devices and playing at low volumes on the DOSS. (Which alone categorically rules out source signal problems such as existing distortion or overdriven input.)It's not bad enough to return and it's not constant. And I can't figure out why it WOULDN'T be dependent in input level that's a real head-scratcher because the characteristics are exactly that of overdriven input especially with cheap AD and/or DA converters.That said for the price I'm not surprised. Actually I'm a tiny bit impressed for the price clipping and distorting aside.So I'm not going to one-star it. It deserves a tiny bit of respect. And I do still use it clipping and all.The battery doesn't last as long as some other (slightly more expensive) similar devices. Also the bass is much thinner than others. (Though many others have cartoonishly boomy muddy over-loud bass. Maybe lack of bass is better than over-compensated bass.)
5,This speaker is pretty powerful and has a long battery life for the price. The only complaint that I have is that it seems to have a lot of bass and it isn't readily apparent as to how to dial it back. I use it to listen to my audio books and it is a much deeper sound coming through this speaker. Having said that I would not hesitate to purchase this again.
5,We love this speaker! It works perfectly with our iphone 6 but so far not with the iphone 4. We have been in communication with DOSS customer service though and they answered our e-mail (on Sunday!) and sent a video to show how to correctly pair the speaker with the phone. It is simple to use. It gives warning beeps when the battery is low so you can recharge in a timely way. We can have the phone in the kitchen and have taken the speaker to the patio and to the farthest-away bedroom and the sound does not fade.
4,This little box is durable water resistant and sounds bigger than its size.
3,Good product for the price. Wish it could go louder. One major flaw I’ve noticed is it randomly starts skipping songs definitely not my phone because this has never happened with any other speaker
5,pretty cool so far easy to connect to bluetooth sound quality is good idk bout battery life haven’t used it for that long yet
4,I really like this product over all.  The price is right and delivery was quick.  Sound quality for the  price is very good.  I am a recording engineer and if your looking for pristine bass and soaring highs look elsewhere. If you're looking for a wall price Bluetooth speaker that sounds really good by this.
4,Solid unit. Rating the three I’ve used (Doss Anker Oontz3) I place Oontz first with best bass Doss then Anker. All 3 quality products. Hope that’s helpful.
5,This thing’s battery life is outstanding and I love the touch controls. Vast upgrade from my last speaker that finally needed replacement when the battery was unable to hold a charge anymore.
5,For such a small sound box and such a great price this boom box is amazing! Took it camping and my friends made note at how awesome the bass was on this and asked where I got it! Great product and a great price.
4,For the money we are happy with the product.
5,My husband loves it.
4,Wish it had more base sound quality is good but it could have used more bass considering its size compare to the Beat pill which has more bass
5,We use bluetooth speakers all the time and have a multitude of them and this is one of our favorites. The bluetooth works as well if not better than some we have costing 3 - 4 times what this one did. with exceptional sound. There is also a card slot so we can play music when we don't want to drag a phone with us when going in the great outdoors for some fun away from phones and wifi. You can't go wrong for the price.
3,Initially I was very pleased with my purchase. I have no complaints from the seller. I have PRIME so delivery was quick. I purchased this speaker to use at work. My main issue with the speaker is that when playing music at work even if I have my iPhone on silent do not disturb or driving mode if I received ve a phone call it sounds through the speaker. That’s a nice feature to have for someone that wants it however there is no option to turn it off. So I now find myself with a speaker that is useless for the purpose that I purchased it. I also factor in for my three stars the lack of customizability. The sound is great but as far as settings is on or off that’s it. Overall it is a good speaker just not the right purchase for me.
5,I love this portable speaker! Great value the battery life has been great nice sound quality and volume easy to pair with your phone and it answers calls (which I need to figure out how to disable). I use it around the house and in the back yard by our pool. Highly recommend.
3,computer sound
5,This is a great little speaker.  It has great sound which I wasn't expecting from such a small speaker.I would definitely purchase this again and would recommend it!
3,I was hoping for the sound to be a bit louder than it actually is. Other than the sound quality very good speaker battery life is long and it still is a loud speaker that fills a room but it isn’t much louder than my echo dot.
4,After posting the original review below I was contacted buy the company via email almost imidiatly. They felt I had received a defective unit and offered to send me another one. I  received the second unit two days later and so far it has been working great first use after initial charge I played it at max volume for over six hours and it was still not dead.Will not hold a charge and advances the songs on my Playlist randomly
5,I use it all the time now not only to listen to the music but to watch movies.  Somehow it manages to provide good surround sound via Bluetooth connected to firestick.  Battery life is not an issue either.
3,Sound quality is bad.
5,I really like this it’s perfect for moving around to different rooms or outside. I’m surprised at the sound quality I think it’s so good for what it is. It has both an auxiliary and android (micro) charging plug to make life simpler!  I am very happy with this.
3,***EDIT!!!!! I've owned this speaker for 3 years now but for about the last year it has started skipping songs and changing podcasts to the next episode when connected to my phone. I've always had a little trouble getting it to connect to my computer but my mac is probably 7-8 years old now. But still.... Now I have a speaker that is useless to me and I don't know if it would behave like this with anyone else's phone if I gave it away. I went ahead and bought a JBL speaker and I freaking love it.First wireless speakers I've ever purchased. Pumps out great sound whether it's music or podcasts. I love the buttons on top. I answered a call with it once and they said I sound like I'm in a tunnel but who wants to talk on the phone through speakers anyway?
5,I've had this speaker for a little over a year now and I absolutely love it. The volume & bass are loud and clear as you'd expect with a Bluetooth connection. The battery life on this is amazing several hours on a charge at the very least. I've been able to connect this with iOS Android & Kindle OS without any issues whatsoever. This has lasted me through working on the car cleaning house working outside taking showers and music for family gatherings. If you're ever considering getting a Bluetooth speaker this would be the one to get.
5,This speaker was just what I wanted. It can get very loud and the sound is very clear which is great for when I want to listen to music or podcasts in the shower. The bluetooth connects very quickly unlike another speaker I've used. Also this speaker survived an accidental fall of about 3.5 feet onto a tile floor with no noticeable damage which I'm very thankful for.I haven't had to recharge it yet so I can't say exactly how long the battery lasts but it's been at least a few hours so far.
1,It work only in Aux connection !
4,Love the sound quality from this little box.  Purchased the recommended Anker 3.5mm Auxiliary Audio Cable to hook it to my Echo Dot.  The only downside of this product is that it does not appear to be completely compatible with the Echo Dot.  Alexa can't find the bluetooth.  And when plugged in the speaker on the Dot can't be heard.  The bluetooth is a disappointment but not enough to return the item.
3,This speaker is all treble and no bass. You miss a lot of the music due to that facet. You get what you pay for. No one mentioned this in the reviews or else I would not have purchased.  I immediately bought another speaker because I can not deal with missing a third of the music composition in the music I listen to.
4,Love this radio!!!
5,This speaker is the coolest. The sound control is a touch-activated circle that lights up on the top. The Bluetooth connects super easily and the battery lasts a long time. The volume on this speaker gets loud and keeps its clarity!!
5,It worked for 28 days then started making funny noises otherwise it works great for 28 daysWithin days Amy from DOSS contacted me and replaced my DOSS Touch Wireless Bluetooth V4.0 Portable Speaker with HD Sound and Bass and apologize for the inconvenience with no questions asked. The Doss portable speaker sounds as good as a more expensive Sony portable I purchased. If the DOSS could be paired for stereo effect no other company could compete. The Micro SD to play music or upgrade speaker's firmware plus other features make this a must for Birthday or Christmas presents.
4,The sound is good. I’ve heard better and I’ve heard way worse. My biggest disappointment is the sound quality when the aux. It’s horrible. At work there is so many Bluetooth syncing that I use the aux so that I don’t syncing to someone else’s. I just don’t understand why the sound quality would be different from Bluetooth vs aux.
3,Update:I was able to get the system fully working with my cell phone - controls and all. Unfortunately it is still painful to use with my laptop and the buttons still do not work. The seller reached out to me which was great.Original review: I (bluetooth) connected this to my laptop. For the next 30 minutes I wanted to pull my hair out. The only buttons on the speaker that worked were the the on/off button and the volume circle. The advance rewind pause and mode buttons do nothing. I then connected it to my Samsung Galaxy S7 and the result was the same.FYI the sound is OK. Nothing to write home about but better than my laptop. Definitely would NOT recommend.Oh I forgot to mention it comes with a "waterproof" bag. Will help if you spill something on it...maybe. It's a drawstring bag.
5,My daughter loves it. For the price it’s an amazing buy. Would recommend for younger kids or not so tech savvy person who loves music.
5,There is nothing to dislike about these amazing little speakers!! I bought one for my husband last year and had to get one myself. Then I’ve just purchased three for my brother and nephews in the USA . They arrived with them within a week of ordering. I’m really pleased thank you
5,I have only had this speaker 4.5 months. just stopped working. Will not light up to pair to Bluetooth is fully charged.After contacting the seller I told him of my problem. He was very understanding and told me to try reset.which I did to no avail. he then stated not to worry he would replace mine with a new speaker. He DID and in two days it arrived. Thatis great customer service. The speaker is extremely good great sound and super bass. Thank You Lu
5,I got this little guy for my office and it could be more perfect. For the cost it has great sound long battery life and Bluetooth connectivity. Go ahead! Get it! 👍🏻
5,I love it better than any other one i bought..i Thought i had two different ones one w/remote..the fricken adapter plug fell in..sad the one w/ great bass sound does not hold a chargefor long..I LOVE MY DOSS I WILL BUY ANOTHER ONE..AND TELL MY FRIENDS..💛💙💜💚❤
5,We bought this so my Mother-in-Law could keep it next to her while watching TV. She has a loud oxygen concentrator which made here keep the volume loud. Now she can move from her couch to her bed take the speaker with her and not have to crank up the volume so loud that it disturbed other house members! I didn't realize that this little unit was battery powered; but it's no problem....it runs off of the charger cable just fine. an added bonus is that it will serve as a great extension speaker fr Alexa when we entertain!
5,I purchased this for our pool area. It is loud enough that I can not turn it all the way up. Sounds is clear and loud!It does seem to lose connection at around 30 feet but I'm not using that far away so no big deal. Highly recommend!
5,Easy to connect to and to run. We used it for a small outdoor wedding ceremony and it worked fine. We’ve since used it outside multiple times and it works great.I’m giving sound quality 4 stars because sometimes the sound crackles and I’m not sure why.
4,It's ok the battery life isn't great & it's not loud enough.
4,Best bang for your buck!
5,Excellent ! Everything is perfect I love it.Wpuld buy this product again.
4,This is worth the $20 spent. It will fill a room with reasonably clear sound but don't expect too much. It is after all a small box.Good enough for small gatherings.
5,I bought this Bluetooth speaker YEARS ago and I still love it so much! It still has amazing sound and good battery life. I've dropped it a ton of times too (LOL) and it still has amazing sound. It's super durable and it sounds amazing. Oh did I mention it sounds amazing? Lol all jokes aside I would definitely recommend this speaker as it is affordable and of high quality.
5,This speaker has awesome quality! It's loud and crisp and has pretty good bass too. I use it as a work computer speaker with the aux port and also for bluetooth. The battery lasts forever!
5,My 13 yr old daughter wanted a beats pill. I wasn’t about to shell out that kind of money so this speaker looked like the next best thing. It is absolutely a great speaker for a teen. I wouldn’t recommend it if your looking for the sound quality of a beats pill but it still has great sound for the price! It looks nice and sounds good. It’s lightweight easy to use and easy to setup. Major plus my daughter liked how the volume control works.
4,Works ok and sounds pretty good but we seem to have problems connecting when we switch source devices.UPDATE: After a bit of experimenting it appears we have to disconnect a connected device #1 (turn off the bluetooth) and then turn on the bluetooth for device #2 to connect to the speaker.  I guess I should have read the instructions: "Speaker would automatically reconnect to the last device used."
3,The BT is easy to set up and the range is good.  I bought it mostly to listen to podcasts while working out so sound quality wasn't a high priority.  The sound quality is ok but I recommend getting a larger more expensive speaker if listening to music is your primary consideration.
5,Great sound quality Bluetooth connectivity and battery life .It is totally worth to buy this speaker
4,Very slick and everything is as advertised. Nice voice prompts tell you the status of the pairing. The range is amazing.Update: Dropped it by a star. It is often painful slow to pair. It frequently has to be powered on then off then on again to pair. It can pair in ten seconds or it may take a minute. I have yet to see it pair if the blue circle is flashing. I have consistently had to power it off and on again.
4,We love it only issue and reason for the 4 stars is the fact that when you connect it via cable the sound is lower.
5,This little portable speaker was well worth the price.  After having it with my laptop I would not want to be without it.  The battery lasts a long time and it was simple to connect to the laptop.  The sound is great and it makes you feel like you have surround sound while watching movies.  It has a rich bass sound and not a 'cheap speaker' sound.  While it may not be a Bose it is a great speaker system for the price.  You won't regret buying it!
5,My sister's first bluetooth speaker.  She is beyond happy now that she has discovered how to connect it up and go anywhere with her country music!  She loves her birthday gift!
5,I bought this for a gift for my husband and he loves it! He takes it everywhere!  Very easy to sink and remembers the last device connected to. Great quality for the price!
5,Have had the speaker for a week and love it although I'm still getting used to it and the functions. I use it mainly to play music from my Echo Dot and not for responding to commands from "Alexa." Being wireless I can bring it from room-to-room even to the outside deck without signal loss.  When using it with the Echo Dot it replaces the Echo's built-in speaker in other words you don't get stereo sound.  I'm still getting used to it.  For the price it's priceles and a keeper.
5,I am not an audiophile but this speaker sounds amazing for the price. I have used it with Amazon Echo and my iPhone and both connect via Bluetooth easily and quickly. Distance is good too. I can get at least 30+ feet from the speaker with my phone and no crackle. Volume touch control on the top is a slick feature. The feet are rubber and grip really well. Volume is plenty loud but will impact battery life if played very high. Battery lasted all day at a tolerable volume and switching between devices. Overall I am very satisfied.
3,Bought this based on other reviews I read saying this speaker had pretty good bass.... It doesn't. In fact it barely has any bass at all and is pretty treble-heavy. Tried several different equalizer apps too to see if I could tweak it but it still lacked a lot of bass. I thought I could replace a Bose Soundlink Mini with this but it's truly no comparison - Bose wins by a landslide. Will be returning.
5,Very pleased with my Doss Soundbox. Charges quickly pairs easily. The sound is good. The only knpck is the base is a little short but well worth the investment.
5,I'm so glad I bought this. I use it to bluetooth Pandora while I'm studying and can have my phone out in my kitchen so I'm not tempted to be distracted by other things. No streaming connection issues at all! Sound is great quality. Battery lasts a really long time. I would recommend this to others for sure. Get it! You won't regret it! I bought it in white; wish they had purple! :)
5,I bought this product in 2016 still works great. Sound quality is good volume not as high as a jvc o something like that but for an 15m2 to 25m2 room it is great. Battery life is great too and after all these years it works like new.
3,Three stars because we have two units: one unit should get five and the other should get zero.We ordered two of these Doss SoundBoxes the first was a red one. Red Unit has been wonderful for listening to music on smartphone at home or at the office (small rooms) and was very handy for background music for an office party (large conference room). We liked the red one enough to buy a second unit this time a white one.  White Unit has very irritating static that makes it impossible to enjoy listening to music or hearing the audio for a movie; a non-music podcast or talk radio is just barely tolerable with the static which is there regardless of whether using bluetooth or a direct connection by audio cable. For the cost Doss SoundBox is worth taking a chance on.
5,I was surprised by the quality of sound this little box makes. It worked pretty good for an outdoor movie. I would suggest getting 2 boxes to get a fuller surround sound if 2 devices can be connected (haven’t tried that)
5,Used it for almost 4 years it is so great so surprised that the battery can still last long.Just brought an new upgraded version for another work desk
3,I had high hopes for this speaker as I did a lot of research before buying and most of the "tech people" recommended this Doss speaker. However after a few weeks of using it I noticed that the Bluetooth range isn't as great like stated by Doss. I connected my lap topiPhone and tablet to this and got the same results of the Bluetooth connection cutting off if I walked away even 10ft from it. I don't have a large apt so I figured this speaker would work fine but it keeps cutting off when I use the restroom next door or walk into my open air kitchen it makes it a bit difficult to like this speaker. I will say that it plays very well and the music sounds awesome but the Bluetooth connectivity isn't so great. Battery life does last for awhile tho.
5,This is an awesome speaker. Its small (smaller than a box of tissues) and still has killer output. So far battery life has been good and the best feature for me is the ability to control the music from the speaker. That was the feature I was looking for and didn't find many with that function at this low of a price. A Recommended buy!
5,I have had it for about a week so far I absolutely love it. My jbl speaker blew so I had to get a replacement but wasn’t looking to spend another 200 I’m so glad I decided to give this speaker a try I read the review and they sound promising and I have not been disappointed. Powerfully little speaker even better price. Happy customer.
5,I enjoy this speaker so much; it does increase my listening enjoyment. Like it so much that I bought one for my daughter and one for my grandson. Great purchase!
3,It's decent. Not high quality. There were several reviews comparing this with Bose. I had Bose I like the bass in Bose much better than this one. Not a bad purchase however it is pretty economic and compact. Sometimes has trouble connecting with my computer Bluetooth but I'm sure it's just unique problem of mine. In general it should connect just fine since it works great with my phone.
3,This little speaker sounds pretty good and has some nice bass.  I bought an Ankor a while back which doesn't quite have the bass but is better overall.  I have a few issues with this cheap speaker and those are as follows.1 - sometimes it skips for a second.  As if I'm hitting a speed bump but I'm not driving.  It just has occasional skips.2- I can't understand what it says when it connects to my phone. "Bluetooth heavy on" is what it sounds like.  In the voice of George Takei? It's not him but it sort of sounds like it.3 - it takes a while to link up. Like 30 seconds whereas my Ankor is immediate.4 - the on button has to be pushed and held twice and eventually it will power on.Small gripes but overall good for under $40
4,This is a very nice speaker especially for the price.
5,I love this little speaker.  Easy to set up and use.  Great sound quality.  I use it to listen to books internet radio etc from my iPhone.  Also has microphone so can be used for phone conversations.
5,This is our 3rd purchase of these great little speakers. Very loud for its size and easy to use. Our first one from 2 years ago is dead now. But to be fair I run a painting studio and everything breaks here. Loyal to this brand for the sound quality price and easy of use.
3,Works well. Paired up up easily. Sound is good but does not have much bass.Definitely worth the $20.
3,Love love this speaker it sounds so clear and louder than most Bluetooth speakers. Battery life lasts long and I can use it days at a time without charging it everyday. I definitely recommend this if you’re looking for good sound quality speaker. 4/10/2020 back with an update! Speaker is starting to mess up out of nowhere :( the music sounds horrible and it breaks up badly when my phone isn’t right next to the speaker which has never done that before and I’m so disappointed and dissatisfied now.
5,I love this speaker especially for the price!  I have a couple Marley speakers but I wanted something for camping that was durable  inexpensive and portable.  This speaker here fits all these needs and more.  I likely would not have spent $150+ on a Marley speaker had I bought this one first.  This being said I am unable to comment on the longevity of the speaker life since it's relatively new to me and I've yet to give it a full work out.
5,This speaker is one of the best investments I've made for under $50. While it is compact DOSS doesn't go short on the quality. This speaker can get REALLY REALLY loud for its size. It is super easy to connect with your phone and I would recommend this for anyone who wants an intro affordable pair of speakers.**3-Month Update**The speakers are still working perfectly. I've learned that it's easier to connect the device if you turn on your phone's bluetooth before turning on the speaker. No problems yet and I hope this will last me for years to come.
5,The music sounds 👍 fantastic sounds like the speakers are bigger than they are very good quality know complain s yet.
4,So far seems ok. Wish it came with the sd card for this price. Using this as a nighttime player for my sons who sleep 12 hours so since it can’t stay plugged in I’m hoping the battery can last long enough. Wish there was a display bc when using the sd card you have no idea where your starting
5,Really solid speaker pleasantly surprised by the quality and volume even in noisy work areas.!
3,On/Off switch requires a precise push. It's kinda tricky in that you need to push the button below flush. Sound is fine if lacking bass.1-19-19 Follow up. Contacted by customer service. They asked for a description of the problem and a photo which I provided. In short order they responded and determined that the button/switch was broken. They checked the warranty status and asked if I would be satisfied with a new speaker. I agreed and they sent one. The switch works. I was very pleased with the professional and timely customer service.Now on to the review update...the speaker works fine. The bass issue is related to the source material. It works fine if the material is of good quality.Uses: Kitchen garage bathroom.Very good performance at a very nice price
5,Received it two days ago. Charged it for a few hours and then good to go. Connected through Bluetooth with no problem. Sound is great especially considering it’s small size. I have had it on for many hours listening to the  since it was charged.  Making doing my work a pleasure.  I bought the Doss soundbox last year. At that time this model was around 40$. For 25$ it is a bargain. Definitely better then the sound box. Love it.
5,I’ve had many speakers of different kinds and i find this speaker has really good audio quality for the price! I was pleasantly surprised by how clear the audio was and by the quality of the bass. However the volume does not get as loud as some of my other speakers such as my iHome.I would say overall this speaker is great for everyday use but for a party or larger event with more overall noise I’m not sure if it would be loud enough on its own.
2,I really liked this when I got it but it only lasted 6 months.  In the meantime I bought another one and it only lasted 6 months.  Also the blue tooth connection was very poor and didn't work all the time.
5,First my young teen got one of these two years ago. It was such a hit that we bought her little sister now also a young teen one. Their dad kept borrowing theirs so I finally ordered him one too. Now everyone has their own which I was smart enough to buy in different colors and no one argues over who stole their speaker!
5,I've had this speaker for a year now and 110% would buy again.  I spent months buying & discarding one after the other until I found this!  The price is right the right size & most importantly the sound is incredible!  I've found nothing to complain about with this speaker!
4,Great present for teenager
2,Sounded like it was out of a tin can.  I don’t get all the positive reviews but you do you boo.
5,I selected this box because of other reviews and am happy that I did.  I have hearing difficulties and can't afford hearing aids. I have a pair of wireless headphones which are great but they tend to fall off if I move around the room.  Received the Doss speaker and an attachment to adapt my tv to bluetooth and after charging the speaker paired them together and wow I had lift off amazing good sound and I can hear all over by taking the speaker from my easy chair to the dining area to the bedroom.  Thanks Doss for this amazing device.
5,Like the sound and features of this speaker
5,I have had this speaker for 1.5 years & it is still great! Unfortunately my neighbors can probably agree with that. It even got wet with one of our Texas storms water poured out of the top. All good. With the hot temps & my clutsy husband...this is by far the best outdoor speaker I have found. Please note...its not a Bose...its not amazing but its darn good for the price. Buying another one for backup...still married to the clutz 😁
5,I was a bit surprised when I received this. It is SMALL!  A can of coke is taller and almost as wide. But it sounds spectacular. Better than my roommates $200 Jaw Bone. I'm thinking of buying 4 more and replacing my surround sound system with them. In fact I have already just thought it over I'm getting them. I have limited space and these will sound just as good in my office has my $1600 a pair Paradigm speakers. They are great and I can arrange them so I get better sound. Very happy!
5,Love this and carry it with us as we work! Sound is great and size is just right. Small enough to transport easily. It is also very hardy and not worried about carrying around
5,I doubted that this would work well enough for my taste in sound quality. But I really must admit it sounds great. I take it into whichever room o am in and it sounds great. I am very pleased.
5,I really like this wireless sound box I had another one that is not as good. Battery life is good and easy to charge. Sounds is great
5,I needed a good Christmas gift for someone but in my price range and this was definitely worth the price point. I was scared at first but it arrived within two days which was awesome & the sound quality was amazing for its size!!! 10/10 would recommend. Now let’s see how the recipient likes their gift & if it holds up to it standards.
5,Great sound! My daughter likes to test it’s full volume capability and we can hear it all over our house so I guess that’s a great thing!
2,I had a hard time connecting to the bluetooth but it connects with no problem. If you have a hard time connecting turn your phones bluetooth off and that might help if you are connecting to something other than your phone. I was trying to connect to my computer and that seemed to help. Now I'm having problems with the box getting sound and it seem the sound is freezing I was going to return it but my window closed. I don't recommend buying it
5,Easy bluetooth connection and sound is good
5,This is an awesome speaker you would really be surprised by the quality for the price and also by the size.  These two little speakers hit really hard and have resonant bass. This is definitely a worthwhile item and I'm satisfied with my purchase
4,I have a very dated car/radio in my vehicle.  I soon realized that my phone did not have the sound quality I was looking for while traveling.  I decided on the Doss Touch Wireless Bluetooth V4.0 Portable Speaker for a great sound option.  It is easy to use and I like the sound that is clear.  It cuts on and off easily.  I am enjoying it very much.
4,Sound quality is pretty decent but not the best.  Nice that’s it’s portable. Very durable. Good forThe price. Charge lasts long it. Not sure if I’dBuy it again or try another speaker next time. Overall i liked it.
5,This is a great speaker. Sound is great. Connects really fast.
5,I am a Zumba instructor and one of the classes I teach is in an adult community where I have to provide my own sound system/speakers. My old speaker started to die and I was quickly in need of a new speaker. I saw this had great reviews and was an Amazon choice product..and I decided to take a gamble and try it. BEST DECISION!! This speaker can get SO loud and is crystal clear through Bluetooth and an aux cord. I now love DOSS. Great mini speaker!!!
5,I ordered this speaker knowing that is was on the  cheaper spectrum. Sometimes it will work and sometimes it won't. It will randomly skip or pause songs and I know it's not my phone because it doesn't do that on other bluetooth speakers or playing it out of my phone speaker. Good thing I bought the warranty cuz I'll have to return it.UPDATE:Very happy to say that Doss reached out to me and shipped me a BRAND NEW working speaker to me free of charge!! Fantastic customer service!!
5,I purchased this as a gift and they love it. I've used it enough to know it sounds really good for a speaker in this price range. The bass really resonates. The controls are easy to use as well as connecting to devices. I gave it 4 stars for Bluetooth because the range isn't incredible but it's  on par with all my other speakers I've had. I'd recommended.
5,Speaker has great sound quality and the battery life is awesome
5,I bought this for my Mom and she uses it everyday. It sounds great for the price easy to transport and great battery life.
4,I love this speaker as it's the perfect size for my office and music comes through loud and clear. Mine doesn't have any voice alerts so maybe they fixed that? What keeps this from five stars is how you have to rub your finger in a circle to raise/lower the volume. It's nothing close to accurate and is a very frustrating process. Change this to actual volume buttons and I would give it a five star review...please!
4,stopped working after a month and it was literally never dropped.  Customer service replaced it pretty quickly and the new unit works fine.  Would be 5 stars but by the time they contacted me I had already bought another brand to replace it.  the volume button (the circle) has no label on the device.  the device needs better labeling.
4,Sound quality is good. But it is not portable that's why so heavy to lift
3,Sounded OK but mine skipped non-stop from the moment I brought it home. Skipped from one podcast to another podcast from one song to another LITERALLY non stop skipping. I called Amazon tech support and they suggested a few things to help the problem that I tried nothing helped. I was SO bummed because I wanted to love it - it was pretty cute. But it was determined to skip through everything I tried listening to.Amazon was great about it from start to finish absolutely nothing to complain about as far as customer service and technical support at Amazon!
4,Pretty good little speaker. Not the best sound quality but you get what you paid for. Definitely not upset with the purchase. :)
5,For a small speaker it has a very loud and rich sound.  I used it several times in a car where bluetooth connectivity isn't available and it worked fantastically and was loud enough to hear over the noise of driving the car.It does clip high notes a bit at the higher end of the volume scale but that is to be expected with a speaker at this price point.
3,Seems like a well built bluetooth speaker. Connects plays music yadda yadda.If you use it mainly to play something via the line in (AUX) port though it's inconvenient. With plenty of other bluetooth speakers if there is a line in cord plugged in and you turn the speaker on the speaker automatically starts playing whatever's coming in through the line in cable. With the DOSS SoundBox though you have to fiddle with the touch buttons to change the input to AUX.(I called the DOSS customer support and they verified that there is not a way to get the speaker to default to the line in source.)
5,Nice sounds from a small package. I bought this based off three things. The reviews the fact that it also has a line in jack and the price. It paired quickly with my Iphone but I also like to use it where I don't want to use my data. So I plug it in my mp3 player and listen that way. It takes a while to charge but I think it's because of The lithium battery. I dont have numbers on the play time but I have only charged it 3 times. It seems to hold a charge quite well.
5,I walk into work at 6am and almost immediately turn this bad boy on (first use) easy connect quality sound but what’s really impressive is that it’s 3pm i’m ready to go home and my speaker is still going. According to my phone it’s 40% battery still. Amazing. so worth the price. I know battery life wears out with time but for now i’m gonna really enjoy this speaker.
5,I bought this speaker a few years ago and have loved it! Decided to buy another one because my boyfriend dropped our first one in a big puddle of water which it couldnt survive...BUT loved the speaker so much I decided to purchase the same one again.
4,I use this product all the time for listening to music in my house or on the go. The battery life is quite long and the volume can get surprisingly high for such a small speaker. However the bluetooth connectivity is shotty at best. If my phone is not within 10ft of the speaker the quality of the sound starts skipping and fading.
4,I Really liked how easy it was to setup and the battery life is impressive. I charge it about every 3 days using it on average of about 2-3 hours each day volume turned all the way up! And even then there's almost no distortion!
3,I rated the battery and BT connectivity at a 4 only  because I’ve not had a chance to fully test those functions. I really do not know how well they work. The sound is clear on this speaker but “trebly” and lacking in lower and bass tones. It does sounds hollow.  That being said this is a decent speaker that sounds very clear. If you can adjust your input via an equalizer you might have better luck. I will adjust my review as get to use this speaker more.
5,I liked the simple instructions and the effortless startup as well as the good performance.
4,Good sound. easy connection
5,se escucha muy bien perfecto
5,I use this speaker for an hour or more everyday. It's not exceptionally loud but as long as I'm in the adjacent room I can hear it clearly. I hardly ever charge it and I've never had it die on me.Controls are easy connected to my phone in no time and turns off on its own when not in use.
5,Great product! Just what I was looking for to play music from my cell and works as a speaker phone for my cell too.
4,It’s a great speaker for the price! I’ve bought two of these and they’re great.  The sound quality is good (it’s not like a Bose system or anything) but it does the job.  I mostly use it around the house and sometimes on the beach.
5,Got this for my husband as a gift and he raves about how good it is.  We are remodeling and he puts his music on and just works like crazy! There have been moments when I wish it didn’t work quite so well. ;-)
5,UPDATED REVIEW: Great speaker and superior customer service! I got this speaker in October 2016 and loved everything about it except that it stopped pairing with my laptop after having it for less than a year. The seller contacted me immediately upon seeing my original review and I had a replacement within 2 days no questions asked. The sound is great and the white color looks very attractive in my home office. I would definitely buy this again for myself or as a gift. Buy with no worries as this seller obviously understands what customer satisfaction is all about.
5,Got it for our exercise room. Connectted seamlessly with iPad and was loud enough to clearly hear the music and instructor over our fan. I am not an audiophile. I cannot give that type of review as far a sound quality but it was very clear.
4,Best speaker for the given price range don’t compare with JBL or BOSE. Their price value doesn’t justify the offering of this product with respect to its price.
4,This speaker provides very good volume treble and midrange fidelity. However the bass is underwhelming and can distort and I am not a bass junkie. The wireless connectivity range is impressive though.
4,So its cool that it basically doesn't have any buttons and mostly touch and boy is this speaker loud but the audio quality can be a bit better and the battery last a pretty good while so its a good buy
5,We just love ours! We’ve bought 2. One for the house and another for a gift - the teacher needed a Bluetooth speaker for class. Raving reviews all around!! I can’t imagine better quality and ... the price it’s insane!
5,It's been 3 yrs and still works like new. A very nice product. The bass isn't as strong as the bose. But so my bose doesn't stay charged anymore after two years and still my doss still kicks at half the price. I literally would buy another doss before a bose. They last longer with great audio!
5,The DOSS Touch Wireless Bluetooth V4.0 Portable Speaker with HD Sound and Bass is MARVELOUS! The battery takes about two hours to completely charge and then after I followed the extremely user friendly instructions I was instantly listening to my favorite music for hours! The sound is powerful! I LOVED this speaker so much I bought another one for my husband for his birthday next week. The Bluetooth hooks up lightning fast the volume is superb you can't go wrong with this DOSS Speaker.
5,I love this little speaker! The quality of the sound is great even when you crank it up!It held a charge well- Lasted for hours and the Bluetooth connectivity was good from across the room.
5,Speaker was great but would not turn off after 10 months. I contacted Doss by phone and talked to a real tech person. They had a replacement sent out the next day. Great ccompany to do business with and would recommend as they stand behind their 1 year warranty.
5,ok
5,I work in my wood shop all day. I have my DOSS box hooked to my mp3 . It's simple to use  great sound quality for such a good price and in such a small package. Glad I got it. Rob
5,Great little speaker. Pretty decent battery life. Sounds much bigger than it is. It's easy to connect to bluetooth but you have to do so within 15 minutes.
5,I am SO impressed by this little speaker! First of all the sound is great. To me it sounds just as good as any big name brand $100 portable speaker. Secondly the battery life is insane!!!! I have had this since January and use it a few times a week and I just had to charge it for the first time in March! Ridiculous! I just bought a second one of these for my office because I love it so much. Highly recommend!
5,Yo la compré en Junio 2018 y aún la tengo en perfecta condiciones. Lo que más me encanta es la calidad del sonido. Vale la pena mencionar que no es la más potente pero para ver películas en tu laptop y/o escuchar música tranquilo está más que bien.La recomiendo 100%
4,Good
5,Works amazing haven’t had any issues and it’s super loud... in the past I have bought more expensive speakers and could barly head out of them... this one is loud and clear!
5,I bought two speakers at the same time this one and one that was 20W. I stuck with this one because I only use it in my bedroom or bathroom and the sound it loud enough while showing. It is clear but not robust not much bass but for the price I am very very happy with this purchase. Wish I bought another in a different colour. Also extremely impressed with the quality it looks very expensive and the buttons and functionality are great.
3,Nice little speakerbut the sound quality is just not thereI think I blew the speaker.
5,Nice compact size. Sound quality is good.Great product for the price.
4,It’s very pretty I got the red one
5,I have this speaker  for about 3 months already  This is not bad at all. Sounds good not great but good. But hey for the price you can't judge. Battery life is Awsome.
4,I like the sound good item.
5,I do not move Alexa around. She stays in one area of the house and is used for listening to music all day.  The speaker certainly would not be raved about I am sure by the real techies of the world. But it definitely improved the quality of the sound of what I listen to. Such a small footprint and easy to hook up. I have the white unit to match the Alexa Echo Dot sitting on a white counter. Totally unobtrusive.
5,I had to say 'for the money' as it sounds like a put down but here I have to say for the money you can't beat this speaker. I like that because I'm not scared to death to take it places where it might be damaged. I enjoy taking it out on my boat when I'm fishing. It's plenty loud enough and it's got great sound that I'd compare to speakers that are far more expensive.
5,It is easy to use and sounds great for portable speakers.  I use it mainly to connect to my tablet for watching movies.
4,Initially it worked great sound was always good but the recharging port broke internally after 6 months.  Really frustrating to skimp on that part of this speaker.AS an update DOSS contacted me and acknowledged this was a problem and sent me a new unit.  The form factor is the same and the sound quality is good.  So far this one is performing very well.
4,I like this speaker.. so far it’s working well and the battery life is really good..
5,Great little Bluetooth. Worth the money. Not super loud. Good for inside the house or sitting outside on patio.
5,I was on the hunt to find a great blue-tooth speaker for a low price and I definitely found it! It has lengthy battery life and the sound quality is outstanding. The only minuscule downside would be the occasional blue tooth connectivity with my iphone. More often than not I manually have to select my iphone to connect with the speaker. It's not a huge inconvenience for me but just something to keep in mind. Overall great product and would recommend!
4,My only problem is it disconnects Bluetooth after 20mins.....terrible idea
5,Not only have I purchased this for myself but also several family members. This speaker is awesome! It’s small so you can take it anywhere and so easy to use whether it be indoors or out. You won’t be disappointed!
4,Overall it works fine.  Sometimes it seems to be a bit glitchy - like if I'm using it in a room that has a fan on I hear some light background static.  Or if I'm using it in the kitchen and somebody runs the microwave the static is more noticeable.  BUT I'm not looking for fancy.  It's a nice basic Bluetooth speaker.
5,Sound quality is pretty good for a portable speaker. The only slight disappointment is the white speaker I received has grey spots on it.
4,The connectivity doesn’t always work right away but the sound and quality is great! I’d recommend this product!
5,Beautiful sound. I stream music from YouTube from my phone.  Can't walk across the house or the Bluetooth disconnects but the sound is so good I don't care.
5,For the price this speaker is really hard to beat.  I was impressed with how loud it is and the quality of the speaker as well.  Great product
2,I had originally purchased an Oontz Bluetooth speaker which was stolen so I decided to go with the Doss based on the information provided. When I first got it I noticed right away that it was nowhere near as loud or clear as I wanted it like my Oontz. I kept it to give it a chance and it worked ok for the most part. Had issues connecting it to devices (usually took 3-4 tries) and it wasn't as sturdy as my Oontz. Keep in mind that this was not a waterproof or shock proof speaker so it had to be handled delicately. Problem for me since I'm somewhat clumsy and I noticed the port to charge the speaker was also delicate. After about 2 weeks sure enough the port to charge started to become loose and I could see it was only a matter of short time that it would break (still holding in though). The worst thing happened 2 weeks after I bought it I connected it to my laptop and the sould quality was horrible!! It sounded scratchy like an old lp. I figured maybe it needed to be charged. I will update to see if this solved the problem. I think I'm going to return it and get my Oontz back.
5,I love how compact and easy-to-use this product is. I took it on a seven day trip where I knew I’d use it daily and since returning home I’ve used it regularly in my home office instead of blasting my “party speaker” from downstairs. The sound quality is great for small spaces but I wish the volume went just a little higher. Considering the cost it was money well spent.P.S. I recommend adding the carrying case to your purchase for protection while traveling.
4,Works as expected! My only issue is more personal than anything - I am a massage therapist and I use this in my sessions. I have made the mistake of using it while it's not plugged into the charger and it makes a really loud noise alerting you when it's low in battery. Perhaps that's useful for some people but I would rather it just shut off without the loud notice!
3,I got this guy two years ago and have loved it. Size is great sound is good portable but if I had to buy another one I’d probably go with a different brand. Assuming that’s the problem I’m now experiencing.I use this speaker daily for streaming sleep sounds. It’s been great minus the light that can’t be dimmed or tuned off. And last month the speaker began to alert me to recharge in the middle of the night. I fully charge it before going to bed and it usually lasts for hours after I wake up. It’s not great waking up in the middle of the night by the thing you depend on for white noise WHILE you sleep.Decent product but I wish it had lasted longer.
4,Affordable and does the job of providing  music for small gatherings and working out in the yard just perfect.
5,Easy to work and understand connection is fast and reliable
5,Bought on sale for Prime Day. Money definitely well spent really enjoying the speaker!
5,Super loud which i like best Bluetooth speaker i bought @
5,I have two of these puppies. They have been my faithful companions for 3 years now and I can confidently say this is a great speaker for any small space these have never given me problems
4,The speaker I originally purchased failed to charge after 3 months. I sent a note to customer support and they immediately sent out a replacement. So--fantastic customer service. The sound is great the batteries last forever it pairs nicely the touch controls are a little too sensitive it's easy to brush them and suddenly you're a couple songs farther down your play list. A great buy--only caveat to take care plugging the usb-cord in and out.
5,I wanted to upgrade the sound of my tinny laptop speakers for listening to music podcasts etc. and chose this one because of its high rating to price ratio.  It has met expectations in every way.  It feels well made and the sound is excellent considering the compact size.  It paired easily and has good range so I can take it from room to room without signal loss.  The sleek controls require only a light touch to change volume and skip tracks...a nice high end feature.  So far battery life is as advertised.  Kudos to a fine product.
5,This little guy has game.  Great sound at all volumes w/o distortion.  Holds a charge for a long timenot sure how long as I plug it in at night to charge. It has heft to it as well.  I was so satisfied I was going to buy another for my other echo dot but I noticed the price went up significantly.  I understand it was a top seller so I don't fault DOSS....I just hope they understand and don't fault me as I bought an equally good speaker insteadfor a lesser pricethe OONTZ angle 3 speakeranother real find.
5,Suena bien!
5,No good. Received it. Charged it over night (14 hrs). It will not power on. Thing is useless. Returning it immediately.UPDATE: 12-8-16. After I returned the item I sent a short email to Doss' customer service. Briefly explained the problem and said i was returning the item. I don't think they ever responded but several days later a brand new speaker was delivered to my door. I hadn't even fully returned the first one yet.  I charged the new one up and it works like a champ. Very good sound for a relatively very small price. All good now. Nice work Doss.
5,Such a value for the low price!!!! Comparable sound to JBL speakers
4,Small and portable with a lasting battery life. Great sound quality and can i hear my music from the other room. There isnt alot of bass though. But other than that. This is a perfect speaker to take to the beach park or anywhere you might want to listen to music easily and for a longer time.
5,Great product !!! Very happy with this speaker.
5,Love this little speaker.  I bought it for work so I do keep it very low volume.  I have brought it home (so small so very portable!) and blasted it.  The sound is great.  Obviously a super expensive speaker will sound better but for this price I think it's incredible.Only thing I don't like is at work when it's connected to my phone if my phone rings the whole office can hear that and I quickly work to shut the speaker off  Wish I could have it only connect to music on my phone and not the ringer.
5,Gives a weird beeping noise when power is low. The blue circle on top is the volume control. If one touches a certain angle the sound stops. But no complaints.
5,My old beloved portable speaker died a few day ago and after finding out they no longer make it I set out to find a new one. I have only used the line-in so I can’t speak for the Bluetooth function yet. The sound quality is pretty good and loud for such a small device. It was straight forward and easy to operate which I appreciate. My only complaint is the annoying voice that announces what mode it’s in I’d rather have a light tell me that. But all things considered it is a small price to pay for a good quality reasonably priced speaker.
4,Sound quality is Surprisingly good for such a small unit. Was it easy to connect
3,UPDATE: they replied to my third email and replaced the product without question.  I therefore am editing my previous review —- of my own will.  Hoping for a better product this time around.I bought this product about 3 months ago.  It worked great and was quite pleased.  Then a few weeks ago the on/off button stuck. Nothing happened to it seems almost like an electronic malfunction.I read through reviews that they had excellent customer service.  So I’ve emailed them twice now in hopes they will allow an exchange and have yet to receive a reply.  Quite disappointing.  So I rate this a 1 mostly due to their poor customer service.  Not sure if anyone else had the same malfunction as I did or if it’s just a bad batch.
5,It’s a great mini speaker at a third of the price.
3,For the first few days the speaker worked well.  Then started making a sound that goes off every several seconds.  Most annoying!  Sounds like the busy signal on a landline.  Just make one "BEEP" or what every you want to call the sound and then it will play for about a minute and make the sound again.  Ot sure why it is doing this or how to correct it but we do not use the device because it is so annoying.
4,Ok
5,For the small sizethe sound is amazing. Comparable to a JBL which are way more expensive. Easy to pair to my phone. Nice and loud with clear sounding music at all volume levels. Well worth 20 bucks.
5,Great little speaker! Good sound holds a charge for 8+ hours.
4,sound is no really loud as I think maybe that's why battery last long. overall with that price good buy
5,Great sound easy to connect to Bluetooth! Very happy with my purchase!
5,Mom needed a speakerGot this one for herAnd she favors itIt's got a good sound system too.
5,The media could not be loaded.
5,These speakers are really good.  The battery life is decent easy to charge and it connects quickly.  I haven't had a single problem with them.  Definitely a safe purchase.
5,So far I am enjoying this item. Great sound quality for the price.
5,I have an issue connecting via bluetooth with my Lenovo computer so I use the aux cable and it works great. My wife's Asus computer connects fine. It's exactly what we were looking for and well priced.
5,I am very surprised and excited when I tired DOSS Touch Wireless Bluetooth Bluetooth connect instantly using my Samsung Note 8 touch controls are so easy to use blue ring is very useful to understand what speaker is doing. Yesterday while BBQ I tried the speaker outside in my backyard Sound quality was amazing even at the low volume.This is early review and will provide more feedback after a month or so.
3,Connection is hit or miss and if it works it constantly goes “beeep” every 4 minutes. We gave up on it around month 9. Terribly disappointed considering we loved this little speaker and sound.
3,The Speaker sounds great if you increase the volume on your phone.  The speaker breaks off from one room to the other it needs to be fairly close in order to work properly I would say no more than 10 to 12 feet max.  I've been using it in the backyard when the phone is close by.
5,I take this thing everywhere lol so convenient!**UPDATE!** I've had my doss box since 2017 it's 2021 and I've just now managed to blow the speakers. Though I'm not quite sure how cause I haven't done anything untoward. Perhaps it's just time? Idk non the less I'm about to buy another one. I won't even shop around to see if anything new and exciting came. I'm perfectly happy with this one. It does what it's supposed to do. When I want big extra loud extremely clear sound I plug in my bose.
5,For the price you can't go wrong.  I am an old man that likes to listen to spotify while I do construction/woodworking.  This works great.  It sounds really good to me but I suspect a young person or somebody who likes bass will need something more.
5,I bought this as a gift for a 'shut-in' friend.  During our conversations her she will say ... several times ... "have I told you that I love my speakers!"  It has enabled her to hear better on phone calls while leaving her hands free to maneuver her walker.  And the other thing that she is constantly raving about is being able to us the USB connection on her computer ... enhancing her ability to hear movies better and more clearly.  Yes based on her enthusiasm I will say this was a great choice for a gift and would highly recommend it to anyone.
4,The Bluetooth capability is instant and loud. However when I use the chord to connect to my old iPad the sound is not as loud. But it could be my super old iPad! It’s like the first generation! Lol! However very satisfied with my purchase! The shipping was crazy speedy!
4,Not too bad for the price paid. Decent sound quality for the price.
5,I absolutely love love this purchase. Sound battery life quality and size all was to my approval.Small box but great sound. I would recommend this to anyone. Looks can be deceiving. I thought it was not going to beTo my liking but I was so wrong. Very happy.
5,I bought those for my son's Christmas.  He was extremely happy.  Since then he has carried it on his 4-wheeler in his truck to his friends house & it has stood all of the torture.  It still works!!!
4,Por la calidad de la presentacion esperaba mejor sonido por el mismo precio obtengo una JBL GO mas pequena y con major sonido.No estoy conforme con el product pues era un regalo y no lleno las expectativas.
5,I'm absolutely shocked at how high quality the sound is from this inexpensive little speaker. Also pairing and everything else works perfect. I can't believe the bass it puts out. Ok it won't shake your room but the bass is clear and matches the rest of the music volume so perfectly. I'm now a big DOSS fan. My only complaint is the LED lights are BRIGHT so I have to flip it upside down so I can sleep. It doesn't affect sound quality since the speakers are on the side. Awesome product awesome price.
5,I like this little speaker a lot! Great sound for the money easy connection to my iPhone. Perfect for my shop.
4,This isnt a bad Speaker box to small speakers woth heavy magnets and voice coils nice over all sound especially for the price.(hope this doesn't make him raise the price. This is no Bose..  But it's Bluetooth direct 3.5mm Jack connect.Controls are.touch but don't work on all phones however paused my utube videos well. Didn't nothing to answer and hang up my Galaxy Note 5 (Latest Android version.)
5,Not a bad speaker.Supsup-long battery life! I used it for a whole month without charging it result in 1/10 battery life left!! Good clear sound(but dont hope for good base go get a BOSE if u want that!)Owned few BOSE series speakers also the soundlink mini but just gave it to my dad. So I had this.Sound is clear with no explode sound even in max volume. Have some base but not strong(for its price ~$25 it is good enough). The thing impressed me is it could "shake" the table which it is on.
5,This speaker surprised me I was expecting a decent quality but what I got was so much more the bass is good for this type of speaker the sound quality is great the volume is loud easy to operate I mean wao... oh and the battery life I mean this thing is a must have... I guess all the need is for it to be water proof and this would be awesome.... but honestly if I could give it a 6th star I would....i loved it so much I bought another one for my son on black!
4,For the price it's a really good speaker. I'm a bit picky about the bass so can't give it 5 stars. But decent buy for a budget. I'm thinking of trying their next tier speaker if theres ever a decent sale.
4,I sometimes have trouble connecting to the bluetooth but not too frequently. Overall a great product. The sound is high quality and the battery life is outstanding.
4,The sound coming out this little box at this price is great. I got it for my aunt that has a hard time hearing and she now hears the TV. We love it.
5,I switched from a Sony srs xb31 to this speaker. Although this speaker assumbly does not have as strong of a bass it does the job well and for a reasonable price. Bluetooth mode has been working with no problem. Only thing would like to change is the loud noise speaker makes once it successfully connects to a device.
5,Great sound long battery life and easy Bluetooth connectivity. What I’m most like about it is that I can take it with me all over the house and have a great music wherever I go.
4,It has an automatic turn-off after 15 minutes of non-use so if you expect it to stand-by for your Bluetooth calls or to play when you want it to forget it. You have to go online and look for a firmware update which doesn't download in a .pdf. I don't now how you get to a .ror extension. Very unfriendly in that respect.
5,Super portable great for taking it from room to room. I use mine in my office. Easy to use with multiple settings to choose from. I absolutely love music so I am extremely picky about my music quality. The ONLY downfall I find is the bass isn't as "clear/hard" as I personally like. I like to "feel" my music when it's playing. If you're looking for a durable portable clear speaker. I highly recommend this speaker. If you're looking for something that "hits/has bass" this speaker doesn't really have that but other than that it's a great all in one package.
5,You cant expect too much for a speaker under $30.  This little speaker actually outperformed my expectations.  The sound is pretty clear and loud.  Connectivity was easy.  Changing volume and tracks is easy with the function buttons on the top of the speaker.  We will see how long the charge lasts but so far I haven't recharged it yet and I have used it several times.  You can't beat this speaker for the money.
5,Little sucker’s easy to grab and take to bath for shower tunes on BT to my phone. I would'nt put IN the shower but can hear fine as my bath is tiled. Will give as gift.Plays BT & Wireless with equal aplomb.Didn’t understand the intermittent squalk it made one day until I returned to the thread and a helpful poster this low batt. warning - so tended that conn. to the always plugged in charger.
3,Though probably good for its intended use it makes a terrible add-on to an Echo Dot. Even when Plugged in the Speaker powers down after 15 minutes. I intended speaker to be used on the deck in a central (but difficult to reach)  location. So each time I must turn it on and reset the volume to Max. At full max and the Echo at 10 the volume is acceptable for a 12x24 deck. but not much more. Also the LED lights are a distraction for my intended use.EDIT: Went from 1 star to 3 because Customer support contacted me and sent a Firmware upgrade that disables "auto power off" feature. I did not install the firmware because I had already moved my CoolVox Speaker to the deck which does not have auto off and it much loader.
5,Beautiful! Exactly as advertised. Size is small enough to be easily transportable. Color is perfect and sound quality is as expected. It’s easy to pair with my device and the touch activated buttons are such a neat feature!
5,I bought this speaker to have in the kitchen while I cook clean what have you.  I listen to a lot of podcast and my phone just wasn't loud enough.  I have to say I am extremely impressed by the sound quality of this speaker.  It's crystal clear no static and is small enough to sit on the counter and not take up much space.  I am very impressed and plan on purchasing another for upstairs in the bathroom.
5,This speaker is awesome.  It is super easy to use and sounds great.  It connected in seconds to my iPod and other devices.  It is small lightweight so I love it doesn’t take up a lot of space.  It comes with both a charging cord and an auxiliary cord.  I have had this for about a week now and so far I give it five stars across the board.
4,Connecting to Bluetooth is difficult but if used by 1 person is fine.
5,The sound is amazing!!!!!!! Haven't had any problems with it for months :)
5,I will hasten to admit it... i was skeptic initially.. but this guy packs a great punch!!! The design is real elegant and the lights compliment it well. Kindly note that to adjust the volume.. u have to swipe which i think is cool but can b invonvenient if you are in a hurry or really busy etc. I am pleased with the sound quality and the aesthetics. It comes with the usb and another wire to connect ur phone.. also.. the carrying pouch is classy and well made. Definitely will buy again!!!
5,Perfect size unexpectedly fine sound quality and volume and it works right out of the box. Frankly i'm shocked at the value; i've spent three times as much on laptop speakers that are tinny thin sounding and fuzzy at the high end of their volume. this speaker has a rich full sound and gets much louder than i need. the touch controls are smooth and responsive; feeling like a device that should cost much more than $25. i am truly astonished at the value.
5,I wasn't expecting a lot out of this tiny speaker but it exceded my expectations! The thing that I love the most is its battery life. I charged it on December 5th and I'm still using it to this day January 13th and haven't even charged it again! (I mostly use it to hear podcasts and the news)
2,When I pulled it out the Amazon box there was some white powder on it that smelled so strong (not sure if it was latex or something) I had a small allergic reaction to it and couldn’t breathe properly for a couple hours. I don’t know if it had to do with the manufacturer or Amazon themselves but it was really weird that nothing else I ordered in the package had any powder on it. Also the slightest movement anywhere near the speaker and it starts skipping. I was washing dishes and placed a plate on the counter about 2 feet away from the speaker then it began skipping.
5,My husband uses this in the suv which doesn't have bluetooth  to connect to bluetooth in his phone. Works good.
4,Works well for my needs just wish it actually lasted for 20 hrs.
3,This is just an initial review I will update if anything changes after I have used it for awhile.  The sound quality sounds a teeny bit fuzzy i think....only a little bit.  Could be a little crisper.  Not much bass but i wouldnt say its bad for bass just not what you want if you want strong bass.  So far it seems ok.  I got it because my phone sucks and doesnt get very loud and also to use with my laptop that was so dumb they put the speakers on the bottom so sound is always muffled from the laptop speakers.  These speakers get REALLY LOUD.  I cant take it to the max.  I seem to keep it at about 60% - 70%.  80% if i want to blast it.
5,For the price this small Bluetooth speaker has decent sound. Works great
5,I ordered this for my husband in August of 2016.  He was very pleased with the quality and I was very pleased with the price.  The sound quality is great very loud for indoor and outdoor use.  If you are outside with a lot of surrounding noise it's probably not going to be sufficient but for us sitting by the pool it was wonderful.  I love the touch controls and having the "next" and "previous" buttons are super handy so you don't have to turn on your device to change the song.  I would recommend this product to anyone.
4,Built to last
5,I've had this speaker for a few months and I love it! I have the white one and it is beautiful! The buttons light up the color is super pretty and the sound is great. Also the battery life is much longer than what I'm used to. I can keep this speaker on two nights in a row without charging which is insane. The only negative is there's no way of seeing how charged it is on the actual speaker but you can see once you connect it to your phone. That's really the only negative I have. Great speaker!
3,Amazing sound from such a  small box.  However it keeps disconnecting from my ipad which has my music.  I got so frustrated bought another item with speaker and to be honest same problem.  Does anyone have anyideas on what is the problem?  Before I bought did a search for compatible ipad speakers on amazon and this speaker Was listed.
5,this puts out more sound than one would initially expect good clarity decent base  wait for it to go on sale...
4,We purchased one for one of our kids and then one of the other kids wanted on. Easy to pair with any device and good sound for the kids music.
5,I've only had this a little while but so far I love it!  the sound is great and looks nice sitting on my vanity. I like to listen to music while doing my makeup.  i only wish the charging cable it came with was longer BUT it's not a big deal for me.
4,Es compacto y suena muy bien
5,I was very happy about the sound coming from this speaker and even happier with the price - I would highly recommend and have purchased two of them....
5,Pleasantly surprised! This has really good sound quality for the price. The sound doesn't get distorted at higher volumes. We ave easily connected several phones to the speaker. It charges fast and battery life is long. Perfect size for a take along speaker.
4,On/off button could be placed more prominently and it’s pretty small. Otherwise this speaker is fine!
4,Overall this a good speaker.  The only thing I wish you could do is control the volume on the actual speaker.  When it boots up or connects it plays the sound pretty loud no matter what your volume is set on the device.  Other than that it's a good device. I keep it in my office at work and it works very well!
5,Perfect inside my small apartment. Pretty good base too
5,Just as described. Works great. No connectivity issues and volume is pretty loud considering it’s small.
3,I was fully aware that it was rated as a 12 Watt device when I ordered it; however both my Amazon Echo Dot and Google Home Mini provide more volume at volume setting 7 than the  DOSS SoundBox Touch provides at full volume. Either device overpowers the DOSS Soundbox at full power. Same for my AYL SoundFit waterproof speaker.Setup and Bluetooth connectivity were easy. The item itself is attractive and appears to be solidly built and there is no noticeable distortion at full volume; but it's just too weak.
5,I did like this speaker. It’s really got good sound and doesn’t sound muffled. Connects Easy to Bluetooth and turns up quick. Definitely would recommend
5,Excellent  I use this every morning and take it with me anytime we go on family trips especially the beach will definitely buy another one.  Had this item for 5 months so far waited to write review to test. Love this one.
5,I like it. Volume is loud and clear. Bass is therefore the size and no distortion even on the highest volume.  It 360°  sound. It's very good for it size. I have klisph kmc 3 and nyne bass and kisiri by this size Doss sound touch it's good and this is what I need for the size I was looking for not  mufffoured like Bose mini. Bose is good stuff but base is enhanced and it's not real bass of a real  music instruments like you are playing the bass drum.
5,Speaker connects quickly and effortlessly. Connecting the first time was a breeze!! I don’t listen to as much music as I do radio classics or news but the sound quality is there. I use mine in the bathroom so the battery seems to last forever. I liked it so much I bought one for a gift!!
5,Not bad for $20. It serves its purpose well.
5,Worlds amazing
3,It paired perfectly and quickly. However when I turned it on started playing my audiobook it was horrible. It sounded like tin and reverberating. I had to turn it off it gave me a headache from listening for 5mins. I bought the speaker for the sound.
5,The sound quality was very good. And stays charged for a really long time. I will probably buy a couple more.
5,I was so used to the jawbone jambox...but when that broke on me I settled on this one by the ratings of others. I love this speaker box!!!! So far works fantastic! Pairing is easy. Volume is very good! Probably louder than my last one. And battery life seems to last. Love this!
5,Perfect unit for a 2000 Toyota Camry. It fits in the empty space near the gear stick.This speaker has an amazing battery lifegood bluetooth speaker for making handheld free calls/picking up calls convenient volume adjuster and great sound. I can even drive with my windows down and still listen to the music. DOSS has recently gotten rid of the annoying british voice which kind of grew on me but the 'low battery please recharged' was the worst. Overall you cannot go wrong with this purchase because the product is amazing and the customer service gold.
5,Great speaker for its price you really cant ask for much improvement in the sound department I only wish you could play music while its plugged in. You can but it makes a really annoying ringing noise when you try to play music and have it charging at the same time. And also I wish you could lock the device. I love to take the speaker to different places and ill listening to the speaker and out of nowhere i  somehow pressed the skip button on it a lock would be an amazing feature.
5,clear easy could be louder
4,if your like me you love to shower and jam out! When you go to press the change the song just make sure your hand is completely dry. Overall great purchase 💕
3,I have had the product for a year and it was a great buy but now after a year of use it randomly cuts off and on. And will do it for days and sometimes I can't get it to stop. But all in all when it was not acting up it was a great speaker very loud great bass and I love that I can change the song on the speaker as well as turn it up and down. And great appearance as well very sleek look.
5,Great sound and bass! Pretty loud for a small speaker! So glad I found this product!
5,Replace my Bose speaker. Great quality
3,I bought this speaking about 2 or 3 years ago an I was very impressed with the speaker great sound never had any issues but the reason I am not giving it a 5 start rating is because just the other day it started turning on an off by its self an nothing I do will make it stop! I own I different brand speaker I bought from radio shack an its lasted me almost 8 years now an still going strong I keep that one at camp an I like to have one for around the house!
5,I listen to lectures with this speaker. The sound is clear and loud enough.  It is not tinny like so many I have had in the past.  I highly recommend this product.
5,very good sound easy to set up very happy for the money I paid.  Listening to it now..
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Sounds crisp & good new trend designed looks attractive at any location bass is ok but depend type of music listen to. can play the next mp3 song from my cellphone galaxy note 4 by touching the button on top of the speaker cool very convenience feature battery life as advertised. Price range is about right. Nothing to complaint.
5,Very easy to set up and great sound quality. I love that you can not only adjust the volume from the speaker but you can also adjust it from your phone. Great buy!!
5,Just pretty good for the price
5,This is money well spent. This little guy puts out amazing sound. I have it connected to my PC's Laptops Tablets. The sound is awesome with the bass. It makes it better for making music and movies with devices that don't have such not so great speakers. I am glad I spent the money on this speaker and for the price it's just right.I highly recommended this to anyone. Buy it NOW :)Update: Still doing awesome. This speaker is amazing. Great sound. It's now 29.99 well worth it.
5,My TV has lousy speakers and the fiber optic connection died.  I use an analog audio-to-bluetooh  traansmitter to get superior audio from my TV.  The bass makes for a clear voice output and I can carry the box to the kitchen and still hear the program.
5,Easy instructions great sound quality and awesome price.
5,This speaker works really good. I have no complaints
4,Sound quality
5,Fast delivery easy setup and good sound quality.  Have yet to push it beyond 4-5 hours of play time but no issues so far
5,Very easy to connect to BT.  I’ve had mine for over a year works great.  Bought for work. Not quite as good as my JBL but a lot better than just using my phone’s speaker.
5,This speaker is better than 75% of the Bluetooth Speakers on the market of the same size most of them are 4-6 times the price of the DOSS. It really is a fantastic sounding speaker nice rich lows and articulate highs. If your able to adjust the equalization on the devise that you are playing music through it then you are able to really maximize the flexibility of this speaker. I have had it for the last 4 months and there have been no issues. Turns on every time without issue. Has been reliable and a great value for the money.
5,The amazing DOSS Touch Wireless Bluetooth V4.0 Portable speaker arrived on time and exactly as described! I enjoy the simple to use Bluetooth connection the opening sound of on and the ending sound of off as well as the ability and clarity of the small yet awesome speakers in the unit. I order 3 more for my grown kids for Christmas and know they will enjoy the sound and functionality of the DOSS. I noticed some areas in my home that would lose signal so moved to another area and no problem.
5,I have no idea how long the battery life it's a great system
5,Get compliments at work all the time. Everyone is always impressed with the sound quality of this speaker! My response always - I love it and it’s on amazon i recommend and the price is really great! You won’t be disappointed ........ get itttttt 🤗
5,The sound is sharp crisp and clear. I am not exaggerating by saying that the vocals sound like as it its coming live from a recording studio. For me that is the most important thing and its amazing how good this sounds in relation to it compact size. The speaker is solidly built. Now if you are someone who must have a lot of bass then this speaker is not your cup of tea. Yes it has bass but if you are listening to dance music etc then it may fall short.
1,It is honestly not worth the money
5,I am not a technical guru in fact this item was emailed to me by a co-worker after I said I was looking for something to hook my phone to so I could listen to my music without wearing my Bluetooth all the time.  Thankfully they included the note about the cord that would be needed. LOL..  I  must say I am impressed  the little speaker gets a "WOW" forwards and backwards from me.  Read the simple directions plug it in turn on my phone  and my playlist sounded awesome!
5,This speaker is a great buy. If you are looking for a mid to low range speaker this is fantastic. We have 8 Blue tooth speakers in our household but I needed one for my office. I could not be happier with my choice. It is not as loud as our Bose or JBL but we spent well under half the cost on this speaker. I like this speaker so much I bought 2 more for Friends and family for Christmas. Great sound and great price. You cannot go wrong with this speaker.
2,When I first bought the speaker I thought it was a great deal! The sound quality on such a small and cheap speaker was very impressive. However after trying to charge the speaker I noticed that the Charging port was almost broken on purchase. When I try to charge the speaker with any cord nothing happens. The only way to charge the speaker is to bend the end of the cord up otherwise charging is out of the question. Keep in mind if this same cord charges everything else I plug into it just fine. On top of this recently the speaker has been pausing and skipping my music by itself. This happens randomly without me being even near the speaker. Another thing to mention is that the Bluetooth connection is super weak on this speaker. There have been a few times where the phone is directly over the speaker and the connection has still cut out. Overall this speaker didn’t really live up to the hype. Although the sound is great the speaker overall is just kinda a pain to work with at times. I’ll be contacting the DOSS customer support and seeing if I can trade in the unit. In such a case I’ll be happy to up review.
3,WHILE I'M ABED RIDDEN DISABLED PERSON IT IS IRRITATING WHEN I HAVE TO GET UP TO TURN THE SPEAKER BACK ON AFTER IT TURNS ITSELF OFF CONTINUALLY WOULD LIKE TO DISSABLE THIS  POWERING DOWN FEATURE. FOR THIS PROBLEM ALONE WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS SPEAKER TO ANYONE AS IT IS VERY IRRITATING. IF ANYONE KNOWS HOW TO DISABLE THIS FEATURE PLEASE LET ME KNOW.
4,great little speaker seems very well made and easy to use also the sound is clear and  distinct i would have given it 5 stars except it will not stay connected to my Dish Hopper which is why i bought it when the hopper is turned off and back on it will not reconnect automatically  however it does  does reconnected to every thing else probably the hopper just my luck but a great speaker nonetheless.
5,I had this item on my shopping list for a while when I got a message from Amazon letting me know it was on sale I automatically bought it because I need it to keep me sane while I'm cooking. So far so good with the speaker. I do wish it was a bit louder but it does its duty.
5,Very impressive sound and appearance..good quality product..I had to look on YouTube for a video on how to use it but that's just because I did not take the time to read the instructions and I am not very tech like..Very good product highly recommended..
5,I think this a great product sounds really good and battery lasts a long time. I think the price is fair.:)
5,Very easy to use and connect to a Samsung Galaxy s8 smartphone.  Good sound quality. Light weight but seems sturdy and well made.
5,Wow! I can't believe the quality of this product for the $27 price! I don't know how you could go wrong with this. Very good sound quality. Very easy to sync with my iphone. Took just 30 seconds. Very happy!!
5,Very helpful to amplify my android sound.Bought a second one for my son!
5,Excuse my language but this is a damn good speaker. I've had a few bluetooth speakers and this is the best one. Wish I'd came across this one first. And is it loud? YES!!! very loud and clear. None of that distorted buzzing or annoying background noise you hear with other speakers. At full volume the music sounds great. I love it. Thanks DOSSUPDATE!!!! IT COMES WITH A SILK-LIKE PROTECTIVE SLEEVE BAG. I FOUND IT UNDER THE FORMED PLASTIC CRADLE IN THE BOX. DOSS PLEASE FIND ANOTHER WAY TO PACKAGE THAT. I'M SURE MANY PEOPLE HAVE THROWN IT AWAY.
3,This is my 3rd Doss Bluetooth speaker. My first one I loved!! Took it on vacation and left it in the hotel in Cancun. It was cheaper to order a new one then to pay for shipping. 2nd one Kept disconnecting from my devices (don’t have this problem with anything else) ordered a replacement same problem. Same devices same services same location. Not sure what the problem could be.
5,Sound quality is very nice easy bluetooth connection
5,Really enjoy this portable speaker even works roughly 35 ft away from my Echo Dot. After using for 6 months I had a problem where the unit would not play anymore so I contacted customer support & shortly after that a new one arrived via USPS and now I'm back enjoying my workout music again.
3,I liked it at first but then I tried to use it to play brown noise and pink noise - and it sounds nothing like it should (based on other large speakers in my house).  It's fine for music but the bass is off & if you want to use it as a white noise machine it's not going to bring the right frequencies.Also I had it 100% charged and slept with it as a white noise machine - and then after 6 hours (only 6) it started playing this weird busy signal to say the battery was low.  1. Why would you play an annoying noise like that??  Just turn off.  2.  Why did it run out in 6 hours on a 100% full charge?
5,I bought the DOSS SoundBox 4.0 to pair with my Echo Dot and so far it's working just like I had hoped. Nice clear sound quality and it can get plenty loud enough to fill my two-bedroom apartment. The Bluetooth connectivity is nice because I can move the soundbox around if I want to. The only downside is that if you want to use Alexa often you'll have to keep to soundbox plugged in to an outlet. I wish that Alexa could power up the soundbox when it comes time to respond to commands but I guess ya can't have it all!
3,Not quite what I thought it was.
4,I'm amending my initial review which is a first for me. As I said in my first review this is a sleekly designed powerful speaker with a rich sound. However I had some problems with mine initially. The Doss customer service people could not have been more prompt and dealt with the issue immediately. With such unusually high quality customer service like that behind the product you can't go wrong.
5,Nice sound and a good price.
5,I like the ease of transferring MP3 files to the speaker which it then plays when started. The ability to play music without an external source is very convenient.
1,I liked this Doss unit until it died last week. Well it sorta died - it won't shut off and it won't stay on. Maybe it's in a comma. Don't know why it's never been dropped or abused.I emailed support and got the typical - "reset the unit" - which I had tried to no avail. I made sure it was fully charged - it didn't help. Nothing kept it from this annoying startup/shutdown loop. Finally support said it's probably the battery and offered a coupon for another unit.I told them I would get another unit but not one with the Doss name it. A life of 3 years for an electronic device with virtually no moving parts - save the speaker - is ridiculous. I have a Panasonic Portable Cassette player that's over 30 years old and still works fine.Looks like Doss has read Vance Packard's book "The Waste Makers". Spread the word.
4,good sound for the price
3,This is a $15 speaker being sold for twice as much. It’s not bad. It’s just okay.
5,Very satisfied! great quality . I bought this product two years ago  and work very well.
3,The sound quality isn't quite what I hoped for.  But when you only pay $27.99 what would you expect.  For the money its worth it.  But if you want to blow the roof off your house or drive your parents crazy I would upgrade and get the $60 dollar variety.
5,I LOVE THIS SPEAKER! I have friends who have paid from 100.00 to 700.00 for their portable speakers. I paid 20.00 for this one and it sounds just as good as theirs if not better! Battery lasts FOREVER! Sound quality is AWESOME! BUY THIS SPEAKER!!!
4,I dont have a lot of experience with bluetooth speakers maybe it deserves 5 stars. Works perfectly charge life excellent sound is surprisingly good. Great size for portability and plenty of heft for stability. Would buy sgain and again.
4,I am quite happy with my purchase of the Doss Blue tooth speaker. The quality and sound are wonderful. It connects fast and seems to have a good range. We use it in our kitchen when cooking. Great to listen to your music when cooking.
2,Absolutely no bass whatsoever. Tribit was better sounding for a portable speaker but just went with an echo dot for bathroom instead of either of those because it sounded better.
5,Good volume as well.  Bluetooth connects easily.
5,I bought this hoping to hear some music better since I’m hard of hearing. Well it works really well and the setup was easy I recommend.
4,Great little speaker for the price.
4,Se apaga cada 15 minutos
5,I wanted a speaker so I could hear the tunes on my Galaxy S in the shower. And this is it! Great sound loud with no distortion and connects via Bluetooth super fast!! Just love it!!
5,great sound
5,Not extremely loud Just the right sound Bluetooth connectivity is perfect
4,Good product use while working
5,Great sound easy to carry around to different parts of the house good warning signal when it needs to be recharged and fast recharging.
5,I really like the size sound and amount of Tim you get on a charge. You can’t go wrong for the price either  sounds great !
3,not working with Microsoft teams other functions work fine. called product support but they were not able to fix it.
5,I just received this to replace my other Bluetooth speaker.  It has great sound!  If you are looking for a strong bass sound then this is not the speaker to buy.  It has good volume.  I have not had a chance to test the battery life yet so I cannot rate it.  So far I am very happy with the product and I feel it is priced right.
5,I great sound
5,Super happy with the sound quality.  I bought three of them since they were on sale.  My husband is very happy with his.  I am certain my daughter will love hers.  Sound quality of incoming phone calls on it is great.  On the cell phone end of the call it sounds like someone is talking on a mediocre quality speaker.  But I purchased this to listen to music and I am thrilled with that aspect of it.  Would definitely recommend as a great gift!
5,This works perfect for my desk at work. It puts out a great sound and gives me my mucus while I’m working. It also has a great sound at louder levels!  I’ve had no issues with Bluetooth connecting. I don’t use it with battery as it sits in my desk so I just use the usb connection. Perfect for what I needed at a good price.
5,So far it is a pretty good speaker.  Not sure on battery life yet haven't had it long enough but I did use it for a couple hours and seemed to hold up well.
5,I like the fact that the speaker will connect to all devices
4,It played music fine for 3 weeks. Today it started sounding like an old cassette player static sound is overwhelming at every volume. Returning.Edit: the company replaced my product once they read this comment. The new speaker is fully functional so far. I am going to wait and see whether this one will last but the company really tried to make things work for me. :)
5,Charge up the device.  Turn on your computer or phone to sync. If it’s an Apple product is syncs automatically.  The sound is good.  Adjusting the sound is iffy. You’ll find out. Again great deal with good sound.
4,Absolutely love everything about it!
5,Awesome speaker! Connects easy. The battery last a very long time. Sounds great.  No problems with it. Very happy with the purchase
5,This is a wonderful speaker I would suggest to everyone. It has great sounds quality and the battery life is better than any other I have bought
5,Sound is great ! very compatible with my kindle!
5,Easy to use great sound use it ever!!! Love it!!!
4,Very pleased it's a great bluetooth speaker.  I would recommend it to other customers
5,Great price. Easy setup and connectivity. Love the sound and the ability to use micro sd cards to listen  to straight from the speaker. Don’t hesitate to buy this if your thinking about getting one!
5,I LOVE not like but LOVE this speaker! The sound quality is crisp and clear. It connects easily and the battery life is phenomenal. I'm going to buy another one for my son so he won't try to take mine over lol.
5,The best bluetooth speaker I've ever seen at this price range.I had problem with it speaking when being turned on pairing or changing modes. So I e-mailed the producer and asked them for the firmware to remove its voice as suggested by their answer to another customer's question who had the same problem. In less than 24 hours they replied me back with the firmware update and very clear instructions and video.Totally solved it. Firmware update is super easy and simple to do.Thank you! I'm impressed at your product and services!!!
4,What a great sound easy to use it goes in your backpack it goes to your desk the headboard of the bedroom the dashboard of the car it's a winner.
5,I'm fairly picky with a lot of things I buy online and am still wary when buying stuff like this. I saw a lot of good reviews on this speaker but for 30 bucks can it really be that good? The answer is yes. This speaker is awesome. It's easy to use loud and has a great sound.... and I don't mean "great for $30 sound". I would see no reason why they couldn't see this speaker for triple its price. I highly recommend it.
3,Ever since I bought my Doss speaker it keeps on skipping to another song without anyone touching it 🤦I don't know what is the problem 🤔 it's very frustrating Doss is a speaker that I really like because it plays clean because of the skipping problem I hardly use my speaker which I find hard because I bought it with intention to use it daily am so disappointed
5,Worth the money
4,I ordered this based on the price.  It works great just as advertised.  No complaints after using it for a week.  Saying that I would add if you want better fidelity you will have to spend about 3x more.  A friend brought his Sony BT speakers over ($99) compared and they had more bass and better fidelity.  These speakers will work great for you unless you need to spend more for better fidelity on BT speakers.
5,Amazing sound quality and long battery life.It does shut itself off if you pause whatever you’re playing after a pretty short period but it’s a battery saving feature.100% love and recommend this!UPDATE: went to visit my parents and found out my dad bought one after hearing mine play when he visited. Best sound quality!
4,This is the second Bluetooth speaker I have bought to use with my laptop.  The 1st one cost more sounded bad and the bluetooth quit working soon after I got it. The DOSS works great sounds great and I couldn't be more pleased.  I doubt anyone would not like this speaker at this price!
5,Battery life is amazing.  Perfect size and amplified my whole back yard (1/3 acre) so was perfect for our summer party.  We use it all the time and stays charged forever.  Great buy.
4,very good sound easy to use
5,Great speaker fabulous customer service. Has good battery life and bluetooth range. Ideal for camping and other outdoor events.My first unit had some issue and emailed the customer service with a short video explaining the issue. I received a free replacement within 2 weeks. I still had the one year manufacture warranty.
4,as per wish list.  Too soon to know how well it connects sounds battery life etc.  Not a lot of magic - it ought to be fine.
3,The sound quality on this device is pretty good and the Bluetooth connection is pretty decent.  The only drawback is that the device shuts off every 15 minutes or so due to a power-saving mode that you can't control.  In order to shut this feature off you'll have to contact the manufacturer to upgrade the firmware. Not sure why this is necessary.
5,Sound is great and it will turn up very loud if needed. Easy to use very good quality product. I was extremely pleased that the quality is so good at such a reasonable price. The music lasts all day. We played it from 10am to about 10:30 at night and it was still going strong when I turned it off. We gave it a full charge before using it. It was a gift for my husband and he loves.
5,For the price the sound quality is amazing! The Bluetooth connection also goes a long distance and nice to have in my daughter’s nursery to help her sleep. Absolutely love it!
5,The small Bluetooth speaker works great. Easy set up and pairing with my phone. The sound is better than I expected given that this speaker is not very big. It can play extremely loud without distortion.
4,Good sound
4,This speaker was really good. The battery lasted a long time. I liked how the speaker would turn of automatically when you don’t play anything because I always forgot to turn it off. I just didn’t like how when the battery was low the speaker would switch songs or disconnect from Bluetooth. But overall I really enjoy the bass and sound quality for this price.
5,It's awesome great sound! I put it right next to my bed for tv  Curious if I could connect another one with  if so it would be like surround sound and i will purchase another.  Thanks
4,I've tried several USB speakers and none blew me away but this one was the best overall when considering the sound controls and bluetooth range. No small speaker will ever sound great but this had a decent amount of bass and didn't sound too "tinny" on the high end. The controls are not the easiest to use but luckily they're not needed much except for the on/off switch which is inconveniently located on the back.
5,I know many people claim this speaker is not that loud. Despite what the manufacture says it's not as loud as other bluetooth speakers that I  have purchased. However the sound clarity as well as the base is outstanding for a speaker this size. The price is right. If you want a blaster you will likely spend 10 times as much. I own 8 different bluetooth speakers. This one is one of the best. I must complement the manufacture for producing a great sounding speaker for a moderate price. Great looking impressive packaging. Well done! Note to the manufacture. Bass is a fish😁
5,Speaker does not produce the deep bass like my Bose Bluetooth  yet does provide adequate bassdetailed midrange and high end. Connectivity is also constant battery life is awesome. I would purchase again.
5,Would recommend
3,I have used this speaker for less than a month.  It stated of okay but now sounds garbled.  I use it for my sons room for sleep music.  It's a great looking speaker but doesn't meet my needs.  It makes an annoying connection noise which is problematic when using in a nursery the volume light emits a bit of light which might be great for some folks but I don't need any illumination in the dark.
4,It works great touch is fun to use. But straight from the box it feels kinda cheap. If you are just going to be using this at your desk it will do awesome but it is NOT an "outdoor speaker". Bass is okay and the sound is pretty good. It starts to vibrate quite a bit though if you turn it up above 80% sound. :/
5,I only just got this but so far so good! This little speaker packs a pretty good punch!!! I'm someone who likes her music LOUD and I luvs my bass!!! Yeah... This works for me!
5,The sound quality on speaker is awesome. It has great Bass. I just wish the battery lasted longer other than that I will absolutely buy another one!
4,I have been owned this Doss speaker for a year. It is still working great nothing broke.Just a bit dissatisfied wish the sound quality a bit better.
5,This INCREDIBLE PORTABLE Bluetooth Speaker DOSS SoundBox with Touch Wireless Bluetooth V4.0 Speaker with HD Sound and Bass DELIVERS INCREDIBLY GREAT SOUND and looks elegant and is easy to use. It is THE VERY BEST Bluetooth portable speaker I have ever used and enjoyed.  Highly recommended!
5,Such a small box puts out quality sound!
5,I would recommend this speaker to others.
4,Not meant for out-of-doors.
4,I bought this to use for patio parties. It was easy to set up and synch right out of the box. The tone was clear and good sound. Construction is solid and buttons intuitive. It also gives you the option of answering or making calls while connected. I thought it could have used a little more bass but overall especially at this price it is an excellent speaker. Just a note that it did require a 12 hour initial charge so plan accordingly.
5,Loved it immediately!  No hook up problems. Very easy. Great sound. Perfect. Don’t buy a big expensive thing - this is outstanding
5,Simple to use.  Good sound quality even when volume maxed out.  Battery lasts a long time.
4,This has very good sound for its size. I've tried all inputs and they all work fine. Loaded a 16 GB card with a ton of music and I haven't noticed any issues with it. The Bluetooth connection works very well.The English track that plays when switching inputs is extremely dubious. It's hard to tell what is being said and I'm pretty sure it's not grammatically correct. Oh well it's a minor issue.
5,Este radio no muere  dura sin cargarlo 3 días 8Horas cada día  es pequeño y sofisticado meEncanta
5,This Bluetooth speaker doesn’t work anymore  I bought on June 23 and already will not hold a charge.  I’ve charged it over night works for one hour or less and stops light turns off.
5,OMG...I’m extremely PLEASE!!! If you’re looking for a great compact speaker with surround like Sound this is definitely it. It’s everything I was looking for.Thanks Doss!👍🏽
4,Great sound quality
5,great product! awesome bass and it gets really loud! super easy to connect via bluetooth no issues at all. very happy with my purchase :)
5,Battery lasts a long time and it gives you a nice warning before it dies. It makes a noise every couple of minutes for a while before it dies. I've never waited too long before I plugged it in so I can't say how long it will be before but I've posted about 20 minutes. The functions on the top to skip or pause are super convenient didn't even know I was missing that until I got this speaker!
5,The sound is amazing! It’s not muffled or low. I like my music loud and clear and that’s exactly the quality I get with the stereo.
5,I love this speaker!!! Only thing i wish I had noticed when ordering was that it comes in different colors. Other then that it has great sound quality and your phone can be connected to the speaker from a far distance. For the price it it totally worth it!
5,Love this speaker!
5,I love it! It has the right amount of volume. I love the base. It was easy to hook up! I’ve been listening to it about 3 hours every night for the last 5 nights and have not had to recharge it yet. It’s perfect for me.
5,Great product!
5,Love it! Sound is great battery longevity is great. Only issue is it skips a bit when it's connected to the blue tooth not really noticeable but have to mention that. Other wise it's a great product.
5,The speaker looks great not cheap. Sound is good and can be turned up pretty loud. Talk feature is great. I agree with other reviews the on/off chime is a little hokey (but not a huge deal) & the volume control on the speaker is a very small dial. However I just control volume on my phone which works fine. SURPRISE under the formed plastic in the bottom of the box is a cloth protective sleeve. You'd never know its there and I bet 99% are thrown out. I bought this as a gift and then got myself one.
5,I just got this on Tuesday but am finally able to use it 2 days after receiving it. For some reason it keeps pausing Pandora while playing. It plays for 2 minutes and pauses the song. I keep having to push play. In addition to that the turning on/off and bluetooth connect is fairly loud and the volume keeps resetting.(UPDATE)They sent me a new one. No question asked. This one doesn't have a problem at all. Used this speak to blast Backstreet Boys before their show in my room. Didn't have a problem at all.
5,Very satisfied!! Thinking about buying another one for work
4,Wish there was a way to turn the auto-off feature at least while it's plugged in. Having to turn it on all the time is inconvenient. Ours stays in one place plugged in all the time. Would be great if it could go into a low-power state or something and be turned on easily when you connect to it from your device.
5,This is my second one of these because the first one met its end in a pail of water.  The sound is excellent and has a great range of treble and bass.  For the money it is an amazing speaker.  Battery lasts forever.  Connects easily.  Great product.
5,I think this is the coolest addition to my home electronics. I don't know how something so small puts out great sounds!!! I have it for my Dot. It works so well I ordered a second one for the great room and for when I am working outside.The charge lasts a long time and a voice comes on to tell when it needs to be charged. I've become proficient when it comes to volume control. I love that finger tip control of the top. A lot of boom for a terrific price. Excellent customer service. Great price and arrived quickly.
5,I've had the speaker for exactly 5 months now and over time i've noticed the same thing. i always have to turn it up on my phone and the speaker. so eventually i reached out to their helpful team and they still responded. i asked them for a new fireware file to set the default volume to max and if they could change the led for bluetooth to red and they did. Such an amazing speaker and team. Sound quality is great could use a bit more bass but for the price it is a steal.
5,Had to replacement my expensive Bluetooth speaker gave this cheap one a shot and wow. This thing is incredible for the price the bass is even better than my old beats pill. Loud clear sound. Sleek. 10/10
5,It was very easy to sync to my phone. I bought this Oct. 9th. Used it for about 1 hour. It's been setting on my desk since then. I just tried it to see if the battery is still up and running. It is. I don't know how long it lasts if it's actually turned on. Love the volume and sound.
4,It is a great Bluetooth speaker. We use it all the time. I was a little skeptical because of the price and no one I asked had heard of DOSS..  But it is a great speaker . The only reason it did not get  5 stars because it needed a little more or better information on operating the speaker. Especially for some of us "seniors".
5,Awesome for the price works great for an office.
5,Loved that sound very loud for a little speaker. Love the color blue the buttons are very kool. Only thing is I can’t get it to connect to my Alexa show or spot
5,This is the BEST money I have EVER spent on a speaker. The battery life is amazing the sound quality is phenomenal it makes my table shake when it’s up all the way lol. Has such potential to be a really expensive speaker but I got it for 20$ it’s a complete steal!! I would recommend this speaker to ANYBODY.
5,Best working great
3,Bought this on Cyber Monday because I needed another speaker I could keep in my kitchen.  I liked that this one was white.  The other speaker I have is an Anker purchased a couple of years ago.  I wanted to like this speaker better and it had all of the right makings it was stylish and the controls were much easier than the Anker but the sound quality just isn't there. So it gets a very mediocre at beat rating.
5,Purchased this for my husband as an Xmas gift as his other much older Bluetooth speaker had recently died. He ended up getting it as an early Xmas present the day it was delivered because of how frustrated he was over the old speaker. He absolutely loves this 1 and uses it almost daily without any complaints.
5,I’ve had this for more than 4 years works like its brand new and I use it all the time sound is clear and loud.  Connects well on Bluetooth so worth it.
4,Great speaker for what I need it for. The only thing is when the battery gets low so does the sound quality but I expected that.
5,This little speaker is amazing battery use is great. I used it for 3 full days about 8 hours day and few days for about 3 hours till battery died.  Come on you can't ask for better. Its loud enough good sound. I give this speaker 10 stars. Great buyI purchased 2 will purchase more for gifting.
5,This product quickly paired with my iPhone.  It allows me to listen to streamed radio stations at a good volume.  The volume is quite good with the iPhone volume set to max.  When a phone call comes in it rings through this speaker but when answered and switched to phone speaker the streaming music mutes on this speaker.
4,Not the sound quality you would expect from a $129 Bluetooth speaker but for the money this thing is great so far. Plenty loud and plenty clear for me.
4,Sound quality is great but the max. volume is too low to fill a large room.  I needed this for a classroom setting so my Theatre students could play their music at the Thespian festival.  Had it been just a bit louder this would have earned 5 stars.  I have not returned it and in fact still use it but will be looking for something more powerful for next year's competitions!
5,Easy to connect my phone to and for a little speaker it has good sound and bass. I have a small sony cube speaker and the doss blows it away but it is also 3x the size. Great for when im in the garage working on a car listening to music. Pleased with the speaker overall
4,I tried the trial Prime membership and bought a few things I actually needed. I really didn't need a speaker but I figured for the discounted price and it's great reviews why not. I was not disappointed!!! It's on the smaller side but it does not lack quality. It's easily connects to my phone and I can take it anywhere with the complimentary traveling bag. definitely a good buy if you're looking for a small speaker with high quality sound. 👌🏽
4,It’s better than listening to music through my iPhone. Sounds kind of tinny though. (The reason for the four stars) Other than that a great size and powerful speaker.
5,This is an excellent speaker for me.  Use it on my job.  At home I would enjoy a tad more volume but it’s great for the office.
5,Love this speaker! It connects to all my devices (Samsung smartphone Apple ipod etc) with ease. Quality of sound is great and clear.  Battery life is awesome. I use it every morning for about a week so far and still haven't had to charge it since the initial charge when I first got it.  Way better than the JBL Go 2 that I used to use.
5,Best speaker I’ve ever purchased! Not only does the battery last a very long time it is also very loud! Don’t let the small frame fool you!
5,I'm still learning about the ways I can use this wireless speaker. What I have used so far has been good. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the sound the first charge has lasted much longer than I expected and there have been no issues with the Bluetooth connectivity. Definitely happy with this purchase.
5,Very clear on vocals and all instruments... clear speaker with no distortion
5,This is amazing especially for the price! Buy it!
5,I own 2 of these speakers now. I bought one over a year ago for use around the house. The sound was awesome but then my wife “borrowed” it for her office at work and I haven’t seen it since. I needed a speaker for my office so I bought a second one. The sound is incredible as are the battery life and connectivity. For $25 you can’t go wrong.
5,Loved it while it was working.  Just gave up the ghost at not quite 8 months.Update 5-16-17  Awesome customer service.  Bumped up to 5 stars.The same day I posted that it quit after 8 months I received an email from DOSS apologizing for my problems.  They stated that it was still under warranty (which I didn't even know I had) and they would send out a new replacement.2 days later I receive my replacement and am very happy again.  Great customer service DOSS!  Thank you!
5,This is one of my all-time favorite Amazon buys! Awesome sound EASY setup!!! I love that it acts as a speaker for my phone too. Great itm!$$
5,Really pleased with the sound and battery life.
5,I previously had a small portable speaker that I bought from Best Buy for about $15.00 more.  That speaker broke after approximately 1 month.  In addition it was "mono" only.  This speaker is SO much better.  I currently don't have a car stereo so I use this in my vehicle with my ipod.  Good stereo sound loud enough for my purposes easy to use controls comes with a little fabric carrying sack and I paid about $15 less than the broken speaker.  So far extremely happy with this purchase and I am considering buying another for our garage.
4,I was hoping the bass would have been a little more deeper sounding. That's the only issue I have with it. Other than that. It's a really good speaker.
1,This is where I disagree with google reviews. This product doesn't stay on. if you don't mind turning a computer speaker on and off all the time then buy it. This crap is annoying.
4,1) Battery life great2) Awesome aesthetics - chic looking and beautiful color3) Arrived promptly and in great shape; packaged very well4) Sound quality - average; clearly this not a 200$+ BOSE speaker. For the price it is offered at you cannot complain !5) Sensitive touch control is coolI would like to think that my $30 something was well spent !
5,Works well connects well & is loud especially for its size. It's nice to transport as well.
5,The DOSS Bluetooth speaker does not disappoint. On the beach on the deck in the house. Buy it!
4,Exceptionally clear sound but not much bass.  The OontZ Angle 3 is not quite as loud but the bass is noticably better especially for music but even for voice.  I'd definitely trade if I could.Some have complained about the controls but I find them intuitive.  The lack of bass is my only complaint so far.
5,I bought one of these units. Had it on line in less than two minutes. Sounded great for the size. I use it to augment my cellphone and laptop speakers. It will not replace you home theater system nor is it intended to do so. It produces good quality sound and the volume will fill a reasonable size room. I liked it so much I immediately purchased another and will probably  give a few more to relatives as gifts. It is easy to use and well worth the money.
4,This item was purchased in july 2018 and has stopped working completely in nov 2018. The speaker was rarely used.However the company was kind enough to send a replacement speaker due to still having warranty and were extremely courteous to reach out to me. I have my replacement speaker and am extremely satisfied.
5,What a great sound ! I use this by my pool I love that I do not have to turn my iPhone up. You touch the top gently spin the light and pow! Excellent quality Sound. I’ll take a video upload it later. You can pause and take calls too! Nice features at a great price assistance available anytime. Plus you can get a warranty? Wow!
5,Purchased this Does speaker had a few issues with the productbut customer service was awesomeThey sent Me a replacement and wrote Me the nicest letter ever I'm now listening to My new Does speaker and it works wonderfulnice soundextremely loudand tons of baseand not to mention it's super easy to work and easy to connect to my phone via Bluetooth so I can play my playlistand also works well by plugging it in with the included aux cord. Love the product love the company customer service is awesome.
5,Love this litte speaker it has great sound for its size and the bluetooth is extremly easy to use its the second one we have orderd my daughter had one that i would use every now and then but she went away to collage a month ago and i found myself missing not only her but the speaker as well so i orderd one for myself! It was delieverd fast has a long battery life and is just a great little speaker!
4,This is a very nice looking unit. The sound is very good for the price. The touch volume is easy to manage; I'm not sure why some are reporting issues with it all the touch controls work well. It synced easily with my Echo Dot and gives a rich sound for much less than the full Echo. Haven't had it long enough to test battery life. Note you will have to charge it fully before using.
5,It was a gift for a 13 year old  and it made her happy  so that’s enough for me . Good Job
5,This is a compact unit that is easily transported. Sound quality is very good. Battery life is great. It doesn't take long to charge the unit.
5,You can put a microSDHC card with music on it directly into the unit!  I don't believe the specs mention that it has a microSDHC port.  I plugged in an 8gb card; not sure what the capacity is (64gb?  32GB?)Music sounds fine.For some reason I had a problem pairing with my phone's WIFI UNTIL I plugged in an earphone then for some reason it connected immediately!  I unplugged the earphone and it now connects automatically without problem.I LIKE the mode/volume/play/fast forward lights on top of the unit!
5,I drive a truck that's very noisy and have no trouble hearing music playing through the speaker and getting a volume that lets me hear radio calls and the song playing at the time.
5,Great portable speaker. The sound quality is excellent and I was pretty shocked just for how cheap it was! The volume level works very well and the sound quality does not suffer when the volume is loud. It holds a charge very well and so far we have had no connectivity problems. It's pretty cool that you can answer phone calls and talk to the person without having your phone nearby (as long as it's connected). The touch buttons are a neat added feature as well. I'm considering buying some more for various areas in our home.
5,This was one of the products that I was iffy about because of how cheap it was and I can say this was way more than I expected I highly recommend if you want a simple speaker in your room for personal use with great quality
5,I love this speaker.  Very easy to use and the battery lasts a long time.  I just bought another one for my daughter one to take to college.
5,This was my Christmas gift and I love it. I’m digitally challenged and I can use it. I take it everywhere. The sound is great too.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Pretty loud. Perfect for my shower and beach concerts...music from pandora lol
4,Best bass I've had in a bluetooth speaker of this size and I've tried several.(It's no 12" subwoofer but you can feel the bass right through the table.)The connect/disconnect voice is also not nearly as annoying as some I've had.  This one reminds me of George Takei (probably isn't.)Loud enough to fill a noisy medium room.Not terribly thrilled with the gimicky circular touch volume wheel but you get used to it.
5,Very good speaker good sound quality for the price excellence band quality  easy to use touch controls.
5,Nice little box that pacts a nice loud sound! I use this to listen to my SiriusXM and the sound quality is good to me...Good price also!
3,not as like as i hoped 😔
4,I absolutely love my DOSS soundbox!!!
5,This little Bluetooth speaker carries a big sound and a lot of features I like the way it turns off if I'm not using it the ease of operation is great
4,For value price  I was satisfied with this product. ( Recommended )  when you change the volume the lamp not changed it just On or Off/ not increasing like bar or something. When you reach max volume it will be beeping twice.
5,I really liked this speaker. The sound quality is great. The battery life lasted for several hours...and best part is it shows the battery life at the top of my Android phone. I listed to my YouTube playlist for 2-3 hours in a row and it didn't even put a dent in the battery life!! I love it that is portable and Bluetooth..no cords or wires required.  I would reorder this item again if I needed to.
5,A coworker bought a jbl Bluetooth wireless speaker on sale at Best Buy and yes it sounded great. Even on sale I still didn’t want to spend that much so based on overall reviews and sales I bought this. Syncing to my phone was super easy and quick and yes sound isn’t as good as the jbl but it’s pretty good. With that said if it lasts a long time you won’t go wrong with this speaker. Especially if you are on a budget.
5,I just received this today.  Charged it up as required.  Took 3 hours.  Attached it to my laptop with blue tooth super easy.  And wow the sound in this little thing!!!  Could bust your ear drums.  Easy to navigate.  Easy to turn up and down.  I love it.  It may be too early to give this review but I will revise if anything changes my mind at a later date.
3,I bought this based on the reviews. I have it connected to my echo dot in my theater room. It is connected to my echo by cable. Everything works but the volume level mine puts out is disappointing. Not that I expect it to fill the room with sound but at it's highest level the echo's Alexa app speaks at a normal voice level or slightly below. If my unit is any indication of this speaker then I can't see using it outside unless it's by your side and there isn't much ambient noise. I have another dot connect to another make of speaker which is 1/4 the size and it gets much louder without noticeable distortion. I got this model thinking it would be louder so I could play music in the room when I wanted.
5,Bought this for use at work (in along term care facility) to bring back the joy of music for my residents. This has great sound quality for am inexpensive price. This is actually the second that I’ve purchased - one solely for work and the other for at home. I recommend this frequently!!
3,After couple months it made the turning off sound and wouldn't stop after it didn't pair anymore the blue circle never came on .... dead:-( I am a senior citizen and wanted to enjoy some christian songs off my phone! I am disgusted how long it lasted. I didn't even use it for a while cs of surgeries :-(Pretty sad NOTHING is made anymore how it used to be!!
4,I purchased this speaker to my niece and the other day we went to the beach and she brought it I noticed that it still works perfectly the sound is great! Sounding awesome after 1 or 2 years.
4,Haven't even had for a year and it won't keep its charge. Luckily the company was nice enough to replace it at no additional charge. Only other thing is when turning up the volume if you're  not careful it will change it to the next song because it's a flat surface and you accidentally hit next. Frustrating when listening to pandora and you can't go back
4,Pros:great soundgood bassbest pricetouch top control is coolvery portablelong battery lifeuses usb 2.0 charger and generic white charging blockpairs well with other phonescons:the led light on top never dims or turns off (i bought this to use as a sound machine at night but i just flip it upside down)doesn't pair well with my laptop and phone
5,Initially I wasn't going to post a review... however; after my "incident" I HAD TO. I turned my garage into a home theatre and used the speaker in conjunction with a mini-projector. The speaker was sitting on a small board 11 ft high connected to the projector. The sound of the speaker caused the speaker to vibrate right off the board. The speaker fell 11ft to a concrete garage floor and to my surprise.... it was STILL working and still is. This speaks to the durabilty of this product.
5,Super cute and has great sound quality!
4,It is a good speaker. I like the base the design and battery life. The volume max level is mediocre not too loud.I still have problem each time connecting it to my laptop via Bluetooth. Although it is paired with it I have to manually reconnect it every time. But I had other Bluetooth speakers in the past and sometime it did happen but for this one it happens all the time.
5,This speaker is small but provides excellent sound. I keep mine in my car and love it.
4,This is wonderful speaker for the price point. Nice warm sound and pretty nice battery life.The bass is superb and the treble is pretty nice vocals are pretty clear. The Bluetooth connection has been quick and solid so far.The main drawbacks are sound distortion at very high volume the LED lights don't turn off and the charging port is very tight (take your time connecting the charging cable to avoid damaging it).
5,buying this speaker was the best thing I could've done for myself! I LOVE the sound quality and since I watch tv on my laptop a lot this has really elevated my quality of Netflix binging.
5,GOOD SOUND EASY TO USE
4,Definitely worth thirty bucks. Perfect for general user. Fairly loud and clean sound. The 15 minutes power timeout is an issue if you plan to use it the speaker in "always on" mode - for the notebook desktop Alexa etc. A constant and fairly bright glowing of the touch panel could be annoying too. Thankfully support@dossav.com provided me with FW without auto power-off function. Wish they make a touch panel lights-off timeout one too.
5,We love these! We have two. Very easy to connect to and the sound is great!
5,The sound and features are very nice. Initially had a problem  pairing bluetooth but eventually was able to pair the speaker and it transmits nicely. 32 gm micro SD card works well.
5,This is an amazing Bluetooth speaker. It has amazing depth and bass for its size. It will go louder then you would ever want it to go. I bought this speaker for my wife for Christmas and she is going to absolutely love it. It will fill a room and you will truly enjoy the sound this little speaker produces. It is a very nice looking speaker I love the touch sensitive buttons it provides for a sleak look and will look very nice in our house. I would definitely recommend this speaker and am extremely satisfied with my purchase.
5,For the price this speaker offers impressive performance. It’s hard to comprehend how the manufacturer can make such a quality sounding small speaker at such an affordable price. To boot my speaker stopped functioning properly (would power up on its own and lights flicker) and after contacting customer service the manufacturer sent me a replacement speaker at no cost. I’m very satisfied with this purchase and with the support received.
4,Very pleasantly surprised with the quality.  Great sound easy to use.  Love it.  Would recommend.
5,For the price it's excellent. The bass could be deeper but I want expecting this level of quality for under $40.
5,Very good sound and range. Not super loud but can drown out a noisy room of people. Checked bluetooh range and I got 45-50 feet outdoors (amazing). I get 100% coverage anywhere on first floor of my house in any room.  No connectivity issues. There is no eq settings but audio is crisp with average to decent bass. For the price its outstanding..My shark commando was 100 bucks more and this thing sounds 90% equal with much better range. Powering up a very distinguished mans voice advises you in uh Engrish: "bluetooth mode has be on"Classic....
5,Love this. Connects Bluetooth to my phone and tablet. Volume gets loud so I can go in another room or take it with me. Easy to set up and use.
5,Can't lie I was very surprised at the sound quality of this little guy. Haven't cranked up completely yet but just a little over halfway is loud. Very happy with my purchase.Update: 2 months later this still works but it will randomly start skipping songs. The fast forward/ skip button literally will start flashing like it's being pressed. Huge annoyance when you're trying to listen to music and it keeps skipping through all the songs.
4,Don’t have much experience with things suchas this but seem good.Looks good sounds better than phone.In general would recommend!
4,This was an amazing buy! I use it everyday and take with me wherever I go.
5,This had great sound.  For the money if you are not going with high end this is your unit.  The only thing it lacks in sound is depth in the base. Tones were accurate but had not power behind it.  That said this thing is loud and defined otherwise.  I bought a second one for the wife!
5,Works as it is supposed to.
5,Easy to set up great sound
5,I got it a year ago still working great volume is loud ! and sound quality is great
5,This little speaker actually delivers a better sound than my $99 LG sound bar. I totally recommend this speaker if you're budget is around $50. See below for breakdown.Mid & High Sound: Very clear "mid" and crisp "high" soundsBass: It doesn't quite have the "Oomph" but not too bad considering its price range. And there no static sounds when you pump up the volume.Bluetooth Range: Connection is never lost even when I place my phone and the speaker at the furthest point from each other. I live in a 1500 square-foot apartment.
5,I gave this to my brother for Christmas and he loves it. It's not going to make the house bump but if you just want to have a jam sesh and listen to music or dance a little bit it is good and clear. I haven't heard it yet in a party atmosphere but I don't think it would be loud enough with a lot of people. I gave it 5 stars because of the price point I got it for. For under 50 bucks ( I paid 35) I feel it was well worth the price. If you
5,Great value for a small but loud speaker!
5,This little speaker is fantastic! It links right away has really good sound and the company stands behind their product. I had a busy signal coming through on it contacted them and they responded immediately that this was the signal that it needed to be charged. It was supposed to come with a little usb cord to charge but did not so they sent this right away...no questions no charge. I would buy another of their products based on quality of sound and customer service. Thank you Doss!
5,I really enjoyed the sound quality and battery life of this Bluetooth speaker. I wanted a speaker for my job so when I moved from one Department to another I could take my music with me. Sadly though I only had the speaker for 2 weeks before my job had a burglary and someone stole it. But before it got stolen I really did enjoy the speaker.
5,Very good long lasting after charge and durable
4,One thing I dislike bout this speaker is the battery life. It will last bout 4 hours if that at my job and I turn it off while I'm on breaks and lunches. Other than that it does great.
5,The sound is great for a small speaker.
5,One of many  recent quarantine purchases . INLOVE WITH IT . Don’t let the size fool you.Sound quality is good  volume is great . And the color pink is my favorite
5,The different modes are shown different colors.I use this device with my computer and tv.
4,i like these speakers. They are great to use for phone to listen to your music.
5,I love this little gem!  Little with amazing sound quality!  We use this in our backyard and at the beach.  Connectivity to Bluetooth was instant and the battery life lasts for a full day at the beach ❤️  We love it!
5,This speaker is just amazing the sound is so clear and crisp and volume it puts out is unbelievable You will never find a better speaker at this price.
3,I bought this for the purpose of adding a speaker for my home stereo wirelessly. The unit seem solid and the Bluetooth paired relatively easy with some delay. I placed the  speaker in the kitchen which rather far from the living room where the main speakers are and also I don't want to add any wire stretching from the stereo to the kitchen. When the unit was on the volume control is rather awkward because you have kind of touch and makes a rotating movement to turn up or down the volume. What turned me off was the echoey effect the unit makes when the music came from both if the main speaker and the DOSS. It might be the feedback but I find that very annoying.
5,Great sound and easy pairing.
5,If you're looking for a speaker that puts out than you need to look no further. This thing is amazing!!!! The bass treble it's all perfect. I plan to use this all the time. In comparison a coworker of mine had a $300 speaker just a tad bit bigger than this one. They sound exactly the same and it gets sooo loud! And I paid $240 less. Win Win!! I promise you will not be disappointed with this product. The photo provided is to show how big it is compared to a 4" blade.
5,I ordered this speaker for my girlfriend and I was actually surprised by the sound quality.  She loves it too.. Def worth the price.
3,Could be better. The sound is kinda off and the battery dies quickly.
5,Perfect speaker for a day at the pool!
3,I really had big Hope's for this speaker and the price is pretty good I have tried it out for a while now it sounds good better than I expected  bass response is pretty weak but for the price point that's ok.So why only 3 stars the manual states the volume is 2x 6 watts it's nowhere near that Even with the volume turned mas on the speaker and my phone it is bearly able to fill a medium sized room with people talking.This speaker has a nice sound if you dont mind weak bass but it is let down by its weak output power it's great for a personal space but dont expect to entertain people with this thing not gonna work
5,I have no complaints about this speaker - I brought it to Mexico (it seemed to have good battery life) for music and use it at work for TV. I like how simple it is to use and switch from the AUX to Bluetooth.
5,Great speaker and sound quality. We used the speaker when we went to the beach.
5,Daughter says it bumps! lol.  Not sure what that means exactly but she likes it. lol
5,A mi cuñada le encantó fácil de usar y un muy buen sonido a pesar del tamaño.
5,Update:Company reached out and made a product replacement after a firmware upgrade. I changed my review to 5 stars because now I take this all over my property to listen to music while I landscape.Thanks Wonders Tech!Previous:It’s a little strange with features I don’t need. Makes too much chime noise to interrupt music when connected over Bluetooth. Charger never sits right and have to roll the cord around it. It makes a funny “busy” tone when battery is low.
3,When it worked it was great.  Six months after purchase just started turning on and off randomly in the middle of the night. We turned off all devices that would be trying to connect and the darn thing won't stop turning off and on. Tried with music the next day and it connects; but the machine continues to turn off then back on with no human interaction. Something shorted out somewhere along the line. We'll see if we can open it up and figure it out or at least experiment for the kids.
5,Great speaker for the price. Great for talk radio or Sirius rock channels. Should have bought two.
3,The main reason I returned this item is because the Bluetooth range was small. I compared this item with the OontZ speaker and found the later had much better range. Also the instructions said the speaker would charge in about 3 hours and in 6 hours it still hadn't reached full charged. At that time I thought the device defective but it eventually went to full charge as indicated by the green led indicator. I liked the controls on the top of the unit as opposed to on the end in the OontZ unit but the limited Bluetooth range was unacceptable.
5,This product is incredible!  Sound quality is better than any sound bar I have for my TVs.  I would buy and are fully recommend
5,Great speaker I really love it and it's a steal for $33. It's loud and the bass is impressive for a speaker so small. The only hiccup is understanding when the battery is low/ if it's charging... I haven't run out of battery it seems like it gets quieter and the bass stops pumping so hard when the battery is low. And there's no indication when it's done charging... a little weird but well worth the purchase regardless (the battery seems to last a long time just to be clear).
4,For the price and what I’m using it’s pretty solid.  From MY experience Sound is above average can handle mids and highs ok but songs with bass may come out with some distortion.  For the office it actually works great.  Easy to connect and haven’t had any problems with it.  A great buy.
5,This little bomb box is loud and powerful! Great for around the house and taking it on vacation. Great buy!
5,This speaker has brought me so much joy. The sound is great connecting is easy and now my music can go with me anywhere!
3,sound isn't very loud.
5,For it's size it has a powerful sound. So glad I  purchased this Bluetooth Speaker. Great sound quality.  This was so much easier to Connect to Bluetooth than the old Bluetooth Speaker I paid much more for and broke a few months later. Can carry it from room to room.  ***** I give it 5 out 5 stars.
4,I like this speaker it has decent bass but can rattle when turn to the max on some music.  Overall good for what i wanted I will go for a more expensive one in the future so i can have one that will have more bass and be louder.  I am NOT disappointed with this one however.
4,Good speaker however I bought it for $20 about 2 years ago (non prime day) and today 07/15/19 on "prime day" this is still selling for $20 with a lightining deal... bottom line no deal at all on prime day.
5,This one's a keeper. When I first connected it to my phone I didn't realize I had phone volume all the way up and it was loud much louder than I expected. And considering the compact size it has respectable bass as well. Touch controls to skip pause etc work flawlessly. It would be nice if the LEDs could be dimmed a bit but that's nitpicking considering the price. Perhaps not the most portable unit around because of it's weight but on the other hand it's very solidly built.
4,Used as Bluetooth speaker...worked great.
5,I bought this for my massage office and it works great. Good sound quality especially for the price. It connects well from the other corner of the room or even down the hall. I'm considering one for at home
3,This is a great speaker but I strongly suggest finding a better seller.
5,H-O-L-Y crap😱 this speaker is amazing. It has great weight and it’s loud. The price is very affordable and the best part is that it’s not some cheap quality speaker. This is a great present for anyone. I bought it for my mom and she uses it for her massage business and when she want to listen to music she doesn’t have to use the computer or earbuds she can listen to what she wants where she wants😁.
5,So happy I bought this bluetooth speaker. It connects instantly to my devices and the sound quality is amazing!
5,Great price awesome product. Never had any issues and sound quality is great. Music puts everyone in a better mood perfect for working mom to come home throw some tunes on and clean/ prepare meals. It gets pretty loud usually only need 3/4 all the way up. Portable great battery life and no problems/ issues! Great product especially for price will be buying another for my husband so he can take on his fishing trips. Five stars!
4,Has great sound and bass. No trouble at load volumes. Only down side is I don't think it has water proofing. This was my secongld purchase as my first one after 2 years started to crackle at load volumes.
5,Great little speaker
5,I’ve had a doss box for about four years now and it has not failed me and it’s loud and easy to use
5,Incredibly easy to connect with Bluetooth (and I am TERRIBLE with electronics).  The sound quality is superior I am still shocked with how good this sounds.  Battery life is substantial and this product is something I wouldn’t want to be without.  Excellent product and incredibly reasonable price.  I use this every day.
4,This Speaker lasted 6 months. It now powers on at will beeps and make tones all day and night.Update: contacted the seller and they are sending me a new speaker.
4,Speaker freezes and skips. At first i thought it was the music apps i was using but it was the speaker! Ontop of that the sound quality is terrible and staticky! I returned this. I would not recommend.Update: company sent me a new complimentary speaker. It skips/freezes but not as much as the one I originally ordered. ok speaker.
4,The only issue I have is that it keeps disconnecting the micro SD
5,Got this speaker as a Christmas present for my girlfriend.  She loves it and been using it almost daily since last Christmas.  I used it myself a couple of times and was very impressed with the sound quality.  For the pricethis is an excellent portable speaker.
4,I hate this soundbox. It keeps powering on for no reason and makes unexpected noises. Unable to power off this device.
4,They sound good for the price.......the thing about these water proof or splash resistant speakers is that the battery is sealed up inside and almost impossible to get to so when the battery dies.....time to buy a new one.......therea a term for that.......its called planned obsolescence
3,I have probably owned 20 bluetooth speakers throughout the last couple of years. (I know I have an issue) I bought this one for my mom for Christmas so she can jam around the house. After reading all reviews and staying in my price point I settled on this one. I have to say I am not impressed. I dont really know how it has such high reviews. I played several different styles of music and none of them seemed well balanced. My small UE Roll has better balance and sound than this speaker. The build does seem sturdy and It works fine for my mom but if I would have bought it for myself I would have sent it back.
5,Our great nephew wanted a small bluetooth speaker for his birthday. He was very happy with his gift especially because it came in Red and matched the laptop his parents purchased for veinal school homework.
4,The Quality of the sound is Very Good and the price was excellent. Just what I needed for my patio.
3,We purchased this and loved it. It has great sound quality and the battery life works fairly well. But around the 9 month mark of owning this it started skipping randomly turning off music and randomly turning itself off while its not an expensive speaker I did expect to get at least a few years out of it.
4,it is just ok.  This is my 3rd speaker and i am just not finding the right one.  This one has too much of a high pitch and hurts my ears sometimes.  I have no  problem switching phones to use it and it always turns on.  it plays different sounds so you know what turned on.
3,This may be a quarantine issue but I ordered this months ago and was told a cable which was missing from the original packaging would be sent to me.  Never got it.  Thankfully it came charged and I will get my own cable to charge.  Would like to give it a better review but I am frustrated about cable!
5,I love the sound of this speaker. It's got a nice crisp bass sound that is lacking in other Bluetooth speakers. I like the touch buttons on the to of the device. The only thing I'm not crazy about is the volume button or I should say volume circle? It's literally a blue circle that you have to run your finger around and around for even a little sounds change. But this is small potatoes. Loving it
4,I purchased this primarily to listen to Christmas music during the holiday season. The sound quality is good and the battery life has been just fine.
3,First this is a perfect speaker in my work office where I don't crank it up too high but play a mix of hard rock ambient electro chill etc. the sound is pretty darn good considering the price. The bass is a bit too low but not bad. The only thing I'm curiou about is why does it end songs abruptly and move to the next? This ha happened more than 10 times since I bought it about 3 days ago.  Is the Bluetooth weak? Unknown. I'm keeping it though.
5,Just got this and I LOVE it !! Pairing was a breeze and the sound is fantastic ! It has a nice clear sound with some decent base for it's small size too.  Great size not too big or small. Packaging was good but not bigger than necessary and easy to access. This Doss box is replacing a gawd awful I-pod docking station I use with an AUX plug and I have been suffering with for too long.  Proof I can be too frugal at times.  I am now in wireless heaven rockin on !!
3,I like this speaker. I really do. The sound quality is great especially for the price. I've actually bought 2. The second was to replace one that was damaged after a year. But now this one too is damaged and it's the same issue.The charging port is extremely flimsy. If you don't gently pull out the charging cable the port is done. Both times it was jostled while charging (someone knocked it over; I grabbed it to take to another room forgetting it was plugged in). Both times the charging port was broken.I don't think I'll be purchasing this again. But I am tempted. However for the amount I've spent on 2 I could've bought a name brand speaker that hopefully has a more stable charging port.
5,Ordered the URPOWER LED one and it was not loud at all.  The lights are cute but sound isn't great at all.  Was sending it back but gonna get charged to return it  so just keeping it.  This one's definitely A LOT better and much louder for about the same size and $11 more definitely worth it!!! The sound is much much better compared to the URPOWER.  Better base and louder.  This one's a bit bigger but not by much.  I definitely recommend this one.
5,Love it easy to program
4,I love this except for one thing I can’t get it to stop skipping songs randomly
5,I don't use speakers often but I do like to play them when I have guests over or when I am cooking. This is perfect for someone who is not too picky about the quality of the speaker. The quality is not terrible but there are definitely better ones out there that are more expensive. The battery life is long but one thing I would say is that the sound is not great for the outdoors.
5,So far I'm satisfied. Haven't used it long enough to comment on the battery life.
5,I’ve only had it a few weeks but so far so good. I have zero complaints . Works perfect for when you want to listen to music outside on the patio or trying to exercise at home. Loud enough for small parties.
3,Bluetooth connectivity not good
5,Very good quality fine sound easy to connect. Haven’t used enough to say anything about battery life.
4,Used it with my Amazon Echo Dot. It works fine with the Dot and definitely will play music much louder. But the bass unless the unit is played loudly is very minimal and disappointing. But other than that worked flawlessly sounded good and seemed to be of quite decent quality for the price. And yes the blue led's will light up your room very bright. Also mine didn't auto-shutoff at all which was great.
5,I bought two of these speakers and they are great! Connect easy decent sound and quality. I have one in my garage for when I workout and I love it! Definitely a worthwhile purchase for the price.
4,Great speaker for the price..Was a little skeptical buying it because of some of the bad reviews posted even though there are mostly good reviews. I was able to control the speaker from across the house with perfect clarity on the sound and the volume goes louder than I expected. I would definitely recommend this product for someone that wants a wireless speaker on the cheap that works very well.
5,I work nights alone. So I wanted something that was compact but packed a loud punch. This definitely does the job. It's easy to use. Looks good and sounds even better. My only con about this is after only an hour of play it needed to be charged. BUT That was using it straight out of the package. So the battery life may be better than that.
5,Se ve de excelente calidad y su claridad en los speaks es muy nítida gracias 🙏
3,Great little speaker. Had it for almost a year if not longer.  Only had one issue and for some reason it would he with my phone not my fiance. Sometimes while using the Google play app to listen to music the speaker would only play about 45 seconds of a song before skipping to the next. Idk how or why was it doing that but every time I've listen to music either in my car or with headphones it has never done that except when I use it with this speaker.  To also be fair I dropped it once and little corner chipped but still works fine just that sometimes it does that skipping thing with my phone.
5,I am so glad I purchased this cute little speaker. The Bose version of this is like 120 dollars so I am so glad I found this dupe!! Super cute colors easy to connect and navigate and gets pretty loud! Totally worth the 30 bucks!!
4,Loud clear and made well.
5,Great sturdy little speaker. Use daily. Holds a great charge. Fantastic sound. 100% happy!
5,This thing is way better than I ever expected for the price. Can get very loud if wanted connects pretty easily but can't be too far away from the source I'd say 20-30 feet. After that it may start breaking up. But sound quality and battery life are great and it's a very sleak looking little device
5,Great sound quality with good range.
5,Holds a charge for a very long time. Sounds really good too.
5,I bought this as a gift for my mom and she has bad it for a couple of months now and so far the speaker has worked great! My mom has no complaints on the product. The sound quality is great too. 10/10 for sure!2022 update: The speaker is still holding up and my mom uses it daily. I’m actually considering ordering one for myself since it’s small yet is good quality and holds up!
5,Works well. Amazing for the price in fact. Zero complaints. Set up was a breeze. It doesn't take terribly long to recharge. Appreciate the self turn off feature. The battery life is decent.
4,Meets expectation.  Basic sound
5,Better sound than anticipated.  Easy volume control.  Good volume range.  Good battery life.  Connectivity was easy set up.  I am using the neck out this speaker bank.
5,I never write reviews. Bought this on price point and portability. Did not expect the quality considering that it was inexpensive. I have had bose and jbl...they're too bulky and are not as compact...love this...
5,Sound quality is great for a small speaker.
5,I use this product while the kids are washing dishes. We connect the bluetooth on the phone and play one of the streaming music services I'm paying for. It's loud enough that I sometimes have to tell them to turn it down! Great product great battery life (left it unplugged for a couple of days and it still worked) and bluetooth connects between small rooms.
4,Sounds great for the size my wife won't leave home without it.Update: Purchased a new speaker (same make and model) to replace the old one that died after 2 years of use.
5,I made an excellent choice buying the Doss Sound Box. I love everything about it sounds great and compact.
5,I always used to read the review before buying any product. I read a great review about this product. This bluetooth speaker is really worth buying sounds quality is great. I am very happy buying this.
5,This speaker has worked like a charm ever since I bought it. The sound quality is clear and loud when I need it. The bluetooth connectivity can take a few extra seconds but it's no dealbreaker for me!
5,First off this is not a super high quality speaker but it's just fine for listening around the house watching movies etc. I had a couple problems with my speaker as far as pairing and the input jack but the customer service was so good that I'm giving it five stars even though it's probably more of a four-star speaker in terms of quality (again not bad just not as good as some others I've used). You definitely won't regret spending the amount they're asking for it.
4,I wish it had a volume up/down instead of using the device that it is connected to.  I also wish it had the option to remain on so it would automatically pair without without having to turn it on.  Other than that great sound plenty loud and sounds great.
4,When I first got the speaker I was shocked on how small it was but when I started playing music I was blown away on how loud it was but I give it a 4 star because it depends on the music like the volume will lower a little then it will go high again on some of the songs not all but besides that it's amazing how a small thing can be a big thing
5,Love it the sound is clear it has so much base in it. I would definitely purchase another one if something happened to the one I have
5,Easy to set up.
5,This has really good volume on it. It's almost as loud as a t.v if not as loud as a t.v
4,Private listening very enjoyable
5,Been using this for three years now with no issues. Sound quality is decent for the price and the battery still lasts a really long time. My only complaint is all the touch-screen controls on the top (too bright at night and hard to use....I much prefer physical buttons).
5,I absolutely love this speaker! I charged it once and used it on vacation for 4 days without having to charge it again. 🙌🙌It's touchscreen and very easy to use and connect. Would purchase again!!
5,Great product! I bought 1 a while ago and decided I wanted another to take outside while working in the garden the sound is clear and loud. Definitely recommend this speaker. Only thing is you need a charging block unless you charge it with the USB port.
5,Great sound! Just slightly below my Bose.
5,
5,I got this for my wife to streams music off her laptop. I was impressed no where near as tinny sounding as I figured it would be it actually has some base I'd say more base then the speakers in our 40" Sumsung LED TV. Has a long play time can't say how long but I'd as the figures in the product description are reasonable. Easy to use and understand controls.It will pair with a phone but she hasn't tried that
4,Purchased this speaker based upon price and positive reviews and also out of frustration with my Bose Soundlink not always getting a good bluetooth connection. I have to say for a small speaker the sound is really quite amazing. Maybe just a touch below the quality of the Bose at a fraction of the price. AND it connects fully to my bluetooth and has a greater range. A tremendous value.
2,Sounds great but won't turn off either by itself or manually. Makes connection noises frequently. Will be looking for something else.
5,If I leave it in my kitchen and walk off into my bedroom (opposite ends of the house) the sound box acts as if It’s loosing Bluetooth connection. Decent sound and quality. Battery life is strong and last a while.
5,Thanks to fast fare and reliable customer service I am now pleased with my unit especially since the sound is twice as loud and more crisp than the old unit.  There must have been some defect because the old unit was never that loud and clear. Doss was attentive and understanding when I put my 1st reveiw about a faulty speaker. Its goes a long way when looking for returning customers.I plan on purchasing another 1 now as a gift .
5,This a great little speaker. Obviously you’re not going to get a lot of bass but for its size it’s really clean sounding with plenty of volume. I can’t comment on battery life as I’ve only had it a few days. Setup is easy. Nice product.
5,Awesome product..Update after 2 years... Have used this well.. initially thought the touch buttons would wear out.... not yet... still going strong... sound quality and battery is still good... i charge daily... some may be concerned of the charging port... its still good... overall excellent product...
3,Bought this to replace an old Jawbone Mini Jambox which would not hold charge.This unit is bulkier when compared to mini jambox and it is about 2 times larger than a mini .Coming from Jawbone mini Jambox this unit’s sound quality isn’t as good.The price is definitely more affordable than a Jawbone mini .The power switch’s location could use a redesign.  It is located in the back of the system and it couldnt be reached easily to turn on or off.  This unit has A nice top plate and why not integrate the power button there and instead of hiding it in a awkward location.
5,This is my second unit. I play Pandora radio wherever I work around the house from my phone. I’m retired. Got the second one for my wife. Great little unit with big sound.
5,Wow! It's a little thing but sound great. I didn't even have to read any directions but they were included. It's seamless easy to use. My 8 year old used it to play Pandora from my phone. It sounds lovely. I was afraid it would sound tinny but it doesn't! SOOO glad I got this! I'm getting 2 more for our bedrooms. If anything goes wrong I'll update here but so far one of my favorite purchases and I make a lot of them!
5,Small and light but with great sound. Very nice design with well lit controls. For the price it's a very good speaker I bought it for >$30 (a low price based on what I saw at stores). It comes with a charging USB cable but for quickest charging time buy a 1 amp charger (iPod style) instead of using the USB port on a computer. Although I use it next to my iPod for sound the Bluetooth distance for me was about 35 feet through a couple of walls when I tested by walking away not bad at all.
5,This has been a hit in the household since this was opened last Christmas.... sounds great for such a tiny box. Lots of bass (but not as much as a Bose but it doesn't cost like a Bose too).  It's getting a lot of use in the house.My only "wish list" will be I wish there's an easy way to figure out how much battery life was remaining.  And would be nice if there was a hidden compartment in the box to keep the USB cable (needed for charging this box.)
4,This is great bang for the buck. I tried many different speakers and in this price range this was by far the best. Can be a little low on the bass compared to higher priced items and if it's next to a wifi router the signal can interrupt but it's leaps and bounds above its competitors in this price rage.
4,This little guy works great!! I got it to use outside and in the bathroom. The bass sounds decent and the volume get pretty loud obviously its not going to be blasting cause its a smaller speaker but I am quite happy with it. I am actually considering buying another. I never leave reviews unless I am impressed with a product and I am quite impressed with this.
4,I used it with my iPhone & iPad.  I experienced some difficulty connecting to my iPad but was eventually able to play my music!!
5,This is my second of these. This is for home. The other I use in my classroom at school. We use it daily with music to exercise or dance and I use it to play quiet music while I work after school. It sound great both loud and soft. I recommend it
5,This was the second speaker i bought my grandson kept eyeballing my speaker. So we got him one for his birthday.
5,Great sound good range and decent battery life.  We use it while gardening and keeps our groove going.
1,At first this speaker was perfect for my desk setup. I had attached to my laptop via bluetooth. However after a few weeks I noticed that after maybe 5 minutes of play an annoying buzzing sound would emit from the speaker. It is not the low battery signal as I have not even used it enough to drain the battery..currently the speaker is a 80% battery and it will still cut to the annoying buzzing like clockwork after 5 minutes. As another review mentioned it works fine when plugged into the audio jack..but it defeats the purpose for me as I have my laptop on another part of my desk. I gave this speaker one star because when it works it's great but I'm very disappointed that I've had it a little over a month and it is not working as intended..I wanted to love it but now I'm just stuck with another thing that doesn't work.
5,I got this speaker for my roommate for her birthday and we love it! The sound quality is really good for the price speaker gets nice and loud without distorting the sound. It's very easy to connect to the speaker via bluetooth and it's nice to have the AUX input option as well. Since this was such a huge hit with her I recently bought another one for my boyfriend and he loves it too! Definitely would recommend this speaker!
5,I got this for my kitchen at work. It's so loud I have to keep the volume down so my cooks can hear me. Need to keep my phone close to it though as the bluetooth range is minimal.
5,Great for small spaces. Battery didn't last quite as long as I expected although I did not actually time it.
4,Built great for sound clear & good sound.But if this gets dropped  its all overThe back of the jacks seem a bit shakey.I still recommend it  but fot indoors or on your porch not for camping or portable
5,I am really happy with this speaker! It's easy to setup and use with my phone. It sounds great and the charge lasts a long time. I recommend it!
5,I love this speaker!!! Great clarity and the bass is superb.  Volume for days I can't say enough good things. Easy to use! I am 48 and a bit behind the technology curve. Had no problems at all. Great buy!!
4,It's a good equipment for the price. I had an issue with the first unit I bought but it was quickly replaced by a new one that is working fine so far.
4,A great value speaker.  Build quality is good and it is easy to use. Not a lot of bass but I can't complain for the price.
5,Great speaker for the price
5,I love it !
3,The bass is not as strong and deep as many of the reviews suggest.  Overall sound quality is okay but after reading the reviews I expected to be blown away by the strength of the bass.  I was not.Other than that pairing occurred without any problems and the build quality of the unit seems good.Do I recommend this product?  It depends.  If you are wanting to hear surprisingly rich deep bass then no...look elsewhere.  If decent tonal quality is your primary interest than this item should suffice.
5,So far- fantastic! Love this little speaker more than all the others I have tried. It is on the level with my 7 year old Bose if I dare say! And it was 20x the cost! Easy to use fast connect attractive and the sound quality is amazing for the price! Not sure about the battery life yet let’s see in a few months how it hold us.
5,I have this connected to several devices.  Sounds is very clear and hear my music playing on the second floor while the Bluetooth is downstairs.
4,And has a nice sound and I can put it anywhere in the room and it's enjoyable system
5,Very nice sound quality! Nice base and it’s not like those cheap speaker that crack my music. I can enjoy the beats without my headphones now! Loved it! The price is very affordable for a quality speaker! Recommended!
4,I have received two damaged units first one was clearly someone abusing Amazon return policy and second one was a brand new unit that arrived with blemishes from the factory.  This tiny unit sounds amazing for what it is and its price point.  Would happily give 5 stars but now onto ordering my 3 unit which hopefully arrives properly this go around.
5,I honestly didnt think this product had volume. I was wrong. I love it and takes it everywhere.
5,Satisfied with it so far.
5,I love this speaker and use it almost every day. It was a great purchase. My mom has a $200 Bose speaker that is exactly like this one - I think they are identical and both have great sound quality. Don’t waste money on a more expensive one. This one is great!
4,Decent speaker for the price got pretty good use out of it
5,I love this product. At first I was a little hesitant buying a Bluetooth speaker without physically being able to see it or hear its volume. However after doing some much needed research I decided on this inexpensive speaker. It's probably the best product I've purchased off amazon. The Bluetooth speaker is extra loud sleek finish and the touch panel makes it look really cool. Pairs with devices (i.e. My iPhone 6 and MacBook Pro) quickly. There's no lag when pausing or skipping content. I would definitely recommend this product if you're looking for an inexpensive worthwhile Bluetooth speaker.
4,I bought this for my daughter so I have no real first hand experience with it but she says she is very satisfied with it.
4,Very good sound  l get what I need
5,I was not disappointed! Great sound and volume
5,Buen sonido
5,I left a negative review about this seller after I received my initial order for this speaker because the one I received burned out after a couple of uses.  The seller read the review and contacted me and replaced the speaker immediately.  The new one I received has been working just fine.  It was easy to pair with my phone and computer and puts out a really good sound.  I really appreciated a seller that provides such good service and would now recommend this to anyone!
4,It's great for this price it connect to the Bluetooth real fast real quick battery life lasts forever it's really handy when you really need music
5,Super good clarity!
5,Just like many people here I was looking for a good speaker to pair with my Amazon Echo Dot and found this.  At $30 and with so many glowing reviews I was very skeptical.  But given the price is so cheap I decided to try it out.  I rarely write reviews but man this is one sweet little speaker.  With Spotify Premium (versus the default Amazon music) the sound is so crisp and with the speaker on my coffee table the bass can even be slightly felt on the floor!  Highly recommended.
5,Works great plan on using for huckleberry picking but I use it with laptop to listen to shows.
4,Pros:1. Long lasting battery2. Very good sound quality for price3. Easy user interface4. A charge port that worth a damn (Looking at you jbl make a better charge port)5. PortableCons:1. Bass quality while not bad could be increased
4,In a nutshell:Pros:Nice compact size  Easy to link  Sound quality quite decent  Auto turn off (saves battery life)  Longer life of battery than expectedCons:  Really wish it had a remote! PIA to keep walking to it to adjust volume for different stations
5,The speaker has great sound.
3,I like this speaker overall.  It has great sound quality especially for its size.  Just about every time I use it I have to connect my iPhone manually.  Also the power button rarely turns the speaker off.  I have to stick a paperclip or small screwdriver in the 3.5 jack to hit the reset button in order to power it off.  I was going to send it back but I just didn't want to hassle with that.  If not for the power button and Bluetooth issues I'd rate this speaker 5 stars.
5,I like what I got like the color I am deaf in one ear so to me it sounds great I have it in the kitchen  use it when i wash dishes and when I cook so I am happy with it
2,I did NOT get this free "in exchange for my honest opinion." I paid about $25. And it's NOT worth that much. I'm not a person who slams products for fun. I just want to warn you to protect your hard earned $$. If you're not particular it's not horrible. But it's not good either. Not worth the hype that I fell for. I put it next to a 3 watt I got from 5 Below. You know cheap junk. They sound absolutely completely the same. Identical. Cheap. Same volume same cheap sound quality. The good: no distortion at max volume; nice build quality 5 hours battery life at max volume. The bad? The sound. Tinny high range overwhelming muffled midrange that hides instruments and zero - zip - bass. No soundstage at all. Flat at low volume. Bluetooth range is about 20 feet in the open less if there are walls. It's just . . . another cheap speaker. Check if the reviewer got it for free. Watch youtube "Soundbox  . .. hit or *hit?" for other possibilities. I own a Beats Pill 2 for $240 as well. This is NOT that. It's just another cheap speaker. You can do better.
5,This little beast has been dragged through many drunken bubble baths morning bed in breakfast and some crying on me bathroom floor to Elton John. Hasn't failed me but my father has. At least my mother wasn't around to see it. Anyways thank you.
4,Easy to connect. Controls are a little difficult so understand at first. Nice once you get the hang of it.
5,I am absolutely floored at the sound quality of this speaker; it genuinely rivals other name-brand speakers I’ve had that were MUCH more expensive. The very first song I played had incredible bass and had crystal clear sound. I was also impressed at how loud this little box could become!! It was remarkably easy to setup—it took less than twenty seconds in fact. If you are looking for a speaker that has power for the fraction of the price of other speakers get this one.
5,I love this speaker. It connects easily with Bluetooth and has a good sound. I use it in my bathroom and it’s perfect!
5,Use at a pool or beach and does exactly what we need it to do!  This is a second purchase have one at our cottage too.
5,I was going to buy a JBL for myself but I wanted to try this one out and see if the JBL was necessaryAnd let me tell youThis is way betterI love how the volume button is like a touch wind up buttonAnd it’s ma loudThe best honestlyThank you ! NO JBL NEEDED
1,The speaker was awesome until it started randomly restarting and skipping songs OVER AND OVER AND OVER. It is really aggravating and makes it useless. I tried restarting my phone and updating my music apps but nothing helped. Really sad waste of $30.
5,Nice to look at. Nicely made feels good in hand you can tell its not cheap.. Definitely recommend
5,Love it! I can finally jam it out while I’m cleaning my home! And actually hear it from any room in my apartment.
5,Great little speaker for songs with some bass but crackles if it goes to deep bass or you eq settings are custom bass boosted but overall really good speaker
5,I have purchased over the years two Amazon BTV2 and they last about 1 1/2 to 2 years on each and both have died on me. Decided to go a different direction and purchase the DOSS. So far I like the quality and sound of the speaker and the price was right. But am taking a wait and see attitude on the battery life (2 stars - unknown really at this point) as to longevity.
5,I want another one I blew the first one up fried it by using an over powered outlet so it’s my fault not theirs. I like this box because it delivered great sound quality and it’s a pretty tough system too. Just use caution as to what type of an outlet you plug it into.
5,Lo uso regularmente excelente sonido se conecta fácilmente al bluetooth gran duración de la batería
5,Great product
5,The best soundbox can take everywhere. Love it.
5,I've been using this speaker mostly outdoors with great results so far. I was looking for something very portable with descent sound and affordable price and I got just want I needed. A plus that I discovered is that I can use it when camping at places with no phone reception but still bring my playlist with me by using the SD card. I'm giving this product 5 starts for all it offers at such great price.
3,It's OK. To me the sound seems to go in and out. Could be jus in my mind since I read previous reviews but that's jus how it sounds to me. Sometimes it sounds nice and loud (not extremely but it's just a small speaker so) then it's like ehh ON THE SAME SONG! It has a good amount of bass tho. It does. It started one song then jumped to another without finishing the song it was playing previously. SighYes. The sound does go in and out. I listened from outside and it got louder @ THE END OF THE SONG. 👀 IT HAS ALOT OF BASS MAYBE TOO MUCH FOR THE VOLUME EVEN.
5,The DOSS SoundBox is a small portable speaker that allows connection via Bluetooth or 3.5mm line-in jack (audio connector included). It incorporates a MicroSD slot (32GB max) which is a fantastic feature as it allows the unit to perform as a self-contained music player. The unit also functions as a hands-free speakerphone when paired with your cellular phone.The SoundBox has a classy design with a smooth matte finish top control panel that avoids fingerprints.They deserve the 5 stars
5,Sounds great so far battery life has lasted longer than I expected
5,I have had this for less than a week and so far I’m super stoked with the purchase! I’ve gotten 3 8-hour work days use out of this on a single charge. Sound quality is excellent & I’ve had no issues with the blue tooth connectivity.
5,The best bluetooth speaker for the money. Very good uptime on battery.Base is satisfying and I use it in my car and I don't miss my car speakers. That says something.
1,I obviously wasn't expecting greatness from a $30 bluetooth speaker but it's real bad. Stutters constantly and certain songs just like some of the sounds are totally missing. I've never heard anything like it but every time Brain Stew by Green Day plays through this speaker only half of the opening notes play. It's so weird. Don't buy this.
5,Just what I needed and more. I bought to use in our tent but I've used it so much more than I ever thought I would. So simple to connect and great battery life.
5,I love it the first One it was a gift then I bought another one for my husband. I have three years going on the fourth year I had it. Sounds awesome
5,Great sound for the price!
5,The speaker really surprise me and definitely worth the money. The very first thing that attract me when I order it is that it's coooool. Many speaker use physical buttons and this speaker use all virtual buttons the way it control volume is so much fun.After I get the speaker I found it really met all requirement I have. With so many outlets compatible for different kinds of devices and easy control volume from iPhone. It has 12W power so the sound is loud too. Really a great product!
5,like easy setup
5,For the price this speaker is great! I'm not techy at all so I just wanted something that was easy to bluetooth to my phone and sound decent. This blew me away.  Just charge it for a couple hours before you use it for the first time and within a minute you are good to go! Don't hesitate to buy this well worth the money!
5,Great little speaker for the money particularly when it’s on special sale. The sound and ease of use is terrific. The primary feature I bought it for is the memory card add on. Use it to play continuous background music. Four other friends liked it so much they bought the speaker as well.
5,Bought 4 SoundBot units - lots of buzz on all 4 when using them with Echo Dots.  Gave them away.These DOSS speakers do not have any noticeable buzz while charging and connected to Dots via bluetooth.  Customer support has been great with questions before the sale and after.  You need to change the firmware (they send you the new firmware) to stop the units from going into battery saving mode and shutting down in order to leave them connected to Dots all the time.These are keepers.
4,I thought the sound quality would be better but maybe you gotta spend a lot more money to get that. It just doesn't sound particularly "full" to my ears. The speakers can handle loud volume though which is good. It's also nice and convenient with cool controls. The drawstring bag that came with it stinks to high heaven though. It has a very potent chemical smell to it. Yuk!
5,Love it.  This one has lasted so much longer then the ones I had previously.
5,Absolutely love this speaker! The first time I used it the charge lasted for about 8 hours.
4,Perfect little speaker for my office. I am a school counselor and the students love that they can quickly connect to it with their phones to play me their favorite songs.
4,Works good
5,It was a rocky start. The first unit was defective - it kept skipping to different You Tube channels.  After a couple of rounds with customer service they agreed to send a new unit. The replacement unit has worked flawlessly. The sound is good and battery life has been as advertised.
3,Well... It is what it is I guess. The mids and highs are very good but there is no bass at all. I would say if you use this to watch shows or listen to podcasts it will do well but if you also want to enjoy music ocassionally its lacking bottom end (bass). My other speaker is a jbl flip 3 and it is miles ahead of this thing. I cant complain though I bought it for $20 on sale.
5,Great sound great quality easy to use.
5,Bought it for my office at work. Sounds great.  I would buy it again in a second.
4,It's a good speaker not top shelf but it connects quickly and no static or anything.  Decent sound and volume.
5,the headphone very stylish and easy to use. the sound perfect and volume adjusting very comfortable
5,I use this all the time The sound quality is great and the battery life is incredible. The only con is mic It seems like no one can hear me if I use it for phone calls.
5,My Doss is an outstanding value--really good sound with very good bass at a very reasonable price.  And it is really portable. It will never replace huge expensive speakers in a sound system but I have really nice portable sound from a compact unit.  It connects with Bluetooth as well as my other Bluetooth devices.
1,Possibly a defective unit but mine had nothing but static whether it was paired with my computer my phone or hardwired into my computer.  Other headphones and speakers work fine with these devices so it's not a problem on my side.Other than that the controls were annoying.  I understand touch sensors are trendy but there needs to be more feedback from the interface.  I would press a button and nothing would happen and it's not clear whether it's because the button didn't pick it up or the button does nothing because the thing is in the wrong mode.  (Modes indicated by solid/flashing red/blue lights so you need to read the manual.)It's a speaker.  It should not require a manual.  It should turn on and off and feature a volume control that isn't some vague stirring gesture over an LED.  If you're going to attempt more make sure you at least can deliver that.
5,Outstanding little speaker.
5,Excellent sound. Range is nice.Loved it so much I bought two.
5,This speaker has great sound quality and stays charged for a long time. I use it all day every day and I only have to charge it about twice a week.
1,I see online that there are hundreds of complaints about this product....and they all are about after about 2 months worth of use.  Coincidentally they only offer a 30-day return window....keeps them from having to deal with any of the issues they MUST KNOW about this item.Mine paired just fine. Mine sounded good. HOWEVER I used it only ONE time and then kept it in my air-conditioned home office on my desk and it never got damaged or dropped or anything else.BUT even after charging it completely full (Solid green light) it will NOT TURN ON!!!!!  It has a "Long Push" button on it.....and I did that...to include holding it pushed down for a solid minute.....and it still never powered-on.So I came to my order page for it here on Amazon just to find out that they only have a 30-day return window!!!  How bad is that???  I've only had it for a Month and a half...and only used it once!!!Super upset that now I've simply got a paper weight instead of a nice Bluetooth speaker.HORRIBLE RETURN POLICY!!!Well that's what leaving reviews are for here on Amazon....but there is also Yelp Google and tons more.I very rarely leave negative reviews but this product and seller deserve it since they have a horrible return policy and don't answer emails!
3,the sound is hollow and echos the device has no range.  Several steps from the transmitter and signal is lost.  If you touch it or the surface it is on is jarred it almost acts as if an old fashioned needle record player was kicked.  I cannot speak to battery life as the sound was so bad I turned it off after a few minutes.  Also mine appeared to be dirty not new that may have been what was wrong with it. Still I would not recommend it.UPDATE - while nothing changed with the product the seller resolved my issue (the physical damage) with a quick and courteous replacement.  Now it looks good and at least plays.
5,It works just great. Fills the living room. Even the patio. Easy to use. Neat touch volume dial. Highly reccomended.
4,It covers a decent sound range ie. for a backyard bbq or park.
5,It was perfect!  No complaints!
5,I just unboxed and charged the speakers.The sound is very excellent.  With the volume on my phone maxed and the speakers maxed it is still very clear and loud I have to turn it down.  I'm still on my first charge so I can't comment on battery life yet. I'm very pleased !
5,works perfect and the sound from it is amazing!!
4,Easy to use and conveniently remains charged for several hours at a time.  It is a speaker on all sides so it doesn’t matter which direction it’s facing.  Loud enough for large room or outside.  I was expecting and would have preferred a bit more bass but I’m satisfied with the speaker.
4,Was given as a gift and was opened and used right away. Music quality was good loud with bass. Distance was also good and price was great. For the price you definitely get a nice hardy wireless Bluetooth speaker I would reccomend this as a nice gift or for person use if you don't have the kind of money to spend on high end speakers this speaker does the job.
5,Listen you won't find anything better at this price point it's amazing and beats alot of my friends speakers that cost way more. I've had mine for almost 6 months. I don't use it outdoors since its not suited for that. If you don't like the sound I'll buy it back from you 😂😂😂 I'm kidding.  But it's the best battery life seems to go past what they say. Pairs easily and looks awesome. So surprised at how this small speaker gives such great sound!!!
5,I LOVE this speaker and use it often. I like to bake and will listen to music or a book on the speaker while I'm doing that. The volume is great. I can wash the dishes and still hear what I'm listening to. Also if I get a call when I'm using it that part of it works great. We also use this when we are sitting out by the fire or sitting on the porch. It is great to use to have background music.
5,Just needed a little speaker for my bathroom. This one is perfect. Hard to switch from one devise to another but i only use my phone and computer so not a huge issue for me. Not recommended for parties as it’s not super loud. But great for small room listening.
4,Good speaker for $30. Sounds pretty decent but doesn't have a ton of bass. Who cares though its a lot better than other speakers you can get for the same money. Came with the same voice that tells you when its paired to your phone or what mode but I emailed the Doss support team and they sent me a firmware update to remove it which is really awesome. Overall a good purchase.
4,It's a great speaker for the price bigger than the last one I had. The only thing I can say bad is that it doesn't have as much bass as I would like other than that it's great.
3,The sound is great no question. The battery life is darn good too.However after less than 4 months of once a week usage (2 hours max each time) one speaker is not working at all.No sound comes out. Not sure what the deal is.I have emailed the seller but have not received a response. If I had to do it over I don't think I would purchase again. Not because of sound quality but because of questionable build quality.Update 02/23/19Excellent customer service. Immediate response and fixed my issue. The unit works great. Wouldn't hesitate to purchase. They will take care of you if you have an issue.
4,Not superior sound but for the price I was surprised how good the audio was. Nice compact speaker. Gifted to a teenager. He loved it !
5,Setup was very easy and works similarly to other Bluetooth devices.  The company sent a follow up email after receiving the speaker about the lack of volume control knob and explained the function of the touch ring for volume.  The speaker looks and feels likes it's more expensive brethren. The sounds is also fantastic and you get a lot of volume for such a small speaker.  Great for working outside or in the kitchen!  Not sure how 'waterproof' the bag really is with the drawstring but would probably work for splashes and minimal water contact!
5,Super cute in my nail room! I love it!!
5,Oh Yeah!!This speaker always gives us the sound just like we are having fun at the LIVE CONCERT but actually at our home.Don’t  be afraid of buying this because it’s small.This speaker has small body but has incredibly great soundsFirst I bought this for my daughter who wanted new speaker which has good sounds but not so expensive and not too big in her room as Christmas gift.Now I have one for kitchen too!!Thank you!!
5,The speakers have exceeded my expectations.
3,I've purchased maybe six or seven low cost portable bluetooth speakers from amazon and this has to be the most disappointing as far as volume level.  Also one end of the wrap around grill was poking out.  Don't know if this is an appearance defect only a sign of poor quality control indication of damage due to rough handling or something else.  Regardless the max volume level was still a little too low.
5,I purchased this speaker 4 years ago...so Im updating. I love this speaker and it's been awesome each and every time we've used it. We use it quite a bit by the pool or at the beach.. its gotten sandy and taken some hits.. still works great. As another reviewer mentioned the low battery beeping is annoying for a full hour before it will actually die.
5,I just purchased a second one. I have went thru at least 7 like speakers in the past couple years and have discarded them for various reasons. Once I found this I couldn't be happier. Long lasting battery powerful speaker
5,Easy to use. Easy to connect. The only thing it could be a bit louder.
5,This Speaker Is Awsome It’s Not Banging Loud Loud But It’s Pretty Loud The Sound Quality Is Really Great I Use This When I’m On The River And It Sound Amazing Plus It Went Underwater One Time And Still Works Great It’s Worth The Money .
3,Volume button was not user friendly
5,Love this wireless speaker!  I can take it anywhere.  I recorded a 32 gig microSD card with music and played it while I sewed.  Battery never ran down.  I also connect to my Samsung phone and listen from that and can talk on the phone through the speaker.  I just bought a second one for my husband to use in the garage/barn.
5,For the price it's a great speaker. It stays charged a long time longest lasting speaker I've owned -- and the sound carries quite a distance in the house. Sound quality is super for a small blue-tooth speaker! I've even dropped this twice - tiny dent still working great!
5,This speaker is so good especially for the price. Its loud clear and super cute. I got the light blue one and I love it!
5,I got this Bluetooth speaker for my husband for his birthday which is on Christmas Day surprised him with it he absolutely loves it uses it all the time it's kind of nice that you can answer calls through this Bluetooth and I did purchase the case which he can never keep it in the case cuz he's always using it LOL would highly recommend it and buy it again I just wish for the price it would have came with a memory chip
3,Its a good sound box if its in house or outside but not so good if its in a vehicle it could be  Louder
5,This is a great Bluetooth speaker.
5,My husband loves this speaker for work and I’m glad I read the reviews to tell him to turn it up with his phone!
5,Muy buena calidad de sonido.
5,This is a great portable speaker. The sound is fantastic and the bass is strong. I leave it in my living room and can hear my music thru the whole house. Sometimes my table even vibrates!
5,Surprised by the quality of sound for this price point. The volume is controlled off the phone or device your connected to. At least that’s the only way I’ve seen to do it so far. I like it though. Big sound not much bass but that’s okay. I would recommend this product if you’re wanting a small portable speaker to have playing in the background while doing other things or entertaining guests.
5,Excellent sound my wife loves it & she has another speak in our kitchen that's a Bose I would recommend this product
5,Good sound nice bass connects to bluetooth easily. Like these speakers so much I now have two of these and 2 of the soundbox plus so I can have them in the living room office bedroom and bath... for those long soaks in the tub. Both models have great sound!
4,Nice
5,I bought this speaker for home use.  Really very pleased with the sound quality.  Portable and easy to use.
5,Wow!!!! This speaker is super loud with great bass i love it definitely worth every single penny u cant go wrong with this speaker and would definitely buy another one!!!
4,So far I've been happy with this speaker
5,Good so far
5,I love this speaker! I actually purchased this one because my old roommate had the same one and I really liked hers. The quality is good the sound is great it connects right up to my divices. I love everything about it!
5,I love this speaker.  I have an old car that doesn't have bluetooth or CD player.  I used this speaker in my car play my iPod listen to my audio books and answer my phone when driving.  It is also easy to take to the beach or any other family event.  I purchased another for my granddaughter who loves hers too.  The price is right.  The sound is good and easy to use.
2,I have tried everything I can think of to get this thing to work with no avail. The sound is quite good for the 30 seconds that I can get it to play without shutting off. I have only used this once connected to Bluetooth mainly because I got it to use on my work computer plugged in via 3.5mm audio cable. I have purchased now 3 different cables thinking it was possibly a faulty cable but it still keeps shutting off. I then found a website that had firmware updates to supposedly disable some power saving feature and it worked flawlessly for several hours and is now back to shutting off on full battery every 30 seconds - 1 minute. Don't waste your money on this product!
4,Sound quality a bit distorted toward lower register when using with laptop. Have yet to try it with bluetooth. Value for the money.
5,This little thing definitely has quality sound I was pleasantly surprised
3,I used it for college and I ended up selling it to someone bc It has had airy sound. I like a clean crisp high bass and mids. It missed the mark. Save for a jbl or something else.
4,I like this speaker but the only problem i have with it is that it will skip my songs! Like if i play music from pandora or iTunes it will just skip and literally keep skipping wtf. Playing music from youtube its fine tho but still annoying it does that
5,Excellent speaker for iPad or phone easy to connect.  Sound quality is top notch.  Volume is perfect -  can be either loud or soft depending on your choice.  Can answer and talk on the phone through the speaker and works perfect.
5,This box is great. Very easy to setup with bluetooth (and I'm 67!) Thought the sound wasn't loud enough but you need to make sure volume is turned all the way up on the box and your phone.
5,This little speaker is great. Perfect size.
4,Bought this one to take to work for some work tunes and it’s awesome sounds great very loud and sounds good for the size bass is a little wonky but fixed it with my iPhone equalizer
5,Excellent buy for the money!
5,Bought this like 3 years ago and still works wonderfully. Great sound quality and fantastic battery life.
4,Great sound for its size; much better sound for heavy metal music.  If you like to play 80s music with deep bass you might like the JBL Flip 3 a little better.  The only one in it's category that can play music without having to be connected to another source; it has a memory card.  Excellent product.
5,OMG!!!! This thing sounds amazing! Way better than I expected!!! Wow! Not super loud but super clear with no distortion. Bass and highs sound amazing. Speaker looks extremely elegant. It looks like something you’d pay 100s of dollars for. I’m gonna definitely by another one for the garage. I would highly recommend this product. If your looking for a good quality sounding Bluetooth speaker you’d be hard pressed to find anything else as far as quality and pricing goes.
5,Good sound quality.  I sit at my desk during 12 hour shifts with jazz music playing.Without it the music just ain't so great..
5,Teen kept stealing mine so he got his own. Great battery life. Sturdy construction. Good Sound. We are enjoying this on the go speaker!
5,I love that it is so clear sounding.And you can hear it throughout the house if turned up.Best Buy ever
5,I like the sound this speaker gives out. Stays charged for a long time. Would definately say this is as good a speaker as the super expensive ones out there.
4,Battery last a good while does charge fairly slow and is hard to clean due to the small holes. All in all  worth the money. I've dropped mine several times and it still keeps working no problem. Volume could be a bit louder at full but adequate nonetheless.
5,I bought one of these 3 years ago it still works great charges and holds the charge and sounds great. I just bought a second one for my wife. Could not expect more from a $30 bluetooth speaker.
5,I heard a popping noise and now the speaker makes a funny hissing sound whenever playing bass. Like something is vibrating in there that wasn’t before. I wasn’t even playing anything full blast probably 1/4 of my iphones total volume :/ pretty disappointedEDIT: The company ended up sending me a new system as a replacement which has been working perfectly! No more vibrating coming from the bass and the sounds are crisper than ever. Thanks so much! Amazing service and amazing product!!!
4,For a bluetooth speaker at under 30.00 it has a great sound.  It does not get real loud but at its max volume there is no distortion and is able to carry a lower base.  Only had it a day or so but so far so good.
5,Pretty loud for a small speaker  last long time
5,This was an impulse purchase for my boyfriend he loves it and I love how inexpensive it was compared to other speakers! It connects to many devices with ease.
4,Really good for the price. Battery life about 12 hrs and 3 hrs to charge. Gets super loud but bass is not as booming as it could be (on par for the size of the speaker I guess). Crisp sound on the treble end. Sure beats listening to music on my phone speaker all around my house.
5,This speaker is absolutely amazing. The bass within it is unnerving in such a spectacular way. It enriches my musical experiences tenfold. I hope to have many years with this product especially being able to purchase it at such a reasonable price. 20 out of 20 will definitely purchase and recommend to a friend again.
5,A great speaker!! Batter life and sound quality is awesome!!
4,This is a re-rate.  I hope this company progresses and varies its product.  My initial rating stemmed from not having it long enough before rating.  If you're looking for BASS look elsewhere.  But the rest of the sound quality is incomparable.  Consider price point and YOU will not be disappointed.
5,I absolutely love this speaker.  The battery life is great I used it maybe every other day and had to charge it maybe on the 10th day.  The sound is of good quality not too loud or soft.
4,Sound
5,This is a great affordable speaker. The battery lasts quite a long time the sound range is good and I haven’t had any problems with it after using it for a month 8 hours a day 5 days a week. With this usage I have to charge it maybe once a week.
4,Got this in today and immediately connected it to my phone to stream music. The sound quality is pretty good for a $27 bluetooth speaker. Sound is loud and clear. The bass could be better but I am very pleased for the price I paid.
3,I really loved the size and touch keypad on the top but the bass wasn’t good enough and the sound was rather tinny so we returned it and bought a Sony Bluetooth speaker at Walmart instead.
5,A great little portable Bluetooth speaker. I really enjoy this speaker it suits my needs perfectly. I would reccomend it and I would buy it again.
3,The sound is good but the bluetooth range is very limited. The sound is very distorted if the speaker and bluetooth device is not very close to one another. My phone has to be beside the speaker in order to get consistent sound without distortion. Not good. And don't even try to step in the next room.
4,Not a bad little speaker!  Very surprised that it gets as loud as it does and the bass as deep as it does.  But don't look at this for audio snobs - there is a bit of a muffled tone to it sometimes - but if you want an awesome outdoor speaker for the pool patio or just around the house it does the job!
4,I don't use it as much as I thought I would.  I'd get it ready for the classroom and then could get it to work.  Mostly just sits on my counter.
5,I am not a big volume person - I mostly use this for background music. It has lasted just short of 12 hours for me. The entire time the sound was excellent especially considering the size of the unit. It significantly improves the enjoyment of a movie I am watching on my iPad or iPod. I put the speaker behind the iPad or iPod and it is like watching the movie on a good quality TV. One thing I wish it had was an indication of how much battery life was left.
2,It's  a $30 speaker but seriously? It sounds like a little old AM  radio no bass at all. Don't know how did  this device to score more than 2stars reviews. Or maybe I'm getting old and deaf...
4,Ive had this speaker for a few months now. We love it and it works great. Only now it wont charge. We are still using the same charger it came with and nothing is visibly wrong with the port. I would like to know if there is some sort of warranty or exchange for this item.UPDATE: Company responded very quickly and solved my problem. Thank you very much
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Connects via bluetooth instantly apon Turing the speaker on! Batty life is incredible! And the sound has a nice bass to it!
5,Perfect for on the go sounds! Use this for music & speaker phone & it gets the job done!
5,Great sound. Gets really loud. Feels substantial and not cheap. I love it so much I’m gifting it to my friends for Christmas.
2,This product is decent quality for the price...if you're only using it to connect via Bluetooth.I am a school teacher who travels from classroom to classroom. My school has smartboards but the sound quality of the smartboards are not good. As a science teacher sometimes I will play short clips for students so I carry around a portable speaker.I had an "Amazon Basics" speaker but the charging port broke. So I bought the Doss Soundbox speaker to replace it being the Amazon speaker was discontinued. It connected to my phone very nicely via Bluetooth but when I connect it via AUX to the smartboard it "doesn't find it." I tried connecting it to other devices via the AUX cord and it worked perfectly fine but the speaker just not work on the SmartBoards at my school. This defeats the purpose of me buying these speakers so unfortunately I have to return them.
5,I cannot believe how long the battery life is! Best speaker I have used to date!
3,Its not a bad speaker for the price but the volume adjusts on its own. Hard to explain but itll go quiet ull turn it up on ur phone and the next thing u know it is blasting! A little annoying
5,I’m really glad I found this. The price was reasonable and the sound is great!  It was super easy to set up and to use.
5,Admittedly I was upset at first because my volume wouldn’t work (I had read reviews so just knew it was going to happen to me also) My spouse showed me how to correctly turn up the volume on the unit and O MY WORD!!! It’s fabulous! I hook up my music to my phone and then put it in my Jeep because my radio stinks. It’s great!
4,I love the sound from this little device but it does not work well with the phone function. The speaker does not allow the use of telephone calls. It is described as a way to use your cell phone's blue tooth capabilities...well we can hear but the person on the other end can not hear us speaking so we end up not using the speaker.
5,Nice product inexpensive sound quality is great and easy to connect.I use it in my office and it is perfect.
4,Works perfectly. Connects seamlessly great rice point
5,I have two of these. I purchased one a while back in black when it was on sale. My husband loves high cost things in the store for some reason lol. Well... I purchased this one when it was also on sale in a nice lady color! Seems my black one does not return from my husband! Definitely love the speaker.
5,For the price and the size this is really good. Never have an issue connecting my phone to it via bluetooth the sound quality is good (with a fairly good bass level also impressive for the size) the volume maximum is good without very much distortion or sound warping and the battery life is excellent. Use it both outside and inside and results are good in both instances.
5,Small but great sound. Happy with this purchase.
4,The bluetooth doesn't reach that far which is why I'm giving it a 4 instead of a 5. Also tip for those who gets a speaker that skips songs contact the provider on Amazon and they'll just send you a new one and that one works perfectly fine and good!
5,This is a great little speaker.  Love having it for listening to pod casts and music.  Great speaker for the price.  I can also take the speaker into another room in the house and have my phone in a different room and still keep connected.
3,Would not get one. Otherwise very easy to set up.
5,We used this speaker for a gathering in a large hall and it did the perfect job. Wonderful sound battery stays for a good long time easy to connect & good size to carry with you wherever you go! I hope they also gave the case with this Speaker but we bought it separately.
5,I was shocked this little speaker worked so well bought it for my nightstand to listen to music in bed. It works very well and has a good sound! Would recommend this speaker you get your money’s worth from it!
3,Disappointed with the sound quality notably the base!
4,LOUD AND AWESOME! Bass was slightly more superior than my Altec and Oontz. Bought this to use for parties/cleaning the whole house since it's nice and loud. I just wish that they'd remove the sound indicator stuff when turning it on and off or pairing. I found their firmware on their website to "remove" it but I'm not sure how to do it...
1,Not much to like. It’s even overpriced for what it is. The sound is flimsy at best. Total waste of money. It’s cheap and it sounds cheap. Buy something else. Anything else. Not this.
5,This speaker offers a solid variety of options for connecting and playing music. Was iffy on getting a speaker at this price compared to spending money on a big name brand speaker but am planning to buy more now. This speaker can get LOUD without bass being effected in any way and the sound quality is fantastic. Save yourself the hassle and some money by getting this. Also battery life is incredible.
5,Love this speaker. I use it in my classroom for presentations and videos. All students can hear the audio throughout the room with no issues. Connects to both my iPhone and my Mac computer with ease. My friend was also able to connect with their Android phone with ease as well.
5,For the size it does have a great sound! My mom loved it! The only thing I wished it had was FM radio. I still give it a 5 star rating because it is that good. The sound is crisp and clear it doesn't get distorted if you increase the volume! It charges pretty fast and the battery can last up to for about 3 days if played about 4-6 hrs per day.
5,I’ve had this identical one for years. It works well gets pretty loud and is clear as long as your device is close by. I like it a lot.
5,I walked to my sisters apartment next door and it was still connected to my phone! The bass is unexpectedly awesome. Very easy to use and connects to most devices. If it doesn’t connect through Bluetooth you can just use the line-in cord that comes with it. Very convenient! I also use it as a speaker for watching movies on my laptop.
5,Bought it for a significantly lower price than it's listed price on Balck Friday and it's definitely worth well more than I spent.  I spent around the same amount two years ago for a speaker priced around what this DOSS one is and you can't even compare them.  It's sound quality is great and quite loud if you want it to be.  Satisfied with my purchase enough to return a speaker I'm certainly going to get for a secret santa present.
5,My background includes years of professional music studio work hence my experience with audio equipment is rather broad.So:This is an excellent speaker with good tone and plenty of headroom (volume) - a real bargain at the rather low cost!Pairing with a MacBook Pro was seamless.The only change I would make is adding the ability to toggle the lighting off on the top mounted touch control function buttons.This speaker is so good I found myself forgetting that the audio was not live.
3,I have never tested the battery life on this unit because I cant listen to it long enough to punish myself that way. There is no bass and no separation. I cant argue that the sound is any better than the sound from my laptop. I gave it to my eight year old for the toy that it is!  He likes it. I don't believe the reviews are genuine.
5,The thing has good sound two little bit larger than I was expecting. Very pleased with it the only thing I don't like is that it has a hard time connecting Bluetooth from different sources it's you have to cancel or unpair from One Source before you can pair up to a different source.
5,Got it for my Boyfriend for Christmas and it sounds amazing. By far the nicest speaker we have in the house
5,Though I'd like to adjust treble and bass just a bit the sound is really good and a world above my last low-cost speaker. Worth twice the price.
5,Excelente sonido
5,I use this everyday at work.  Great battery life great sound and looks great as well.  I hook up with Bluetooth and to my iPhone and it goes all day at work.  Provides great sound at all levels with good base as well.  For the price the product cannot be beat.  Everyone is always asking me where I got it from will purchase again.  I purchased it on sale as a lightning deal so super stoked about it.
5,This little Bluetooth speaker box works really good and it sounds really good and was good volume two you can't go wrong especially if it's on sale
5,Bluetooth Connection is great life of batterie great sound loud!.Great deal well worth it... I dont do reviews
5,I've charged this thing once in the last 4 months and it still reads with 70% I use it for working out and stroller rides.  Highly recommend.
5,It's easy to use. Sounds better than my phone speaker...big improvement.
5,I originally bought this for a project at work but loved it so much I kept it for myself! I've not had any issue with the bluetooth staying connected and the battery life is excellent. Sound and volume are beyond what I expected. Love it!
5,I have really enjoyed this little speaker. It is easy to use and has great battery life as I have used it since it arrived and have not needed to charge it yet. I would definitely buy it again!
5,We got a pool so wanted some music to jam out too while we swim and this does a lot more than that. I can probably use this for a party.
4,I bought this speaker after listening to music off of one that my boyfriend had bought. I enjoyed the sound so much that I purchased it the same day. ... after a few times of listening to it . I noticed that the bass would cause the sensors to pause skip or whatever the songs.
4,2017: The charger that it came with did not work so i had to get a different one. but the speaker itself works GREAT.  UPDATE 2020: 3 Years later and the speaker still works. I have just noticed that lately it changes my songs by itself.... weird. So I am about to buy a new one.
5,This is an amazing little speaker - well built small in size great sound quality and has good battery life. What else you want in a budget friendly gadget that costs less than $30 dollars?Actually I paid approximately $27.50. I have other speaker like Bose sound link II but I am impressed by the clean sound (both high and low) this speaker produces. You cannot go wrong with the purchase of this speaker.
4,Good deal It won’t handle a lot of volume but it’s great for sitting at the computer or taking with me.
5,I’m not a techie but this thing installed with my iPhone very easily. Sound quality is excellent and have yet to charge it after 12 hours of use. Good product!
5,Small speaker with big sound! Could not be happier with this purchase especially for the money. I originally purchased this for the bathroom for when I take a shower and get ready and now find myself taking it all over the house with me. The sound is excellent and is very loud for being so small.  I absolutely recommend this speaker. It arrived quickly was extremely easy to set up blue tooth and the seller is very friendly and helpful. Thank you!
5,Very easy to set up and kicks out a ton of sound for such a tiny little thing.  I can walk all over my apartment and this thing never loses connection or sound quality.  It's also pretty cool that it doubles as a speakerphone so I don't even need to take my phone out of my pocket if I'm chopping up veggies or something.  Just bump the button on the speaker with my elbow and I can talk away.  It's hard to believe something this good has such a low price tag!
5,Bought it to use with my phone at work. I love to listen to music but the speakers built into my phone or laptop were not cutting it.  For the money this was a great investment. Gives good sound with good range. EASY to set up and I have been very happy with it.Not sure about Battery life as I just keep it plugged into the USB port all the time.
5,Great little compact speaker.  Excellent sounds.
4,I love the product. The sound quality is great. I don't like that. It cuts off my music sometimes. I  called the manufacture and the offer to exchange it.  That was a good gesture.
5,Naaaaaa... don’t be Surprised when your call  gets answered by itself . I was in the pool and somebody was calling me and it answered before I heard the person calling !
5,Received this little gem yesterday and was worried because the UPS delivery guy literally tossed the package over the gate onto my deck but I unpacked charged as directed in instructions and so far no problems. For a 23$ speaker the sound is awesome and bluetooth connectivity is simple but haven't had long enough to rate the other functions but like it so far.
5,Sound is great battery life is insane. Let it run out of the box had at least 8 hours of plautime before i had to bvb think about charging it. Highly reccomend good price point.
5,This is the best speaker I have bought especially for the price. Sound quality is great and the battery lasts a very long time. It’s a bit delayed and the connection takes a second but it didn’t bother me.
5,Great love the sound quality. It wasn’t hard to contact . The battery lasted a long time.
5,Was a gift for my grandma this year for Christmas and she loved it! Easy to use and great sound. Definitely worth it.
5,Nice clear sound use it at woek
5,I'm enjoying the MicroSD card input it's very useful. The sound is great although it's not bass-heavy.  BT connection excellent as well as phone calls.  The volume control on the top is controlled by touch. Input is marked by different colors. Battery life is good.
5,Actually this little box delivers a really clean sound. Base mid and highs are quite good.Cool features such as volume control and switching functions are great as well.Have listened to it for a total of 8.5 hrs so far on it’s original charge. Connecting to WiFi is quick.Well worth the price!
1,Pros:Good soundEasy to connectCons:Died after 5 months. Will not charge and turn on.I do not recommend this product.
5,Great product. Great value.  My only request would be that they add a random feature function when playing music from the SD card.
5,It wouldn’t connect to my smart TV so I could hear it in the kitchen but that could be my TVs fault. Really nice sound!!!
4,Strong sound for a small speaker.
5,We have seen other Bluetooth players at other people's homes and finally went to Amazon to purchase one. After reading all the reviews we got this one. We could not be more pleased. It is lightweight and so easy to use in any room. We keep it on the charger at night.  Because it goes for 30 hours on a charge we can use it in any room. The sound is amazing. We also like that we can use with our phones or our old IPods.
5,I am so happy with this purchase. Great sound quality and battery life. Very happy I bought it!
5,It is well made and produces very good sound quality for the price. It is easy to use. Can not comment on battery life as it is new.
5,Excelente producto me ha encantado todo funciona de maravilla! Era un regalo para mi esposo y él está súper feliz. Gracias al amable perosona de Amazon me han brindado un servicio excelente su responsabilidad ante todo es muy buena. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
5,I will give the Bluetooth speaker five stars for what it's worth in a class of many others in the same price tag. I was impressed with the positive reviews from other buyers before i settled on this Bluetooth speaker. The sound and bass is great and user friendly features. I will definitely recommend anyone looking for a Bluetooth speaker and want to save some money and buy the best for a good price to go for this one. You'll not be disappointed !
4,It is a small but very powerful speaker. I use it with my Amazon Echo and it works really well. Playing music or listening general news updates are crisp and clear. On the higher range of volume also it keeps the sound clear and does not introduce much noise.
5,I read a bunch of reviews on these small Bluetooth speakers and took a chance and picked this one from Doss.  Very happy with it. Easy to pair and sounds great!  I bought it to listen to music on my small patio of a condo and its perfect.  I don’t have any negative comments on it at all...very happy with my purchase! And it was very affordable....
1,It lasted me nearly 6 months now it no longer charges. For the month prior to it not charging it would disconnect Bluetooth over and over and when it was connected it kept lowering the volume til it was completely silent. Just spend the money on a better speaker
5,Bought this for my teacher friend for her classroom. She loves it and the sound is powerful.
5,I purchased this speaker last December 2016. I was pleased with the sound quality. Although three days ago the speaker started acting up. It started to turn itself on and off skips music and at times doesn't even turn on even after fully charging it. I sent an email to Doss about the issue and they replied in less than 24 hours and sent a replacement for the speaker! I am so pleased with their fast action. I just hope this will last longer than the last one I purchased.
4,I use it at the lake listening to baseball games music. Perfect for what I need it for.
5,This is the best speaker I've ever purchased for the price that it is. I love the volume button and it's elegant look doesn't look childish or mediocre at all like other speakers in this peice range. I bought it in white and I plan on buying more for more rooms or my entertainment center!
4,The speaker sounds great for the size and price.  The first one I bought did not work properly (bluetooth worked well by the auxiliary input did not work).  I contacted the manufacturer and they simply sent me a new speaker.  The second speaker worked perfectly.  I don't have experience with other speakers at this price point but in my opinion this one is great.
5,Volume is surprisingly loud when maxed out in either bluetooth or hardwired playback. Sound quality is very clear and crisp. Haven't noticed any distortion at higher volumes. Very easy to set up and start using right away after charging. Battery life is solid I've gotten at least 5 hours out of my first charge so far and hopefully it's able to last about 12 like it claims. The touch controls for playback are nice and responsive. Attractive design and solid build quality. A+ speaker
4,Returned
5,Oh my gosh am I happy with my purchase!! I got this speaker recommended it to me as a high quality low price buy and he was definitely right. I needed a new speaker for my dorm room this year ever since my beats pill broke and I'm so happy with how this one worked out! It's the perfect loudness for the room and makes jamming out before going out a lot of fun. It's the perfect size for a loud portable speaker. Love it :)
5,A great speaker. Most bluetooth speakers have a significant lag time between my Samsung 4k smart tv and a speaker. This one has the least lag time of any speaker i have including a Bose Soundlink II that cost significantly more or at least $180.00. A great buy.With my tv remote i can control the volume on this (and any bluetooth speaker). I know this does not pertain to just this speaker. but its an important feature at least to me.
2,I bought this as a replacement for my old oontz angle 1st generation speaker. It's a little louder but not loud enough for work standing about 20 feet away and  where there are industrial vacuums for stainless steel welding/cutting and filtration systems for painting and basic warehouse noise.The speaker has good bass but distorts a little too much at the highest settings. So much that the speaker will randomly skip songs or pause them when the volume on the speaker is at maximum level even if the volume on your phone is not at its maximum level as well. It might have to do with the vibration of the speaker but it could be a soft ware issue too. It gets really annoying after a while. It doesn't do that at lower levels. Also the speaker is really heavy compared to my old oontz angle and it kind of feels like they made it heavy on purpose to make it "feel" more durable.If it wasn't for that this would probably be the loudest and best bt speaker with bass AND skip/pause buttons (which is why I bought it) that you could buy at the same price range.
4,The speaker is great for any event. Whether I’m just chilling by myself or partying with others. Easy to connect to and to work. The only downside is that you are unable to control the volume on the speaker itself.
5,Great sound and long lasting charge.
3,The sound quality isn't that great there is a buzzing sound whenever the speaker is on. It's really annoying. The battery life is good and the bluetooth wireless well.
5,I bought this for my wife's Echo Dot to allow for better playback. I was very surprised at the care and quality built-in to the speaker. The echo dot will pair without delay and the sound is on par with much more expensive bluetooth speakers. I also appreciate the volume dial being touch activated. There have been absolutely no instances of lost connection and the playtime has been surprisingly long. I highly recommend speaker for your any Bluetooth need.
5,Best Bluetooth speaker Love 💘❤ it
5,This thing is unbreakable. 4 years later this thing is still working like new!
5,Literally the best $20 I have ever spent! I bought this product as a “deal of the day” offer. My expectations were blown away! Buy this speaker now!
4,Good sound that carries throughout the room. I didn’t get an instruction book and I am not tech savvy so I could not get it paired. But the DOSS company saved the day by calling me several times to get a time when I was not busy and they stayed with me until I had it working beautifully.
4,Incredibly good sound from such as small package. It recently started sounding a busy signal tone every couple minutes. That lets you know of low battery (per Doss email contact within one day). My charge cable had failed. Think it's time for another Doss Soundbox Touch!!!
5,Bought to use at work and it works great! Very loud for being so small. Battery last quit awhile but I do not care for the beeping it makes when it's low. Would definitely recommend. Great price too.
4,For the price it's a very clear sounding device. It could be a little louder but I'm ok with it. I do love how your able to listen while its charging! That's a plus!
5,Great speaker!!! Excellent sound quality with great Bluetooth range
5,This is the perfect Bluetooth speaker! Sound quality is amazing connectivity is never an issue and it looks sleek and attractive for your home. A bonus is that the price is much lower than similar quality products you’d find at the electronics store. My brother has a Boise Bluetooth speaker he uses for his iPhone and I swear I cannot detect any difference in sound quality compared to my DOSS. It’s rechargeable through USB too. I’m in love!
5,Good speaker to bring with you
2,Forget about using this on your night stand. The back lighting on the buttons is as bright as the sun.  For reals I think they invented a new kind of LED that’s brighter than nuclear fusion. Hydrogen can be converted to helium in the light of these LEDs.  Also why is it that almost all Bluetooth speakers in the history of the universe have to make an annoying incredibly loud sound every time a Bluetooth device pairs or connects to it? Seriously this company put zero effort into the experience of the user. Some users may not like ultra bright lighting on the top of their speaker. Some users might want the option to turn annoying electronic sounds off. Oh well I guess I’ll keep looking.Also the last two Bluetooth speakers I had were much better in the sound quality than this one is. It’s just they had really crappy build quality and the USB ports broke on both of them ( different brands). But at least they took user experience into account and didn’t have ultra bright LEDs or annoying sounds every time a device paired.
5,SERIOUSLY THE BEST! What power this little thing has! Great base without that muffled sound. Love the look.. simple chic and blends in nicely with my other stuff.Recommend!
5,There is nothing to dislike. The DOSS unit is obvious quality after you hear it. I use mine to listen to "Oldies but Goodies" with my Vankyo Maxipad S20 tablet.
3,While I've never owned a bluetooth speaker before it sounds good and I had no issues pairing with my phone or tablet.One thing that gives me trouble though is whenever I use it to listen to Spotify Youtube etc it will randomly start to skip songs or videos. The skip button will literally blink continuously while the rest of the buttons become unresponsive. I've tried wired and bluetooth connections with the same issue. The surface is clean and I took the cover off that it came with so I'm not sure what could be causing it.
5,Love this little speaker.  Pretty decent sound quality for such a small speaker.  I use this daily while working.
5,good quality sound
3,Not nearly as loud as I hoped for.
4,It's ok
5,Easy to set up and use. Got this as a gift for my college age son and he loves it. Sleek design and good sound quality. 12 hour battery life and easy to charge. Reasonably priced compared to a lot of Bluetooth speakers. Great product. Would but again
5,It is great when I am cooking cleaning in the shower washing my hair. Or just to block out outside noises. It’s also soothing for soft music When I meditate.
3,I would give it 5 stars but now after 4 months it has started to have problems.  I turn it off but the mode/play/ff/rw buttons stay lit and runs the battery down.  Also for no reason it turns on by itself and trying to connect to my tablet.  Up until this started it was my favorite Bluetooth speaker I have ever tried  I love the sound it has.Hoping someone has a way to fix this problem
5,This lil speaker met all my expectations.  I use this speaker to introduce new songs to my choir and while teaching in my classroom.  In concert with my iPad the Doss Touch Bluetooth makes life easy for me.  I'm able to teach and circulate around my classroom.  The speaker is loud enough for all to hear.  I no longer have to lug my large speaker into my classroom or to church.Lastly I'm able to play music and clean my entire house.  Thus speaker is awesome.
5,Love this speaker.  I tried some expensive ones. But this surpasses all of them.  Great value. Planning on buying more.
4,Paired instantly with my S8Sound quality is more than adequate but not outstandingNo obnoxious boot up and shutdown sounds like my JBL speakerA lot of bang for the buck
4,Oh boy!! What a gem this one is. Completely satisfied with the sound quality. Bass is spot on and I love it when it gives a bass effect and a little vibration to my wooden end table. Taking one star out because I believe it should not get automatically turned off when its connected to power...may be something that they can improve in their firmware logic.
4,Easy to setup and control but it would be nice to have a way to turn off or dim the lights.  The lights are VERY bright and can light up a whole room at night.  I use this speaker with an Echo Dot in the bedroom and I need to place a book on top in order to get to sleep.
4,Never figured out  how to sink w/ alexa
5,I haven't had this speaker for very long but I'm very pleased so far. It had a very good price it was easy to pair the bluetooth and to connect directly since all cables were included. It's easy to charge. The sound is pretty good for such a small device. I don't know how it'll hold up but I have no complaints as of right now.
5,Purchased this speaker for a gift as I received one just like it and loved it.  Nice size hold battery chargers volume is still clear at higher volumes.  Connects to mobile via Bluetooth easily.  Overall winner. I like that I can manage volume on my phone and/or on the speaker.
5,I'm thrilled with this.  The sound is amazing and it hooked up the bluetooth with my new m5 player immediately.  Getting rid of xm radio and will use this
4,Good for the price.
5,I have thoroughly enjoyed this speaker. Because of its compact size it is easy to take and use anywhere. A friend who loves Bose speakers after hearing music on this said  "Why should I spend more than $200 for a Bose speaker when I can buy this one for around $30?"  I agree. It has been a great addition to my music library.
5,Second one of these I have bought. Bluetooth makes it easy to use ANYWHERE!
5,For the prize I got it on daily special but even so the sound is amazing for a small speaker!! I bought it for my phone or iPad but going to use it for my Mac! I had gotten a sound at for my Mac but this is just as good! Very satisfied!!!
3,I've had it for a while now (I wish this webpage told me the purchase date...) and it's been really good until last night. Now it resets randomly with it's annoying chime (it was cool when I summoned it) and I can't use it anymore. I can't find any information on how to fix it if poking the headphone jack with a paperclip won't help which is disappointing.
5,I’ve had this item for over 3 months and am still happy with my purchase. Very nice speakers. Holds very long battery life. Great sound. Holds connection to phone perfectly. I love that I can adjust volume either by touching/swiping the top of the speaker or from my phone.
2,I charged this speaker immediately when I got it brought it to work the next day fully charged played it for maybe 5 hours. Brought it to work the 2nd day and it’s playing for about 3-5 hours and during this time the music will pause every now an then to let you know the speaker is slowly dying. From a full charge my speaker died after 10 hours or so I was pretty disappointed. Not sure if it’s cause I had the volume on Max so I could actually hear it in my loud shop. But wouldn’t recommend for long time listening
4,I was disappointed with the battery length.  I use it daily in my classroom and it must be charged daily
4,Bought for my 14 year old son.  He tells me the sound and range are excellent (better than his last).What I didn't like while looking at it was the volume is not an up and down arrow but rather a dial to lower or increase the sound.It's minor but other than that he likes it.
3,Pretty loud for its size i like the look and feel the touch controls are cool butThe reason i gave it 3 is because i had to return due to a crackling sound while in low to med volume.  I tried different devices and had the devices on med vol too but still . I guess it was just a bad one. For the price you cant go wrong if it works right. I will just save my money a get a better one later.i am the type if the product don't work right the first time and i have to go to the trouble of returning it i tend not to try again.  But if your not me  go for it.
5,For the price I paid I was really satisfied with the sound.
3,I bought a year ago and worked great then stopped taking a charge wrote company about repair or battery change out and no response.  Going to throw it away...
3,The speaker has a nice sound but the jack in the back to connect the charging cableIs so loose that it often does not make the connection to charge.  Unfortunately I have had it for about 8 months which is past the return window apparently.  Should last much longer than that.
5,I keep this little speaker in my art space and play music through my phone to it.  The sound quality is really good and the speaker appears to be well made.  Battery lasts and lasts.  If I didn't already have a couple of UE Boom speakers elsewhere in the house (bought by others) I would buy more of these.Highly recommend and you just can't beat it for the price.
5,Great sounds and has a lot of volume. Bass is perfect and doesn't over power the treble or the mid-range. Quickly locates the Bluetooth devices in the the area. One must pair up these devices to be able to enjoy their downloaded playlists or Internet medias. One draw back is there is no way to control the volume and turn on and off remotely. Otherwise I give it a 4.75 rating.
5,I love this speaker!  It's a fair price decent size and great sound.  For listening to tunes on the beach or in the living it has a great clear sound we all enjoy.
4,I haven’t had a chance to qualify the battery life I just got it and the first thing I wanted to hear was the sound quality I AM KEEPING IT!!
4,I rarely use my Doss but I liked it a lot.  Great sound but my battery won't hold a charge. I played my bem cube all the time and I'm going back to my bem.  Super bummed I spent the money and it didn't last at all.
5,Keep in mind this isn't going to give you concert sound or the greatest audio experience you've ever heard.  If your looking for a good and low priced speaker then this may just be for you sound quality is very adequate(I mostly listen to podcasts while cooking with occasional music) battery life is very good and all around you can't beat it for the money.  For sure would buy again
5,Awesome sound Especially  for such a small speaker  you WILL BE Impressed !!!
5,The DOSS Bluetooth speaker is great and good value. I compare this with a Bose Bluetooth speaker I have and that’s 4x the price! The sound is comparable to where I purchased two more (1 each for my daughters) as birthday gifts.
5,I'm an audio engineer and I can tell you that this is incredible. Look read all the reviews compare all you want but at the end of the day-it does exactly what it says. The battery life is amazing and the sound is perfect for any occasion. From dancing in a hotel room to bringing it for a day at the beach it's the perfect middle ground between partying hard and not being too loud. For the price I mean come on stop kidding your self.
4,I love the sound of this little speaker but I wish the voice commands could be turned off completely. I did update the firmware to remove them but when a call comes in it still says "call incoming." =/ Still that doesn't happen often and is something I can live with. Otherwise great little speaker for the price.
5,Love this little speaker! I have 3 now one for the back deck one for work and one for my nightstand. I just love the portability of them the sound quality is great and they were so inexpensive!
4,Muy bueno para escuchar musica en el parque sonido excelente se conecta bien al blutooth no me gusto que no se conecta con YouTube se pasan la musica muy rapida y no se termina
4,My husband took our Bose mini Bluetooth speaker during our divorce and I bought this one to replace. It’s great! Very comparable. Made me wonder why I spent $200 on the Bose. I was skeptical but was pleasantly surprised at the quality of sound. Only downfall was no wall plug. Had to charge via my laptop.
2,I loved this speaker so much. She was my pride and joy but around 2am she started turning on and off by herself around every two seconds it’s loud and annoying I can’t get it to stop there is nothing online that is helping me and I just want to go to sleep.
5,We love it so much we bought another and a 3rd as a gift. Great sound fun color. Very happy with this purchase!!!
5,Use this all the time.  Decent sound quality/volume (about as good as you're going to get from a bluetooth speaker).  Use this for several hours (6-12) at a time and haven't experienced any battery life issues even at higher volume for more than 7-8 hours.It's a little difficult to turn on/off with the little flimsy button in the back.  Seems like you need to hold it down for a while and there's no feedback to tell if it's catching or not.
5,Works great just what I needed. I am using with Show 5. I like that it is portable. I leave it plugged in & that way it is charged when I take it outside on the patio. I connected to Show 5 through aux cable. Package contains a usb charging cord & aux cable. For the price it is a great speaker.
5,I purchased this for the living room TV that my husband couldn't hear.  I was able to connect it with a blue tooth adapter to the TV (which is not a smart tv)  by myself.  So it's easily connected.  The sound quality is very good and serves the purpose I was intending for it.
5,El dispositivo cumplió mis expectativas muy moderno... Excelente el sonido.. Fácil de usar... Muy cómodo para llevar... Excelente producto...
5,This wireless blue tooth speaker has good quality at a low price.  It has worked worked just fine with my iPhone.
3,It's a great sounding speaker get's really loud and the sound quality is awesome. BUT the dang pairing sound it makes when it connects to Bluetooth is super loud and annoying. I'm almost tempted to give it to someone else and buy a different one that's not as loud and won't disturb my office when I pair it. I've tried contacting support several times to ask if there's a way to turn the pairing sound down or off and haven't gotten a reply yet. Overall I'd recommend this speaker but not if for an office setting.
5,Excellent product for the price. Could use some additional depth is sound but quality is OK.
5,After a bad experience with  another brand I was a bit nervous.  The software and pairing was simple and complete for a 73 yr. old to install.  Love this little guy - take him to bathroom basement and garage .  Very happy camper!
3,Sounds great for music. Only one complaint: With audio books after any pause even a short one part of the initial sound is clipped resulting in a popping sound. This does not happen when plugged into aux port only Bluetooth.
5,Has a very good sound
5,We have 2 of these--one for the upstairs and for the downstairs. Love them!!Great sound qualitiy for the $$
5,I love this little speaker! My laptop speakers aren't very loud even at 100% sometimes I can't hear videos on YouTube or Amazon Prime Video.  This speaker is great because I can hook it up to any device via Bluetooth or use the 3.5mm jack input to attach by cord.  The volume button is super cool  you use your finger to swipe in a circular motion and it feels so high tech!  Definitely recommend this product. You'll love it!  :)
5,LOVE this little system!  I was having a hard time justifying buying a Boise speaker and I’m glad I tried this first!
3,+ Very loud at max volume+ Nice color+ Powerful bass+ Great price+ Great customer support+ Carrying bag and all needed cords included- Have to hold the power button to turn it off or on- Wheel volume control is pointless as the volume is controlled incrementally.- No plug included for charging without a computer~ Its big. Not a con for me but it might be a problem for some people.EDIT:- On songs with a lot of bass the speaker will go quiet and will not play the bass right.- Moves around at medium to high volume
5,A fairly good sound for the small speaker. I haven't used it much without the USB power plugged in. Basically it's all good but if this hadn't been on sale I would never have bought it at Amazon base price. Too expensive for a average speaker.
5,The sound is great! The only thing I found to be wrong was that could've been due to not changing it long enough but I did change it until it was a solid green light. But other than that I think it's a great buy especially for the price I got it for.
3,its solid for the money. perhaps i was spoiled by the soundbot i had before which was similarly priced but the bass on this thing is basically nonexistent. it seems like thats the standard now and its my fault for not researching but its okay for what you pay. not great for music but it has made for a decent computer speaker.
5,Great sound and long battery life. Seems like a higher priced speaker.
5,Everything is good i ordered because back in my country a year ago my brother bought one and i wanted one too and now i got it... But i think it used to come with a bag to carry it and mine didn't bring it and my grandma ordered one too like a month ago and she had to order the bag alone... Now is that? Can someone explain me plz?
5,Surprised this sounded so good and was so well built for the price. My wife uses it every single day for well over a year now and I am constantly surprised the quality if it for the money spent. It looks great sounds good well thought out.
5,Easy to set up and use.
4,It's has a nice design and a great color selectionThe sound quality is very nice. Great battery life I spent 4 hours using it and it till didnt die. The only problem is it vibrates itself off surfaces haha so after a while of playing it might vibrate right of the shelf or table lol
5,I've had this speaker for a month or 2 and I love the sound quality ease of use and the look of it.  Surprising quality for the price.
4,Stopped working after a few months
4,1. Good battery life2. Sound quality good.3. Bass effect to the point.4. Holds good even on high volumes.5. Portable6. Easily gets paired with devices.7. Touch controls.8. Sleek simple and elegant.Could have provide with a carrying case instead of purchasing separately.
5,I've had this Doss SoundBox speaker for almost 2mos now & I love this thing! So easy to move from room to room or outdoors. It has a smooth & powerful sound & a really nice sturdy feel to it. The battery lasts long to (you definitely get 12 hours out of it). I recently got the Khanka carry case for it & have brought it to the beach a couple times the sound quality is just as great outdoors as it is indoors. I would highly recommend!
5,I use this item around the house like when I'm in the kitchen or in the bathroom doing my makeup I think it is perfect for the price. super easy to set up my only gripe is the battery drains pretty quickly but I like to listen to music continuously for hours haha. Other than that great buy I highly recommend!
5,Was not expecting much volume or clarity of sound from such a small speaker but the price was attractive. I am so pleasantly surprised. The sound is full with decent bass tones and clear in mid-range and treble. I purchased this as small bookshelf speakers but the fact they have a built-in battery makes me imagine that I could easily move them around.Pairing these with a Chromecast Audio allowed me to inexpensively move music through my whole house without breaking the budget. I would definitely consider adding some more of these to my setup.
4,Pretty great sound. It does break up a bit at the loudest setting. Wish it had NFC support. I'm not the biggest fan of the volume touch button. You have to trace the circular button clockwise or counterclockwise to raise and lower the volume. Other than that it's very good and seems worth the cost.
4,Hooked up to Alexis and now she can get her tunes while she's in the spa. Sound quality could be better.
5,I liked everything about this product. Unlike the $ 99 Bose mini speaker this one can be hooked up conventionally as well as via bluetooth. The sound seems comparable. I haven't really tested battery length but so far so good. Thank you! It makes my 6S smartphone jazz playlists sound great outdoors and also TSFJAZZ and KCSM on wifi. Blutooth Synch was a snap.
4,This product has lasted longer than any other brand of wireless speaker I have purchased in the past 4 yrs...I bought a 2nd one to keep at lakehouse!
4,This speaker works great. Sound is good for small space like the bedroom office or bathroom.Very happy with it.
5,I purchased this as a gift for my husband who loves music but due to hearing loss can’t hear the music on his phone.  He is over the moon happy with this speaker.  Follow the instructions carefully to pair the bluetooth.  The price is right too!
3,******Update***** After  further inspection of the speaker I believe one of the speakers had busted and the other one was working fine. The blown speaker I'm assuming is where I was getting all the static from.The company refunded my money no problem and we're very fast and pleasant to deal with. I believe things happen that's out of their control sometimes. After dealing with customer service I would buy the speaker again.Received this speaker July 13th 2017. I've had it less than a month and it's already nothing but static. Tried to reset and charge Etc. Nothing seems to work. As far as sound quality it is about the same as any other $20 speaker on the market.
5,Perfect size charge has longevity and volume gets loud and clear.
5,It was East to connect to the MacBook Pro and enhanced the sound greatly.  Well worth the cost.  Hard to believe a small thing can sound so good.
5,I use this speaker for podcasts and to boost my laptop sound...  works great...  loud enough to overcome running on the treadmill...
5,Got this on a deal. Accidentally ordered 2.. which was a fortunate accident. I love this little thing. Very good sound!  You can tell its quality when you pick it up. Most feel very light this has a weight to it. Has GREAT volume! very impressive for being small. Still feeling out the battery life but so far so good.. again impressed!
5,Was pleased with the sound and volume. Good for putting poolside for tunes while swimming.
5,This is such an amazing speaker with such an amazing sound n HD bass I will never buy from any other company but this one! I've bought other speakers prior to this 1 n none even came close to the sound n bass as this speaker I absolutely love it!! In fact I jus purchased 2 more lol look no further ppl u want a great sounding speaker u wont find another like it!!! 👍👍👍👍👍👍
4,Not too bad...for the price the sound quality is nice. Its not "The Beats" or anything but definitely still a good item to buy. Volume is also considerably decent. I love the volume button tho. Its not actually a button but in order to amplify the volume you have to put your finger in a clockwise rotation on the interface. Its so cool.
5,I am impressed.  Very clear and good bass.  Music off SD card works good except I wish it had a random function.  Bluetooth works good I'm not sure about distance since speaker and phone are always close together.  Has plenty of volume.  Small footprint.  Only Bluetooth speaker I could find with easily accessible control buttons.  I love the fact they are backlit.  I would definitely recommend it.
5,I just got mine today and I love it. The sound is crystal clear like the customer videos show. The speakers have excellent bass especially when you turn them up and it don't take much. My mom has an expensive Bose Bluetooth and there's not much difference except the Bose has better bass to it. I'd rather have this one. When you switch tracks manually it sounds off a soft chime. 😀
5,Bought this on sale and works great! Sound quality is perfect. Furthermore it fell from at least 7ft and still works perfectly. Will definitely recommend.
4,I ordered this for my husband as a gift and then decided to give it to my dad instead. I'm glad I did - my dad reports that the sound is nice but the speaker doesn't have the level of bass that my husband would want. My dad uses it primarily with his Echo Dot and seems pleased with the quality and portability of the speaker.
5,Got it for my mom as a Christmas present. Not loud enough for me but she says it’s perfect. She’s only had it for about an hour and hasn’t stopped playing music on it yet so i would say she loves it. Perfect size works perfect definitely would recommend others.
5,Love everything about it no problems at all .. 5 stars
4,The speaker has a good batter great sound quality and is loud however I've been having issues with it skipping songs on its own. The next song button will flash mid-song and cut whatever I'm listening to short then play the next song. However it does not do this when it is plugged in and charging. Overall a good speaker.
4,Great speaker for the price. Bass isn’t the best but it’s still better than I thought it would be. I haven’t used it long enough to test the battery life. Bluetooth hooked up right away.
4,Nice unit with great sound for its size. Bluetooth works flawlessly. My only concern now is when the battery life is shot that it is not easily replaced as per a previous question that was asked. I dont like the idea that if the battery dies that they unit goes in the garbage we have enough plastic waste in our landfills and seas.
5,Sound is ok but if you want a speaker that can take a beating look no further. I have dropped this speaker from that 30-50 feet onto hard root filled ground 3 times now. (I like to listen to music while hammocking high up in trees) Each time expecting the speaker to be destroy but there are no signs of my abuse an it still works as great as the day I got it! Not even a scratch!
5,I have only used the microSD to listen but the sound is very clear and although heavy on treble and highs the system does carry enough bass to off-set this a bit. I would not recommend for bass-heavy music but if you like rock and music with guitars and singers this will be nice for your luck. If you are wishing to play dubstep and trap and the oldskool jungle I would not recommend as the music EQ is unlucky for these genres. Thank you friends!
5,Sometimes when it has almost low battery the songs tend to skip automatically due to vibration and sensitivity. Besides that minor trouble it’s perfect and i love it
5,A clear bold sound for a low price make this a wonderful portable speaker.  The setup was very easy connecting to my iPhone and my wife's iPad.  The Bluetooth range is amazing. We can put the iPad in the house and play the Doss speaker in our backyard over 10 feet away.  This speaker puts out a clear balanced sound that will make summer outside dining a total delight.  Plus it even came with a travel bag so we can take it to the beach.
5,Excellent value.  I urge Amazon to stop censoring customers of AWS by denying access to contracted for service.Thanks
5,Did not have a place to play USB drive. Is there a adapter to get to play USB drive so I won't have to return them. I can get the adapters I need. I just ordered the correct ones. Thanks!
5,Use it in my office. Works great. I didn’t want to spend a lot of money. Works great for the price.
1,The Max volume at it highest level by way on connection through Bluetooth and input was inadequate and never got the opportunity to experience the bass sound.
5,Bass leaves a little to be desired but you get all you could ask for for the price. good sound great battery life easy to connect
5,Hands down the absolute best low budget speaker you can get cause I believe I paid under $30 and yet the sound quality is better than people I know with those unnecessary $60-200 pill speakers
5,I got this for a friend of mine so I can’t give it a rating on battery life but the Bluetooth work like a charm I’ve owned a jbl and a tribit max sound plus and I can say it’s not as loud as the jbl but it’s still a good but
4,Great sound.  Really great sound.  Clear and crisp.  They sound like they should cost hundreds of dollars not $30.  Listening to phone calls is clear although the other party has a little problem hearing me.  But that's not why I bought them.  I wanted to listen to the song list from my phone while in my truck without spending a bunch of $$$.  Perfect answer.
5,I had trouble getting the blue tooth setting operational but now it connects quickly and the sound is great.
5,Received this speaker within the time I was told it would be delivered.Great service.This speaker is nothing short of awesome.I knew it before I even tried it just because it wasn't a cheap piece of plastic....it is heavy and well made and the sound is purely magical.The price is more than reasonable and the setup is easy.Whoever gave this a bad review must have ordered something other than this product.This would make a great gift as well.
4,Had to order a replacement. After 5 min of playing any sound via bluetooth or aux the speaker would skip forward randomly and at a high rate. It was like playing roulette with music.
5,I'm so in love with these speakers.  By no means am I an expert when it comes to sound quality...just your average individual who wants to be able to dance around in the kitchen in between cooking meals.  These speakers are the perfect size and are truly portable should you need to do that!  I'm really impressed by the sound quality as well.  The tones are deep and rich and I was quite impressed by it's ability to not distort bass sounds too badly.  I would definitely recommend these speakers.
5,Sound Quality is good
5,I liked the easy set up. I bought it for my parents to listen to online church.
5,This has kept me going for hours while painting and doing other home projects. Great sound quality for a small device!
5,Absolutely awesome sound! The battery life is great to.
5,Bought this cute little guy because my daughter had bought one and she loved it. Very easy to set up and use. Plays long hours and sound quality is fine by me. (I'm not an audiophile)
5,Great speaker pairs in seconds to my PC and iPhone.Battery life is even longer than advertised I get 14 hours.Bluetooth connection is solid when paired to PC I can take speaker to any place in my house and even out in the yard without any drop outs.The first one I received had a problem with the on/off switch hard to use.  I reported it to Doss and within 5 days had received a new speaker. That's what I call first class customer service.
5,It’s great
5,The quality of this box is better than I expected wow and it suits my purpose
4,This has good sound quality but not great. Everything has been easy going with this sound bar and the battery life is VERY impressive! The only issue I've really had is connecting it to my laptop; on occassion the sound has become very distorted with lots of static. However with all other devices it's been fine.
5,We love the sound but hate having to get up and turn it on as it automatically shuts off if you don’t use it for a while.  Our old $5 one whichbhas great sound stays on once you switch it on.Sounds lazy to not want to get up and turn it on but lots of times were working and in the middle of something when we want to turn it on.  Just wish it stayed on!!!!
5,I bought this speaker for my daughter. I was really impressed with it. For the price you can't beat it. Its loud and clear. As always when I use Amazon the product was on time and I had no issues. There are better bluetooth speakers out there. They also come with a hefty price tag. If you want a great sounding speaker with a small piece tag you can't go wrong with this one. I highly recommend it.
5,I bought one for myself.  Loved it.  Loved it so much that I bought it for my mom for Christmas.  Took a second or two to teach her how to use it but it really is easy to use and has great durability and sound quality!
3,The sound is amazing on this thing I really loved it only problem was it came with a little dent.
1,I purchased this speaker in May 2016 and it worked ok for a while.  However over time its performance withered to where within the last year its volume has been softer than even the phone by itself whether via bluetooth or direct input via auxiliary cable.  I have used entirely indoors and never abused.  I write very few reviews but am so disappointed with this product that I had to call up the order and review today.  I had always th=ought the Doss name had value but I would never buy this product or another Doss product again.  In summary it started out with just ok sound and quality never big volume to hear across the room and tailed off steadily to where its sound is so weak that just playing the music over your phone is a vast improvement.
5,I am not sure what I expected but this is just great for what I wanted and more.  I bought to go with echo dot.  I take it all over the one story house and on the back porch.  Great sound easy to connect small and compact.  Works with my  computer and it says it will work with my phone.  I have not tried that but I am sure it would if I wanted.  Nice price nice product.
4,Buen altavoz con buena calidad de audio y una batería muy durable. Es el segundo altavoz de la marca que compró. Ambos salieron muy buenos. Recomendable producto.
5,Great speaker! Excellent sound for the price acoustics - treble/bass are balanced. The sound radiates wonderfully in semi-large area that I intended it to. Highly recommend if you’re looking for a great compact speaker at a good price. I got the white to match the walls of the room it’s in tho there are other fun colors. Thanks DOSS!
5,I’m a year late reviewing but this thing is awesome! For the price I couldn’t ask for more. The batter life lasts forever and it’s plenty loud enough to hear across my 1200 sq ft first bottom story of our home. Such a wonderful device even over a year later!
4,Loved this compared to other speakers. Pretty load for a smaller speaker.
5,I don’t have anything to compare it to but I’m very happy with my purchase.
5,For the money a great blue tooth speaker. Not a Bose but for the money a great value. Instant connectivity no issues.
5,Had bought another speaker for $10 less than this and im so glad I sent that one back and put up the extra.$10. this speaker is great! The quality feels great and the sound is awesome. I don't know if there's a speaker this good out there for the same amount of money cause I was surprised at the quality. If you don't have the money for a $100 speaker this definitely will compete with them. Really cool design too. Couldn't be happier.
5,This is the best speaker!  User friendly.
1,Was a great speaker at first but it shuts off after 15 minutes if not playing music.  So I searched on Google and found that there is a firmware update that cancels that.  So I emailed the support website and I received a reply in very broken English asking for my Amazon order number and a picture of the bottom of the unit.  I sent what the requested and I received a 1kb xyz.bin file.  I was told to load the file onto a Micro SD card and insert it upside down into the TF Card slot.  I did that and the unit did the update as described.  However after the update the volume is 25% of what it was before AND the unit still shuts off after 15 minutes.  And on toop of that the Micro SD card goes in the TF card slot so far I can barely grab it but not enough to remove the Micro SD card.  I absolutely DO NOT recommend this product at all!!
5,It's perfect for outside listening while I sell my snowball.
4,Great speaker. I got till it for my dorm room and it works perfectly when me or my roomates want to sync our phones or laptops to it so we can listen to music together. The size is great for moving it room to room or traveling with it and the sound quality is just fine for the price.
4,Portable easy to use sound is good and battery lasts a good length of time.  Wish it could be louder but for its size and price I guess it is OK.  Good for use in a regular sized room but not in much more.
5,I like the product.
4,The first speaker that I received didn't work. The Bluetooth wouldn't connect but I could still use the aux port to play music. I informed the company and they immediately sent me a new speaker and the Bluetooth works! Sounds pretty good for what it is. Keep in mind that this is not a Bose so it isn't going to sound that good. But this still sounds great.
5,So I tested a well known speaker brand in store and was not satisfied with the sound using my Bluetooth connect I need to hear all elements of my music clearly if I am not using ear phones.This speaker did not disappoint no distorted 'rattling' music I wassurprised how beautiful my music sounded simply amazing compact in size can easily fit in my handbag or luggage very happy with my choice.
1,We got this item and loved it worked great. Had it sitting on a patio table outside under a 10 ft umbrella. One rain storm came and speaker no longer turns on. Very disappointed since it states for outdoor and water resistant
5,Small but mighty.
5,Def would recommend good for the price it’s everything  I would expect from a great quality speaker.
5,This little speaker packs a powerful punch! I use it in my house and outside by the pool. The sound quality is very good. I’ve listened to music for hours without the battery dying.
2,When I was looking for a quality Bluetooth speaker I went by the "best seller" connotation and ordered one of these speakers. The sound quality seemed good although I thought the volume control cut off  at only a moderate level.I have no beefs with the sound it produced at all. What it came down to was the charging. It failed to work and the little diode lights in back never lit up. I returned the unit asking for a replacement and asking that the unit they sent me be tested to make sure it would work. Instead I got a unit that was WORSE than the original. Not only did the unit not work and turn onit did not charge or do any of the functions it was supposed to do. So in my opinion there is very little or no quality control to this product. So to any potential customers you have a 50/50 chance of receiving  a speaker that does not work and customer support (although prompt) doesn't seem  to care enough to pretest their replacement units. So you are taking your chances. Apparentlyquality control is unheard of with foreign made products.
4,I love that the buttons on top are basically touch screen. The sound is actually very loud and doesn't sound crackly like other speakers Ive had. Great quality !
5,The sound quality is great the bass is booming. IT is LOUD!! I was amazed by it all. It connects to my phone and laptop with ease. I could not ask for a better speaker at the moment
5,This speaker has very rich sound for a very affordable price.  I have been extremely pleased using this speaker in my office at work to listen to music in the background while I work.  It's no Bose and you aren't going to fill a room at a party with sound from this thing but it's great for what you pay for it.
5,I love this thing. I play all my Amazon prime songs on it.plan on using it out at our trailer.
5,This speaker is very nice quality for the price. I've used it quite a bit outside and charged it once so far. Sound is very good.
5,It can be loud which is good cause your music be blasting. Amazing to listen to music while showering  cookouts or just to listen to music in general.
4,Great product. Was a Christmas gift and my husband is blown away by the ease of use and great sound.
4,This product sounds great when you are in place or in a small area. If you have a larger area you cannot really hear it as well and if you are on the go it automatically skips songs shortly after they start. That is very annoying
4,Really good quality my first speaker and it was worth it
5,Easy setup
4,I have only  used  it for a for the last few weeks  but so far so good.Pros-small-decent sound for the size-George Takei talks to you-feels sturdy-doesn't look cheap-SD(tf) card option many other speakers in this price don't haveCon-The light stays on...........it  should go off a few seconds after you stop touching it IMO
5,Great build quality sounds great not a bass thumper... great sound.  Really like the volume adjust feature works well.  Size just right for desktop.  Well constructed and has some mass to it not a cheap lightweight product.
5,
4,I cannot pair it to my phone??? Otherwise I love the sound.
4,Small size big sound! Its attractive design blends in with any room. It's portable took it to the beach (kept it off sand & blanket) my music and the waves were perfect together!! The convenient touch sensitive top located buttons work well for me.  I really like this speaker!!
5,Great BT connectivity good battery life (easily more than a couple of hours) no issues with playing MP3s from microSD card and the sound volume and quality is great.
4,This is a great little speaker with great sound.  This is my second purchase.  Highly recommend.
5,Fun to use good value for the price. We use it for cook outs to play requests as we visit- a bright spot during this virus.
5,Good one
5,Excellent little box. I have a cochlear implant because of severe hearing loss and although this has greatly improved my hearing tv sound systems are not adequate for comfortable listening. I use a Bluetooth transmitter from tv to Soundbox and the tone and clarity have made listening so much easier less reliant on closed captioning. Also I can take the Box with me if in another room. Have not used it with music so cannot comment on that quality.made tv listening so much easier
5,I want to say that this is an amazing speaker!The sound is great it gets loud and clear. The volume adjusts nice and easy. Bluetooth connection is very simple. The battery lasts a very long time and when it's time to charge it is very quick!I highly recommend this speaker.
5,My Doss Bluetooth Speaker works but the “Next” button is broken and will just random skip songs and keep skipping until it “fixes itself”. When it’s skipping it won’t let me go back to a song it skipped because it will just skip it again. And it won’t even let me use my phone to go back because it will skip it. It’s really frustrating and annoying and ruins the mood.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I Love it gave it 4 stars Because the shipping was late😍🥰I was shocked how loud it goes..
5,What a deal! Love it! Works amazing and great sound. A true value! Don’t second guess it! Get it! You won’t regret it!
4,I like this product.  The battery lasts 10-12 hours depending on the volume I have it on.  Only takes about 4 hours to fully recharge.  I'm not a person that needs the greatest sound I just wanted something that would play itunes by my phone and it does.  It's loud enough to get good sound in my 24x30 workshop.
5,The sound on this is fantastic given the size of the unit. Very easy to use and pair. I have used it almost every day since my purchase about a month ago. I have dropped it several times with no issues. Well built. The mini SD card slot takes up to a 32 GB card meaning it fits thousands of sound files so when you want to hear your own music library its always there for you. At this price its a real winner.
5,This speaker has sound power! My husband wanted a speaker for his office that was a good price. Got this on a lightening deal and it's well worth it's money. We tested it out on our deck outside and we were both impressed! Definitely read the instructions--they are easy--for how the buttons work and how to pair your phone. Comes with a USB plug in but not the wall plug. We used one of our iPhone wall plugs to charge it more. It came charged.
5,My Galaxy A tablet isn't very loud so I've tried several bluetooth speakers. After reading other reviews I tried the Doss speaker and boy does it work well and it does get loud. I've never had an issue with the battery discharging too soon but then I charge it a couple times a week. Sound quality is good better than several other speakers I've tried. I would buy this again.
5,Bought this and it shipped in one day.  The packaging was nice.  It was shipped very well in a nice box with bubble wrap in it.  It's more then I expected.  I didn't have to spend alot of money on a great speaker.  The sound is amazing.  I love the touch feature on it.  I also like how it shows the battery life on my phone for the speaker.  I would say 100% buy this speaker.  It's amazing and not expensive. You won't be disappointed.
5,The first speaker I got had issues with skipping almost like a bad Bluetooth connection even when my phone was placed next to the speaker. I contacted Doss and after they reviewed a brief video I sent of the speaker having the issue sent me a prompt replacement. The new speaker has had zero issues. It’s a great speaker for its size has even sound and good battery life. Worth it!
5,Dear AmazonI found my package on my patio.  So everything is good and it sounds great.ThanksJohn
5,I bought one for my husband and I. We both love ours. The sound guilty and bass is incredible compared to what we used to have. With our jobs we need a long lasting battery and this meets all expectations. I have no issues with my Bluetooth disconnecting. Plus I love how it connects to my echo dot. Definitely buying one for my kids.
4,I purchased this item on a recommendation from a friend. It works great. However one issue I had was 4 days after arrival to me it started started sounding like there was a short. After turning it off and restarting my iPhone it works great again
4,Smaller than I would like but still functional.  I use it with my Fire HD 10 to practice my chorus music which I have on the Fire HD.  With MobileSheetsPro  I can have the scanned PDF sheet music and an MP3 learning track tied together to make it easy to practice.
5,Thank you
5,I love this speaker. I am a teacher and I use this in my classroom. It stays charged forever and sounds great!!
3,Good value for this wireless speaker!
5,very very loud beautiful sound quality although in no expert. very sleek design as well and very fast shipping!
5,Great little speaker.  Finds and pairs quickly with my phone and tablet.  Sound is better than any other I've tried in this price range.  The range is more than acceptable.  I can have it paired with my tablet in the kitchen and bring it into the bedroom which is a distance of approximately 45 ft through concrete and wire lathe walls and don't lose the signal.  And the price was right too.  Very happy with my purchase.
5,Nice sturdy looking speaker with touchscreen buttons. Connects fast to the BT. Can’t compare the sounds or quality cause my ears suck anyway and I can’t tell the difference  between  Taylor Swift and a rhino in heat. I like it so far and for that kind of money I think it sounds so much better to me
5,Quick easy ordering. Great product-
4,I really like this speaker. It doesnt have the bass oomph I was hoping for but it still does have some bass and the overall sound quality is great. It turns up pretty loud too.
3,I use my bluetooth speakers both for music and for talking on phone.  I had another brand which died so decided to try this brand.  For music it was excellent however when I talked on phone no one could under me at all.  Switched back to original brand.
5,We use them for outdoor movies and they’ve been great!  Small so easily portable. Loud enough and good sound quality. Easy to connect.
5,Wow after spending way to much money on a Beats pill for my daughter and having it go out I decided to give the Doss SoundBox a try and wow I am so thankful that I did. I Love the Quality at such an affordable price I can't promise you won't be disappointed but I definitely am NOT! My daughter and I both have one and love the quality and sound.
5,I could not ask for more for a speaker in this price range. It works great and I have no complaints. Would definitely recommend!
5,Excellent she loves it
4,Very nice especially being able to use as hands free for phone but volume is not as loud ae expected.
4,Great sound . Small so it does not take up a lot of space on my counter. Love that there is not a lot of wires once it is charged. Wish the on and off button was on the top it is small and I find myself picking it up or turning it around to push it.
4,Very good buy for the price. Could be a little louder. But overall good product
5,Love it! Clear sound loud enough for a home gym or room. Easily connects with no problem! Portable size
5,Excellent sound quality
5,I got this as a gift from my husband to use in my garage gym. It works great! Sound is pretty good - certainly better than from my laptop speakers! I don’t know about battery life yet but so far I really like it
3,It’s small. Works well. Not a loud as I would like. If was a little louder it would be perfect. I use it in huge warehouse so it could be louder. For most it’s great. Can’t beat the price.
5,Love the size of the box. It's easy to take somewhere. Wish it was easier to connect to Bluetooth
5,I didn't want to spend crazy money on a bluetooth speaker. Only need it for my bedroom and sometimes in the bathroom. Perfect for small area use. Battery life is great. I've been using it in small spurts for about 3 weeks and still haven't needed to recharge it. Easy to connect to my phone as well which is important for my mature generation! I'm happy with my purchase.
4,Doesn't put out high level of sound but for the money a great speaker
5,This little box has a huge sound for the price. It charges quickly and plays for hours. I am more than satisfied.
4,Big sound from a small speaker. Interface could be more intuitive but otherwise was a great buy.
5,I love this speaker!  Quality sound easy to work. Bluetooth works great. Highly recommend...
5,Great sound and quality. Has a lot of bass and sounds like surround sound on my tv. Much louder than I need it to be but love the option. Only downfall is that it is heavier than expected. I traveled with it internationally and probably should have taken a smaller speaker. Still l love this speaker! Friends have commented that it’s better than more expensive options out there.
5,This speaker is exactly what I hoped!  Great sound in a small unit.  Works perfect for our small deck or in the garage.  Very good value!  Highly recommend!
3,It's ok. Sound isn't anything great Bluetooth is fussy like every other one of these type of things.  Controls aren't intuitive I just mash them until something happens. It was cheap and I use the wired connection in my shop with my headphone jack on my phone. I don't really use the battery much but seems ok.  I'm satisfied for the price still use it regularly.
5,Absolutely love this speaker!! My husband and I have used it in the yard doing yard work it's as loud as a truck speaker!! I love it so much the sound quality is just unreal!! Buy it I promise you wont be disappointed!! Oh and I stopped my yard work just to write this review as I'm listening to this speaker best buy I've made in a long time!!
5,Sound is loud and clear.
5,Heavy and bulky for a portable speaker the sound quality is great and dose not lose it bluetooth connection. After many hours being on with periods  of non uses don't have to reconnect.
5,Like other reviewers pointed out it does not have bass but it has crispy clear sound and no obvious distortion at high volume. Volume control is responsive. Haven’t tested the TF card function yet. So far so good. I have bought 4 such speakers in the last two years it’s sound quality is close to the high end ones minus the bass. But it is so so much cheaper than those. It is worth the money and more.
5,The sound is great and my daughter loved it. Can’t beat it for the price.
4,Has really good sound.  Connects easily. Not sure about the battery life yet.  Haven't used it long enough.
3,This speaker was great until a few days ago. It really makes a lot of noise for its size... It started this annoying beeping like a busy tone on a phone. I have researched it(instructions are lacking) and it seems it is a battery issue. My indicator light does not work and I have tried everything. Ive had it a couple months it's a great speaker and I used it every night at bedtime but its just a paperweight now.
5,Probably the best Bluetooth speaker I’ve ever had. Great sound and the. Battery lasts forever !
5,Of course this speaker is portable but it’s easy to use and grab on the go! The sound is pretty good- for the price.
5,I think for a little bluetooth box it produces great sound. I don't know about battery life yet
4,I brought this device like 2 years ago and never used that much. I found it in my locker last night and was about to play it but it wont connect to any device. So Idk what's wrong with it. Do I get a replacement one?
5,I love this speaker.  I own two at my house and have bought several for gifts.  We have used them outside by the pool in the golf course and of course in the house. It is easy to set up and sounds great. Awesome little speaker.
5,I am reposting this due to excellent customer service. The connector on back for charging failed after a few months - would not charge. I posted a one star review here. A couple of days later I received an email from the seller stating they would replace the unit free of charge. I was happily surprised because it came without any promoting from me. I received the new unit and it works great so far. Great customer service Well done!
5,Good sound quality. Opera and rap sound great.  Perfect for taking to a hotel or for your office.
5,This speaker is incredible and for $30?!? I was surprised with how good the bass is and how loud it gets. Really nice and sleek design too!
5,Love everything about this! Ican hear it from several rooms.
5,I bought this for my 11 year old son for Christmas. Perfect gift for that hard to buy for "tweenager" The price was excellent and came as discribed. My older teen daughter's keep swiping it from him... I might need to buy a second
5,This speaker is very small very portable and work very well.  I am impressed especially for the price.  Highly recommended product.
4,Constantly loses it's connection to the device and takes multiple reboots to get it to reconnect.  The sound quality and battery life is really nice when it is working.EDIT:  The company contacted me and sent me out a replacement SoundBox that is working wonderfully with a solid Bluetooth connection and distance.  Added 1 star to my original review.
4,It took a while but I now like this product. It's an excellent value. It is fairly powerful for it's compact size with good treble good midrange and fair bass. Very easy setup with nice illuminated controls. Battery life is excellent thus far. Time will tell if this will continue to be so. I will buy this product again.
5,My daughter bought this speaker with her birthday money. I have to be honest I was extremely skeptical when she got it in the mail. She charged it up and tried it for the first time and I was blown away with the sound quality!!! She brings this speaker with her where ever she goes and everyone asks what brand it is because they want one!!
5,I got this for my boyfriend for Christmas I wanted to make sure it sounded great before I gave it to him so I tested it out. Very loud. Good use for parties and you can walk across the house with your phone and it still be hooked up
4,Absolutely amazing speaker. Easy to use and pair. Only used it for a day but am impressed with the sound. Good bass and clear sound. Not tried mic and phone function yetJust tried the mic function since my review above. The person I was speaking to said I sounded muffled and not clear. So de rates to 4 stars
3,Good clear sound but literally no bass what so ever. Put this alongside my JBL flip and found both to be about equal.  Read all of the reviews and really got from these what I thought would I be a good product with a reasonable base output.  However when you read a bit father you find that all of the reviews were either paid for or compensated with lower priced products for the review. I should have known there was some reason for all of the five star reviews. Please understand this is a very good product  at an extremely good price just does not quite meet the hype of the reviews.
5,You’ve gotta be crazy to leave anything less than a 5 star review for this. Great price aside sound quality / bass is incredible and battery lasts forever.
5,Bought this two years ago and it still works. Sounds great plays upon hours after charging.Highly recommend.
4,Overall i am very happy with this bluetooth speaker. The sound quality is good as well as the battery life.
5,I got this  to listen to music in my apartment and it sounds great connects easily and the battery has yet lose charge.
5,Has pretty good sound for a small speaker.  I had to come back and edit.  My wife loves music of all kinds and as she goes from room to room in the house she'll turn on different audio devices.  Since getting her this speaker she pairs it up with her Kindle in the morning puts it on her wheelchair and her music is with her at all times.  She loves it and said it was the best present I've ever given her in more than 25 years together.
4,Works great! Not the best sound quality in the world but perfect for my purposes. I do wish the charge lasted a bit longer. Also this blue color stains easily with the volume sensor just with the oils on the hands and I haven't been able to clean it.
4,Wish it went louder than the phone setting but overall great speaker and quality sound for its size
4,Headline says it all.
4,The product itself is amazing the only issue I had was the person delivered my package. It was in my recycling bin instead of on the porch where they said it was. Other than that no issue with the product itself.
5,Great sound and battery life for a great price
5,A must buy!  I was leery on buying this but it had good reviews and so much cheaper than bose.  I am very happy with this purchase! It gets pretty loud and has decent bass for such a small box.  It connects very easily to my phone.
5,very nice for a room not loud enough for a party
5,Oh how much I really love this!!!Highly recommended it had amazing bass when you crank it up! I use it in my garage when I’m working out. Amazing battery life too!!
5,This speaker puts out a lot of sound. The bluetooth works well - I move the speaker upstairs and downstairs to the basement. It charges up in about an hour. It lasts for at least 8 hours. I think its good value for money.
5,This compact speaker delivers great quality sound for a reasonable price. It was straightforward to pair with both my phone and computer and is small enough to be easily portable. Very happy with this purchase.I also want to give a shout out to the fantastic customer service at DOSS; I had an issue with first speaker I received from Amazon but when I reached out to the company they responded promptly and sent a replacement which works great.
4,Works as advertised
5,No dislikes at all love this Bluetooth speaker
5,Purchased for  Christmas present.  They love it and easy to use.  Great value!
5,I loved the style and sound quality of my doss wireless touch Bluetooth speaker
5,Purchased white speaker in April 2018 for my fiancée. Still going strong. Great for watching YouTube in the kitchen bathroom beauty room wherever.  Music sounds great out in the garden.Pros: pretty good sound easy to use and battery still lasts about 6 or 7 hours perhaps longer.Cons: micro usb power port. Micro usb cables are failure prone.
5,I was pleasantly surprised with this speaker; after reading some of the bad reviews I thought I was taking a risk but it was on sale so I ordered it anyway. The sound quality is perfect & the battery life is better than I expected! The only thing I agree with from negative reviews is that the beeping sound when the battery is running low is very annoying.
5,This works like you think it should. The only minor thing is the controls on the top light up and are always on. Not a big deal during the day. At night they are pretty bright. I covered it with a cloth and that fixed it.
5,This Bluetooth speaker is easy to use and has a great battery life and great sound especially for my use living in a one-bedroom apartment.
5,This little speaker has good battery life the sound can fill the room even on a lower setting and the quality is amazing! Second one I've bought and I'm extremely happy with it.
5,Bought this for Father’s Day.
4,I enjoy this. I bought it on sale and think I got my money's worth. It connected easily with my phone and is very portable. It could be louder; I wanted to be able to listen to it while in the shower. If I could hear it over the running water I'd rate it 5 stars.
5,Very happy with this speaker. Great quality for the price. And this is not a paid (or otherwise rewarded) review!
4,crisp podcast playbacks. Clear music playback even at volume. NOT that tinney sound. placed on a table creates a subtle pound that is surprising. Unless its windy not to bad outdoors while gardening. NOT good at being speaker phone extension.
5,Amazing sound quality comes from this little box. Great price tooPurchase the case for it.It will keep it clean and portable.
4,This speaker was well above what i could of hoped for. Quality was really surprising for the 29.99 price and the setup is perfect. The only problem I have with it is the volume control is kind of hard being close to other buttons so i just leave the speaker volume all the way up while controlling it on my phone/mac etc. Overall good buy!
5,I didn’t think this would be as loud as it is but i love the sound quality and i haven’t had any problems! my favorite thing to have when i’m in the shower in my room even outdoors!
5,I use this all the time so I do not have to run my TV on full blast to hear on the opposite side of the living-room... You are welcome neighbor down stairs. All I have to do is turn it on and it connects automatically then I can control the volume pause rewind fast forward. Love it!
4,Heres the reasons for giving four stars:  1. It makes super annoying sound when On/Off and Bluetooth dis/connection.  2. Some buttons wouldn't work. I bought this speaker for use with my Mac mini I can't pause can't play pre/next track. The power button is awkwardly placed next to inputs and requires long press to turn on and off.
5,This speaker is is worth every penny. We have been through several bluetooth speakers and most that are portable just aren’t very reliable. We even use this in our car and the sound quality is superb. There are several features that make this speaker better than your average bluetooth speaker. Even though it’s smaller the quality and sound is amazing! I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a speaker that is portable and convenient but has superior sound quality.
4,Great sound
5,It looks and works great!!
5,a real nice widget.
4,I just read a story about fake reviews especially in electronics.  They said to look for short reviews.  I'm not giving a long one but I like the sound from this.
5,Used this one time and it never worked again.  Do not purchase.  We were careful not to over charge but it still didn't work after the first use.For whatever reason this thing started working.  I’m assuming any problems I had with it were due to operator error. This speaker works great and has been working for a while now. I would purchase again.
5,its small  and loud
5,Absolutely love it! Bought for primitive camping with my husband and kids its got great volume and battery life. Bang for bucks! 💪🏾
4,I enjoy almost everything about this speaker until I get phone calls. When I try to use the speaker phone feature I end up switching over to my phone because it’s hard for people to hear me.
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I love this speaker... sound and battery life for sure. I love that you can talk on your phone thru it. I work the night shift 8hrs and it last just about the entire night for me ❤️❤️
4,Black and white the Bluetooth chooses when it wants to connect. I've got Apple Airpods AppleTV and many other Bluetooth devices in my home all work just fine. This speaker system connects every now and again and when it does it's usually only for a week or so.
3,Worked and sounded great.... for awhile. Then out of nowhere 5 months or so after getting it it just wouldn’t hold a charge anymore and couldn’t be unplugged for more than a minute without shutting off. Tried to just use it as a stationary speaker in my home but upon further inspection it seems that the charging port detached and fell (...??) into the interior of the speaker. So it wasn’t that it wouldn’t keep a charge it was that it just fell apart and wouldn’t charge at all any longer.
5,Sounds grate for the size of the box. Well built also. I bought one for my Wife an liked it so munch bought one for my self. Hers is blue mine is red. We do not run ours at full volume. We use the sound Box for back ground music so battery is good in this way.
4,Great for the price! Would be better if it had FM radio capabilities & a remote.  Base was impressive for its price tag.
5,Great speaker for out on the patio or at the beach. I am surprised how long the batteries last in this device compared to other speakers I had in the past.
5,Easy to connect to your phone and when turned off the battery is stable for a very long time.  Very nice sound.
3,I bought this to replace two stereo speakers for my desk top. Nope not as good as what I have. Great for a portable. I love that when it goes on you have to turn the volume up. Great battery life.
5,I have given this product a 5 Star only because I know someone who has one & they are very very pleased with it. This is a Christmas present for my husband (today is December 12) but I’m sure my hubby will love his just as much. Just FYI my husband wears hearing aids & when he first heard the sound coming out of the speakers he had to turn his hearing aids down seems well worth the money!!
5,This is a great portable speaker and works great.  I can use it both wireless and connected to a computer.  Bluetooth works great
5,For the price could not beat it easy to use!
3,This is the 3rd one of these I've bought. First two are fine. The third stopped working after only 2 months. I'm afraid to go to the well another time. I'd like Amazon or the manufacturer to replace this defective unit.
5,I love my bluetooth I can sit outside and listen to myusic
3,I purchased this speaker based on the many rave reviews and low price. It is a solid device at a great price but sound is less than amazing. Several said great bass but they must have low expectations I find myself begging for more bass. Even tried using wired connection since equalizer is limited with Bluetooth but little difference.  My son's smaller pocket Jensen speaker has more bass for about the same price.  In fact my Google Home has much better sound and it is in desperate need of an equalizer adjustment.  With an $80 price marked down to $30 I had hopes for more but basically got what I paid for.
3,Looks nice was packaged good does not sound anything near what I was expecting. Almost no low frequency sound and anything higher than medium the sound is distorted. I paired it with a Alexa flex.
4,It does sound good for the price pretty loud the bass on the other hand is really not great so that's why i'm giving it a 4 star.
5,I love this speaker! I love all things pink and I've never found a speaker that can sound and LOOK great!!! Would buy again.
5,Speaker is very loud to be so small I love it
5,I am so glad I bought this speaker. It works brilliantly. I was worried about buying a wireless speaker -it just seemed like a pain to have to remember to charge it. But it's absolutely fantastic to be able to put this wherever I want no worry of plugging it in. Personally this was so that I could listen to podcasts while I shower clean house etc. but I think it's going to have tons more uses than I imagined. Great design super easy to use. I love it.
5,My first purchase from DOSS and it hasn’t been a regret yet. The item came in on time as expected and was packaged very carefully. I’ve been synching it with my iPhone listening to music or podcasts and it’s been great. Clear sound and a great bass to it to hear everything from my favorite bands to enthralling podcasts made better from the speaker. I would highly recommend to anyone wanting one for an affordable price.
5,Amazing quality and sound
4,Easy set up. Works well with decent sound quality.
5,For the price the quality is great. I got it for small apartment and the sound travels well through out
4,El sonido y lo rápido que se conecto al bluetooth
5,Bought for work we have a lot of noise whenever in the back at work (machinery yelling etc) and I bought these hoping I can listen to music while working and they work very well! Can still hear the music with all the noise around and the sound quality is great! Also I use it at home and I can hear it across house quite well so if u want a great little speaker I recomend this item!
5,Nice speaker. definitely exceeded expectations
5,Great product for a good price
2,I bought this speaker brand new on Amazon a few weeks ago and was really happy with the sound and ease of use. Eventually a dial tone sound would cut into my music/podcasts. I Looked at the manual to see if there was an explanation and nothing was mentioned so I looked online and saw that this was an issue for many other customers. The suggested solution was to fully charge it which is what I did for hours without using it but the tone still cut in. I guess my new speakers had a weak battery so I have sent it back in exchange for another. I'm giving this product one more chance but I have my concerns. To be continued...
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This is an amazing speaker for the price. I was surprised in how loud it goes and it so cute .
4,Bought this for my classroom as my kids enjoy listening to music when they’re working independently. Works really good. I even took it outdoors one day and it was really loud and played surprisingly well.
4,nice perfect
4,This is a nice compact bluetooth speaker. Sound quality is good for the money but not great.
5,Really love the speaker use it often
4,For such a small box the sound is pretty powerful. Use this in the bathroom while getting ready for work. It picks up streaming audio from my phone in the other room quite well.
5,Great sound long battery life connects to Bluetooth very quickly. Glad I purchased it.
5,This is an amazing little Bluetooth speaker. It has amazing sound quality and a great battery life. I highly recommend this product.
4,I like the size and now easy it is to carry. I dislike how quick the battery runs out.
5,I like the size and the color. It connects quickly and the sound is very good.
5,I received one for Christmas and loved it so much I bought one for my brother's birthday.  I also bought the case which is the perfect compliment.  My brother was overjoyed at the sound and the easy pairing ability.  Definitely recommended!
5,This was a gift for my teenage daughter the sound is loud enough to her liking... And I am not telling her every two minutes to turn down her music. this speaker is recommended for parents with teenage kids that like to play loud music LOL
5,This speaker changed my LIFE! It has a really great sound for the price and size. I'm so pleased with it. I only wish there was another way to turn up the volume.... I don't like how it stops whatever I am listening to when I've reached full volume just to tell me I've reached full volume... it's a small thing but an annoying small thing. Still not bad enough to take away a star though I REALLY love this!
3,I do not like this speaker no matter what device I connect it to after 10-20 mins it’s disconnects. I cannot keep it connected to any of my devices and it becomes very frustrating. I would not recommend to buy this speaker.
5,Love my tunes. Needed smart looking speaker with a well rounded sound spectrum (not tiny and shrill).  Has enough bass to make my oldies station sound excellent. Love it.
5,Attractive small speaker really delivers high quality sound. I've already used it to project movie audio from my laptop & music from my phone indoors & outside. No problems pairing Bluetooth.
2,The top is a touchscreen which makes this speaker  very annoying to use. You can't turn it off if your palm touches the touchscreen the power button on the back requires you hold it in it's not a physical power switch.  you have to fiddle with the circle to change the volume there's no knob.  The bass is great for a speaker of this size but it cannot be adjusted so you're stuck with it late at night.  It is durable though I'll grant them that.
5,The sound and battery are awesome i brought two
2,I'm amazed at the high reviews and a little disappointed because they were what motivated me to purchase 2 of these speakers. However immediately upon playing them I was disappointed with the sound quality. This was definitely another learning lesson of you get what you pay for. It looks nice and connect well. If you're looking for a box to just play noise and be louder than your phone or computer speakers then sure this might fit your needs.However if you want a rich clear quality sound from across the room this speaker will not do it. I played a variety of different songs at different volumes and was not satisfied with any. I'm no audio expert and don't know how to describe what I'm hearing but the sound is very shallow echo-like and rattly... On vocals with high notes the sound cracks and is not clear. It basically ruins good songs that I want to absorb myself in. I promptly returned these the next day and am buying 2 more speakers in the $75 range. Lesson learned...
3,I think it’s just ok.... great value. Got it on a lightning deal. Virtually impossible to use the Bluetooth microphone. Good build quality. The wrap around speaker grill vibrates at higher volume
5,Very nice little speaker with a big sound. Use it while in the pool. Thoroughly enjoy and the battery lasts a long time too.
2,So I ordered this as a cheap bluetooth solution before I could save up and buy a nicer one. Well for the price the sound it produces is fine. It's everything else that I do not like. The volume button is a touch wheel with no visual of physical feedbad so you have no idea if you are turning up your turning down your volume properly. This usually results in the volume suddenly spiking to uncomfortable levels. It can only connect one phone at a time which is again fine but I've never had a bluetooth device where you had to disconnect the previous phone in order to add a new one. It's not a huge problem but it is annoying. My biggest complaint is the low battery sound. It is loud and sounds a LOT like the emergency alert or amber alert sound and I HATE it. It scares me every time to the point where I don't like to leave the thing unplugged when I use it so I don't have to hear that awful sound. Please choose your sound effects more wisely.
5,for the price it is AWESOME. sound is really nice. charge life is perfect for outdoor use use it all day! the only downside is that once you pair it with your echo dot you have to manually disconnect it and make sure your echo dot is out of range when you turn it on or you can't use it with any other device. but not sure if that's an issue with echo or the speaker itself.
5,This is the third speaker I've bought. I got one for my wife for her work and she loved it. I decided to get one for myself for work and it's better then my Klein speaker. I had to get one for our golf cart we use camping. It works great. This is definitely the best bang for the buck.
4,This connects easily. It's easy to use. The sound is crisp but it's one small box so it's not great sound. For the money it's a good option. I keep it in the kitchen to listen to podcasts. For music it's not very fulfilling but in the background for a short time it's fine.
5,I have a JBL Flip that quit working when I purchased a new Note 8 (would not connect with the Note 8). I wanted a replacement speaker for the garage so I looked online and tried this one. I believe it was the advertised battery life that originally made my choice. But the sound from this unit eclipses the sound from the JBL Flip! And the controls for this unit are on top not hidden like the Flip.
5,I am a big fan of a competitive company starting with the first letter "B" and sounds like "hose".I can't stress enough how excellent the sound is on this speaker. Great low end along with full range including highs. I bought 4 of these and sold them to other guys on my construction job consisting of over 300 Union Workers.I insist it is the best speaker for your workplace or laying in bed with your iPad at night and watching a Netflix movie.
5,Very good sou d and I am impressed so far.  Easy to use and to set up
5,Love the sound quality and the design on the top which makes it easy to clean and use. When it starts to die I just wish the sound indicator wasn’t so aggressive.
4,Have not had a chance to use speaker very much.  Seems to be loud enough for all my needs. Nice color and easy to start up and use.
4,Overall awesome product! I’d say it’s Worth more than you pay for it. It’s perfect for getting ready :)
4,I liked it so much that I bought a second. The speaker is great and the build is very solid. Just a BIT too much overall bass or I would have given it 5 stars. If I could have gone to 4.5 I would have.
5,Just got it so time will tell if it holds up but sound quality and ability to connect with Bluetooth - very very nice.  Great value.
5,Great product for the price highly recommend..
3,I've had a Photive Cyren for roughly 2.5 years that had been subjected to too much rough handling over the years and finally started to give out. It was $15 and well worth the price. This Doss speaker comparatively is disappointing both in its sound quality (it's not as clear as some of the other speakers I've owned and tried) and connectivity has been a recurring problem (frequently loses connection). Otherwise it works okay (and the battery is solid) but the price point is too high when there are so many better speakers on Amazon.UPDATE:Adding a star for customer service. Doss refunded the purchase price and sent a new one in the mail. Very responsive.
5,I love this speaker!! It is perfect at the pool or in the garage when your cleaning!! The best purchase ever the sound is clear and crisp!! No issues at all!!
5,Really nice and well designed speaker. For a portable speaker the sound is very loud and the bass sounds pretty good. The battery lasts for a really long time. You can charge the battery and continue to use it at the same time which is nice. To turn up the volume you swivel your finger in a clockwise motion around the circle in the center and to lower it you move your finger counter clockwise. Overall I'm really satisfied with this speaker. Definitely a good purchase
5,Love this product .  I listen to books on tape on my studio and the sound is great!
5,Quede sorprendido la presentación 😱 1A. Y el sonido ni que decir. Es EXCELENTE. Nunca había escuchado esta marca.  Pero la recomiendo. 😊👏
2,Unit is very big bulky and the sound quality is not very good. Very little bass
5,For this little speaker it has good sound. And for the price you can’t go wrong. I would recommend.
5,Great speakers! We take them with us on all of our outings. Just wish it held a longer charge. It plays continuously for 2-3 hours before it gives us a warning.
5,Wow this is everything they say it is in the reviews.  It's easy to use pairs quickly sounds awesome and is small.  We have several JBL Extreme systems at work and they're great but don't quite pair so easily.  This sounds equally as great but the DOSS system isn't $200... though nor is it splashproof which isn't high on my priority list for a bluetooth speaker system.  I'm very happy with my purchase.
5,Took a while to set up!
5,This is a great speaker for almost anywhere. It's loud small enough to take places easy to connect easy to charge and it is over all a very good Bluetooth speaker. All controls on top work great and it works with my different USB chargers just fine. I love this speaker it's been working great and I've had it for about 4 months now. I hope this review helped and I hope you enjoy this speaker as much as I do! :)
3,One of the two speakers blew out after not even two months of daily use. Great sound quality up until then. Now I have to find a replacement speaker to solder into the the thing?!?!?! SMH
5,Sound quality is very good to be so small
2,This speaker appears well made and the sound is great for the price.  I have two concerns that may not bother others.1.  The touch lights on top are actually fairly bright and cannot be dimmed or disabled.  I wanted to use this in my bedroom but those bright lights are a non-starter. I've read other reviews that suggest turning the speaker upside down so the lights on the top do not show.  Do I really have to buy something and then turn it upside down?2.  I wanted this to pair to an echo dot.  It has an automatic turn off feature to save batteries.  This can be disabled by downloading a file copying it to an SD disk then inserting it into the speaker to update the firmware.  Now I need to get an SD card to do that.I'm disappointed in the lack of flexibility on firmware updates for use with Alexa and the constant lights.  Maybe I can use this in the garage but not what I expected.
5,One of the best Bluetooth speakers I have bought and believe me you I have purchased my fair share of Bluetooth speakers. I feel the sound quality on this Doss is amazing for its size. Connecting any Bluetooth device is simple and fast. This small device packs a punch! Also was perfect for our summer beach trips! The battery life is awesome!!
5,Esta bonito
5,Great sound from a little box!  The only (minor) issue I’ve had is getting it connected to my phone on occasion. When that does happen I just delete it and repair and it connects right away. Other than that it works great and plays extremely well.
5,This sound that comes from this device is great!  We use it at the beach at outdoor events and around the house.
5,Sounds clear and loud. Bass is okay for this little speaker not distorted. Smaller than I thought but that's good. Better than I expected for the price. Good buy
5,im not a discerning listener but it really is a great speaker. can blast across 1500sf very clearly.easy setup. nice look.
5,I rarely give such enthusiastic reviews but this speaker operates superbly with my iPhone via Bluetooth.  Quality of sound is good ease of understanding modes and volume excellent and I presume battery life is very good also. I have no cons to complain about and give my recommendation without reservation.  I might add that price is very  very good for what you get.
5,I bought this to help amplify my TV that is not Bluetooth but a HDTV Flat Screen...works wonderful. I wanted sound quality and clarity....not loud noise. This never produces understanding I think of being under water you hear shouting from above but its not clear.  This is adjustable and easy to install. I have amble sound w/o blasting my neighbors or my dogs ears.Would and have recommended this to family and friends.
3,It has signs of use and It suppose to be new. So now I’m kinda confused about it. Also didn’t have any plastic protecting it🤦🏾‍♀️
5,Great little power boxSound is great connection with Bluetooth is easy and smooth and price was very attractive
5,It is just great for a small speaker. Play it all the time.
5,This was a purchase I went back-and-forth on because I hadn’t heard of the name and the price was so low. I am SO glad I took the chance! This little speaker is awesome! Sound quality is fantastic and the connectivity is great ~ I can have my iPhone in another room with clear crackle-free sound.  A definite recommendation!
5,We have purchased two of these and I couldn't be happier!  The sound quality is great!  I would highly recommend this speaker!
4,Awesome little speaker doesn't have a whole lot of bass but it sounds good  good for a small room!
5,Sound quality is good. Easy to connect to my phone and easy to use.
5,Great buy and great price. This has a super long battery life and it sounds great. The only downside is the volume controls which are a little hard to get the hang of but that's not really a deal breaker for me. I ended buying another in a different color because I loved it so much. It's easy to pair with my phone and my tablet. The AUX cord is great too. Don't hesitate to buy it this really is a good buy.
5,I absolutely love this product it takes the place of a home stereo system just the right amount of sound perfect clarity I bought one for the front of my house the back of my house and my bathroom thank you for making a great product.
4,i still hate the newer version but i liked this one a lot
5,Works well especially for the price. The bass is even pretty good and is enough for my teenage son. Would recommend.
5,I just received this speaker a couple days. It's what I needed. I'm a teacher and although I'm not in a classroom right now this is gonna be really helpful for my morning routines. :)
5,Very happy with this purchase.  Was well rated on comparing Bluetooth site
2,The sound quality was horrible. It kept disconnecting from Bluetooth. I guess that's what you get from a cheap speaker
4,Good sound and it can get loud if you want it to.  It has an micro SD slot and 3.5mm jack input as well.  The volume control is usable but simple buttons would have been nicer.  The voice used to say the speaker is on and other notifications seems to have misunderstood some words in translation.  Kind of funny but not unintelligible.
5,this speaker is really good ..unfortunately I though it would connect to Amazon blue dot via blue tooth but it doesn't  it only connect with blue dot via cable which makes it a waste of money for  me ..as I never use my phone or tablet for music..i guess it will make it a  nice present for someone else around xmas....having said that the product is of really good quality and sound is great . !!
5,Just got it today and man it is off the hook. Sounds crisp and clear. The bass is crazy. Don’t let the size fool you.
5,Best Bluetooth speaker ever!!! It’s so easy to connect and the sound is amazing! You get so much sound from this little speaker!
5,We were looking for something that would easily fit on a shelf that we could both link via blue tooth and also hook up to our TV.  Something like the BOSE would have been clearer but also about 10x the price.  For our needs this was a steal and is working so well.  Clear sound plenty of volume.  Just great.
5,This speaker is great! It gets plenty loud and we've had zero connectivity issues (or issues otherwise). My husband uses it when he's working outside and has taken it golfing. He loves it!
5,Great bold sound for on the go music
5,I like the small size and was pleasantly surprised T the sound quality.
5,I bought this to replace one I bought somewhere else (not the same speaker) and I love it!! It has great sound and it works great for calls music everything!!
5,This speaker is great and it’s lasted for a year maybe even longer. I’m just sad that it’s stop working it suddenly stops charging. I tried so many usb even the one it came with nothing works.
4,Excelente sonido no la he usado mucho así que ni se la durabilidad de la pila. El tamaño es ideal para llevarla en los paseos
5,Update: customer service contacted me and replaced the speaker that was skipping songa. New device works great.------It is extremely annoying that this speaker skips songs on its own. Cannot listen to anything.It worked fine for a bit but now its useless. When it worked fine it was decent sound for price.If it wasnt for the skipping i would have given 5 stars.
5,I bought this speaker a year ago and it’s still going strong. Great sound and battery life. Easy to connect with wifi so what's not to like?  Good value and I would highly recommend it.
3,The audio quality is Not as good as advertised and expected.The device works very nice until the bass comes in... once this happens the mids and highs loose a lot of volume just like if the amplifier didn’t have enough output power to feed the drivers and the bass simultaneously also the bass is by far not as deep as expected.If you consider you spent 20 bucks for it instead of 200 for a Bose system is still a good purchase just don’t get too excited about it.The best feature is the tactile function and how it looks.
4,This was a great little speaker only problem I had with it was its inability to connect two or more easily
4,Plenty loud for my needs! Not going to shake your house. Sounds clear. Overall cannot beat the price for a really good portable speaker!
4,Decent sound for the size but still not as full as I'd hoped. After I get used to it for a few minutes it's pretty good! Very easy to pair with devices and very portable. I paid $39 on sale and feel like that's a good value but i may have returned it if I paid full price.
5,I love this speaker so much! It’s very loud and I like how the volume feature is set up. I’m thinking about getting more to give to my family as gifts because everyone who sees in action asks me where I got it.
5,Good quality
5,This is a great little speaker! I bought one a year ago and just bought this red one to take out to the work zone. Pairs to my phone within seconds the battery lasts a long time and the sound quality is excellent. Love it.
4,Occasionally skips to the nest song. I use it in the bathroom and water appears to be bad for the touch controls.  This is my second unit as the first one would not finish a song before skipping to the next one.
5,WOW bought this for use in my garage when working on car Easy set up Quick Bluetooth connection to iPhone and padSpeaker is compact and quick to chargeSound is excellent for the price and volume is  surprisingly loud This is ideal for its intended use !!  Obviously not for high definition audio. Great portable speaker
5,I liked it very much it is easy to use and the sound is crisp and enough for the use I give it.
5,Really good sound especially when placed on a large hard surface like a counter top. Bass is great too. I rarely turn the volume all the way up because it can get pretty loud pretty easily. Definitely worth the money
5,I love this speaker the build quality is excellent. Definitely durable I'm impressed with the sound as well. The touch controls are pretty neat and a nice addition to the speaker. I did have minor issues with the wireless connection to speaker but customer service was quick to assist with the problem. If you're looking for a relatively cheap speaker start with this one it's worth the money.
5,Was surprised of how durable this thing was built when unboxing it. Color is beautiful and loved the way the buttons were made. Battery life is great. Will be buying some more for around the house.A little over a year and a half later Speaker still works perfect and has been dropped and beaten up. Still very pleased and also pleased with the two other that we have purchased.
5,Love this little speaker sounds great connectivity easy battery live good
4,Great speaker very loud I can hear it from a far distance just the battery doesnt last to long I use it while cleaning the house  and it serves its purpose
5,I love the sound quality and the battery life! Best little portable speaker I've ever purchased.
5,I bought this as a gift for a family member. She uses it in her bedroom or in the living room.Easy to use just plug in the cord to ipod or connect over Bluetooth and can easily play your music aloud. Very easy to store or set on a shelf out of the way.Fast shipping good packaging and no damage to the item.Thank you!
4,Speaker sound quality is good but it does not deliver as much of the bass as I want to hear.
5,For a little speaker the sound quality is amazing. It will have great sound across a pool or  can be used in a personal space without bothering others.Connectivity is almost immediate.
5,This is easy to use and reliable. Only had it running about 10 day so far so I cannot speak to the longevity of it yet but it was easy to set up and looks good in my daughter's bedroom. We use it all night long for her sleep noise and play music from it periodically during the day.
5,I have to admit that I wasn't expecting a whole lot when I ordered this speaker. But I've been pleasantly surprised by its apparently solid construction and by the quality of the sound. I wanted something small and light enough to take hiking/camping and for some tunes at the beach. So far it's been just great and I'm glad to have it. Only time will speak to its longevity; however at this price point it's not much of a gamble. Recommended.
5,I wound up not using the aux cable supplied because it seemed the one I had played the sound better. I used the speaker in a classroom of twenty loud 2 year olds who want to dance and it played well. I use my iPod so it is compatible and the sound was loud and clear enough the kids were able to hear and follow the songs I played.
5,I was skeptical of this but for the price and size I think this would be hard to beat. We plugged it into our 22" Samsung HDTV in our kitchen which has horrible built in speakers and this is a vast improvement. That said you should be realistic about your expectations. This is not a high end audio device but if you are looking for a portable speaker system to go with your phone or tablet or even to use it as we are it is pretty impressive.
5,This speaker sounds great for what I needed it for! Music through my tablet through bluetooth sounds just right! Great speaker great price!
5,Initially I was disappointed - the unit worked but then stopped holding a charge within a couple of months of purchasing it. The company was very responsive to my review comments and sent a new speaker to replace the one that did not function. I've now had the replacement speaker for a couple of months and it's working great. For the size of the unit and price I am very happy with the sound quality and the length of time that it holds a charge.
5,This is smaller than I expected but I also didn't read carefully. Nonetheless the sound is quality so I have no complaints. Was easy to connect. I like that you can adjust volume by touching blue circle light dial and advance song selection without having to mess around with your phone. Excellent buy!
5,Excellent item. Can now participate in meetings at work easily.
5,Pleasantly SURPRISED.  I own a BOSE Soundlink (at work) and waned another one for the house then saw this one.  Because of the high reviews  I thought I'd give it a shot for under $40. This thing is NOT a Bose but a VERY close second and the battery life is unreal!  Since I purchased this thing this past spring I've only had to recharge it TWICE. Would definitely purchase again.  Great product!  ;)
5,Very decent sound quality can’t tell much difference between this one and one JLB Bluetooth speaker.
5,We got this to use for work events and is perfect. We use it for soft relaxing music holiday events and to jam out on. It's super easy to connect your smart phone or tablet to control and use your Spotify iHeart radio YouTube or phone music playlist. Just be careful of taking these devices too far away from each other especially in an office building and interference because it will cause the playback to stutter due to loss of connectivity to the player source.
5,Does what it needs to do for the price
4,Sounds pretty good especially for the price (bought it on Prime Day). It’s very loud and doesn’t lose too much of the quality if you decide to blast it!
4,Works great
4,Audio quality is clear even at higher volumes. It of course doesn't do justice to music like decent sound system or top-notch headphones but it's absolutely perfect for podcasts. I don't think you could ask for more given the price.
4,Overall a very good product for the price.  Sound quality is good  the only issue that I have had is that sometimes it is difficult to connect to Bluetooth.
5,For this price I don't think you might get a Soundbox like this one: stylish minimalist and well built as an Apple product. Surprising great bass for this small size.
5,I have always been a little disappointed with the sound quality of portable speakers. This is the first one I’ve been excited about. The volume and quality is great!
5,This speaker is made very well its loud louder than my altec . I played music for 6 hours and it still had a little charge.  It has an sd card slot to play music with  it has bluetooth aux cord come9 with it. And its touch sensitive like a phone. The design is is futuristic.  You can't go wrong with this speaker.
5,I really like this speaker. It is easier to use than some other I have had. Like the option of Bluetooth phones jack and micro SD. It is a bit bigger and heavier than the Anchor Sound Core and Amazon Basics that I also have but still easy to carry around in one hand. I found on Deal of the Day for $23.97. Can't beat that. Comes with USP cord audio cable and carrying bag. Would buy again.
4,Not much negative to say. Quality is better than others I have at the same price.
4,we’ve had this speaker for a few months now and have had no problems with it operationally. We never use the phone call features so I can’t comment on that. It has decent quality sound for a tiny Bluetooth speaker holds a charge for a long amount of time and easy to operate.
5,I love this speaker.  Small great sound easy to control.  I use to to in connection with my cell phone.  The range is good although it is substantially reduced when you're a room or 2 away.  I plan to buy more of them to spread them throughout the house so that I'll have high quality sound as I move from room to room.
5,It's loud. Just do not expect bass. Its battery life is great. Normally use this for an hour 4 days a week when i play catch with my dog. I just throw on a podcast and have fun with my dog. I have not charged it since its initial charge. Its been 2 months.
4,Worth for the money. The sound quality is good does not match other expensive Bluetooth speakers
5,Sounds awesome and is loud with a good amount of bass.
5,This speaker has been great.  The connectivity is good and the sound quality is perfect for its size.  Although it’s not a “ruggedized” speaker it’s survived a few spills out of the golf cart and still is working like a champ!
4,I am old school. I need it deep bass. This is to mid range from my old hippie ears.
5,A friend has one that they let me borrow. I loved it so much I bought my sled one and plan on giving more as gifts. For as small as it is the sound is amazing quality is great and the range is awesome! Worth the buy love it and I don’t even have mine yet!😂😂😂
5,This speaker is amazing.  The sound that comes out of this is unbelievable. I absolutely love it. And it stays charged for a long time. I charged it one time a month ago & it's still almost fully charged. I like the way the battery level shows on my phone so I'll know when it needs to be charged again. And who knows how long that'll be.  It's just awesome.
5,I received this today and couldn't wait to try it out !!! It sounds as good as a regular stereo without all the wires and hassle !!! I absolutely love it!!!
5,I am really impressed for the price it is pretty loud and sound quality is good it got a good amount of bass for the size and the battery life is also amazing I get over 4 hours playing at mid volume.
3,I bought this so I can use it with a micro SD card and it performs well in that aspect. However the bluetooth is very lacking when compared to other known brands. Every time I walk into the next room it immediatley becomes choppy and then disconnects which is something I do not experience with my older bluetooth speakers. With my older bluetooth speakers (Logitech Oontz) I'm able to go two rooms over and never lose a connection. Sound is crisp though and not heavy on the bass.It gets 3 due to the poor bluetooth connection.
5,Perfect for my desk at work.  I can stream all week every day and only charge it once.
5,Easy to set up. Works very well. Perfect size and unobtrusive. Use it when I am cooking or washing dishes. Highly recommend.
4,For the price and the size this thing sounds GREAT!!! It's perfect for a medium sized room or to use outside. The touch controls on top look nice. They light up white and blue. It looks and sounds like it should cost more. I was very happy with this product from the second I opened it up!
5,The sound is amazing
5,Sound quality is great Bluetooth connectivity is functioning well. Well worth it for the price.
5,Honestly considering this is the best value speaker I could find it's really nice. I think the sound is good and it's easy to use. I use it for my record player as I'm too broke to afford a nice speaker right now.
5,Of the 5 different portable bluetooth speakers and DOSS Wireless is the best. It beat out the others in clarity of sound across all level and has better bass. I systematically tested each speaker with the the same classical metal and hip-hop songs. List of speakers is below.SHARKK® Speaker Boombox Bluetooth Speakers- https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ES2BQ7M/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1Polaris V8 - 9W(4.5W X 2) Portable Bluetooth Speaker - https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MQDBRMO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1DKnight Big MagicBox Bluetooth 4.0 Portable Wireless speaker - https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01E318R1K/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1Jawbone Mini Jambox Wireless Bluetooth Speaker - https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DVKORXC/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1SHARKK® Speaker Boombox Bluetooth Speakers - https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ES2BQ7M/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
5,Good speaker! Sounds good and last pretty long on one charge. Being square it isn't the easiest to stuff into a bag that's roundMine died after 2 years of hard use (work in a bakery so lots of flour and oil sprays  and heat and being dropped or brushed off a table a lot) just stopped charging but would still recommend this speaker!
2,I purchased this to set on my desk at work and listen to the radio quietly it does its job for that.  But connecting it every morning or every time I stop using it for 10-15 minutes is extremely noisy.  First there is a noise when turning it on that is very distracting to others but when it actually pairing to my phone I'm pretty sure people outside the building can hear it.  Not sure why the pairing noise needed to be that loud.  I literally have to cover top with my hands and force the front into my stomach and bottom into my legs just to mute the noise enough so others are not annoyed with me at work.  If I walk away out of range with my phone when I come back within range it automatically pairs up and makes the same obnoxious noise.  If I had known how loud the power on and pairing feature noises would be I would definitely have chosen a different speaker.
5,My mind was blown at how good this speaker turned out to be. I did not have high expectations at all for the price but holy crap! I'm currently using this as my main source of music in my truck while doing a restore on it. Even with the big mud tires no carpet and loud exhaust the speaker is still able to play over it all! 6/5 stars!
4,The box plays ok.. but thought it would play louder... I tried playing the sd card and it won't work... is there another option
5,I got this for my husband (a complete and total music & gadget snob) without his input. That's a pretty big gamble but it paid off. He takes this thing EVERYWHERE.It has great sound is easy to use charges quickly (just plug into your computer or into a USB adapter straight into the wall.)We use it while working out while cooking while sitting around the fire pit while camping at the beach etc. It's worked great every single time.This is now going on my "top gifts" list!
5,The sound is better than I expected and it works smoothly and flawlessly. I'm impressed! Wish I had bought this sooner -- I have more music and podcasts in my life particularly when working in the garage or yard. I use it with my iPhone 7 Plus -- it connects smoothly and quickly every time.
5,I really love how the display is set up! It easily adjusts the volume and I am happy to say that i didn't gave to press super hard to get it to do anything. Would definitely recommend this speaker! It has a nice smooth sleek design and seems to be great quality!
1,This speaker did not deliver it is very low quality speakers baffles and has little to no bass whatsoever
5,It's EVERYTHING it says it was. The sound range everything. Its volume is perfect! I love it and I'm sure you will too.
4,Great product for the price. A little on the heavy side but the sound quality is good.
5,Se escucha perfectamente se conecta fácil al bluetooth  y dura la bateria
5,This is perfect for our bathroom.  The sound is very clear while singing in the shower.
5,Darling where have you been all my life? I'm in love with this little speaker.The sound is unbelievable. I was in a sad mood and this little speaker has me doing cartwheels in my kitchen!!!  I'm 57 yrs young by the way. Get this speaker please!!!!!!
5,I love this speaker I was looking for a speaker with great sound quality that I can travel with and this is by far one of the best electronic purchases ever.
5,I like the convenience it has and I mostly use it for work.
5,I actually use it to listen to podcasts in my car since my stereo isn't working.  Fits into narrow spaces including the cupholder.  More than enough sound for its size even when traveling on the interstate.  Long battery life means I don't have to recharge it for several trips.  So on the off chance you're like me then get this speaker.
5,Drops out if left without motion or sound for  15 minutes or so. Requires walking across the room to get close to TV for merging
3,I’ve had mine for about a year now it worked great at first but after a few weeks it started skipping songs constantly. It was skipping them on its own. Other than the sounds and connectivity was very good.
5,Looks good the sound is really good from a non-music expert perspective. Works great in a hot bathroom too if I want to use it while I'm in the shower the moisture hasn't seemed to cause any issues. Has also survived two falls off a mantle over 5 feet high face first onto the hardwood floor with no dents or noticeable issues in sound quality. Does vibrate off surfaces so don't put it on the edge.
5,This product has a good sound quality compare to its price. The DOSS Touch Wireless Bluetooth V4.0 has a nice finished and its material quality is much better than others with the same price at least the one I had. I would like to see if it was a little bit more powerful. I recommend it.
5,Came packaged nicely....tho I’ve unboxed it.....looks exactly as portrayed. The sound is good and the Bluetooth connects easily. I was looking for a small speaker that’s loud and this does the trick for me....it’s a little heavy for anyone looking for something light.
5,it is easy to use. I bought two more for my friends.
5,Awesome affordable speaker. Easy and portable projects an amazing sound. The waterproof bag has proven extremely useful when visiting the beach. You will not be disappointed with this purchase.I even had a small issue with the charging cable after much use. Costumer service was impeccable friendly and fast to respond. I was still under warranty and they didn’t hesitate to fix my problem with new device. I happy recommend this product as well has the company.
5,I’m impressed with the sound quality and amplification power of such a small box.
5,Being a standard Classic iPod user with a nice small Bose boom box speakers we're only now considering using Blutooth on iPhones or iPad. So not wanting to invest great sums (like $200 for Bose BT) I read the DOSS reviews to give it a try. What a wonder. Music seems to fill our bedroom (where we listen each night mostly to Halpern soothers). Very happy and highly recommend.
4,Wonderful it has not fail in any aspect so far.. it only got 4 star because there is no such thing as perfect also if it had a radio then it would get 4.5 but for what I bout it for it's great.
4,Good sound. Paired with my iPhone almost instantly. Good battery life.  Sound is not as strong or loud as I hoped and expected. Volume control is kind of strange and hard to get used to. But overall a good product and excellent value. Not a Bose but $60 less than a similar Bose. I'd buy it again
5,This little speaker is amazing! Such a great price and amazing sound and quality
4,Great Bluetooth speaker and loud very happy with it
5,Easy connectivity volume control is a little wonky but works every time. For the money this thing rocks! Loud beautiful highs ok lows but don't expect much for 20ish dollars.  Glad I bought it! It was just for cleaning and listening to some good progressive metal =p
5,All good
5,Excellent sound quality
5,Es el segundo que compro de la misma marca me encanta como se escucha. Lindo diseño comodo de usar
2,I own two but have had problems with both and no help from the company. Sound quality power and flexibility are good for the size and price. One worked perfectly for about a year but stopped connecting via Bluetooth. The other one also worked fine for about 6 months but now times out every 15 minutes so it has to be turned on every 15 minutes. Trying to contact the company got no results whatsoever. I do NOT recomment this product or this company.
4,It works great for the price and size of it. Only issue I had with the thing was that when it gets to the low battery it constantly reminds you every 20 or so seconds even though it has about 10 more minutes of use. Besides that; great battery life charge time build quality and sound quality is above it's price tag.
5,Excelente altavoz sonido potente y claro y buena conexión al principio dudaba mucho por la marca; pero no me decepcionó para nada. Es de lo mejor que puedes encontrar a ese precio.
5,It’s really easy to use and connect with Bluetooth and has a great sound quality!
5,So i have a workshop in my garage and I set up a TV (folding down from the ceiling when I want to use it) there for streaming.  In the garage sound is terrible with the default speakers in the TV so I rigged this up to work as a mini soundbar and it is great!  I can't recommend this enough for that.
2,I've been struggling with these speakers for over a year and they are WAY too glitchy! I use them with my alexa dots and at least once a week I have to disconnect and reconnect them because they pop in and out. We called tech support but they just said to disconnect them and reconnect them EVERY time they start popping. I don't want to fuss with all that mess every time I want to listen to music.
5,It's just awesome
5,For the price of this the quality is really good. I haven't used it enough to test the battery life. But the bluetooth is really good. I haven't had any issues with it disconnecting and you can even go fairly far with your device.
3,I read other reviews of satisfied customers so I took a chance. Sadly the sound in tinny and when you barely increase the volume it buzzes and sounds terrible.
5,It's everything I was looking for I drive a paratransit type bus  and I was looking for a compact blue tooth speaker with clarity and it serve that purpose for sure.  The words are clear  the bass is good and the sound is perfect ! Especially for the price . I can't keep it turned up to the max cause it covers to much space and is to loud for the space I occupy ! You will be doing your self a favor if u make this purchase seriously
3,It’s important to note that while this is a perfectly fine toy speaker and works well and is quite good for the cost it does not come anywhere remotely near the volume or bass response of a refined speaker such as Bose Soundlink Mini or JBL Charge 3. Don’t expect to open the box and be wowed by the sound - it is OK and good for the price. It’s not a case of “they’re all made in the same factory anyway” the quality of high end speakers really is much better and that is reflected in their exhorbitant cost.
5,When I orderd this unit I made sure I read the reviews and most were good for this particular unit. I've added my ratings of 5 stars becuse this little unit amazed me. It was quuck to setup and the sound was better than expected. I use it in my bathroom  and because of the acoustics it sounded really good when streaming my music. The battery last long depend on how you use it but Ive gone a couple of weeks without charging.
5,Very pleased with this speaker. Easy to use. Great sound
5,I have purchased other bluetooth speakers with high reviews and not happy with the sound quality. I finally found this speaker and WOW! The sound is amazing! Very easy to set up excellent battery life and beautiful sound quality!
5,This comes in handy when I don't feel like using earbuds but want to keep the noise down at night. I like having the volume control so I can back it off when a program gets to a dramatic moment and the producers think they need to impress us by cranking the sound track up to eleven. This volume control seems to respond more quickly than pushing a "down volume" button and waiting for the device to respond.
5,Blown away by the bass all u need is a good player and wow it player better than JBL charge
4,Used at night when my phone was charging.  Sound was great even at low volume.
5,The sound is clear and the Bluetooth is easy to connect and battery life is very good
3,Not the best but for the price it's a good deal. The sound is a little bit tin can but it's better than others that are comparable to this price.
5,Paired easy works as discribed.
4,Good speaker. Not anything fancy but it's not the worst out there either.
5,Love it :) my last bluetooth speaker disconnected after 15 seconds if I was on a phone call. This one stays connected for awhile with no activity and can even answer your phone calls!!
5,I am so pleased with this speaker! I purchased it in white. I find the sound quality is great for it's size and the genre of music I prefer. The speaker feels solid and substantial. The top controls are back lit in bright blue and very user friendly. It prefty much disappears into the background. I highly recommend this speaker for both the sound and the price.
4,Seems to be good quality. Hated they say d would ship by a certain day and did not. Did not.
4,So far so good I have only used it three times but it has worked great every time.
3,Sound clarity could be better and I wish you could control the volume. I like to listen to my music louder outside.
5,I bought this speaker because I have hearing difficulties. I use it with my television so the television doesn’t have to be so loud it bothers others in the house. It works very well for this purpose. The only thing I have trouble with is keeping it paired to the television. If I turn the speaker off I have to pair it each time even though I have it set up with a clear line of sight.
4,A mi Doss Soudbox le faltó la bolsa para viaje no vino en mi pedido
5,Bought this BT Speaker for my gf (actually her 2ND DOSS... Her mom ended up using the first one lol) She LOVES the sound appearance and the quality of it...!!!
5,This little speaker knocks like a club very loud and powerful
5,We have been using the speaker non-stop since it arrived and was fully charge.  The sound quality is deceptively good for a device this small and the ability to use the SoundBox as a speaker/mic with my cell phone is an added plus.  The battery life on a full charge has lasted us a full day without issue as well.This is the rare device that I can fully recommend and will probably purchase more of for gifts.
5,I broke my son's soeaker and bought this as a replacement.  He paid $40 for his old speaker. This one was a little less but blew that other speaker OUT OF THE WATER. Can't speak to battery life yet.  Have only had it a few days.
5,I think this speaker is perfect. Loud for the size I bought this to use while I’m in my pool and it works great. Battery seems to last about 6 hours if you play it on Bluetooth and the volume all the way up which is wonderful enough time while I’m in the pool. Bluetooth works from a pretty far distance also.
5,Great price great sound! I’ve purchased many BT speakers and this is by far the best!
4,This is an awesome speaker especially for the price! Could use a bit better bass but it’s there! I’ve never been a fan of speakers that are all treble and no balance but this is definitely not the case. It’s great!
5,El sonido me gusto muchoTenia una bocina Bose y la calidad de sonido de esta no tiene nada que envidiarle a Bose incluso me atreveria q es mejor
5,This is a really nice speaker.  Great sound.  It is a nice size and well made.
5,The speaker worked fine for a few weeks and then it got much quieter. The Hi-Def audio cord didn't work either it mad the sound worse when plugged in!  Will not buy again! Just another knockoff.EDIT: The company after hearing my feedback responded quickly and professionally about my concerns. They sent me a replacement quickly and tested it personally before sending it. I appreciate the dedication to costumer service. Great Job!
5,Great sounds
3,I wasn't expecting great highs and lows with an inexpensive speaker. However I would have spent more on a better product knowing what I know now. Bass often is too much for this little guy to handle. Also it cuts out frequently which is distracting when listening to music or watching a movie on my tablet.I noticed other reviewers saying this speaker works well with their Echo Dot or Alexa. It may be best suited for that as opposed to music or movies when sound quality is important.Overall it works. Pairs easily with my devices and has decent battery life. It's not bad for the price I suppose.
5,This baby is bad loud enough to hear it all thru my house. I love this speaker it also has a really good bass on it. Buy this Again? Hell yea love this.I got this months ago just thought I’ll review it now. Great product guys.
5,It was a gift for my granddaughter and she's very into true sound. She's 19 years old and she knows about that sort of thing and she's very happy with it. It's small and powerful  and it fills the room. Also great price. I'll eventually get another one cause she spends part of her time (now that school has started) at her grandfather's house and she takes it with her.
3,Sound is fine.  For me the product is difficult to use for these reasons:1.  On/Off requires pressing and holding a tiny button on the back of the unit a real pain.  Difficult to operate normally but with my arthritis damn near impossible.2.  When it turns on or off it makes a series of loud and uncomfortable tones which are not adjustable in volume.  Not a problem for the user but very disturbing for others within earshot especially if they are sleeping.Sadlly I was looking forward to liking this product but I must return it.
5,I purchased this speaker for my teenage son for Xmas and he loves it! My daughter has a Boze speaker and this seriously is close if not as good as a Boze. For the price you can't beat it!! Sound is awesome the volume is great and the quality is amazing. Battery life is pretty good too. I'm a very happy customer and would totally recommend.
5,Connects fast! Sounds good! So pleased with this purchase!
4,This little speaker is awesome! Just like other reviews I read you're getting what you pay for. This speaker plays music loud enough for it to be heard all over my 2 story house and loud enough for me to have brought it to a camping ground at a country concert and for my friends to enjoy!
5,My television developed a buzz in the speaker and this (paired with my AppleTV) made a fine replacement. Sounds better than the TV did!
4,I had one that wouldn't charge after a few months.  I wrote to Amazon and they sent me a brand new one.  Very happy.
3,Speaker puts out great quality sound but somehow speaker blew out and now it rattles so I need a new one.  If the speaker can’t can’t handle the volume they need to make it better
4,Difficulty To Adjust Volume Sometimes With This 'Touch/Slide' Feature... It's Rather Touchy! Otherwise A Rather Nice Device!
5,Best sound quality I've ever had in a Bluetooth speaker!
5,Bought this on a lightning deal on a whim for $20 something. Bought it to play my Audible books when doing chores in the house. Was surprised at how well the sound is. Battery life is phenomenal. Good connectivity. Quite pleased overall. 4.5 stars
5,This thing is AMAZING!  Very loud clear base and treble.  I was surprised at how good this thing sounds.  If you have an EQ app on your device it reproduces perfectly!  Just make sure you keep the rubber pads on the bottom clean.  Otherwise it will crawl all over your desk! By the way this thing stinks badly the first few hours after charging.  It's a burn-in thing I guess.
5,I use this bluetooth speaker to listen to podcast. For it's size it sounds very good.
5,Sound quality is great! Easy to connect and the battery lasts quite a while if fully charged. Have had zero issues or complaints. Very happy with it.
5,Great little speaker. Easy to install and pair with my Echo Dot - and I am somewhat computer/electronics challenged. This was super easy. It will charge in a few hours and the charge can last about 12 depending on how much you use it etc. I keep it plugged in and only use the battery for when I have no electric outlet. Sound is great and loud. For the price this is the speaker to buy!
5,Super Value!  I've gotten my money's worth on this thing time an time again.  Great sound and durable. I take it to the beach hiking BBQs etc. In and out of the rain.  This speaker can fill a large room or the yard.  I never have it maxed because it'd simply be too loud.  My housemate has a swanky $150.00+ portable speaker that's collecting dust because this is the go-to!
5,Tremendous value. Great sound! I am very impressed with this wireless speaker. I bought it primarily for classic radio but find music more than adequate.  I recommend this little but powerful speaker.
4,The sound was great but the speakers blew out after 3 weeks and I wasn't really playing anything especially loud.Edit: Changed from a 2 star to a 4 because these guys sent me a new speaker after reading my review I assume.  Well done customer service.
4,Purchased for desk at work. Works well for quiet listening and compact for minimal foot print.
4,I love this little speaker. However it arrived with what seems like a loose connection inside causing the sound to flicker if moved. I didn't worry about it since it's something that wouldn't be moved when you are listening anyway. Now it's sometimes flickering even without being moved. I've missed the return date by a few days so it seems I'll have to put up with it.
4,I just returned my Echo and left this in my room. I used this with Echo to streaming music from Pandora. However I thought it is also easy for me to just connect my cell phone with this speaker and streaming music. It works pretty well. I could say this speaker kind of focus on bass but not so good for voice.
5,Awesome product!  Highly recommended!Thank you! 😊
4,This is a great speaker for the money. I was at a friends listening to a more expensive one and yes – the sound is a little better. But it cost twice as much. Very happy with this  👍
4,I like this thing a lot. My only complaint is that for me the battery life is nowhere near as advertised and I got the white version which chipped VERY quickly. Luckily I'm someone who doesn't care much for things always looking package-new but to others this may be a concern.
4,Works really well plugged in with speaker cable. Nice loud sound however on Bluetooth (at least with my laptop) had some interference whenever it or the laptop got moved around. Specifically the sound would cut out and the audio actually lags behind if watching a show. Besides that fairly happy with my purchase!
5,This is a great little speaker. I am surprised how nice it is given that it’s not expensive. Sounds great easy Bluetooth hookup overall very pleased.
4,Not real load but sounds good looks good.
4,Pretty good but battery is dead after a little use
5,This is a great little speaker for the price. Arrived quickly and  was easy to hook up blue tooth. I would buy again.
4,This product meets my use requirements. its portable and puts out good sound.
5,Amazingly impressed !!
4,So far so good.
4,I enjoyed this bluetooth speaker the audio was well balanced and was given to a friend as a gift. They enjoyed it and the sound was enough to host a little gathering of people The touchscreen on the speaker adds to the device giving it a premium look and feel.
5,This speaker is fantastic. Great volume and sound quality. Have bought 2 of these and are worth every penny! Would I recommend? Absolutely!
5,This is really a great speaker with great sound and it was not costly.
5,Like everyone else - I LOVE IT !!  It's nice looking great audio quality lightweight voice prompts for input micro SD card input bluetooth (connects flawlessly) Long lasting battery charge take it everywhere and anywhere in your house !!!  Volume control takes some getting used to.  Looks as sleek and polished as an apple product !!!  I am in the process of making up micro sd cards for different music collections.Well worth the money.... actually worth much more !!
5,Good sound easy to set up reasonable price.
5,This is amazing for the price! We can use it outside inside and it’s not because it hold a great charge
3,Great with the ability to use a SD card as well as bluetooth and AUX cable. But bass is poor. Not a very powerful speaker.
5,OMG!!!!! This is AWESOME! My husband and I live music. The other Bluetooth small speakers we have are ok for close proximity. But this little soundbox delivers excellent clarity and covers our 2000 sq ft home no problem! Well made! Well packaged! Unbeatable price!! Very chic! I bought it for him but we will be sharing this gem! I can not say enough about this wireless sound box! Would make an impressive gift! My husband was very impressed! House will be filled with clear loud Christmas music!
5,Great sound quality for a small speaker touch controls are really responsive  and battery life last a long time
5,It’s better than both my other speakers one is an 80$ sony speaker and the other is a jbl pulse for 120$ this speaker is louder and battery lasts way longer. Wish I hadn’t wasted my money in the other ones.
5,Love it I bought this for my desk top PC my play list is on media player wanted to be able to listen to my music out on my porch about 25 feet from PC. It paired easily to blue tooth and held signal out on porch. Very pleased with it recommend it highly. Sound is best quality i have heard from a portable speaker.
3,I bragged to people about this great little speaker. I used it all the time all over my yard shop back porch kitchen. I loved it. All past tense. One year in it stopped working. Now I am sad and looking for another speaker. Unfortunately won’t be buying another Doss
5,This speaker puts out a lot of volume for such a small enclosure. The audio range is better than I expected - good midrange for vocals not tinny. I haven't paid close attention to the battery life but I'd estimate it in the 30 hour range. Bluetooth connects easily every time. MP3 files stored on a micro SD card played well but I wasn't able to play Apple AAC or Apple Lossless files (m4a).
5,I am really happy with this bluetooth speaker. The sound is incredible. The only thing that it lacks is an AC adapter. Since I don't move it around it would be great to just plug it in and not have to keep charging it with my computer.Updated: DOSS support contacted me to let me know that we can use a 5V adapter from a cellphone. I've edited this review with that information and also changed it to 5 stars which it really deserves.
5,Cute little speaker. Nice quality for the price. All touch screen and mine does not have a voice on it. It just makes a tune when connected to Bluetooth. They must've updated it? Came with USB cable and aux cord. That is awesome!!If you need a quick speaker because maybe your old one went bad (like mine did) and need a quick replacement for a good deal. I'd recommend this speaker. I love it!
5,Love this little speaker! I take it everywhere  to the beach vacations and use in my house. It has a long battery life as well.
5,I am very satisfied with this product since it fulfilled my expectations widely its battery is durable and the charging time is fast.  The size is suitable to carry everywhere.  Really worth comparing quality and price.  I would definitely buy it again
5,its really nice i use it when I'm cleaning its loud good sound easy to use
4,Very good
5,This bluetooth speaker cranks out a good amount of sound. The highs and mids are clean and the bass is surprising for such a small speaker. Glad I didnt spend $100+ on a JBL speaker. This is perfect for a on the go speaker that you can crank out decent amount of jams in a small to medium sized room. Amazing value! Highly recommended!
5,Excellent value! Wonderful sound! Only needed one centered at the front of the room for PowerPoint presentations. The sound covered the whole room nicely. The volume is awesome! Even the Bluetooth pairing with more than one laptop (used at different times) was seamless...
4,Really very simple to set up - connected right away to my phone.  I thought the sound was a little low at first but then I realized I needed to turn up the volume on my phone as well.  The bass is not as amazing as I expected based on the other reviews but it is fine.
5,Great sound! I'll buy another one for my son. Thank you
3,I bought it because of the sd card but I returned 2#1.  It worked for a couple of days and then it wouldn’t turn on#2 I installed the shuffle firmware and now it keeps skipping songs on it own so I cant hear a full song with the sd and using pandora until I run out of skips and hear a constant bip while it tries to skipWhy would they sell a product that they had to offer a firmware fix for something that shouldve been included in the first place
3,Bluetooth connected almost immediately but I was disappointed with the sound. I have a smaller speaker that's ALOT louder than this speaker is. Im still going to use it because I bought this one hoping for a longer battery life.. We will see i guess I'll update in awhile but for now this isn't the best. Its good for small areas but I work in a factory and was hoping this was more loud.
5,Works great for a replacement for my shredded speakers in my truck
4,The sound is ok for a speaker this size.  I'm not a music snob but it would be nice if it had a little more bass.  The size and appearance of the speaker is great.  It would work nice on your desk or bedside table for listening.
4,The speaker works well with the auxiliary plug-in. The Bluetooth works but no great distances or obstacles can be in the way.
5,Easy to connect and good sound in my side by side
5,This little box is amazing it delivers a crystal clear quality audio sound. It is small and solid and has a quality build feel to it. The controls are easy to use and the Bluetooth connectivity is simple and it just works easily and effectively. It also looks very cool. I thought the sound was "pretty good" until I realized I had it sitting with the speakers pointing down! when I realized my mistake and uprighted it I was blown away.
5,This bluetooth speaker has amazing sound quality and is easy to use. The battery life is great as well. Would highly recommend.
4,Good Product overall but it keeps skipping tracks and turning my volume up and down
3,It's not an expensive product but I still feel disappointed with the sound. It has noise and the voice sounds scratchy.
4,No me agradó la conectividad bluetooth. Se pierden detalles del sonido debido a esto.
5,The sound is fantastic
4,For the money it is great.  Using it around the house replacing listening to headphones.  I won't recommend this for large areas such as an outside deck or large room.  That is not why I got it.  Great for around the kitchen dinning room etc.
5,This is a great speaker for the price. Sound quality is great. Very sturdy. Would make a great gift for a teen. Very pleased
5,I've had this for almost a year now and I absolutely love it. The sound is great it charges fast and lasts long and it's loud enough for me to hear when I ride my bike places in heavy traffic. It's much safer than headphones and it finds my devices very quickly. Very portable and the chime it makes when it turns on is cool.
5,Sounds so loud for a little thing. I love it.
5,Nice sound from this small speakerJust enough Bass for a rich sound in small spaces !Buy it !I bought  a2nd for another room !
4,Easy to hook up and great sound
5,I use this in my office or around the house when cleaning and love it!  Love the portability and sound is good!
5,Connected to my phone very fast. At first i was worried that it wouldn’t be loud enough but once i started using the speaker i was blown away. This a very good budget speaker.
4,It's is great speaker for the money. But with Alexa dots it skips very lightly occasionally. Battery life is great. It also connects automatically with the dot after the first set up. Set up was easy. It has a good range.
5,I love that it's so small but has big sound that you can carry it almost any where
5,Sound is pretty decent  Connectivity was a snap.  Easy to use.  Great price
4,Amazing sound stays charged for a long time with continuous use. I bought this for my husband for father's day and he uses it all the time. I want one for myself now. The only thing I don't really care for is the volume adjuster but I can live with it for the price.
5,I use it to listen to podcasts around the house. If your vehicle doesn't have an aux cable you can use it with your phone and it projects well above road noise. Good sound quality. Very happy with this purchase.
5,Best speaker really out there. I use it on my daily basis and I love it really so much. The battery stays so long and it's suitable for day picnics
4,I don’t give it a 5 star review b cuz it says it comes w a pouch to store the speaker and no pouch arrived w it ..
4,Got my second one of the same one cause my mom wanted mine! It lasts so long BUT this one is not working properly I have to charge it all the time every 30 min it dies!!! :(
2,I was optimistic about this product...I haven't really used many BT speakers.  However the advertising and yes even some of the reviews swayed me to give it a try.  Unfortunately I was disappointed.  Upon arrival the speaker just looked dingy (I ordered the white version) and even had a discoloration on the front.  When I attempted to plug the charger in the port was loose and didn't even seem like it was made for the cord it came with.  Finally the speaker had issues pairing not only with my Echo Dot (3rd Generation) but with my phone (Samsung A70) as well.Product returned.
4,Pretty good for the price. Not a lot of bass. Anker sound speaker is better. Just liked the features of the Doss SD card and the touch controls (volume and skipping to the next song without using my phone if I'm close to the speaker)
5,This is a great little speaker for the price!  It’s plenty loud and the sound quality is phenomenal. Battery life isn’t great but easy enough to plug it in and keep on playing.Highly recommend.
5,We Bluetooth the speaker to my iPad in the car.  It has plenty of volume and the tone is very good.  Highly recommend.
5,Updated 11 June 2017: after earlier review I was sent a brand new speaker by Wonders Tech. It works great and sound is just as great. Very nice customer service they certainly care about their customers and products. Thanks!Blue Tooth randomly disconnects. There is no interference from WiFi or Microwave or Wireless Phone and the thing will just disconnect blue tooth about every 20 minutes. Have to reset connection to get it to work again. Otherwise it sounds great.
2,This speaker has more cons than pros. The sound is decent: I had a JB microwireless Bluetooth speaker before this one and am considering buying another one because of how much I dislike this speaker..The pros: inexpensive ($10 less than JB microwireless) unique button display. Decent sound(not great).Cons: the on/off noise is extremely loud and you can not turn it off. It is followed buy a very loud noise when it connects via Bluetooth. The volume of these noises is  not only stressful when you want to listen to music at night when house members are sleeping but also rather embarrassing in the daytime. There is also a loud "boop" when you turn it all the way up (the touch display makes it so you don't know when you're near max volume)The asthetic of it is okay.. I dont suggest the blue one unless you're a boy in high school or younger.Lastly it is not water proof and does not seem extremely resistant so I would not call it an outdoor speaker..
5,Had a minor concern.  Fast and Excellent response by Amazon and DOSS to my concern.  DOSS provided a quick solution to my concern. Am very happy with my DOSS speaker excellent and reliable Bluetooth great sound.  I’ll continue to explore the speakers offered by DOSS.  Sent the recently released DOSS Traveler to son who needed an outdoor speaker that was designed for rough handling.  Rate DOSS as a quality vendor who responds to customer concerns.
5,I am extremely impressed w my speaker and when I say this little baby booms she definitely booms. Battery life is awesome. I opened it December 25th and had off and on without the charger today is the 28th and I’m just now putting it on the charger (even though it wasn’t completely dead). I absolutely love my speaker and it is worth every penny
5,easy to set up a connection and the sound quality was very good.
5,Works great. I bought it for my dad to listen to his morning music and the sound is great.
5,Bought it back in Dec 2017 and it still works great. The overall build quality is good. The base is probably not the best on high volume but for this price no complains 😊
3,Ive had in for about a month now and the sound wuakity has deteriorated rapily and sounds very staticy. Wish it would of lasted longer
4,The speaker had a really great sound and simple to use.  The all touch settings were a nice feature.  But I only had it week and the the device went haywire.  It was acting as though phone calls were constantly coming in and it shut off itself.  I'm bummed out because I had to return it
4,Great value product under $20 when I purchased it. Great portable speaker when using moderate volume levels.  Not the best at max volume.
5,me gusta el diseño el color el volumen táctil
4,works greta but will randomly change the songs sometimes. haven't figured out what causes it. will go through like ten songs and not let me change it. have to turn everything off and reconnect.
5,I’m so surprised it’s loud for the size that it is
5,great little speaker at a great price! last bluetooth speaker  I bought cost $150 (from Sony) and I love it (and it still works)but I needed another one for my husband so I was glad to see the price on this one.It works and sounds just fine and does everything the other one does but I am a little less worried about it being out in the yard.
5,Perfect size for a pool side or outdoor speaker.
5,My husband is hard of hearing and this works wonderful
5,I bought this about a year ago. i have it in the bathroom it sits on the window ledge. It has been exposes to steam for a year and still works amazing. the battery lasts a long time i think ihave had to charge it maybe 3x. it also fell from the window once and barely left a dent its really durable. i recomend this product!
5,Battery life is amazing!  Can take this anywhere and listen for hours!  Sound is loud too!
5,Love it very good quality sound easy to connect to your phone
5,Extremely easy to set up battery life lasts through multiple days of continued podcast listening. The touch buttons respond immediately. Dropped once and suffered no damage. I would buy again. Sound looks like it comes out from all sides however sound only comes out of the front. And that might be listed on product description. Not a complaint just an fyi!
4,Not an Audiophile or anything but this does the job we need.Great sound for the price.  We actually have a couple of these because they are so affordable.
4,I am overall happy with this speaker. It’s has pretty good sound as well as bass for the size. I would say it could be louder in my personal opinion and I don’t think the button lights need to stay on because I’m very sure it drains the battery
4,I just got this today the device is very classy. It has a really good sound and does get pretty loud however it does not have much bass. Other then that im happy with my purchase and would purchase again. 🙂
5,This little speaker delivers surprisingly rich full-bodied sound for such a petite enclosure. Highly recommended for any phone or radio. Mine is mostly used with a SiriusXM Onyx Plus and it sounds great.Update: I bought a second one of these for use mostly with an Echo Dot. The only small speakers that I've heard that are even closely comparable are the drivers that Bose uses in their Wave Radios. The DOSS is an excellent value - check out the price of a Bose Wave Radio!
5,THIS SPEAKER IS GREAT FOR LISTENING TO YOUR TV AT A DISTANCE.
4,Bluetooth aux sounds good. Add a micro SD card and the music gets a popping sound. Very annoying. Tried many different things low volume/high volume...always has the popping.
5,I love the quality and sound
5,This little speaker is awesome! The sound it perfect not tinny. Connects in a snap and works great with auxillary devices as well. Beeps every so often when it needs to be charged but little battery icon shows up on iPhone so you can avoid that since it does interrupt the music.
5,What a great bang for the buck! Purchased 2016 and still going strong 2020.Sound quality is impressive for the little speaker. It could use more bass however. Overall a very impressive speaker!
3,I've had the unit since the first week of December so that's about a month. Decent sound price-considered. Easy to pair. The only complaint if you can call it that is that it turns off by itself maybe due to inactivity for a period of time (which I have not figured out yet). I actually use if as a bluetooth speaker for my Echo Dot. It works well with it until the BT speaker turns itself off. When that happens it seems I have needed to pair it again with my Dot. Any tips on how to keep it turned on without having to connect it via aux cable?
5,This little speaker is worth its weight in gold! I ordered it to use in conjunction with a new Echo (2nd Gen) and I am really enjoying it. I carry it all over the house. I love the controls their ease of use how easy it is to charge with the USB cable included.  The sound is clear and full.  Can't say enough good things about it.  Yes.  Buy one!
3,the sound quality is really good but i’m giving it 3 stars because i think mine is defective. it has buttons at the top to skip songs & i believe the forward button is messed up because it skips songs on its own which is super annoying. i’ll have to buy a different speaker because this is a nuisance. sucks because i like the speaker besides that issue.
5,I’ve only had the speaker for a few days so I don’t know about the battery life but I’m really pleased with this product. The sound is great! I bought it to use with my iPhone and am very happy with it. Love the red color too.
5,Updated: great customer service and a firmware update resolved my issue.  Good sound for a speaker this size and price.  The lights are a little bright if you use it while going to sleep but there is a Firmware update to turn off the lights. (of course it would be a whole lot easier to just add a button to dim or shut the lights off)
5,Nice little speaker for the $$
5,Love this small speaker. It is an awesome speaker. Puts out good volume fir the size. I have used it for hours and have only charged it once.
5,Just received it today and I must say for 30 dollars this is a bargain.  Looks nice  does feel cheap  easy setup  and sounds great.  Might just have to buy another one for  a great birthday or Christmas gift for someone that loves music.  Only had for one day so if it blows up anytime soon I followed up.  If the battery only last a few years I'll still consider it a great buy.
4,Puts out a pretty good sounds for price. Not disappointed at all!!
5,It’s hard to imagine that such a small speaker can produce such great sound. I’ve used it to play my Zumba music in a large room with a high ceiling and it did beautifully. The Bluetooth connects like a charm. I highly recommend this speaker.
5,Easy to use small compact yet powerful economically priced! Easy to sync  EXCELLENT
5,The sound is amazing and the color so girlie! I love it
5,This cheap little bluetooth speaker is loud. It stays charged for three or four days. It is easy to connect to whether you choose bluetooth or aux cord connection. We are very pleased with the speaker and I plan to buy a couple more for my kids.
5,Great for the money.
5,Sound quality is nice. I like the battery life of these speakers
3,Would not immediately connect to Amazon  Echo DotVolume does NOT work.  Clockwise up volume or counter clockwise for lowRecommend buying a more reliable Bluetooth speaker but amazon echo dot is limited with what it will pair with.
3,I liked the design and all. But the sound not enough bass and the highs are to high.
5,I don’t normally write reviews. But I got this in the mail yesterday and tested it out today. And it is amazing overall. But hands down awesome for $20!! Don’t hesitate to get it. I am looking forward to using at the beach as well as for work when school starts back. The sound quality is amazing.
5,Battery came charged and lasted several hours. Sound quality is great. Design is very sleek. The only downfall is only one phone can be connected to the Bluetooth at one time. If you switch music between phones you have to unpair the phone and pair the new one. Great buy for the price.
5,The bass in this speaker is out of this world!!! 🥰🥰🥰
5,I needed a new Bluetooth speaker to use outside and at the pool and this one is great. It has much better sound much better battery life and way longer connectivity than any of the ones that I have had before. I didn't expect the bass to be all that great and the Doss was better than I expected. The price was also great. Overall it is a great product. I will probably buy one for the extended family.
5,I gave this as a gift and he says he loves it.
5,I had a BOSS blue tooth speaker does not have a good indication if its on or off.  This product has a nice blue light to show when it's ON.  And the sound system is almost as good as BOSS
4,One downfall not loud enough
4,So far so good just got it a week ago and very impressed. Connects easily with other Bluetooth devises and can be very loud. Had the Cambridge Oontz 3rd generation and it died within 9 months. Doss is definitely looks better connects easier louder and it's much better then Oontz. Hope it last!
4,very satisfied.  bought one for myself. Liked it enough to buy a second for a gift
3,It’s not bad but I guess I’m used to really good sound.  Still I like this little speaker. Easy to use.
5,Love it
5,Was searching for a speaker for my iPod and bought this one. When I first got it I thought the volume was too low but when I figured out that you have to increase the volume on your iPod too the sound was great. It's not tinny like you would normally find in most small speakers. It has a great quality sound and can be heard through a few rooms. Just what I was looking for. Thanks for the speaker!!!
5,This is great! Easy to use and powerful! I use it when I’m on hold and it never cuts out calls. My music off my iPhone sounds incredible and power lasts a very long time!
5,It is a good product worth what you pay for it.
5,It’s got everything Connection wise. Easy set up. Good sound quality! Handy substitute for car radio and having music in other rooms in the house. Love it so much I sent as Christmas gifts and all who received them loved them too.
5,Frankly I'm shocked at the excellent quality I got for $30!I've had this almost a year and it is working like a champ. Syncs to devices easily; has a nice volume range. Yes I can BLAST IT if I want to. Holds a charge really well. I think I've only recharged it about 3 times in this whole year. It has a Very good zipper case that holds it and the cords.
5,I’ve used this speaker almost every day for three years and it still sounds great!!
5,I love to listen to music now I can have better sound upstairs with my phone\.
5,I’ll tell you what - this little guy has amazing sound great bass and gets loud as heck! I never would have thought especially for the price the kind of sound quality this thing has. Best part it can be voice activated when paired with the Amazon Dot. Highly recommend and I am going to order at least two more for my house.
5,The sound from this speaker is excellent. Unbelievable value for money. The bluetooth pairing works easily (that has always been my biggest problem with this kind of product!). It is flexible in terms of sound sources and has a solid robust feel to it. Have not tried it out in the open yet but the battery life seems good so we are looking forward to using it on the patio in the summer.
4,I like the look of it.  Sounds good.  Only thing I’m not crazy about is the dial volume feature.  I prefer just up and down the dial makes it hard for me to adjust
5,I normally do not write reviews but this product is GREAT exactly what I've been in the market for I did not expect for the sound to be  as intense and clear great product so far I would definitely purchase again
5,I was surprised how well this little speaker sounds. For the price it's amazing. I'm going to buy another one.
5,period between inactivity and self shutdown is way too short and the bluetooth is at times faulty but that definitely shouldn’t deter you from buying it it’s a wonderful speaker!!!! especially the pink one! i love it her name is benny😍🥰
4,This has been a great little speaker so far. The battery life has been really good. The sound is clear and can get to a pretty high volume. My only issue is I wish the distance went a little farther between my Bluetooth device and speaker but still the distance isn't that bad either.
5,I love this thing. Great in the kitchen or garage while listening to my podcasts
5,Bought this speaker and I enjoy it very well "GOOD SOUND". However after a month it suddenly STOP working "would not turn on". Contact the customer service and immediately sent a replacement a good customer service. I am rating this as 5 star - customer service is great and the sound quality is good. I hope this one I received will last long.
5,Very nice speaker small but with excellent sound quality.  The sound the speaker makes when powered up and when it connects to the bluetooth device is a bit loud.  I know they can provide a firmware update to turn these sounds off but for me I have decided I would rather have the sound than not. I guess my only negative thought is it takes a long time to charge via USB.
5,I felt the need to write a review after reading some of the other ones. This speaker is good quality. People keep leaving negative reviews like this thing cost them an arm and a leg! It's a great speaker unless you're looking to physically feel the bass. In that case start lookin for $500 speakers instead of $30 speakers.
4,Great speaker. Loud. Strong. I dropped it out of a Front End Loader and she still works. No damge at all. The only issue is the frequency must be close to our 2way radio. So when I key up the radio to talk it changes my song or pauses. But that's not the speakers fault.
5,This speaker is actually great. I'd been meaning to purchase one for quite a while now and I came across this one and it looked perfect. It's super sleek and a great company. Plus the price was a great deal. Once I got it I was really glad that it was actually as good as it looked. Great sound great battery life. Perfect for a home party or a day at the beach just keep it away from the water!
5,Excellent sound!!! Great sound quality. I’m using it as an extra sound bar for my tv in my room so the sound is close to my head not across the room at the tv  blasting out the room next door. Great for additional sound for tv without having to wire anything!
5,👍🏻👍🏻
5,This speaker works really well. It has a really cool design. The lights on the top are very bold and clear and are touch sensitive. It comes with an attachment so you can hook up your mp3 player to it and it comes with two modes bluetooth (color changes to blue) and manual attachment (color changes to red.) The sound quality is really clear
5,Just an update (11/28/17):Speaker had some issues (would skip tracks or pause with music player and Verizon) however am keeping five stars due to the amazing customer service from DOSS. Thanks again for everything!Great product. Works very well good sound and bass for the size. Got the warranty just in case anything happens. Came with a charging cable and AUX cord as well as a soft storage pouch. Thanks again! :-)
5,Really quite a feisty little speaker.  Captures the highs and mids quite nicely.  The bottom end is full.  This box offers a nicely textured polyphonic reproduction.  I grew up with a number of renown musicians who afforded me the opportunity to develop my own keen ear.  I am still surprised at both the low cost and quality of product.  Keep it up!
5,I have to say I never write a review. This little speaker is great for the price . Very loud and very clear for its size . Looked around and took a chance on this one and I’m happy I did . For what you would pay for the JBL  go with this one . Great job Doss
5,Sound quality is excellent for a portable speaker like this. Can’t be happier.The speaker I received first had a dent on it but did not affect its function. I left the seller a message to let them know about the damage but did not request a replacement since the speaker works just fine. However the seller sent me a replacement right after they received a message. Thank you for the great speaker and superb service!
4,Bought this as a gift no problems so far connects Easy and good overall sound quality
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Very good sound quality it is on half volume right now. The battery also lasts for weeks I use it every morning when getting ready for school and that’s around an hour and the battery isn’t even close to dead right now and I haven’t charged it in like a month. very very worth the money.
2,This speaker looks beautiful and the sound was very good for the price. I was pretty impressed. I am giving this two stars because unfortunately this speaker likes to pause stop and randomly skip music on its own. At first I thought it was my phone with the issue and I even restarted the phone and the problem seemed to get fixed for a few days. Then it started happening again. My music would get stopped paused skipped on its own non stop. I turned the Bluetooth off and my music played fine (I listen to music on youtube Red I don't know if this happens with other music apps as well). I then used my living room speaker and the music played fine. I then connected my phone to this speaker to see and the music began to get inturrupted on its own. I'm very dissapointed in this speaker. I have been giving it many chances since I bought it hoping it wasn't the speaker but each time it ends up being the issue.
5,I love this little speaker!!! $29.99 is a great deal!I got this speaker so I could listen to music easily on our deck. It's perfect. Loud enough I can jam to some good tunes but not annoy the neighbors.I have a Bose that cost about $500.00. This stereo is close in sound quality. Not quite as loud.Perfect for a personal sound system that you can take around with you. Plus other people can access it with their phone too which is fun.
5,Recomedada
5,Love the sound quality for the price this speaker really surprised me.
5,This was a Christmas gift for my husband to listen to while on his forklift at work. The sound is VERY good crisp and clear. It's really loud and the bass is great for such a small speaker. Very very impressed!
1,If you like/love good sound quality this won’t work at all. No bass. No balance. Just awful. Sounds like my old Alexa Dot speaker. It was sent right back.
5,I ended up giving mines away and I miss it already. I will be buying another one because it was good for the price.
4,Its a Great speaker box but the battery last longer with a memorycard
5,I was honestly a little skeptical buying this because to me the price was fairly cheap. I’m glad I did though! I was NOT expecting such a loud sound coming from a little speaker... it certainly hasn’t disappointed me. I can go three days before charging it again. If you’re looking for a compact quality sound portable speaker I highly recommend this one!
5,This is a good loud portable speaker. Sounds decent for what it is your not going to get audiophile sound coming from this if you think that from a 30 or 40 dollar Bluetooth speaker you are crazy. I bought it mainly to listen to audio books while driving since 04 VW doesn't have Bluetooth.  One thing I find annoying is the bright blue light on the top for the volume. Since I use this in my car it gets annoying at night.
4,The sound is nice but not as loud as I expected. The connectivity is nice and reliable. I bought it to play music while I'm trying to sleep and it works well but there's no way I've found to turn off (or even dim) the lights from the buttons which makes my room annoyingly bright.
5,Been using this speaker for 7 months now and it's worked great.  Gets very loud and doesn't have any audio issues when played at full blast.  The bluetooth range seems to be good.  Speaker could be a bit better on the base but it still works just fine.  Battery seems to last a very long time as I go a month or two without charging it.
5,I am so happy I bought this! I live in a group house I just wanted some speakers for my room and something I can take to the kitchen when I'm cooking or into the bathroom for a shower (perfect because it withstands moisture). Its very easy to connect via bluetooth I switch between many different devices as well. I think the sound is great and it gets pretty loud.For this price its perfect!
4,It’s easy to connect to your devices. The sound isn’t great but I’m not trying to blow away the neighbors. The battery life is good and last the entire gathering.
5,Saw the reviews on this speaker and decided to try for myself and I must say I am impressed. I love the features and the buttons its easy to operate has a nice battery life and the sound is very impressive. Gotta say for the money you cant go wrong I thought about the Bose Soundlink and couldn't drop the money. The sound on this one is great and all I need would buy another one when needed.
5,I have owned this for about a year. No problems whatsoever. Love the feature that tells you when your battery needs to be charged. It is used bluetooth with an Amazon Echo Dot. Very happy I chose this speaker AND an awesome price.
5,For a $30 worth of speaker you get more what you pay for on this speaker. The sound is clear and loud. The Bass is excellent too. The touch controls are very cool! I wish they make a new version that is waterproof. Unfortunately this is not good for outdoor use like on the beach or garden. But overall this speaker sounds really really good.
5,ease of use
5,This is my first time buying a Bluetooth speaker and this one met my expectations!Its small and easy to use even though I suck at technological usages yet this one is so simple and it really can be heard "360" all around. It has a long lasting battery. My favorite part is how fast it connects to Bluetooth. You just turn the speaker on connect to Bluetooth and play a song! Definitly would recommend
4,This exceeded my expectations.  The sound quality is great.  Very happy with my purchase.
3,Sound very low
5,Great sound!I compared my DOSS speakers with a friend's $230.00 Bose speakers. Mine sounds way better. For $34.00 you can't beat it.I previously bought two Bluetooth speakers for my sons both over a hundred dollars. My $34.00 DOSS sounds just as good if not even better.They don't believe the sound coming from speakers less than a third of the price of their speakers.Click and buy it. Great product.
5,Great Speaker! Easy to set up and the sound quality is amazing! I bought this speaker for my bluetooth record player and it fills up my whole house with amazing sound! Love it!
5,This is very well built and has great sound quality!
5,I’m really impressed with the quality of the speaker! It’s so easy to connect to Bluetooth super fast the battery lasts longer than any other speaker I’ve had. Would definitely recommend! Super loud for the size
5,I got the speaker for an intended gift. I was however curious about the system itself so I opened it up and had a test run in music. Wow! I am pleased with the quality of sound it distributes for the price I paid. I’m sure the gift recipient will be happy too. I am planning on buying at least 2 more for gifts.
5,I love this speaker....I keep it plugged in so I can't speak to the battery life but the sound is excellent!
4,Super easy set up pairing with blue tooth and devices. Was worried because of reviews it would be a miserable experience but was no trouble at all. Sound is good enough...not a Bose sound but nowhere near the Bose price either. It’s small and portable my family likes it!
1,UPDATE:  Only one of FIVE TF cards I bought works and then it only plays 6 songs before looping back to the beginning.  I play WMA music which is listed as working.  Does anyone know how to get in touch with manufacturer or seller?  Can't find that info anywhere...….otherwise the sound is GREAT but I simply need the TF slot to work properly with WMAs.Got it today. I actually bought this one to replace another brand that after two tries would not work. This one feels heavier and better quality to begin with. The sound is excellent. I got it to play music from the TF card. The 32GB TF card that I bought works fine. Then I got to 16GB cards and they don't work at all. So for now since I can't figure out what the problem may be even after reformatting to FAT32 I have ordered two more of the 32GB card switch did work. They will be here in a few days and I will try them. It is currently charging and it took me forever to find the little red light underneath the charging plug on the back. But now that I know no problem. The sound is just so so so good. Hope the new TF cards work.
4,Sounds great
3,It sounds static when my phone is not near it like really I thought I was buying a speaker with good distance.
5,Awesome  sound and easy setup.
5,For a unit that fits in the palm of your hand this Bluetooth speaker delivers a nice sound with controls that are easy to us.  I have four rooms that are hardwired to my sound system so I use the Bluetooth speakers when I'm working in other rooms. It's extreme portability and long battery life make it perfect for this application and  Bluetooth pairing was easy.
5,my Doss speaker arrived in less then a week it was easy to activate to my phone and it plays very well and plenty loud however I am old school and don't know a lot about todays technology it did not come with instructions I don't know what the Mode is for and I would like to know what a TF card is where to get one and how to use it even so I like it.
5,I LOVE my doss sound bar. It did mess up after I brought it in the bathroom while I showered. Great sound very loud bass booming just how I like it
4,Only used it a couple times so far it's good  clear sound.
5,Sound quality is crisp & clear. Easy to set up. Fast shipping!
5,I love this speaker! I have a Bose Bluetooth speaker in my kitchen and and the sound quality is very comparable to that. It connects  easily and I’ve only had to charge it once. Would absolutely purchase again.
5,Is perfect for my laptop computer on the go:)
5,I love this little but powerful sound box. It fills my work space and home with music.
5,Nice sound. I use it when cleaning and it brings music to all areas of the building
5,Since this is a Christmas present you will have to wait for the recipient to respond!
5,We used this device recently on a trip to the beach. We enjoyed beautiful music on a white sandy beach with wind and waves.
4,I love this doss soundbox . If the sale is still on I would like to buy five more.
2,I purchased one of these for my wife due to the simplistic interface. It sounded great and had a sturdy feel. I fell in love with it and purchased 2 more. I setup one for her Chromebook one for her windows 10 notebook and one for a bedroom TV.All was well for a week or so then one of the 2 new units failed. It will not power or and stay on.Quite disappointing my Logitech and zero chill units are still running strong and sound much better and have been doing so fo a year. So even if the interface is better on these units they seem to not hold up under delicate use.
5,Mi speaker is excellent
5,Purchased the black model and have used for about an hour. It has worked perfectly so far.  This little guy has some power. The sound is very crisp. Connecting was a breeze and the controls are simple to use. The box it comes in is simple brown and the accessories are just ok. Definitely recommend this as a primary bluetooth speaker or an extra one! Will update once I can test battery life.
5,My product arrived within two days. There was a slight stain on my speaker but the ease of set-up made this easy to look past. It has great sound quality and I can get range all the way to my basement from the top level of my home. Great speaker for a low price. I would highly recommend this speaker for someone who likes to listen to music in the shower or when cooking and cleaning.
5,Worked great at first. It had great sound also. After about the 4th day it stopped working. I sent the speaker back with no issues. I was then contacted by a rep from the company and they were great. They even sent me a new speaker at no charge. I am now very happy with my new speaker it works great. I really think it sounds as good as the BOSE I had purchased when the first one failed.
5,Love it’s loud for it size and it’s not sensitive to touch just enough
5,Packaged well tight.y and secure. Once I got the speaker out I turned it on. It comes barely charged enough to turn on and play but it kept beeping until I plugged it in. Once charged I am very impressed! Plays well good quality comes with a waterproof bag as well and a nice little best wishes card. Very happy. The only thing I could say against it is it does not look sturdy as though if it were to be dropped its a goner. Otherwise love it.
5,Bought this for myself i loved it so much!!! My daughter came along and hogged it from me!!!! She loved the size music quality and battery life!!! More than I did!!! I haven't  seen it since suppose it playing music on soccer championships!!!
5,I just love my new speaker is easy to set up and great to listen to just the right thing for me thanks so very much and it even was sent earlier than expected
5,Excelente sonido  lo puedo usar para mis fiestas o reuniones de trabajo.
5,Great little speaker ! Works well for sitting in hot tub or on beach . Great price
5,Excellent sound!! I just purchased a second one for my office. Highly recommend this product.
5,Clear sound
5,It works for my kitchen. Wish it was 2x more louder. But sound is clear bass is just right battery life great. Connects fast. Charges fast. Great price! Going to get a bigger Doss only because I need it louder in my garage.
3,If you're looking for a cheap but pretty decent bluetooth speaker this is the one!  Please note this is nothing like the fancier and more expensive ones you can buy.  The sound is good connectivity works like it should even comes with a (albeit cheap) carrying case for it.  Works as it should!  The interface can be somewhat confusing especially if you lose the instructions like I did.  I bought it for my daughter and she uses it all the time.  It is well worth the money if you don't want to go expensive!
5,I am really impressed with this bluetooth. It is very loud. It has touch screen. It connects easy. It actually stays on my dash if I bring it in the car. I love that why I get a phone call I can answer it and talk through the speaker. I am impressed with the product for sure. Glad i made this puchase.
5,Bluetooth speaker is amazing! Got it as a gift for my husband and he loves it! It has good battery life and good sound to it its very much worth it! Its like buying the Beats Pill but less the money and maybe even better quality. Would definitely recommend!
5,This little speaker had a big sound for a reasonable price!
4,Great deal for the price!  Very satisfied!!  Would buy again!
5,Nice clear sound
4,My little speaker is a cutie and I bought it at a great price!
4,Love it overall.The weird busy tone it gives when it is running out of battery power is super annoying though. Also charging it via USB can be inconvenient at times.  Still those are very minor issues.
3,This is convenient and easy to use. The size is nice for packing in a suitcase or beach bag. The sound is only so-so.
4,I was very surprised by the quality of this product taking in consideration its size. The sound is very clear and high quality.I purchased it most to enjoy my music at home and I loved it.
5,Great product
5,This is the first decent bluetooth speaker I have bought.  The sound is clear and nice.  I can hear the base from it quite well. It does a good job outside.  I like the style of it and got lots of compliments from co workers.  The touch buttons are responsive and look pretty good.  I like the voice commands in it also.  That seems to set it apart from other speakers.I definitely think it is worth the price and would buy again.
5,Great sound connects easily and goes longer than I would have hoped for on a charge
5,I love this speaker! I am used to an ex boyfriend’s $200 speaker with amazing bass ~ this $30 speaker doesn’t have much bass but it’s a $30 speaker not a $200 speaker haha. The sound is very clear and wonderful for the price. One day I may spend more for that bass but for someone on a budget this is definitely the best! I’m very happy.
5,This is a great little speaker for a great price. The sound is impressive volume control simple. I liked it so much that I bought another for a gift. Compact and light enough to throw in beach bag for a day on the beach!
5,I am pleasantly surprised at the audio quality from this speaker. The setup was quick. The size is perfect to move with you. It charges via a mini USB. The circular volume touch control works independently from the volume control on your device. It came nicely packaged with cables and a fabric pouch for storage.  I do agree with a previous reviewer I would prefer no audio voice announcement  when I turn it on but no big deal. I'd  buy it again. Thanks.
4,I love it! Sometimes you can hear the static sound but then it goes away. It's kind of weird but for now I really love it!
5,This little dude is more than meets the eye! I put it through its paces with the Marcus Miller Band and I was pleasantly surprised at the frequency response from across the spectrum. (If you're not familiar with MMB they are a jazz band led by a bass player ergo the bass is prominently featured throughout their music.) This speaker system was well worth the money that I paid. I am currently considering buying another.
5,Already tested it out at the beach on a windy day and I could hear the music loud and clear. It connected to my phone easily with no problems and the battery charge is still going. It didn't wear out after a couple of hours of use. Easy to carry and enough options for connection that I can pair it with multiple devices. For anyone looking to bring their music along on outdoor activities this is a good fit.
5,Great sound and battery life. Easy to charge. Easy connectivity. Looks great too.
5,Love this speaker. Battery last long time and sound quality is great. Love the touch sensor. Perfect size.
5,Never heard of this but it was the hit of the season!
5,Great product. Sounds amazing and great battery life
5,Struggles a bit with the high end sounds.  Bass is awesome for such a tiny speaker and it is way louder than expected.  The battery lasts forever.  Totally amazed by the how long one charge lasts.
5,For the price the sound is really good. It makes listening to music or audio books possible when the noise level is a bit higher in my house. I can hear whatever I’m listening to over a garbage disposal or a sewing machine.
4,I am very surprised how good the sound quality is with this speaker.
5,This is an awesome little speaker good sound quality. Excellent for the price
5,Bought this speaker for myself in the summer (2019) fell in love with it! And now giving it as gifts for Christmas! Great sound and makes for a perfect gift and great for those who travels a lot.  5 stars heck yea!
5,I COULDN’T wait to open the box!! We bought this for our backyard get together!! The speaker is small but very powerful!! Love it!! You won’t be disappointed!!
5,Works really well. Gets quite loud. Sound is high quality.
5,Exactly what I was hoping for from a 20$ speaker. Good sound quality and solid battery life. Connects quickly has a good connection range touch pad is sensitive and responsive very lightweight and small enough to fit in my sweater pocket. Very pleased!
4,It is great device apart from some minor sound quality issues. Love it
5,I am very happy with this purchase.  It sounds great and it was very fairly priced.
5,I've had this speaker for about 7 months now and it's held up amazingly well! I work at a doggy daycare that has concrete floors and this speaker has hit the floor from about 3 feet up many times. It was flung across the room at one point. There are some small dings from being handled so roughly but the sound quality hasn't changed! This speaker is well worth the money!
5,Great product if you want something that is personalized.  I have a small apartment and the sound really carries (625sqft).  It would probably sound good too in a bigger place because I read some of the comments and I  pretty much went by those...a lot of great comments.  I love it too because it's USB charger and portable!  I higher recommend it due to my reasons!  I'm  very happy with it.
3,I purchased this unit so that I can play bell choir music from my cell phone.  I was disappointed that it doesn't have a lot of volume.  If you need something much less than 1 watt to play better quality music from your cell then maybe this is for you but if you need something loud then find another unit.
4,Works well. Makes social media fun and useful. I will be buying another one.
4,fácil de usar
4,Very good sound and holds a charge well. I bought it to use with the Kindle on road trips for the kids to watch movies and it was perfect. The controls are a bit finicky but that has not been a huge deal. I would totally buy it again.
5,It’s been 4 days playing this speaker overnight and the battery is now on half. Incredible. Great sound quality and very sexy!
5,I purchased two of the DOSS sound boxes one for home and one for my office.  I absolutely love the sound quality and the ease of using them.  For me this was a steal.  I highly recommend this purchase.
4,I like it
4,I use this for nighttime to hear my white noise off my phone  works great  battery lasts about 6 hrs  don’t know how long it will last playing music but it’s good for the cost .
5,Perfect for using outdoor on the patio or out in thebyard playing with kids.  Easy to connect to phones or another media devices.
4,The battery lasts a long time. It’s nice and loud for such a small speaker. The sound quality isn’t that great but definitely worth the money.
5,This isn't the loudest speaker I've ever had but for its size it packs a punch. The sound quality is good with a decent base for such a tiny box. It's fast and easy to connect to and very portable. It's heavy for its size but still only weighs about as much as a bottle of soda. Would definitely buy again.
5,I adore this little speaker. It’s loud clear great battery life and Bluetooth distance. I wish it had more bass that’s the only reason I gave 4 stars on sound. Everything else is a solid 5. You can’t find a better speaker for the price.
5,I love this thing price was great sound quality beyond expectations.. not going to blast out my 1 acre yard.. but at work in the shop outside on siding or small non power tool jobs.. amazing.. and holds sound quality to max volume.. and battery last very well.. although it’s fairly newer so.. time will tell on that
5,I couldn’t be happier with the sound this provides for such a small portable speaker! Love it! Easy to control from speaker or phone.
5,Beats other more expensive speakers by a mile
5,I love the sound quality.  Great battery life. No complaints yet!
4,This speaker worked real good for about a week like really really good but all of a sudden the led lights cut out the speakers themselves went out right after and now nothing maybe I just got defective one maybe idk but it sucks because it was a great speaker...
5,Great box use it for work 👍.  Help me through the day .
5,I was looking in the comments and people where saying that it was to quiet… I 100% disagree if you want the loudest and high quality sound… I recommend you using the auxiliary cord as to the Bluetooth will make it quieter. The bass in this portable speaker is out of this world! When I first used it I didn't know this much bass was going to come out… it was vibrating the table. The buttons are very responsive and fast and I just give this speaker a 10 out of 10!
5,The other speakers I've had have lasted a year we'll see about this one. What u like about this one is it's easier to get exactly the volume you want and it turns off by itself; this saving battery power.
4,DAMN that light is bright and you can't turn it off!
5,Reliable pairs quickly and has good sound. Just one caveat: the buttons are very touchy. If it stays in one place this shouldn't be an issue but I move mine around a lot. I've dropped it a few times and no damage done.
5,I have had this speaker for over a month and a few weeks and I'm so happy with the quality of this product. I start my morning with a work out using these speakers and its great it connects quickly and the sound is great (for the price). I love it and I would definitely purchase it again if needed.
5,I use this everyday to play songs on Amazon music on my iPhone.  It's so portable that I bring it with me all over the house.I don't use my Sonos system as much anymore.
3,When used With audiobooks there is frequent skipping typically at the beginning of sentences or after a pause. This makes it impossible to use for audiobooks. Works well with music.
5,This speaker unit is great. Plenty of power to push your music. Very easy to pair from My iPhone. Took three hours to charge. Instructions are easy to understand. We drive to Denver from Russell Kansas and the radeo reception is not the best but having this in the car all my music on my iPhone is played. Sounds great. Very easy to turn up the volume. For the price from Amazon you can't beat it.  Enjoy
5,Good sound
5,I really like this speaker. I’ve played it for 3 or 4 hours without it dying. This is an awesome product.
5,i ordered it in advance as a gift. once i gifted it and it was returned to me because  it wouldn't hold a charge it was too late to return it... I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT IT HAD A 12 MONTH WARRANTY UNTIL I WAS CONTACTED BY THE SELLER... WOW WHAT GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! AFTER COLLECTING SOME INFORMATION THY IMMEDIATELY REPLACED IT WITH A NEW ONE WHICH WORKS GREAT.  This unit works just as described or better... love it!
4,My son lovez it. He uses it everyday and it has great sound.
4,Works goodsound is clearbattery life is awesome. Well worth the money
5,Android user.  My first SoundBox skipped songs when connected to any streaming music service.  Doss sent me a replacement under warranty and it works as advertised.  Very good sound quality.  I was very impressed by the customer service and follow through on the warranty claim.  This company is genuinely interested in customer satisfaction and was a pleasure to deal with.
5,I also own a Bose little bluetooth speaker and I wanted another one but to spend over $120 is over my budget these days. I'm glad I found this one because the quality of the sound is very good it works great and it is easy to use. The battery lasts a long time too. I wish I knew this when I bought my Bose speaker two years ago.
3,This sound box is very nice I don’t know if I just got unlucky but mine hits the next button by itself right in the middle of a song. It only did this every once and a while when I first used it I’ve had it for a month or so now and the skipping keeps getting worse. It really sucks!
5,Awesome. Equivalent to $100 speaker. Don’t debate. High quality!
4,I was disappointed by battery life however nthe sound quality is on par with previous generation brand name speakers which retailed for $99+I'd recommend spending $65+ for a name brand speaker which has higher quality Bluetooth protocols
4,I've had this product for a while now and the sound is awesome!! The only thing I would complain about is that if the volume and bass are up too loud the songs will change or pause due to the nature of the buttons. The vibrations will trigger the buttons to activate. But other than that it's great!!!
5,I bought this speaker for my wife for her birthday to have in our bathroom.  It is absolutely fantastic!  Very easy to pair with you Bluetooth compatible phone or Echo.  The sound that comes out of it is really good too.  I don't think it would project sound in a huge open space but for a smaller area (like a bedroom or bathroom) it's perfect.
5,Just received and so far great!  Have only used on bluetooth but it synced to my iPadin about 2 seconds.  No issues at all....  seamless.  iPad found it linked and the musicplayed instantly. The sound is fine and plenty loud.  The price is great it looks good and bestof all it works as stated and works easily and we are pretty happy.  Good deal!
5,This speaker is unbelievable. The power and sound clarity is great. It amazes me the price is so low. I am taking it on a 15 person camping trip today and I am sure there will be more buyers by next week. I'll be buying a couple for xmas gifts. I've used it Bluetooth from my phone and with an MP3 player plugged in. I love it. Oh that camping trip.......everyone wanted one of these speakers.
4,It’s small but it’s loud so I like it. Purchasing the bigger one soon!
5,I was very surprised by this speaker! I thought it wasn't going to be loud enough because of its size but the sound is very good and the sound has good bass. It's very easy to use and connects with any smartphone. The design is nice definitely does not look cheap. It's not heavy at all. I totally recommend. I bought this as a gift for my sister because she listens to music all day and I might buy one for myself.
4,Expanded sound in living area from a ROKU TV.  Definite improvement in areas where listening was difficult.
5,We use this speaker for music and audio books. There are certsinly more expensive and better Bluetooth speakers but this one has been a very good value for our use. It connects well is easy to use and sounds good.
5,Got this for $30 on Prime Day. Comes with a little draw string bag to carry it in. You'd probably have a hard time finding a better speaker in that price range. Great sound quality. Loud. If you have an app that lets you adjust bass it handles it well. It doesn't have actual buttons which concerned me at first but the touch surface works surprisingly well. Had it for almost 2 weeks now. Good ass Speaker.
5,This is a great speaker.  Quality is fantastic and the price is great.
5,Full clear detailed sound at any volume. High quality for a small speaker. Easy accessible controls. Easy pairing. Love it.
5,Love it.  Use it all the time.  Its also well made.  Its been dropped like 100 times.
5,Greatest purchase I have ever made. Works just as good as when I got it a year ago. It made pregaming the bars fun and the sound of it is amazing.
5,Worth every dime
5,i loved it the sound quality it awsome but when it started dying it will make a beeping noise
4,I like the compactness of the unit. I wish it could be louder.
5,Es buenisimo buen tamaño el sonido se escucha bien y a buen precio
5,Very stylish and easy to carry around. Great sound!
2,Update in initial review this speaker has proven to be a nightmare. Doesn't hold a charge doesn't maintain its connection to my phone. It's frustrating to use. Hopefully the seller will refund complete disappointment on this speaker.WOW this thing packs some great sound! I've been on an endless search for a speaker that packed a punch & this delivers and then some. I can put this in the kitchen & hear it all throughout the house. The controls are elegant & sound quality is fantastic. I ordered the white one & to my frustration there was a couple of black spots on the top that somehow were missed during the inspection  process. I'm particular about wanting anything white to be flawless so it bothered me. I contacted the seller and was amazed that they offered to replace the unit! They *really* stand behind their product. As for the sound I am BLOWN away by this gem of a speaker!  Don't hesitate to order this it rocks!
5,I just love this mini bluetooth speaker! Its small enough to put on the windowsill in my bathroom and the steam from the shower hasn't affected its quality one bit! A great purchase!!!!
5,This small speaker really surprised me- it looks really nice and has a good size. It's easy to use and the sound is just great.I had ordered it not knowing that my husband had just bought a similar one from a known brand (4x the price). We were getting ready to return this when we compared them and ended up deciding for this Bluetooth speaker instead. Definitely recommend it and would absolutely buy it again.
5,Good speaker very good sound and battery life is good. I would recommend this speaker to anyone.
5,2nd one I buy and this one is mine. Great bluetooth speaker it's a Power House. The Battery Life is unbelievable. Have only charge it  twice since initial charge.
5,I purchased this speaker for my son for his room and he loves it. Sometimes I think that he has some kind of big sound system in his room when he has this on. I would definitely recommend this. I think it would also be good for like in a hotel room or sitting out on the patio on a nice day.
4,Good item if you get it for $20. Nothing amazing  but a good desk speaker.
5,I bought this to replace a smaller one I was using for outdoors. I was very impressed with the great sound and battery life. I also like that when I am listening to Pandora I can skip to the next song using it rather than having to use my phone.It is a very good speaker for the price and well made.I would highly recommend it.
5,Great little speaker with lasting battery power. We took this little guy camping and it lasted at least 5 evenings around the campfire without needing a recharge!
5,We purchased this for the backyard during  a party. Worked great and lasted the entire party with no issues. A must have...
4,I use it when I watch movies on my computer because the sound on my computer went out  It work fine for that
5,The sound is great on this  even using it as my speaker phone.  I love to connect it to my TV at night so I do not disturb anyone in the household.  The sound is so crisp
4,Verry good bass and more.I just love it
5,Excellent sound reproduction using my Samsung Galaxy on You-Tube. Appears to be well constructed & is very easily operated. The "line in" adds more versatility & bass response is surprising. I don't have micro SD audio storage so haven't tried that yet. I challenge anyone to find a better sounding unit for the $28 that offers the same features.
5,Love the sound. Perfect for listening to music or YouTube from your phone. I mostly use it in my bathroom while taking a bath or I bring it by the pool. The size is wonderful so really you can use it anywhere. Battery life is great I hardly ever charge it.  I got the beautiful white color however there are other fabulous colors too.
5,the battery life is pretty long and the sound quality is fabulous however i have experience very minor cuts in the Bluetooth connectivity (note: this can be for any number of reasons) otherwise the speaker is absolutely was i was hoping for and more. I have impressed several of my friends with this speaker now they might get one too.
5,Mighty little speaker for its size and price.  Definitely a good buy for basic Bluetooth speaker needs.
5,I bought one of these last year and my husband loved it. Greta quality and the price was reasonable! The battery life is also a plus! At the request of my husband we recently purchased another one to replace one of another brand that wasn’t as good. This one is as good as the first!
4,Works great with my tablet. Listen to my audiobooks all night no problem.
5,I bought this for my husband for Christmas.  He's a little picky with sound quality. He really seems to love it!  The quality is even better than mine of which I always thought was great. Very pleased with this.
5,Arrived early and well packed. I connected my bluetooth with zero problem and the sound is unbelievable great for the size and cost of this item. I have no complaints.
5,This thing is awesome it has great sound I love it!!
5,Product worked fine for about a week but then it just randomly shorted and now it sounds off. It's a shame I was really starting to enjoy this product.EDIT:The Doss customer service team is impeccable at what they do. They replaced my defective speaker in a timely manner and I’m very happy with my replaced product and would recommend this speaker to my friends and family as it’s a good speaker for its cost.
5,This speaker Box turned out to be much better than I expected really good quality for the price. The sound is actually very good pretty loud.
4,I got it today working great on my phone watching youtube the sound make it sound like im watchin tv. Great boost sounds i now have to waterproof pouches to keep it extra dry and 12 hours of non stop music i am dishwasher and it sucks without music it makes my work go by faster and time flies by.
4,Good product for price.
5,The bass it’s not the best good for bed side
3,This was easy to use and sounded great but it just died after 2 year.  Not sure why.
5,Wow I was surprised with the sound of this product. The size and performance is just what I was looking for.
5,Love the sound! love the price...
5,Sound is very nice and does not sound like a am radio.
5,Updated on 04/03/2017. changed from one star to 5 stars.The 1st one I got was defect. After contacting the company they immediately sent me a new one which works like a charm. Especially thanks Milla's prompt response in a professional manner. Milla's has the best customer services ever.The 15 minutes turn-off function only works with the Bluetooth not if you connect from TV audio out to the speaker.Thank you again Milla for your exceptional customer service!!!
5,Great portable Bluetooth speaker! Was looking for a speaker to play music on from my phone quickly and easily. The set up was less than a minute. Easy to charge. It is a USB charge. You need to provide the wall plug though but easy enough as it fits in my phone charger plug or computer. Lasts a long time without needing to be charged. Great sound too! With it especially for the cost.
5,Very good sound. Pretty loud and full sound
4,Works great sound is great white color looks nice. The top plate did crack after a few uses but it still works perfect and looks good.
5,I love the product and the value for its price. Recommended!
5,Sounds great
5,I had this cute speaker for several months I use it in my car. The sounds is very good no distortions speaker phone works well I love the control panel especially the volume circle. The battery last a long time and it warns you that is running low ahead of time. Overall a very good purchase for the price is a good good deal.
4,Muy bien 👍🏾
4,Hooks up easily controls work well good sound for the price. Held back a star for the loud annoying chirpy sound it makes when connecting.
3,So first of all I love this speaker. It connects pretty quick to my iPhone the volume limit is pretty high and the battery life is amazing. The only thing I dislike is that sometimes it makes a popping sound while my music is playing. I’m not sure if it’s because I got a defective one or it tends to happen once in a while but it does happen. However I still recommend it.
5,I teach a boot camp style class at a gym.  It isn’t a large space but it is a noisy gym.  We use a Tabata timer with music and the volume sound quality and connectivity has been great!
3,I returned this for a full refund. Sounded great when it would stay connected to my phone. The speaker was constantly losing Bluetooth connection.
3,Bought this for my small workout room (9x11).  Even so the sound quality is pretty tinny.  Seems to lack bass.
3,Eeh. It's good.. you get what you pay for. No bass. Still ended up buying a JBL.
5,So clear so loud!  Love it!  My teenage son who loves his music and is very particular about how he listens to it - "borrowed" the speaker and is now in love with it! LOL.  I'll have to get him one as well so I can have mine back.  It's smaller than I expected which is great. Comes with it's own soft carrying case and the battery lasts forever!  Great speaker.
5,Great sound output and quality. The battery life is very lengthy. Not the best for music that has a lot of bass but good for listening to around the house.
5,Liked everything
5,Impressed with the sound and how easy it is to use the device.  At first I had issue of connecting it to my IPAD but that was my issue.  Initially I had connected my wife's ipad to the speakers and discovered you have to disconnect it before trying to connect a different IPAD.  But we love it and look forward to using it in our RV and trips.
5,Welp...well first off 5 stars for the whole customer experience seriously...amazon and it's third party sellers are simply amazing...but this speaker is also so cute and compact I still have to test it out at work to make sure it's loud enough for me...but everything was packed neatly and all...but yes it does get pretty loud but stays clear I played a couple types of songs to see one upbeat with lots of base one with more mellow tones so we shall see how everything goes...hopefully this was helpful...
5,Decline to comment but love it
5,The sound quality is excellent for this speaker. Ring so small.
5,What an amazing Bluetooth speaker. Fantastic tone and quality. A fantastic buy at any price.
4,Great sound for the price good battery life easy set up. I've used this unit more than a dozen times and have zero problems. I would recommend this if you just want decent sound for less than half the price of a lot of the other Bluetooth speakers on the market.
5,Love it doesn’t die fast
5,Got this as a gift for mt husband. He absolutely loves it! Easy to use very clear sound and awesome volume.
5,Bought on sale for $19 plays really loud when in an enclosed room also has good volume when outdoors depending on what your surroundings are. Build quality was exceptional bought the black version.Be sure to plant this down properly on any surface as the bass this gives off will vibrate the speaker thus moving it around the surface.
5,great little speaker. was searching for an inexpensive speaker since it was going to be for my toddler. she loves it. we just synced it to a tablet and she carries it all over the house to wherever she's playing; even takes it outside. great performance at this price point. i like it so much i'm considering getting one for myself to use while working in my workshop and maybe a few for xmas gifts.
5,This speaker has great sound quality. It's a great speaker for the price.
4,I am really enjoying this speaker the sound quality is nice and clear bass is good as well. I use it while working in the garage doing yard work shooting basketball etc. This is the first portable bluetooth speaker I've owned and I'm pleased.
5,If you're not trying to spend a lot of money yet don't want to compromise on getting a horrible quality speaker this speaker is your perfect answer!  It is very good quality and it sound and materials it's made out of. It works well I love the Bluetooth and all the other capabilities and it's very fashionable I love the touch top instead of buttons. It's only $30 for my purchase and definitely worth it.
5,Like everything about it works amazing  got it as a gift  use it in car  out and about different places and events jam in room and shower !!!  Two thumbs up !!!! Thanks
4,Sound quality is set at the factory. Is not adjustable but sounds ok. Convenient for answering phone calls without being distracted from tasks being performed.
3,Let me start with what's good. The sound is surprisingly full with no distortions at a higher volume. Connecting to the the aux port works great. But the Bluetooth connection is not easily achieved and is sometimes lost -- even two feet away. The micro SD card doesn't stay in the slot so I couldn't test that. The Mode function seems to turn the Bluetooth on and off when nothing else is connected. My main problem was the finger-on-lights-navigation with no haptic feedback.The circular volume control is inaccurate at best. These are personal preferences so I think it's still a pretty good little device.
5,This is our second Doss speaker. We were so impressed with the performance ease of use features and value of the first that we had to have another. What amazes us is the big sound from such a small package. Furthermore it compares favorably with speakers costing four times as much or more. I'm singing in the shower again! Don't waste your time or money. Here's your bluetooth speaker!
5,Fast delivery great sound appears to be well made and the Bluetooth link up was automatic.I'm still running on the charge that was in the battery when I received the speaker. (not continuous of course but much better than I expected).
5,This speaker has crystal clear sound and connected to my phone with no issues at all.  Fantastic speaker - especially for the price.  Definitely recommend!
4,Sound quality distorts at high volume. Could pack a little more bass and mids. Battery is good. Connectivity was easy and reliable. Decent overall for the price.
3,I have had this for over a year now and it worked great and the sound is good. Now the problem is it just turns on by itself and nothing I do wound stop it so now it's in the trash.
4,This is affordable and does the job. It blasts loud. Connects easy. The sound quality is pretty average but still good. Overall 4/5. Best affordable speaker.
5,Love the bubble gum color sound amazing packs a punch in it
5,Great sound for a small speaker
5,I had been pricing the Bose speaker but it was just too expensive for my needs.  I ordered this one-- it is great!  Easy to set up for a non techie like me. When it came I delayed in setting it up because I was afraid that it would be too difficult but when I finally opened the box got out the speaker read the directions and actually tried it the setup was a breeze.  A good product that I highly recommend.
4,I Really like it!!
4,Very nice thus far.  Quality feels good...sound is very good for something of this size.  Let's see how it holds up.  The USB charge port is a concern a over time it gets worn.  And once that fails you're dead in the water.
2,It would be great but it drops Bluetooth signal repeatedly. I wouldn't buy it again.
5,I am amazed at the level of quality especially at this pricepoint. It paired well with my Samsung S7 and the instructions were easily understood. The sound is excellent for a compact Bluetooth speaker. It appears to be well made. I would have paid a bit more if it also offered some drop or water protection but I only intend to use it in the garage and camping trips. Hopefully it won't get damaged.
5,I must say I own other Bluetooth speakers but this one seems to amaze me everytime I play it. The sound blows me away everytime I hear it. I have a Bluetooth speaker with a total of 20watts. I compare the sound of my doss with it the doss sound is more clearer and louder. What an amazing speaker. I recommend to anyone to get it. Did I mention it only cost my 34$.
5,I absolutely love my DOSS speaker (so far). I've only had it about a week but it's more than I expected. Its not heavy but it's not as light as my beats pill. If you want a good sounding speaker at a decent price then I would definitely try this one. I can say that I didn't expect such great sound for $24 bucks so I will definitely be buying another one!!!! (the pink one)
5,I bought this on a deal of the day. The reviews were great and for the price I figured why Not? I have the best and cheapest speaker in my house of 3!! My girlfriend is an audio engineer and she is a freak about the way things sound. She would also recommend this if you are working on a budget
5,Sound quality is pretty great. I was definitely iffy buying a cheaper speaker but it really does work well and it connects very easy to my phone. Very happy with my purchase.
5,Great price loud enough easy to use.
5,Very happy with the purchase easy to use with extra micro sd slot for music though I think it only support up to 32 gb of micro sd ( I tried using 64 gb and it won't work) but still 32 gb is big enough that can store up to 8000 songs. Great sound quality for everyday use Good price for an expensive look design and quality. And the what's best is their customer support which I find it excellent courteous and very helpful!
5,Love it. I works. It can get loud enough. The bottom end is strong for the size of the box. I do sound at my church and I use it to listen to the the live feed to the CD recorder. The only thing I didn't like the tones it emited on start up and power down. I contactes the seller who sent me the software needed to turn it off. Thanks guys!
5,I absolutely love this speaker. A few of my friends have a Bluetooth speaker and I thought they were neat but I wasn't sure exactly how often i'd use it. turns out I use it all the time. Its easy to use sounds amazing easily portable. I absolutely love it. If you're in the market get this one for sure.
4,You can’t beat this little speaker for the price.  The sound is actually quite good.
3,My speaker did not last a whole year. It started turning off and on by itself now I have to replace it and I love this speaker
2,The DOSS replaced a previous model I had that stopped working.  I love the sound quality of the device but found I cannot successfully use it with Bluetooth. I bought this due to the mandatory WFH policy of my company (CoronaVirus.)  I am on global calls all day long. However the phone via BlueTooth drops the sound within 5 minutes of the call.  I have had better luck with the cable from phone to DOSS but that started having issues as well. I was also getting crackling feedback this morning but disconnected the power cord between DOSS and Computer and that fixed that.  I have had this for about 1 week.  Disappointed to say the least.
4,Bought this for my mom and works great for listening to music over Bluetooth. The sound and volume are just fine  for a 20' by 20' size room.. Havn't tried it outdoors. I like that it also has a microphone for answering calls. I'm happy with this purchase.
4,Volume dial sensitive will sometimes turn off instead of turning down volume.
4,Works well Bluetooth has good range I like it's size and compactness. Doesn't sound HD though.
5,We have purchased a Boss speaker for our home in Michigan and in Florida. My husband has trouble hearing the tv because the sound on the tv comes from the back and his hearing aid speaker ate on the back of his ears.  He has the speaker behind him and it works perfect so he can get all of what is being said. Great product and sound at a reasonable price.
4,Very good for the price. Much better then buying an expensive apple product
5,Worked really well the first 3 months  now it doesn't hold a charge and continually skips to next song and pauses music.UPDATE :Warranty service was easy to work with they reached out and I had a new speaker within the next 2 days. The replacement works great.UPDATEWarranty service was easy to work with they reached out and I had a new speaker within the next 2 days. The replacement works great.
5,I was amazed how much sounds come out of a small speaker. Was at a cookout in the park and did a great job!!
2,This product is no better than using an iphone 12 or later for projecting sound.  Returned for more powerful ( and expensive) replacement.
5,As timid as the sound is I still worry about the neighbors feeling the bass being in an apartment building. I feel the bass in the floor. Great sound and bass for the price. It's nothing super impressive but I like it in my kitchen while cooking/cleaning. If I were to take it outdoors or desire a big sound I would spend quadruple. So it certainly serves its purpose of being a secondary audio device. Kudos to the designers of this budget blaster.
5,Great sound for the price. Good bass. Worth the money.
5,Great speaker for the money I take it everywhere so that we can listen to music. I love the phone answering feature. If you get a call while listening to music it seamlessly answers the call for you. I was looking for an inexpensive but good quality bluetooth speaker and this really fits the bill. If you don't want to spend a fortune but want a great little speaker with great sound this is it.
5,For the price- great sounds and battery lasts for a long timeI have Bose 11 and this box sounds close to it
5,this little powerhouse speaker I installed it in the wife's restaurant and only run the volume at 50% and then run Alexa at volume 4... its plenty loud enough this weekend was just me so I ran everything at 10 and I could not hear my phone ring or text. This thing gets loud!! will buy buying more. We run it while plugged in all day to the power.
4,Pretty good sound for the price. Sounds good at high volume. Decent bass for the size. Wish it would go louder. Charging cord short (18ish inches) and doesn't come with a wall adaptor - kind of annoying to me. Good speaker though.
3,This product seems to be built very well and sounds really good for its size. My biggest issue is trying to pair it. I paired it to both my and my wife’s iPhone and both attempts took several tries before it finally showed up as a device. Once paired it seems to remember the pairing and reconnects each time but getting there was a pain.Otherwise I don’t have any issues with the overall build and quality seems like a good product in that regard but I will update my review should anything go south.
4,I purchased this speaker and I have not been disappointed at all!! GREAT BUY!!! I have bought several speakers over the years and for the money this one stacks up for sure!!  I would give it five stars if it went louder
5,This little speaker can jam out  I have used it for a variety of things from baseball games deep cleaning my kitchen backyard barbecues and fire pit evenings.  The battery life is really good and the sound quality put out is also good I can hear it easily and clearly in the next room while cleaning. I bought two of these guys and have another one in the shower and can easily hear it over the sound of the shower also .
4,I love the design I also love the way it sounds in the size is very helpful in handy and stylish!
5,I had one of these speakers then ordered two more for a class reunion. I didn’t charge the two new ones until the week of the event and one would not connect. An email exchange with support resulted in an immediate replacement. These little speakers are great and so is service if needed.
5,I'm giving this product a 5-star review based in part on the very respectable price. I bought this to replace my $100+ Nokia 360 Bluetooth speaker which died prematurely and I'm happier with my purchase than I expected to be. Decent midrange and bass from such a small speaker. One comment: it sounds much better when elevated to approximately shoulder level. Less impressive on a lower surface such as a table or desktop. Overall a very good purchase.
5,Bought this for my 88 year old father so he can hear his TV in another room. It sounds great and bluetooth hook up is a breeze!
5,Awesome speaker! It connected to my samsung s7 with no problems right out of the box. I have enjoyed this speaker so much that I recommended it to several of my family members. It has a very clear nice bass sound. I like that you have to use your finger to "turn" it down or up as in circling it around the center "button" to adjust the volume. It picks up phone calls with no issues and I just love it! Great buy!
5,Outstanding for the price I paid. Use it for work (carpet installer) I hear through the whole house and battery lasts all day long.
4,I’m Very Impressed with the quality of this speaker for the price
5,FANTASTIC for the price. Of course I wish the bass hit harder of course I wish it was even louder. But $30 guys you can't beat it.It's also pretty heavy which makes me feel like there's some quality here.Don't expect a whole house party but it's pretty lit in my 700sq ft apartment.
5,I was looking for a speaker that would enhance my Echo Dot sound. Read most of the reviews on this product which gave it high-marks plus the price was right. It was very east to se up. I've had it for a few days and still have not had to charge it. The sound is REALLY good. Size is just right didn't want something big & bulky. I .recommend this product
5,Good for traveling
3,I bought this on a whim when it was a deal of the day. I got a great deal but was disappointed in the sound quality. Doesn't seem to be much bass. I don't like a ton of bass but this speaker was lacking even for me. For the price it was a fair deal but in retrospect I think if I had heard it first I would have passed even with the sale price.
3,Amazing battery life!! The sound isn’t quite what I was expecting no bass at all. Overall good product tho
5,Wow! what a great mini speaker. It is so loud for the size and bass is surprisingly clear. I got the baby blue one and just love it . Would definitely recommend this. It also comes with 2 cords - USB(charge) & Headphones cord(for your phone) I use only through bluetooth though. Great buy. If you're looking for a speaker for say a big party though i would not recommend
5,Amazing sound for a little speaker! I've got monster JBL and this is one just as good if not better!
5,Very easy to set up and use. Sound quality is good
5,I've only had this a few days so I'm not sure of the battery life .  Item as described  and no issues with shipping. I love the color! I bought this for my office so I like that it is small and convenient to carry. I'm not an expert with sound but it works great for what I needed.
5,These speakers are good quality for the money.  I’ve bought two of them - one for my son and one for my granddaughter.
5,Bought one for each of my twins for Christmas - they love them... the only thing is I might regret it a little because they listen to their music sooo loud! 😂🤣 But  they love them!
5,This little speaker is amazing. We also have a Bose portable speaker and the sound from this DOSS box is so close to the Bose it's hard to tell the difference.  And I'm extremely happy with that because $30 odd compared to $100 odd is fantastic.  What little difference in sound there is I don't worry about and we are extremely happy with it.
5,I use with my Alexa music. Perfect
3,For a small speaker the sound quality is decent not great. The deal breaker for me is having to adjust the volume by sliding my finger around the circular light on top - I teach a class where I need to be able to adjust the volume frequently and using this sliding technique is inaccurate and sometimes didn't even work. A button or knob would be much better.
4,Great and loud sound but almost not much bass incase you like rap or hip-hop songs.
5,This was the best Father’s Day gift - it’s a great product and the sound is awesome
4,Very nice sound.  I didn't notice in the product description that it has a built in microphone so that you can also take phone calls over it.  What a deal!Now I've bought a second one as a gift.  Great sound.  Good base.
5,Very nice product - lots a great value for the price.
4,Good sound. Could be a little louder due to use in the shop.
5,I used many portable speakers but this one is the best of all!
1,Very poor quality sound the higher the volume the worse the sound.
4,This is a good lightweight speaker in a general sense. It doesn't put out a lot of wattage nor does it generate substantial bass. But for the price it has sufficient bass mid-range & high-range capability.
5,I LOVE this wonderful little speaker.  It's so easy to use and WIRELESS!  Charges fast and easy on the computer and the sound is incredible.  It's actually too loud at times and I have to turn it down --- which is amazing given the very small size of this gem.  I might buy more of these -- to have all over the house. Wowwy wow wow.
5,Easy to connect and great sound. I contacted the company to ask about the firmware upgrade that will allow the battery saving shut off to be eliminated. Not only did they reply promptly but also offered to send me the SD card that is needed for that upgrade.  I highly recommend this speaker.
5,I love this little speaker.  Sounds greatI bought a second one to give as a gift.Affordable price too
5,This is an amazing speaker. It has a nice and clear sound looks gorgeous and just attracts a lot of attention from everyone. A lot of people have asked me about it and I gave them honest sincere recommendation on buying this speaker. I've only had it for less than a week but so far it's good. I'll make sure to update if anything goes wrong but it's impossible at this point. If I don't damage the speaker myself there's no wai it will magically stop functioning.
5,I love this speaker so much I bought another one to keep at work. Great bass music sounds amazing through this speaker! Also great for the price!
5,Nice sound use in my classes to stream music from Mac iPad and phone.  Connects right up  sounds fine. Nice built in base/treble balance. good volume controlled by broadcasting blutetooth device.
4,Fantastic little speaker! This guy puts out great sound and has great bass thumps to go along with it. Bluetooth connection is easy and functionality is superb.
3,
4,volume is great. but wish there was a USB port
5,This thing is incredible. Literally the best sound box I've ever purchased! Charges crazy fast can be wireless w/ bluetooth. Perfect for jamming out around the house in the back yard or honestly wherever. The thing is portable! Great sound too. Can have this in my living room and hear it throughout my house. Hope my family likes radios. They're all getting one for Christmas!
5,I have two of these.  One I keep in my car and the other at home.  I use it for music and for watching videos.  The sound is great and the battery lasts for a long time.
5,I bought this on Prime Day for a steal in hopes of getting something small and easy transportable plus good sound quality for our garage gym/home when I’m jamming out while cleaning. Very loud for such a small device too! I highly recommend this! It definitely surpassed my expectations.
5,Like I said - Plenty of boom for your buck.  This little box is surprising good you could probably calm a Cat 2 Hurricane just by playing a Kenny G song on this device .  Get you one.
5,Product works great. Connects quickly and sounds great. Haven't had long enough to determine battery life.
3,The Bluetooth connection works but the sound quality if OK not great.  But I guess it is to be expected at that price range
5,This little speaker more than met my expectations. It is quite a bargain for the amount that I paid for it. It could use a little more base and then it would be perfect. So if your looking for a good sounding little blue tooth speaker that does not cost a lot look no further!.
3,It is a great speaker but it has a malfunction. I will be in a middle of a song and suddenly the speaker will start spazzing and skip through my songs. When I first bought the speaker I thought I wouldn't mind but now it's just annoying. It is a good speaker but I would like to enjoy my music without interruption
5,I love this box. I take it with me when I travel. In hotel room I listen to all my music. Never a problem connecting. The sound is great. Battery life last a long time. Buying more as gifts.
5,Speaker has great sounds quality and lasts hours before needing a charge!
5,I paid 19 on a deal of the day and amazed at the sound for the money and the battery last a long long time.  Easy to carry light weight and great sound this little speaker is hard to beat for the money.  I would recommend this speaker.
5,Quality product. There is some heft to it. Solid build. Sound quality is great. Pairing is easy. Touch controls are responsive and gives of a high tech vibe. Would recommend
1,I purchased the Doss Bluetooth Speaker for a Christmas gift it worked for less than four months. The charger light quit working after we used it twice which obviously indicated it was no longer charging. Amazon Tech Team tried to troubleshoot The Doss SoundBoc Touch Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker but it seems to be dead. I tried to contact the seller and have had no luck.
5,I am not an audiophile.  This sounds great to me.  I have a pretty large one bedroom apartment and it gets LOUD and distance wise I havent had any problems with my phone being too far from the speaker for bluetooth.  Love not listening to Spotify or podcasts on my phone.  This is great.  The buttons are nice to have too but I don't find myself using them very frequently.
2,I loved the speaker since i bought it. great sound very versatile easy to use probably with little problems of multiple devices on bluetooth. something expected. Bought the speaker in september 2018. unfortunately in july 2019 it stop working. In Peru we have really good technicians. they openned the device and the board got damaged nothing they can do to fix it. I tought this kind of things happen. but i have to take my old 2008 JBL and all it makes me think is that the good brands last longer. cheap stuff not really.By the way if anyone can assit me how to get a new mainboard that will be lovely. seems like the board inside has the bluetooth on and off i mean all in one board. Please let me know if anyone knows. cheers
5,Love this thing sound packs a punch!
5,Great blue tooth connection throughout the houseWorth the price
5,Better than I expected! Perfect for what I wanted in the kitchen. Great sound holds a charge very well.
5,Love this! Does exactly what it says it does!
3,I feel like the sound is good...however I believe I received a faulty product when I purchased a brand new one. The sound seems to be going in and out so I’m not really sure.
5,I like the design of this product and it fits into my purse perfectly so I can carry it around. The sound quality is good too.
5,I am now cord free!  Highly recommend this speaker.
5,Was pleasantly surprised how great the sound was! Also loved how easy it was to connect via Bluetooth. Really great quality for an amazing price. I bought the case for it—it is an excellent deal too and really nice!!!
1,I was really happy when I got this speaker. I agreed with pretty much all the reviews volume is perfect (loud and clear.) Size is cute and perfect.  Battery lasts a long time (too long!). Unfortunately the sound box stopped working in less than a month!  For some crazy reason it stopped connecting to my phone and it will make this annoying sounds like it wants to pair but it doesn’t.  Worst thing is that I CAN’T TURN IT OFF!!  And yes! This is when I realize that the battery lasts a really really long time!  I tried trouble shooting like the manual says but no luck.  I am trying to return it now but the thing doesn’t shut off!  So frustrating specially at night.  Yes I have it downstairs and in a box ready to be shipped back but we can still hear it!  The volume is stuck in a high enough lever that even with the shipping box and close doors we can hear it in the middle of the night - I am a really light sleeper.
4,This works well for a portable speaker. We use it in the locker room where phones are not allowed. It has a nice range and is easy to control. I wish it could get a little louder.
5,I was a bit worried due to the price but works great I can use it several times without having to charge it.
5,I've had this for about 6 months now and still haven't had to charge it and I use it A LOT. The sound quality is great and its super small and light so you can move it around. The only thing is when I connect it to my Mac it glitches a little and doesn't sound very good so wouldn't recommend it for that. Otherwise it's a great buy!
4,Instructions could be a bit more through but overall it is a nice cost effective way to listen to your iPod or mobile phone.
4,Good speaker for the money. Looks nice and decent sound- good value
5,I use this with my Echo and it sounds great.  It shuts off after a few minutes when I no longer playing music which I like because sometimes I forget.  You will know when it needs to be charged it makes a beeping kind of sound.  I can move it to any room and still it works great.
5,For a little speaker it provides loud sound.
5,I absolutely love my bluetooth speaker box.
5,I purchased this for my sister and brother-in-law last year.  They stated that this was by far their favorite gift - and I'm glad! It was very inexpensive when I bought it (around $20).  We've played music on it many times and the sound quality is awesome.  Highly recommend to anyone with a Pandora playlist and a smart phone.
5,Sound is great battery life is pretty long. I mean I use it all day and it hasn't run out on me yet. I do charge it before I go to bed.it connects automatically. I love this product
5,Just got it for a friend very surprised by the sound
5,Great little speaker. Perfect travel size.
5,Very good. The sound quality is also very good for the size of the speaker. Almost every time I use it people ask me how much I bought it and where. The battery life is also great. I recommend it!
4,Looks really good and love the buttons and sound !It works for me.
5,I love it i use it for my TV so my roommates don't hear it late at night. I keep it on my nightstand.
4,needs mute button
4,It is light weight sounds good and the price was right. I didn't like it at first because I didn't know how to get it to switch to using the aux line. As soon as I read the instruction it made perfect sense and all is good.
5,Love this speaker overall. When starting it up it is rather loud but once you get through the initial turning it on it’s got good sound quality and the battery lasts well. It also has a nice feature that if you put your timer on it shuts off when the timer goes off.
3,This is a good speaker sound and bass are great. My only issue is that it doesn’t last 12 hours and it’s loud but not for factory work. It is soft in a factory all I have been looking for is a loud speaker for factory assembly so my peers an I can have something to listen to other then the banging and clinging of metal. But it is a grade A speaker for probably small events outside or in it did last 8 hours without dying as well so that’s a lot of play time.
3,For the price I think it's worth the money. However it does NOT get very loud. I teach in the performing arts and wanted to be able to use it for class and for show practice but it doesn't get loud enough to use. If you just need a speaker that can project for personal use in your home or the pool it's probably worth it. If you need it to get loud invest in something a little more expensive that will project more sound.
4,My grandson loves it
5,It is a bit tinny at the high frequencies but for the price it is just fine.  Plays most music great and perfect in the midrange.  It takes about 30 seconds to link to the bluetooth once it is set up. We used it for the echo dot and can use it just about anywhere in the house.  Much better sound than the echo dot.
4,I originally purchase this speaker and I gave a negative review but the 1st one I had was defective... They were so grateful to send me another one and it works perfectly... Not much bass but the music still sounds good I'm happy with this purchase
5,I've been looking for an inexpensive easy bluetooth speaker and this one checks all the boxes. It's loud enough (even for me). I like it more than a friend's Jawbone. I didn't have to read the directions to use it. I'll probably get another one. If I could daisy chain them that would be a bonus. (and I don't know that I can't -- does anyone know if that's an option?)
5,I love the volume control on this speaker and it make a nice night light in the bedroom. I also have a sony  XB20 . That is a great sounding speaker with bass  and about the same size but cost over twice the price of this speaker.  But still this speaker is nice sounding and for the price very good quality.
5,Have had this a little over a month and we love it! It works so well and the size is perfect! The sound is incredible as well. Perfect for camping and hiking or working in the garage or backyard.
4,It's definitely a powerful little speaker but I dont feel as though the bass is as rich as it could be but overall for the price great buy.
5,Product works as expected Good sound overall. Contacted DOSS to get firmware upgrade to avoid voice announce each change of mode etc easily done. The lack of the ability to navigate to different albums (folders) can be overcome by labeling music files in the root with a numeric prefix for artist then play ascending or descending. If this DOSS unit has a shortcoming it is navigation. I am hopeful this will be improved with future firmware releases. thanks.
5,I got this last year as a secret Santa gift loved it so much that I bought it to give as this year’s secret Santa gift. I highly recommend the sound that comes out of it is high quality.
5,This little bluetooth speaker packs a pretty good wallop.  The highs and mids sparkle and while the bass doesn't have an equivalent punch you do hear some low end in the music.  I use it mostly to listen to blues music on the amazon prime station either outside on the patio or in a small 8 X 10 bar area off our kitchen.  Sounds great the battery lasts a long time and recharges quickly via a 120 V outlet.  Amazing buy for the price.
2,Complete waste of money — this speaker  skips through to a new song CONSTANTLY — I still have not listened to a single song all the way through — I waited too long to take it out of the box and missed the return window but I will contact the company. Don’t throw your money away on this stinker.
5,Works well easy to connect plenty of volume.  Adds a lot to a trip to the beach!
5,Love this portable speaker! The battery lasts for ages—I only charge about once per week and I use it on a daily basis during showers cooking and yoga throughout the day. Packs a big sound for such a small package. The bass frequencies are surprisingly powerful. Perfect for a day at the beach or a bbq/picnic outside. Highly recommend!
5,I bought this for my husband for our home gym; our last one another brand just wasn't reliable. He loves this! Connectivity is excellent and the volume is just what he needs especially when on cardio equipment. Great value for the amount I paid!
5,Muy buen productobuena batería y sonido claro y con algo de bass
3,works well good sound for small cheap thing. Update 5/20/20 it's dead. I put it on the outside of my shower curtain on the edge of my tub. Somehow water got around the curtain and  fully filled the inside of unit with water because of the vents at top and bottom.  Water went in easy but once full of water it was difficult to get out. I noticed it sounded like it was drowning  It kept playing till I moved it. DO NOT GET THIS THING WET!
4,Pretty decent as long as you dont expect to use it very loudly. Nice for watching movies or listening to music with 2-3 other people. Not loud enough for a house party or anything like that. As long as you know that its a great value for the price
4,Looks nice good quality but not quite as loud as I would like. But it will do.
5,I’d like to buy two or three more of these but only if I could get the ‘deal of the day’ price I got on my original orders — simple - fantastic sound very easy controls - wish I would have bought 3 more of these on the deal of the day price.
4,The sound is super clear. Instructions on how to use it is very simple and easy. Gave it a 4 star because my husband was a bit disappointed that there wasn’t any bass. It’s a great speaker tho. My kids were dancing around the whole house!
1,I have had the speaker for a few months. It sounds great. I have it connected to my PC with auxiliary cord because it would not connect with Bluetooth even though it was discovered.In moving some things around I had to disconnect the auxiliary cord. When I plugged it back in the speaker will not stay on. It turns itself off every 20 seconds. The manual says it will turn it self off after 15 minutes or when the battery is low. Well it doesn't stay on for 15 minutes and it isn't using the battery as it continuously plugged in.Unfortunately the time has passed to return it. Very sad right now.
2,To start off I own the DOSS soundbox XL and LOVE IT.  I saw this product and had high expectations for this from my previous experience with this  brand.  However when cranking this smaller version up the sound gets muddy and the bass is almost non-existent.  I own 7 smaller portable bluetooth speakers Anker Bose JBL Oontz and others.  For the price range it sounds very similar to my Oontz Angle though I think the Oontz edges it out in sound.  For the size my Anker Soundcore Sport XL delivers better sound and bass.  I think that the DOSS name is what influenced me to buy this speaker hoping it would sound like its bigger cousin.Pros:  The controls are pretty sweet.  It has a cool touch-dial for sound.  Bluetooth connectivity is superior to my other portable speakers.Cons: Sound quality is sub-par.
5,The speaker came on time and in good condition. The Bluetooth connected simple enough and was up and running fairly quickly.
3,Design is nice. Compact. Easy to setup. The sound gets distorted quickly when turning up- not as loud as I would like but will probably fit the needs of most. Don't misunderstand- it is pretty loud- but with iPhone on max volume I can turn Alexa up about 75% but at around 80% it begins to get distorted sounding. I could try to lower volume on phone and turn volume up on Alexa to see if that has an effect but have not tried. It meets my needs
5,I love this speak it's crisp and clear and the battery life is decent  I use this speaker to watch netflix on my tablet by using the bluetooth on it works great with the money which is a good price
5,The speaker arrived right on time.  The unit itself is nicely finished and solidly built.  I like the touch controls and the effortless pairing with other Bluetooth devices.  The unit is not real heavy on the bass but is acceptable given the size of the unit.  The main thing is that is sufficiently loud and clear.
5,Sound is great! Love the size and versatility
5,Battery lasts forever and the bluetooth stays connected more than halfway across the house.  Also works great for speaker phone.  I can talk on the phone and wash dishes at the same time now.
5,Thing is pretty solid great deal for the price...and more. I can turn it all the way up(with the swirl of a finger *giggity*) and I don't hear blaring bass like the bad kind. Better watch out where you place it the bass will rumble it off the shelf if you ain't careful...
3,This worked great for 6 months but last night I charged it for the last time before it died! I hope the company can do something to help fix this problem!!!UPDATE: The company replaced the broken one. BUT the new one likes to make my phone skip to the next song mid song on its own for some reason on Pandora. Very annoying when your enjoying a song and all of a sudden it's off and a new song is playing....there is a flaw in the product.
4,The 1st speaker was fuzzy but my replacement was was great!!
4,Good sound quality connected very easy via bluetooth to my IPOD since I play all my music on it rather than using up all the space on my android for music storage. Frustration free packing very simple to set up and the red really stands.
5,I had a problem connecting this unit to Alexa. I called DOSS customer service who walked me through the set up process without any luck. Without hesitation they sent me a new unit immediately. When the new unit arrived it worked beautifully.EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE. I highly recommend them.
5,What I loved about this product is that the speaker is wireless Bluetooth and it has some bass too it. It’s well worth the money.
4,Great buy! Sound quality and battery life is good
5,The sound quality of this speaker is amazing and priced nicely!!!  Would highly recommend.
1,I received this speaker today and could. Ot wait to try it out as my daughter needs soft music plating in order to fall asleep.  This speaker acts like it is possessed!  It will not stay off when you turn it off.  It repeatedly turns itself on constantly making the chime noises to turn itself back on even after I press the off button (which makes it disruptive to the whole sleeping process) and which will also impact the battery life.  By 3am I had to get up and but tge speaker in thebasement because it was so disruptive constantly turning itself on and off it was waking up myself and my kids.  I even disconnected it from my phone and it would still turn itself in and off.  This speaker could be used as a torture device as it causes sleep depravation.The manual states that the machine will turn itself off after 15 minutes of non use while it will do that it will turn itself back on randomly.  Shutting off a device shouldn’t be so infuriating.  I will be sending it back and purchasing a Jambox speaker (which I previously had and it did not turn on whenever it wanted).  So frustrating!
5,This speaker has extreme amount of bass for as small as it is and the touch sensitive buttons are a huge plus. Love this item and need to buy more for a couple other family members just cause its really nice sound and one for me too!
5,This product is great and I recommend it to anyone Good sound quality but not loud enough to blast entire neighborhood! It’s perfect and has a charger as well.
3,You get what you pay for. Spend a little more and get a better quality speaker.
4,My boyfriend bought this speaker a while back and I was so impressed with it I decided to get my own. The only complaint is that there’s sometimes some annoying conflict with other Bluetooth devices nearby.
4,This speaker is not bad. Easy to connect. Use cable to hook up will provide better sound effects than connect by BT but BT connecting range is kind of short. If you take your phone far to about 8 feet it will start to be unstable.
5,I have had this speaker now for over 2 years and it continues to producing amazing sounds.  Mainly used for golfing it has fallen from the cart more than a dozen times and always keep booming out the music.  It can make it 27 holes ( 6+ hours) on a single charge and has proven to be extremely durable.  Highly recommended!
5,Easy setup  great bluetooth connectivity awesome sound
5,Love this speaker. Sound is amazing
4,So far so good
5,Nothing wrong with it. Very good if we consider the price.
4,Dont know how this sound or anything  it's a present
5,The amazon tablets have limited sound volume.  This bluetooth speaker is easy to use and makes the volume loud enough to listen to from a distance  It is not too big but it delivers good bass.  Well made dropped it on the carpet a few times and still looks brand new.
3,Its cute. Great for small spaces. Its not harass your neighbors loud. My neighbor didnt know i was even home let alone that i had music playing and we can hear eachouther sneeze. The sound quality gets crackly the louder it gets and depending on the songs acoustics. Its great for being so cheap i guess. Though I may have spent the extra $10 on something a little more agressive. Debating a return or not. The volume only goes as oud as the decice its playing from.
5,This is a great speaker for a reasonable price.  Easy to connect to a smart phone or other Bluetooth device.  I use it by the pool.  The volume levels are perfect for background music while I'm reading or for entertainment music when there is a group in the pool.
4,It is nice and compact but the bass is a little underwhelming.
5,I love this little speaker it has made my life better. The only downside It makes a funny little noise (sometimes very loudly) when starting up. Sounds great - and it's cute!
5,Exactly what I was looking for could not be happyer
5,I ordered one for myself. My sister came to visit me and was very impressed with the Doss Bluetooth speaker. I sent her one as a gift.
5,Great Sound quality easy to charge & use.
4,Great sound for the money. Bluetooth or hooking up to ipod
5,I did get a really good deal on this speaker but we love it.  We take it outside on the deck to listen by the pool.  We bring it in the house to hear throughout.  Quality of the sound is great!  Deep bass as well.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I just got this speaker and it already went to its grave. It would start playing for a few minutes then the sound will go out and it would switch to making an annoying noise. I know it didn't cost that much but this is unacceptable.There's also the annoying fact that the speaker would auto shut down if you stop playing sound on it for a few minutes. I understand the reason for a feature like this but there should have been the option to turn it off.
5,This speaker has an awesome sound!  Unfortunately we bought this for our 20 year old granddaughter who lives with us and I can now hear her awful taste in music much louder and clearer than ever before.
5,Let me put it this way while watching a horror flick at night on my porch in the country this speaker actually made me reach for my pistol. I'm amazed at how well the stereo is from such a small unit it's almost like surround sound.Bass is excellent volume is sufficient to make your neighbor either tell you that your taste in music is awful or "crank that *stuff* up!" Very pleased with this purchase.
5,I can’t get over how good this speaker sounds!  Easy to connect and use so glad we took a chance on it.
5,Got this for my wife to stream music from her Kindle. Wow the sound is remarkably excellent. With all speakers like this you have remember to raise the volume on the master audio source which for us was the Kindle.  To achieve the rich full sound make sure the source volume is up enough to drive speaker.
4,Kinda basic. But all in all a great little speaker
5,Although it lacks a light show and brand name like JBL it is waaaaay better and cheaper than the JBL Pulse. Love the features and the blue color is super cool. Arrived very fast and safely intact. I am pleased. BUY 2! Get the storage/carry case too. Comes with strap and super cute. Also can play speaker while in case.
5,Everything is as described by the seller.
2,I ordered this based on many positive reviews. I found this item to look and feel solid and well made. I like the lighted control panel however once I got it paired with my phone I was extremely disappointed with the horrible sound quality.I have a small BLUEDIO speaker that I purchased two years ago that sounds so much better than this one. My old speaker has some button issue but still works. I'll just continue to use my old bluetooth speaker instead of this new DOSS - I hate the sound!This DOSS speaker is loud but sounds totally FLAT - no bass and no treble. It just sounds bad. Reminds me of an old AM transistor radio from the 70's.I have no use for this item but Amazon wants to charge me nearly $8.00 to return it! What a rip off! I'm unhappy with this purchase. I thought Amazon offered free refunds guess I was wrong!
2,Sometimes the sound would be good other times the music would be filled with static!  The longer the music was on the worse it got. When moving the round blue volume control on top of the speaker it makes a beeping sound and sometimes it makes another irritating sound.  Very disappointed!  The reason for waiting so long to write this review was that I kept trying and hoping it would finally play correctly.  Also I am a complete novice in technology and want someone knowledgeable to check it out which finally happened just recently.  I know it's too late to return it but felt that it was important that I write this review.
4,Great product for the price. Just right don't expect a Bose but it's a decent speaker.
2,Only 2 starts but not because it doesn't sound good it does.  In my case it is connected via cable to an Amazon Dot so I never change the mode setting (Aux in) and I can control the volume using Alexa.  The Dot and the speaker are on my nightstand next to the bed.  My complaint is the 4 backlit touch keys and the volume control ring on the top of the speaker are incredible bright and they're always on.  They don't turn off automatically when not in use and you can't turn them off or dim them manually.  They are so bright and annoying that I had to cover them in order to sleep.  Such a stupid design flaw.  Not that they are bright but that you have no control over them.  If you use the speaker in a different location you might not consider the bright lights a problem but if you want to sleep next to it look for another option.
3,I'm very impressed with the sound quality and depth of the audio lower end bass. Two 6W drivers deliver the sound.After using this device for a while I am not pleased with the touch controls as they sometimes accidentally activate when brushed over. I plugged the 3.5mm cable into the jack and the speaker was frozen in Micro card mode and wouldn't turn off. I left it on all night to discharge it plugged into the charger to charge now it won't turn on at all. The warranty is too short; I bought two of them.
4,This is a nice little speaker. I use this in the baby's room to play classical music. It's hooked up to an iPod. My only complaint is that there are no volume buttons on the top. You have to use the volume of the streaming device.
5,Love how it lets you know on your phone how long does it have till the speakers dies and love how you can lower and turn up the volume with out touching your phone
4,The sound quality isn't quite as good as I'd hoped but for the price and size/ease of carrying around its worth it!
3,I bought this soundbox about a month ago.  This sounded great when I bought it but I’ve noticed now I lose certain sounds and if I turn it up past a certain volume it gets crackly.  It works for the cost but it’s not anything special.
5,Extremely impressed with the sound quality for the money. It’s lighter weight than I thought it would be but huge sound. Got this as a Christmas gift for my dad and it’s easy enough to use for him to figure out. One thing I do wish it has was an adapter for the charger cord you must plug it into a computer usb or have your own power block.
5,I purchased this speaker to go with my Alexa Echo Dot. It is AWESOME! Has great sound quality and is easy to get set up. I liked it so much I bought one for my son.  The speaker has rubber knobs on the bottom so it doesn't slide around. It lasts a long time on a charge. Charges on a universal connection like a Kindle or android phone.
5,Great quality for a good price. Do yourself a favor and do not over spend on other wireless speaker brands when you can get big sound for a little cash. High quality easy to operate. I truly love this product. Buy one and you will love it too best cash you can spend.If you over spend that one is all on you.
4,The sound is clear but wish it was able to be louder.
4,I don't dislike anything about the speaker. Well made sounds good and easily connects to my phone. Very satisfied. Thank you.
2,The sound quality quality on this is not that good. It is pretty. Also pretty heavy. Connectivity was easy.
5,If you are looking for a sleek great sounding speaker then this is the one. I work overnight in a grocery store.  It has 37 aisle and you can hear it clear at the last aisle.
5,This speaker has really nice sound quality! It’s small but really packs a punch even with songs that have heavy bass. I love that the buttons are touch sensitive and it makes the unit really streamlined. Would recommmend.
4,My older bluetooth speaker has a horrible bluetooth range.  My son walked around the outside of our house and this stayed connected quite well!
4,Price was right and it hooks up quick and plays well and is easy to operate. So far the battery life seems alright. Okay if listening in confined area but if you want something loud in a large area might want to get something else.
5,Actually I rate this speaker a 4.5 but that's not an option here. Out of the box the unit looks very nice and feels expensive and the sound quality as well as controls are very good to near excellent. Give it 6 more watts of power to the speakers and you've got a 5 star product. Highly recommend at this price point.  Even came with a nifty little desktop bt speaker (3 watts) that sounds equals good.
5,Just received it yesterday. It is very light and has a sleek design. I'm a lay person when it comes to sound systems and all that but the sound is great in my opinion and louder than I had anticipated. I like to jam out and it's doing the job for me. It has clear bright lights on the top and comes with an aux cord which is convenient. Definitely worth it for the good price
5,This was an awesome by I took it to work today and I didn't have to listen to all of that are there music that other people play I was able to have my music and awesome and I'm very grateful for this
5,Fantastic little speaker for the price. I had an iHome which is being replaced with this. I was pleasantly surprised that it can skip/pause/rewind songs even when playing from Alexa. Features I like the most:- re-pairs with Alexa and phone without issues once turned on.- once music stops it turns off automatically when not used so it does not drain the battery- very very long battery life
5,The Doss unit is an exceptional value. I am very happy with it's performance so far. Excellent hi-fidelity stereo sound!! The Bass response is especially impressive!!I'm going to recommend this to.my musician friends and music enthusiasts. I wouldn't hesitate to get a 2nd unit if I need one. Get this  as a gift for any one you know who has been needing a small Bluetooth stereo speaker!!
4,Price point is good for what you get
5,I really really like this bluetooth speaker. It connects easily to my phone. The battery lasts about 8 hours. I use my speaker to listen to music while I shower. It does allow you to answer phone calls while connected.  I don't have no complaints with this product.
5,Have been very happy with this speaker. I’ve had it in my golf bag for a couple of years. Still works great!
4,Very good speaker for this price. Bought this to connect to my Echo Dot. Add the cost of both and equals half the price for the Amazon Echo plus now you have a Bluetooth speaker to place anywhere. Doesn't compare to the sound from a Bose or Sony butthose cost $150 and up
5,I loved the sound so good
5,Recommend - would purchase again!
5,Fantastic !!!! Is a yes!!! I would recommended without hesitation. Great sound and battery durable enough .
5,Great sound quality and battery life
5,Have always enjoyed listening to music while cleaning the house but don't care to wear headphones. This speaker is great. Love the idea that I can just take it from room to room with no wires. The sound is great!! Loud enough to hear it over the vacuum. Love this so much we bought a second one for my husband while in the garage.
5,This was given as a gift and it works so great! have had no issues since
