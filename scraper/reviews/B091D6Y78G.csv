4,***UPDATE # - August 2019 - So I am not sure when or how but the issues with random discounts of android phones has gotten a lot better.  It almost never happens anymore.  The router did not update firmware since April so the likely cause of the improvement must be in the phones themselves (same phones still connecting daily) or in the removal of some external interference.  Whatever it is nice to have stable and reliable wifi on my phone again!***UPDATE 2 - April 2019  So right after I added the update below I started having an issue where all of the android phones in my house will randomly loose data connection (not all at the same time) to the router (they still see it as the wifi symbol is still on but the LTE symbol will also light up).  This loss normally is short lived but VERY annoying as it interrupts any internet activity on the phone.  Sometimes however we have to turn the wifi on the phone off and back on to get data back.  I am not sure yet if it is the phones (All Samsung Galaxy S devices 5 through 9) or the router but I do not seem to have the same issues at work on my S8 so I am thinking it may be the router.  I will update when I know more or if anyone reading this knows something let me know.  I have tried resetting the phones to original settings with no change.****** UPDATE I have been using the RT-ACRH17 for about a YEAR now and so far so good.  I have only expierenced one drop out of wifi that I can attribute to the router rather than my ISP (Comcast).  I have my phone connected to the 5 GHz band and it has great signal even on the second floor (router is in the basement) so signal strength is good.  Haven't made any settings changes recently so don't know if Asus fixed the reboot issue but I do know that the firmware has self updated.  Don't know when it happens until i go into the user interface and it has a new firmware listed.  Still no dd-wrt support but otherwise a great router! ***First a quick summary The good:  The wifi speed and coverage is excellent. Features for the price rocks (this unit has the hardware of an AC1900 router).  Now for the no so good: Setup was sub-par at best but how often are you changing you router settings anyway?  No ddwrt support (at least not yet).  Only one USB port (but it is USB 3.0).So I bought this router to replace an aging Linksys unit (EA3500 I know I know).  I ALMOST gave up on this router and sent it back as the setup process was HORRIBLE.  EVERY change required a system reboot that took AT LEAST a minute!  Change the wifi channel on the 2.4 GHz band = reboot change the SSID for the 5 GHz band = reboot etc (yes even the change you want to ask about too).  I did some reading on line and found that some people found that a BIOS update fixed this and made the reboots faster however I updated the BIOS and still have this issue with nearly every change there does not appear to be a pattern now of what requires a reboot and what does not.  I hope ASUS fixes this SOON but really I don't change my settings often so not that big of an issue.Once I got it setup I noted that coverage area and signal strength were approximately the same as the EA3500 to maybe slightly better throughout my house.  The BIG difference comes in the link speeds I am seeing.  Previously I was seeing max internet speeds in the area of 30 to 50 Mbps (I have 60 Mbps internet) on the first and second floor of my house (the router is in the basement) depending on the room you are in.  With the ASUS I now get 50 to 60 Mbps speeds throughout the entire house and 5 to 20 Mbps in my yard.I have connected a 2TB USB 2.0 HD to the USB port on the router and it works great as a media server although a bit slow (but this is the fault of the HD enclosure as it is only USB 2.0.  In fact ALL of my streaming devices (I have 9 in the house between my wife and the kids) see the HD more readily (I have to wait for each device to "FIND" the server if it is asleep but not the drive connected to this router) than the dedicated media server I have connected to my NAS.  I am considering purchasing a USB 3.0 enclosure and shutting down the media server entirely.Speaking of the nine streaming devices I have in my house at any given time I can have six or eight devices streaming (Two to four laptops two Rokus two to four cell phones and up to four tablets).  I have had up to 16 devices connected to my network either gaming or streaming media at one time (I have two daughters and they BOTH had friends over last weekend along with my wife and I).  At no time did I experience any trouble with my WiFi disconnecting although at times I did notice slow downs to around 15 to 20 Mbps.The four port switch on the rear does provide full gigabit bandwidth to all four devices connected and the modem so no concerns here.  As some reviewers have noted all of the lights for the router are are on the top front of the unit with no LEDs next to the switch ports.  This is not an issue with me but may be for some.The processor at the heart of this router is a quad-core ARM Cortex A7 by Qualcomm (IPQ4019) running at 717 MHz.  The specs on the Qualcomm site note that this SoC is a 2x2 MIMO chip with ASUS claiming the RT_ACRH17 as 3x3.  I have not tested this so do not know which is correct.  But I can tell you that I have never seen the four CPU cores at over 50% even with all the streaming this past weekend!  Flash is a comfortable 128 MB with 256 MB RAM so good enough for future third party BIOS (Hopefully).My biggest concern with this router is that at least so far there is NO ddwrt support of the device.  Currently as this is a new device and ASUS is still actively supporting it this is a minor issue as the OEM firmware has decent features.  However once this unit is no longer supported by ASUS this may become a significant issue as old router firmware is very unsecure.I will update as I use this router more but feel free to ask me questions and I will try to answer them.
4,This review is for Asus RT-ACRH17 AC1700 model.I've been using this router for a month or so upgrading from an outdated NetGear DGN2200 N300 ADSL2+ Modem Router v4.  been running smoothly 24x7 (powered through a UPS) and serving some 12 devices (2 PCs 3 consoles one Smart TV and the rest android mobile devices).The packaging is kind of cheap the top cover is plain carton. mine arrived intact luckily but there is room for improvement Asus!The RAM is at 45% utilization most of the time and the powerful CPU rarely spikes to 20% (below 10% most of the time).  The router remains cool (spring time here no A/C yet house temperature some 24C/76F the router temperature remains around 30C/86F.The range is decent using the 2.4GHz (i live in a large 330SQM/3300SQF condo steel-reinforced concrete walls) all the house is fully covered weakest point is -75dBm or some 45% signal strength with 4 walls in between rare disconnects most other points -60dBm or +80% signal strength no disconnect whatsoever.However when using the 5GHz the range is VERY poor -80dBm with 2 walls in between at any point (less than 10 meters/33 feet distance) and hence my 4 stars.I have only one MU-MIMO capable device so i cannot tell if the feature is useful. as for Beam-Forming/AI-Radar well the range of the AC network is too short so i don't think it's worth it. Well i got them built-in who cares! ready for the future :-)Speed is great a huge improvement over my last Netgear DGN2200. with the 5GHz i am doing everything i ever wanted to do: remote play of PS4 Pro to PC at 1080p max settings stream 4k MKV video files using PLEX to my LG TV stream my 3TB FLAC music library to my Harman sound system and all my family Youtube and mobiles use (family of 4).I didn't use the gigabit LAN ports yet so I cannot write about this topic.My Guests are well entertained with the Guest network and there are lots of controls on which guests can login for how long and what bandwidth can they use.I am considered to be a tech savvy guy yet i can say that the setup was a plug and play easy process for any user.  I was up and running with defaults in less than 3 minutes.The router web and Mobile management interface are extremely easy to use with hints on every acronym/function.  The system monitor is great and almost instantaneous. the router automatically performed 2 firmware updates (in once month this is a healthy indicator Asus is actively improving the device).The parental control feature is very simple and basic too. you can set which devices can login at what hours and days and put a cap on download/upload speeds. but you cannot set an amount of time to a certain a user irrespective of the device (did that using Microsoft Windows 10 parental control and PSN on the PS4 Pro) and the router does not have a criteria to filter contents except IP addresses and/or domains which have to be manually input. so for strict parents who are not much into technology you have to find better options.One other drawback is that i have not found a way to enable both standard QoS and bandwidth limiter it's an either or relationship :-(I have not used the USB 3 connection yet so I cannot write about it i never used on my previous router.for the advanced settings there's a plethora of options starting from deciding which channel to use going to building your own routing table.The firewall is decent and will satisfy most home users.final set of advice:Always install the latest firmware first disable the WPS protocol don't use default user name and passwords choose long complex passwords for each Frequency band (12 Alphanumeric+symbols passwords) and choose at least WPA2 encryption then choose the least congested channels use 20MHz and 40MHz bandwidth (less speed but more stability and range) and in dense areas use the Wireless MAC filter to control who can login to your network and allow guests to login to only guests network.Remember wireless is never 100% safe no matter how genius you are and how expensive your hardware is it's called wireless for a good reason :-)  but you deter most cyber attackers with the above set of advice.Happy bandwidth consuming :-)
3,Lightning fried my previous router and I had longer range plans to do a full upgrade to a pfsense setup so this is getting me by until then.The router itself is fine for basic use but for utmost security it does fall short. Allow me to explain.It does support guest networks but not VLAN's.If you don't need VLANS then this router may suit your needs.One annoying bug is when I'm on the router page the list of DHCP clients keeps resetting every 5 seconds to "no clients" and then they appear again. So I have to time myself just right to take the list of clients and export to a CSV file readable by just about any spreadsheet program.The user interface is standard ASUS fare which is intuitive enough. I just don't care for that annoying refresh glitch that I spoke about above.I'm not keen on this so it's getting shelved... going to a Netgate / pfsense setup. But back to this router.I have no way of setting a different network for the guest and other networks (like IoT). Example: my main lan would be 192.168.10.* and the guest would be 192.168.20.* and so on.If your needs are super basic this router will be fine. If you want much finer grained control over your network consider a different router or roll up your sleeves and get something that runs pfsense. Learn about VLANS. That's what I'm doing.
5,Works well.  I purchased for built in VPN.  Signal strength is good.  Most all features you'll need for in home SOHO router.  You can pay more for higher end routers but if you need a good basic router with most commonly used features this will do the job.
5,I have an apartment where I pay my upstairs neighbor to use his wifi. I don't have access to his routerThe signal to the main bedroom was weak and I bought this hoping to extend that signal.And now that I finally did that (it was quirky to set up and I had issues along the way) it's working greatMy signal in that bedroom went from .5 mbs to 20mb which is night and day. I can now download and watch TV.I do have problems logging into this router. But now that it's working I'm thrilled
5,one of the best routers out there...  shame the one they sent me was broken when i returned it i decided to try a nighthawk by netgear and the nighthawk worked... my old router was an asus and i loved it this new asus was the same model as my old one and it was great but the lan cables didn't function so i had to return it....
5,I use it with Arris SB8200 Modem and it is so much faster then the rented xfinity modem/router.
5,Excellent Product
3,I haven't owned this long but it is starting to annoy me already.First off the initial Wifi password could not be found anywhere in the instructions. The usual guesses did not work. OK so use the ethernet and go that way. Turns out the password for the Wifi could not have been guessed at (doctor_xxxx). If this is not a brand-new device as it was meant to be then someone has some explaining to do.Next up try to login again and we get the 'another user is logged in' message. Every router I have ever owned does this too but they ALL provide the option right then and there to log out the user. This one does not. One has to resort to cryptic potentially configuration-destroying options to get it back. Or reboot the thing. Absurd. This is definitely going to be a problem. There are many reasons why a user ends up logged in when it shouldn't be and a really really simple bit of software to handle this condition is missing. Did they not compare notes with every other router out there? I checked online the above unsatisfactory solutions are the only ones that ASUS provides.On to figuring out how well the Wifi performs...  to be continued.
5,Truly impressed with this router. I originally purchased it back in November 2017 and not once has it ever failed on me. I don't have it on a reboot schedule I don't have it in an area with a ton of air flow and it sits behind a fridge. Not once have I ever had problems with signal or speed. I would say the coverage is decent enough for about ~1800sqft outside of that you might want to get a Wifi 6/ax router. I'm actually in the market to do just that since we're getting new devices that are AX compatible. Best $64 I had ever spent on a router.
4,Most of the consumer grade wifi routers out there have software issues in my experience. Generally they'll fire up and work ok for a period of time then the problems start. My latest round of router upgrades happened because a Netgear Nighthawk router suddenly started to drop all 2.4ghz connections in the house (all google hubs printers etc). The ONLY way to get them to reconnect was to reboot the router--even though the SSID was still being broadcast. Initially it would happen once a week or so then it became a daily issue. Having experienced this sort of random failures in the past I knew it was time for a replacement.I bought a TP-Link A9 and that too worked for a few days before it also started dropping 2.4ghz connections. I thought--what are the odds two different routers would exhibit similar behavior. The only difference was with the TP-Link the connections would come back. I started to suspect radio interference--but we have very few neighbors and they're not close. Even so I disabled automatic channel selection and started manually selecting channels. No dice same issue through channels 1 6 11. I returned the TP-Link and bought this Asus.Heaven finally smiled on me. This Asus router is rock solid stable--SO FAR. My 2.4ghz devices don't drop. My 5ghz devices don't drop. Even though the router has a scheduled reboot option where you can select what time and what days to automatically reboot (which by the way does fix many of the lousy programming errors in the firmware for these consumer devices) the Asus just doesn't need it. Initially I just enabled a nightly reboot but since have backed it down to weekly and may disable it all together.It's as fast as any other AC1900 router I've tested. It easily saturates my downstream/upstream bandwidth. The configuration software is fine although the dark theme is obviously targeted toward gamers. I'd like a nice clean sanitary white skin but this is strictly an aesthetics issue and has nothing to do with functionality. The TPLink actually had an attractive interface. The Asus is just kitschy.I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the mobile app is more focused on appearance and stats than ease of configuration. It does have some cool stats capabilities though. The web interface is functional but has an odd arrangement and seems to target a certain demographic. The are knit pics on appearances though. The hardware and network software appear to be top shelf and reliable which is what I want above all else. As of this writing the Asus delivers on that front. I would absolutely recommend based on my experience to-date.
5,This is a highly recommended router. The set up is easy if you stay away from setting up on the phone app. Connect via ethernet and do the WiFi setting on the router IP: 192.168.50.1 (username and password are "admin" both). The system suggests changing username and password. When logged on it shows the network name and factory password. I suggest that initially you don't change the network name and password first test the WiFi connection then go back and change the network name and password for both 5G and 2.4G. Good luck and enjoy.
5,we use frontier and spectrums internet and use this router instead of theirs because this is better and we can use it forever also we’re big fans of asus…
3,I think this might have been a great router if I could only access their site to manage router
5,Like the title says- if you update the firmware be sure to do a hard reset or you will get no throughput. Otherwise a good value for what it is. Especially appreciated are the GBit ethernet connectors.
2,It was past time for me to upgrade our wifi with so many people and things in my house using.  I was getting rid of my spectrum provided router.I got this up and running initially with no problem.  All was good until I tried to change the network name and password.  Suddenly nothing would connect.  I updated the software restarted the unit I even changed the network back to original.  Finally after resetting it and starting from scratch I got everything running.I switched everything in my house to to new network.  I started noticing everything was slow.  So I began running speed test around my house.  When within 5-10 ft of router I get great speeds.  Any farther and it drops significantly.  25 feet away  and terrible speeds.My Spectrum router was slower overall but even that had twice the range of this unit.I ended up getting the best mesh router and extremely glad I did.I would not recommend unless you live in a very small place.
3,Not happy with this product.  Better than Comcast stuff but not by much.  Drops signal daily.  Have to reset daily.  Does not reach 300 yds. as advertised
5,I have used many different routers over the last 2 decades. This one has the best performance of any to date. I had one of the old reliable Linksys blue "G" routers that everyone seemed to have at one time. That was a great router but did not keep up with broadband speed upgrades. I have had several D-link versions as well as several Netgear "n" series routers. All of them failed to have great coverage and those that had 5GHz radio channels either worked poorly or failed altogether after a short period of time. I also had a Motorola modem/router AC1600 combo that worked pretty good until the modem gets overwhelmed with packet failures. The coverage on that one was OK but not great.I decided to get the cable modem from my provider since they cover it better and then go back to a stand alone wireless router.Because this is an "AC" router I get to take advantage of my 100MBs cable service no problem. Running multiple streams and over 20 different devices at one time has not found any limits yet. Best of all I get coverage in places that struggled with all my other routers. The 5GHz radio seems much more reliable so far and easily has double the coverage of the others I have used.Set-up was straightforward and I already had a network plan that works for me. I simply used the similar settings and I was up and running. Using the same network names and passwords meant I did not have to reconfigure any devices on my network. I hope ti lasts because it has been great so far. No complaints.Until I get fiber or some other form of Gigabit Ethernet this should be the last one I buy for many years.
5,It works as expected and very well at that. I have not had to do any reboots or anything. It is on a Fiber host.
5,I thought about going wifi 6 but honestly we don't get gigabit speeds from our home internet.I added this as an Access Point to my network.This page goes over adding it as an Access Pointhttps://www.asus.com/us/support/faq/1015009Make sure you download the Discovery tool from Asus as you need it set the device up.https://www.asus.com/Networking-IoT-Servers/WiFi-Routers/ASUS-WiFi-Routers/RT-ACRH17/HelpDesk_Download/I had to plug the wireless router directly into my desktop computer to get the initial setup done.Then I just set it up where I have my Network switch and plugged the ethernet cable into that hub.Signal wise live in a 2400 sqft home. The wireless router is set up in the living room which is actually almostat one end of the house opposite a den/office. I connected to the 2ghz network walked upstairs and then down to the office on the other side with the door closed and still had 5 bars. I get both the 5g and 2g at that distance though.Speedwise My internet only get's 20-30 mbps down and about 5-10 up.On 2G no dropoff in speed at all when going from one end of the house to the other.5g signal get's weak at that distance though and drops to 10-15 down and 3-5 upI walked outside also. Experienced more of a dropoff but still got 2-3 bars about 125 feet from the houseon the 2g.Excellent signal strength good user interface fairly easy setup.
