5,Ordered the Victrola Retro Radio/ BT receiver last night at 11:30 P.M. and go t it at 8 P.M. tonight. Great service! Unpacked the unit and was very pleased by its retro looks - simple yet beautiful.  Wanted to buy it in the walnut color but opted for the Espresso since it was on sale - no regrets. Ready to use right out of the box - all you do is connect it and you're set. There are two minor quirks on my unit which are not deal breakers but may or may not be present on other similar units. I was tuning the radio to my favorite FM station (105.9) and did not find it on the 105 section of the dial but on the 107 section - odd. The Bluetooth takes a little longer than expected to sync with my I Phone 13 but no big deal. This aside I was blown away by the sound which is full and rich through all volume levels without distortion in my opinion. Nice crisp clear sound. I listen to mostly classical music but do listen to other genres as well and i am sure the unit will do it all justice. The bass=treble knob was a a great touch - I found that keeping the knob in the middle yielded the best sound balance but admittedly this is my personal taste. There is a wire antenna on the back but I saw no need to unravel it as the reception was perfect as is. So to sum up this is great little unit to have anywhere in your home (so compact and lightweight you can take it from room to room). As mentioned above i was blown away by the sound quality for such a small unit - the price may seem high but it is worth it. If this is what you are looking for do not hesitate -  you will not be disappointed.
5,This radio fits well in the space provided.  The color blends well with my decor. The sound is superb as I listen to my favorite radio stations and programs.
4,I received this retro radio/bluetooth speaker a few days ago and it definitely exceeded my expectations. I was hesitant about buying it after I read a few of the negative reviews on here but I'm so glad I went ahead and bought this. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this radio! The look and feel of this radio is really true to what this type of radio would have looked like decades ago. Between the wood finish the knobs the circular AM/FM dial and the cover...I really appreciate how it looks...VERY CLASSY! Other than the giveaway of the small red and blue LEDs that are at the bottom right of the radio (for AM/FM or bluetooth) one wouldn't be able to distinguish this radio from an actual antique radio IMO unless you examined it up close. With the radio off and LEDs not displayed it would be difficult to assume this radio was not the "real deal" (antique). The only part I really would have preferred would have been the dial to be lighted but it's not a big deal. If Victrola had offered the same model with a lighted dial I would have willingly paid the difference in price for it. There is also a dial for bass and treble (it is just one knob and you turn it one way or the other to add more or less of each). I appreciate this feature too as I prefer more treble than bass when it comes to listening to radio and other music. I was also surprised at the sound quality for this type of radio (tabletop). It's not a Bose of course but definitely sounds good! The Bluetooth connects quickly and sounds good also. Very stable connection. You do have to turn the volume up higher for the bluetooth verses the radio but I kinda expected this was going to be the case with this radio.Regarding the person's post about the FM dial needle not being aligned properly...I have not had that type of issue. I tuned into stations and they were pretty much on spot with the respective stations' frequencies. We have a station at 99.5 FM and the needle was just under "100" so that seems accurate to me. What I couldn't believe was how well this radio received stations especially for a tabletop radio. I am about 25-30 miles south "as the crow flies" from the city. Although we receive most of the bigger 100 kw FM's from the city most of the lower powered stations are difficult if not impossible to receive on most radios here (other than via a car stereo). This radio has sensitivity like none other I have seen with a tabletop radio...well maybe a tabletop that was actually made 30+ years ago. Not only am I able to hear all the 100 kw class C FM stations from the city I am also hearing just about every low-powered FM translator from that area as well...stations we normally only receive on better quality radios car stereos here in our area. Unbelievable reception on it! Granted with a dial you have to fine tune the dial to get some of the lower powered FM's to "lock in" but it's doable and I get a fairly decent signal from those stations just as I do the more powerful FMs.The one negative about this radio is the AM reception; it is definitely lacking but most radio manufacturers are not spending a great deal of $ on the AM section of radios anymore. Most non-music AM formats such as talk sports etc have moved to the FM dial in many areas so AM is an afterthought. Sound-wise and recpetion for the AM section...I would give it a 2 out of 10 rating (10 being the best). I was unable to receive many AM stations on it but then again we are quite a ways from the city. Personally I would have preferred the AM section to work better than it does since I'm a radio nerd and interested in not only FM but AM broadcasting. If you're looking for an AM radio for listening or for DX purposes I wouldn't recommend it. For those who don't DX you can always listen to stations via their online streams on your phone/tablet/mobile device and send it to the radio via bluetooth.I highly recommend this radio if you're into antique radios and/or into FM DXing as I am. Definitely worth the $ I paid for it! If you're thinking about buying it GET IT!
4,This is a fantastic replica that is easy to use. The Bluetooth connects quickly and the radio picks up channels with ease. The frame is plastic meant to look like wood and the speaker has the traditional braided  cloth cover.My only 2 complaints are: 1- the dial glass is accurately plastic which was disappointing. 2- I wish the Volume would go just a bit louder.4 out of 5 stars
4,The look and sound of this radio is pretty great. However there are some big problems that is your choice if you can overlook. The dial isn't accurate if it shows 104 on the dial you are on 106 in reality. Also AM doesn't really work at all. I can get only one station on AM the rest is fuzzy. If you can overlook these it's a great radio.
4,The radio is good for what we bought it for. I would have liked an input auxiliary Jack in back.
4,Got it for the look and it's perfect for that. The sound quality isn't very clear. Readily connects to my phone via Bluetooth.
5,So just like I thought when I plugged this retro radio in and used the manual tuning knob I picked up an interesting message.  A message about time travel from those who came before me.  They had no idea about Bluetooth or “streaming” not even of WiFi.  It was a message from the past that talked about old news stories local car dealership promotions (“dealerships still exist?” I asked myself) and calling to win contests and prizes.  I listened longer to the message being sent over the airwaves and eventually the chatter faded and I was left with soft elevator music.  Not wanting to get brainwashed by the message I tuned some more watching the small needle jump between tiny numbers.  What did this all mean?  The sound faded then picked again where the music coming out of the message box was now from the 1970’s.  I was sure of it.  Isn’t this Captain and Tennille?  I must be traveling in time because no way anyone is still listening to this today.  Now I don’t know much about Bluetooth but I have all my teeth and won’t knock a product feature that I know nothing about.  I did shut the box off after a few mind numbing hours as the effects of time travel began to sink in.  Instantly I was back in my kitchen checking my smartphone like nothing ever happened.  Shhhhh. My crazy secret is safe with you right?
4,Plays very well  and looks nice.  I use it mostly to listen to otr shows via Bluetooth.  The only thing is that the dial is not backlit as advertised.  Otherwise I'm very pleased.
4,Love the look and it connects really easily. I just wish it went a little louder. The sound quality though is good
5,I love this radio clear sound and easy to use
5,I love this little piece!  I can imagine being back during that time and listening to that great music for the first time!  I read reviews about the sound quality and not being loud!  I think that funny because it’s a VINTAGE RADIO!! It probably sounds a lot like it actually would of sounded!  But anyway it’s great for a little room and just sit and relax listening to music!
4,
4,I bought it for the looks…sound is ok
5,This thing is awesome radio or Bluetooth whatever you want to listen to with minimal buttons and knobs. I love it and easily worth the price!
5,
5,I love this vintage replica radio.  I want to boy another one for work!
4,Great except a quiet buz when Bluetooth is on
4,I was playing music yesterday on it and it would lag on one of the songs but it’s still pretty good.
5,Works great. Looks great.Love being able to use it for Bluetooth or just old fashioned radio.
5,The volume doesn’t get very loud but it’s perfect for my bedroom.
5,This is a refreshingly good quality radio at a relatively low price.A lot of people equate 'heavy' with 'quality' to such an extent that manufacturers actually put weights in their products with the hope of giving you that impression of quality. This is a fairly light radio. If you buy one you might be thrown for a moment on the feel of it. I was. This radio feels old school. I was a little excited by the name 'Victrola' on the front.This radio comes with a small instruction booklet as all devices these days do. You don't need it.The volume knob is also the power switch. Turn it all the way down to turn it off. Maximum volume is not blasting loud but it is plenty loud.There's a tone knob. For adjusting the tone. I typically listen to classical music or jazz and the tonal quality of this speaker is quite nice for that music. You can hear a noticeable difference between turning it down towards 'bass' and up towards 'treble'. It doesn't have subwoofer level bass sound but you can definitely hear lower frequencies. I played a little bit of older hard rock on it and it sounds pretty good. Just don't expect the floor to vibrate. Turning it all the way up towards 'treble' doesn't doesn't give it too much of a tinny sound.There's a knob that switches between Bluetooth FM and AM.Switching it away from Bluetooth disconnects it from your device. It needs to resynch when you switch back to Bluetooth. I have an iPhone and with some Bluetooth speakers I have issues with music playback stopping and not resuming when a timer or alarm goes off or if I ask Siri for anything. This speaker actually resumes playback in those situations which is nice.I live in a small town in the mountains. I can pick up exactly 2 stations from where I live. The reception for those 2 stations is fine. The antenna is a wire that comes directly out of the wooden box it's not detachable. I haven't bothered with AM I don't know of any AM stations here.There's something about the sound of most modern bluetooth speakers that I don't necessarily like that much and I'm not sure what it is. Heavy audio compression? Whatever it is grates on my nerves. This product doesn't do that at all.I like this radio a lot.
5,Good reception good sound good no frills radio.
5,This is a perfect little radio for the house. The vintage look makes it a nice decoration. The am/fm radio works great as does the Bluetooth which takes seconds to connect.
5,If you're looking for an inexpensive but very good radio \Bluetooth speaker this is it. The sound quality isn't perfect but it's very good. If you're looking for speakers for dubstep or heavy bass you'll need to spend more but it does have good bass for everything else. Additionally the bass level is adjustable with the tone knob. It's loud not house rocking loud but loud enough to hear well outdoors from my living room.I was surprised to see that this is not rechargeable but connects to the wall so not portable. This however was exactly what I wanted because every BT speaker I've had breaks down at the charger port. I bought and returned the SEVIZ "40 watt" (actually 4 ten watt speakers) in less than a month for exactly that reason.I'm not surprised by all the complaints about the radio adjustment given that we live in a time that people have gotten used to everything being automatic but if you're old enough to know how to use a radio like one from the 80s on back it's not a problem. It is after all a "vintage" non digital speaker. If you want more precise radio adjustment buy one with digital tuning.I get so many stations it's ridiculous and I live at 6000 feet rural at least a half hour away from all but two stations so if you're not getting stations you must really be in the boonies. I get stations from Mexico and I'm 45 minutes away. The stations also come in very clearly with no interference at all.I have had a slight issue with the BT competing for a connection with my other speaker and then having a connection with no media or no phone and having to manually reset the connection but this only happens if both speakers are on.It's also very solidly built although it is manufactured in China. It's MDF not wood but it looks great. It's also not one of those vintage speakers you get and end up surprised at how dinky it is and how much it looks like a kid's toy. It's big for a BT speaker.For the price this is a great speaker. For the price you're not getting a Kenwood an automatic tuner or tons of bells and whistles. If you want a good speaker for YouTube TV or other generalized use this is it. I definitely recommend it. I'll update if anything untoward happens down the road.
4,A beautiful retro looking radio that fits the theme I have going in my room. Only small drawback is the sound quality. It's not bad but you can hear a faint static sound. This when it's paired up with my phone. Either way I'm happy with it since the main reason for me purchasing it was simply the esthetics.
5,Appearance sound
3,The sound is awful can’t understand what is said on the news and music is so staticky would not buy again
5,Old style good looking radio
5,Beautiful
4,This retro Victrola radio can stay plugged in works well and will actually look nice in my kitchen year round. I love the AM/FM radio option for days when I want to listen to the news or classic radio stations and the Bluetooth function is great for listening to music podcasts and audio books while I'm cooking or just having coffee in the morning. You can tell the case is made from MDF and wood grain vinyl but despite that its a really beautiful and functional piece. Yes it's a bit spendy for not getting real wood but just look at how big it is! I took a picture of it next to a standard 14oz candle and its nothing to scoff at. It takes up more room than my electric kettle! Don't expect high quality sound but it's not garbage either. At first I thought it sounded like it had too much reverb and bass but it's much better after playing around with the sound equalizer dial. It does still give off the hollow retro radio sound because its literally just one speaker but for a small space like a kitchen bathroom or bedroom it will work wonderfully.
5,It is an aesthetically pleasing speaking with a nice vintage sound and feel.
5,Nice solid sound
2,I was wanting to replace a 20 year old Crosley that had recently lost the ability of connecting my phone via cord and for listening to playlists (move up to Bluetooth!). Was excited at the prospect of this retro looking radio fitting into my vintage decor. On removing it from the box it sounded broken but it looked fine. I decided to open the back and found that a wooden section that was supposed to be adhered to the back panel wasn’t and was flopping around held only by a cord it was connected to. The “antenna” wasn’t connected to anything or maybe was attached to that piece and came off (which while I can glue things I couldn’t figure out where to reconnect the wire).It’s made of compressed cardboard with vinyl wood grain contact paper covering it. I liked the look of it but would have paid more for something made better of real wood and with a metal rod antenna.I did try it (before) and after my repair and it did hook up to my phone (Bluetooth) very easily I guess it sounded ok but since there was no real antenna it didn’t pick up any stations maybe one on the AM dial.This just wasn’t what I was hoping for.
5,I bought this to replace a cd player/radio I use in my hobby room. The radio was always static and I don't know when I last listened to a cd.I was a little concerned when it arrived because the box was damaged and I could hear rattling. One of the feet came off the bottom and there is a little scratch. But I reattached the foot and plugged it in and it is perfect. The scratch does not affect the sound and it is hidden on the bottom.There is no static and I haven't needed to unwind the antenna. The dial on my radio is not off like others seem to be. I am listening to 88.1 and as you can see in the picture the dial is accurate.
5,Radio is great. Sound is good along with the look of the radio. Looks like its back into 50's or 60's.
5,Perfect for my tiny kitchen!
4,The range doesn’t go very far and is always disconnecting from my phone which i really don’t like. However it’s very beautiful and feels fairly vintage especially for this price range and has cool controls. If range isn’t an issue for you this will work fantastically.
5,This bit of nostalgia although not perfect does have a place today. Like many others I have grown tired of digital crispness and want a truly analog sound. There is only one speaker and the dial is a bit off but that adds to its charm. A true reminder of the sounds of my childhood.
4,The sound quality is good and it looks darling but it's not mobile (it has to be plugged in at all times) and I always have to have it cranked as loud as it can possibly go and it's barely loud enough. If you have sensitive hearing or only need to use it in a small space then this is the speaker for you.
3,I will be returning this speaker. While it’s a beautiful radio unfortunately the music is so soft.
3,I noticed that when tuning in a FM station the dial is about 2° off.  Instead of 96.9 I have to dial in around 99.
5,This vintage style radio/bluetooth is amazing! The sound quality is great! Connects easily to bluetooth. My husband loves that he can listen to AM/FM radio. The style is perfect for us! Very easy to use. Like a few reviewers stated the dial is off a bit for the radio but it's not a big deal for us.
5,This radio sounds excellent. I have it for a smaller room in my house. I spent 32 years as a music teacher and sometimes I just want to listen to the Beethoven string quartets while reading a book in a small room and this radio is absolutely perfect. It is very well-made. You’ll know it as soon as you take it out of the box.
4,Speaker pairs easily and offers reasonable clarity but is not as loud as most of my other bluetooth speakers since it's wired I expected to be able to be louder than my $10 USB charged speakers....it is not.
4,I like the look of it but sound quality is not as good as I hoped for.
5,Wow. All I gotta say. GREAT SOUND QUALITY.. easy BT connection.. gets decently loud. I can hardly wait for the record player to come in!!
5,I bought this for my mom who is in nursing home and she loves it. The Bluetooth connection was easy. Love the product.
4,Christmas gift and told it was easy to use and still working well after 4 months
4,The radio is fine but I bought it for my mother who has dementia thinking it was easy to recognize and operate.  She starts turning knows gets confused and gives up.  I need to get her something with on/off/volume  am/fm and tuner only.  She always seems to end up on bluetooth...Bluetooth... she doesn't understand.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I bought this radio to listen to slow beat type music along with classic music. I haven’t had any troubles at all for Bluetooth connectivity and my phone does recognizes it. My main complaint would be the radio dial that is way off. With the radio station I listen to is 96.8 but in the radio is at 98 it’s frustrating that I just don’t play around with it or else I’ll forget. All and all it is a great radio but don’t expect it to be listening to every kind of music since it’ll sound off and not right. Love the Bluetooth connectivity just the dial is a pain. For the price I love it and glad I got it.
5,This is a good radio for the money. Assuming you want a retro unit with dials instead of digital readouts this is probably as good as it gets. The quality of construction is OK; the controls feel solid and the sound is decent.
4,This was a gift for my brother and he is very pleased with the quality of this radio.  I thought it was a good buy.  I would recommend.  It’s very attractive.
3,Overall radio in good condition and had a cute vintage look.  However the sound quality was disappointing and so was the volume control and therefore returned product as a result.
5,This is a great device and very stylish. Most of the negative reviews are about the low volume. I almost returned this for the same issue but figured out how to turn it up.Go to your Bluetooth select the Victrola Willow information “i” and select that this is a speaker. Otherwise the volume is limited as though it is a headset. Good luck and happy listening!
4,It had a good heft indicating that it had a fairly heavy speaker magnet. My big problem was the antenna wire. I think they had one of those Japanese puzzle box makers coiling these. For the life of me I could not find the end could not find a twist tie like on the power cord absolutely no indication of how to get it unfurled which I broke off in the effort. Even free of the radio I had trouble getting it apart. The wire was so fine that my stripper didn't work so I had to resort to nicking the strands using a razor blade. Once I had it soldered and the unit plugged in the next challenge was zeroing in on my station The other reviewers were right about the dial being misaligned. When I finally got it playing the sound quality was impressive. Not stereo or high fidelity but for a little tabletop radio that'll do pig. That'll do. I just wish the labels on the knobs were easier to read.
5,I love how it looks so old but it has all the modern convinces like Bluetooth.
5,I bought this for the look and was hoping for the best. The order was DOA when I got it. One phone call and a replacement was on its way. Now that I have it - the look is great bluetooth works great. It’s pretty sturdy too - pressboard not plastic. I use one in my office and it’s been totally problem free. The only issue is that the volume is a little low for a large room or a room with a lot of noise. I’m perfectly happy though.
5,Hooked this up as an alternative to a blue tooth radio. I keep it tuned to one local station and use it with a voice control off/on switch tied to the internet. Works well and keeps the station in tune. The sound is solid.
3,The numbers do not match radio station numbers.  Very easy to hook up to Bluetooth.  Sounds & looks great...
5,This speaker works. Instantly hooked up. Looks amazing! Previous review had my tech incompetence showing. 🥴
5,It is a beautiful antique looking piece.  Great sound quality.
3,I didn't have very high expectations for this speaker but I also didn't want to spend too much given where I planned on keeping it. That being said there are speakers out there for less that have a better sound. Even connected on Bluetooth it is lacking in certain frequency ranges. Also the speaker doesn't get very loud at all. Don't plan on using it in a large room. Lastly the Bluetooth clips the beginning of songs. If there is a break between songs you will miss the first half second or so of the subsequent song on your playlist.
4,Overall this product is great though the sound is a bit quieter than I expected.
5,Very good sound from a small table radio. Has AM/FM plus Bluetooth capabilities. Appears to be very well made
5,I bought a 1935 Philco Tombstone radio not working.  The radio was trashed and not worth fixing since it was AM only.  Who listens to that.  The shell was in great shape so I trashed the electrical replaced the grille cloth added an 8" hifi speaker and the Victrola AM FM bluetooth Radio which happened to fit in the inside of the radio shell.. I disconnected the 2 1/2 speaker in the Victrola radio and connected the output to the new 8" speaker and it sounds great. Loud HIFI sound with no distortion.  Now everyone I know wants one.
4,it's compact and fits nicely on table  no complaints
4,Very stylish looking sound quality is fair am is a little staticky but otherwise this radio works fairly decent
3,The description states the tuning dial is backlit and it is not. Not a big deal but worth noting.
5,Awesome gift for mom.
5,Great radio. Bluetooth is nice but if I keep my phone in my pocket and go in the other room it will glitch out. Great sound.
2,The look of this radio is great! It's super cute and really adds to my livingroom.  I realize it was cheap but I'm annoyed that it makes a constant humming noise when plugged in (and shut off).  Also the radio loses signal sometimes so you have to shut it off and turn back on for it to bring in the station again. Oy! The Bluetooth works great though.Update: The radio stopped working completely. The price keeps going down on this and now I don't wonder why.  So glad I kept the box because I'm returning it. 2 stars because it looks nice. That's it.
4,This is a good speaker however the dials do not line up with the actual radio station number. For example I list to a station on 104.5 and I have to have the dial at 6.7. Other than that I’m happy.
5,I ordered this as a gift to myself for Christmas. It just got here and I rushed to get it open and plugged right in. It sounds great for such a little radio/speaker! It's a decent size but on the small side which is exactly why I wanted it. It fits so well in my plant room and the vintage vibe is so soothing! The stations seem just a little off like turning more to the left or right to get the one you want but that doesn't personally affect my experience at all. Would definitely buy again and recommend to friends!! I'm in love!
5,This is the 3rd radio I've gotten for my operatory at the office I work at (dental office). There's another radio in the office but I can't really hear it where I am over all the office sounds. This radio is easy to use. Turn dial for the radio but I do think the needle is off... just saying I like the Bluetooth feature but rarely use it because it kills my cellphone battery. I love the look of it. It was between the old look or boombox. I went with this one....I'll probably create a reason to get the boombox too. But I love this one!!! Very happy dental hygienist. My day is much better now that I have music to soothe this beast. Ha!
4,Overall a 4/5. The sound appears to be coming soley from large speaker holes drilled into the back. Sounds good still although I believe this stunts the sound quality a bit from not emitting from the front or both. Also no light to the radio tuner whatsoever so that's somewhat of a disappointment and a lie in advertising. Raido aspect and Bluetooth work just fine however.
5,Bought this for the room where we shoot pool. I wanted it to blend in with the wood on the slate pool table and it does. I  get a little tired of seeing the  blue lights of electronics and appliances.  We found a great many stations there is good volume. I'm please with purchase and would consider buying again.
4,Was gift for my wife she loves it
4,This is a nice retro radio/bluetooth speaker that is a good value for the price.  The sound quality is good but not great.  It is more than adequate for radio but simply do not expect the same quality that you would from top-flight speakers though it is more than adequate for general everyday use - even for listening to music generally in the background via bluetooth.  In terms of aesthetics this is a great-looking little retro radio.  The wood is faux but looks realistic.  Despite this radio being very affordable it is no way looks cheap.  It is an attractive piece to have out in your home if retro is your style.  The radio has good sensitivity for picking up both AM and FM stations.  I was very pleased with this purchase and would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable attractive radio and/or extra bluetooth speaker for in the home.
5,Good for listening to baseball games on a summer night. Or checking out music with my Amazon music
5,i bought this little guy in august and it has been one of the best purchases i’ve made! VERY affordable great sound and easy to use. i mostly bluetooth (which i prefer) and the dial to get to fm/am isn’t exactly accurate but not hard to get a to a station (may be off by a few). anyways- get tons of compliments about this guy as it’s in my office! planning to purchase one for home. love how vintage looking it is but has the capabilities of what regular bluetooth speakers have! 10000/10 recommend!!
3,Product arrived in damaged packaging. It looks like the box was stabbed all over however the product itself was intact. The radio is cute but cheaply built. The color of the walnut was much darker than I expected based on the photo I saw before purchasing. The “wood” finish looks like the cheap stick on vinyl. Curious to see how that holds up in time. The knobs and clear dial cover are made of light plastic so again cheaply made. The speaker sounds okay about what you would expect on a radio. Overall expect to get what you pay for with this product being on the lower end of the price points compared to it’s competitors.
5,My husband bought this to have just a cheaper radio in the house like he has in the garage.  He loves it!! It is on pretty much all day.  He is very happy with this purchase!! I don't know if it has bluetooth capability.
5,Great bedroom radio! Perfect size. It appears Victrola has taken over the retro market from Crosley since they moved upscale. Didn’t find any of the complaints left by other users. Except I do agree that the dial should be back lit.Good tone. Great Bluetooth connectivity. Great price. Would definitely recommend this product!
2,Lots of static on AM side .  I tried it all over the house  was poor quality sound . I bought it to replace a Sangean radio that I bought on Amazon . It played perfectly . Purchased this radio because I liked the old time style and the simplicity to operate  and it was a little cheaper  .The FM stations came in clearly. I listen to AM stations most of the time .
5,Looks just like an old radio. It is one actually but with the added bonus of streaming. Very nice controls
5,Bought this as somewhat a gag gift for my husband's 60th birthday.I'm very impressed with the quality of this little radio. It plays AM and FM as well as Bluetooth. The sound is very good considering the small size and it also looks nice. It has replaced the boom box in the microwave cart.
5,Love the retro feel & the sound is great. My space is small so it's perfect & fits the bill perfectly.
5,Love the look and quality of this radio and the Bluetooth option is an added bonus. Everything works perfectly. I will mention that the walnut color is much richer and a bit darker than the picture and I am so happy it is!
5,My son was very pleased with his gift.  He fitted it into his wall of media players of various types and uses it pretty much every day.  Really likes the old style appearance.
5,I love this speaker. The sound quality and aesthetic is just wonderful. I love that it plugs in unlike other Bluetooth speakers. And it’s cool that it’s a radio as well. It looks much better than any other speaker I’ve owned and everyone loves it!!
5,We love this radio! It works great and looks fantastic in our retro kitchen. Really nice sound quality!
5,I love this radio. I took it to work because it didn’t fit on my desk at home but since it connects to Bluetooth it works perfectly. Sounds good too and is very cute!
5,I mostly like everything on this radio. It brings back memories from my childhood when my father would keep his ears closed on the radio while listening to his favorite stations. I haven't used the bluetooth connection yet. I have checked the many stations and the sound is great.
5,This radio is a beautiful old-fashioned looking radio  simple but stunning in its' style.  Gave as a gift and they are still bragging about it after 6 months.
5,This is literally the cutest speaker ever. Spud. Great too but omg it’s so adorable
5,I bought to fit the look of my office.  The retro fit well. I have had rights months and works well. Speaker is very good
4,Puede mejorar la calidad del sonido…Pero la relación calidad/precio bien
5,This is a great radio
5,Brought this into work to replace our aging radio. The comments alone with everyone asking where to get it. The manual dial for tuning isn't perfect and the frequencies are off by more than 1 mhz. The antenna knot at the back was also a bit frustrating for 5 minutes but beyond those quibbles it's fantastic. Station's are clear but if you've had troubles with other radios this won't magically get more stations. The sound quality is noticably better than any plastic radio.
5,I like to listen to podcasts while I work.  I had a cheap bluetooth speaker that over time lost its ability to stay charged a whole day so I went on the lookout for a bluetooth speaker that plugs in.  I found almost no options but there were a few radios with bluetooth.  I saw this one for $39.99 at the time and bought it thinking it would probably be tinny and not that great BUT for a $40 radio this has pretty good sound like really pretty good sound.  If you're a snobby audiophile this is probably not for you but if you just want to stream some podcasts or music without recharging a speaker all the time I recommend it.
5,I place in shower room nice to listen to nice music while having showers
5,Wanted a simple radio that my 89year old mother could easily operate.  Most of today's radios have too many features and too small buttons that confuse someone who is not as techno-savy.  This radio fit the bill.
5,Bought for my office for the style.  Getting lots of compliments.  Sound is very good too.  Can't go past half way on the volume in my office so I'm pretty sure it would fill a good sized room with nice sound.  Blue tooth works great too.
4,Not designed to stream the radio broadcast through a Bluetooth speaker. I was hoping to bypass the streaming delay and play America’s favorite sports station 96.7 & 1310 The Ticket from my Bluetooth speaker. The broadcast can only be played through the radio itself. You can only use the Bluetooth to play other devices through the radio speaker. Also the radio dial is not calibrated properly. The dial on the FM selection is off by 1.5 points. Overall it looks great sturdy design and sounds great for the price.
5,Buy it!!! It’s my favorite household item I get so many compliments on it.
4,I like thisHow can I contact the owner
5,The radio is well built and looks attractive. Sound is great.  It picks up a lot of stations.  It does not have presets but relies on the dial to tune in stations so if you listen to several stations it can take a bit of focus when moving between them: the dial indicates more of a range of stations and as the listener you have to identify your station by sound and area of the dial. Great product at a very good price.
1,My jaw hit the floor when I took this radio out of the box. First thing that smacked me across the face were the scratches and dents. It was obviously banged around. That aside I'm looking at the workmanship of the radio and right away I see the paper that's glued on peeling at several points on the radio. You know the paper that's supposed look like wood! That aside i plug it in to see how it sounds... I literally slapped my hand on my forehead in disbelief! Horrible horrible sound. The bass is not bass it's a muffling. The treble just don't unless you want an ear bleed. AM is worse way worse! No matter how I turned the radio or where I went I couldn't get rid of the annoying buzz. It's not a soft buzz that you'll have to put your ear to the radio to hear it no it is loud and you won't get rid of it even on the strongest stations. I tried several outlets in my home and no luck it IS the radio!  This is Victrola now? Trust me when I say you will not get high quality. Save your money. I would not pay $10 bucks for this crap. Returning!
5,The radio is perfect I like it to be honest it gives it the vintage look 👌🏻
2,Worked great for 6 months. Then FM stopped working. It'll work for 20 minutes at a time then go silent. Only FM.
5,I bought this for my husband so he could listen to the pre-game Indiana University basketball program before each game.  Before buying this we had to hold onto the radio's antenna to calm the static enough that we could hear the voices!!  Since he has the Victrola we can sit back and enjoy the show!!
5,Stylish and works great! Not super heavy either so it can fit perfectly on a small shelf. Nice addition to my space! Great sound quality.
5,I wanted a little Bluetooth speaker for my office. I have a couple of sizes of speakers at my house that are portable but for my office I wanted something more stylish that fit the decor and that would stay in one place. This retro-looking speaker/radio combo is perfect. Looks great with the dark wood shelving and desk in my office and it works like a charm. I probably won’t use the radio function a whole lot but I love that it is available. And the price is definitely worth it. It was super easy to set up and connect to with my iPhone. I highly recommend this product.
5,I love the look of this and it was super simple to pair with my iPhone. The radio stations come in pretty well. The only downside is that it’s easy to turn the volume all the way up and still wish it would go a little louder.  Certainly would still recommend it for everyday use in a home.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I love everything about this radio! It’s really straightforward and easy to use. Design and sound quality blew me away especially for the price. It also has a tone adjustment setting that allow your sound to sound clearer or more static like old radios from back in the day. It’s also a nice touch on my vanity!! It really compliment the theme I’m going for and look especially beautiful next to my green plants .
4,This was a present for our 28 year old daughter. She wanted a simple AM/FM radio but has plans to move back overseas. Figured that the bluetooth addition would be worth having just for that reason.
2,I ordered this product in January now in September it will no longer turn on or function. Sad that it didn’t even last a year.
5,This radio is adorable and the sound is perfect!
5,Love it! The sound is excellent. It’s more than loud enough and it’s very good looking. A very high quality product.
2,A beautiful cabinet a great sound and easy to use BUT after only five months it now just produces a buzz.  Further the warranty is limited to 90 days labor and one year parts.  Plus you pay shipping both ways! One year parts is fine but only 90 days labor is a disappointment.  Shouldn't one expect more than 90 days for a $50 radio?  If you buy one I'd get the optional warranty. I need to replace it but I'll look to another brand.  Too bad.  It really is a beautiful little radio.
5,This is a great retro mid century or transitional radio. Classy looking works great but I think it needs a longer cord.
5,This radio is great!  The sound quality has a deep sound that sounds like a classic radio
5,Great radio for the price. Clear sound. Gets fairly loud. Have in my three stall garage it’s not shaking walls but is pretty loud for the size!
5,Sound quality is great.  I bought 2.  I love this freaking radio and it’s retro look.
5,Bought this for Christmas for my mother-in-law. She was wanting an old fashioned radio for the home and it was exactly what she wanted. The vintage style is very appealing the sound quality and volume level are impressive and the features mentioned in the description work as expected. Worth every penny.
4,Very nice looking. However it’s pretty quiet. If you just wanted a little background music then this is for you but if you’d hoped for a kitchen dance party you may want to keep looking. But for the look and price I do like it.
5,Good radio.  Everything works.  Good reception and sound.  Nice quality build and better than expected.
5,This is an attractive radio at a great price.  I had not trouble picking up stations and the bluetooth setup was very easy.  I would purchase it again.
3,Along with another reviewer the tuning is waaaay off and very touchy. For instance something in the 103 FM area requires tuning to the106 area. The BT is easy to use and sound is what you would expect for $45. Probably would not purchase again.
4,This is a nice small unit that I purchased for the look and for the bluetooth speakers with no plans to use the radio.  Easy set up and nice styling.  The only negative I've found is that the volume does not go up very high.  Turning the volume up to the max on the device and on the phone I'm streaming from provides a volume that's a little louder than comfortable in a small room (or vintage camper in my case). The sound on this device would get lost in a larger room.Good value for the money but could use a little more volume.
5,AM FM and bluetooth all function well. The radio sounds great and I love the dials you can turn. It's a great value for the money. If you're very picky about sound quality buy a higher end radio. Me I think this one sounds great! Especially for 40 bucks!
5,Very nice looking sounds great
4,For a basic no frills AM FM radio with Bluetooth connectivity it's a winner. The styling looks nice but you can tell it's cheapish. I'd give it a 7 on the quality scale compared to my Sangean WR-11. However it costs a fraction of the Sangean too. The dial isn't lighted if that's important to you but feels smooth when tuning. The other knobs feel smooth as well.If you're looking for a nice AM FM Bluetooth radio that won't break your wallet this one is rather nice in my experience - but there are better quality options out there albeit at higher cost.UPDATE: 3/31/2020The radio is still trucking along nicely. I still like it every bit as much as I did when purchased.
2,The color pictured is very light and contrasts with the face plate. In person they are the same color. Waaaay darker then pictured. I didn’t choose the dark color
5,My wife wanted a radio for the kitchen and I ordered this not honestly expecting much. However it has great sound adjustable tone and it gets local stations just fine with the built-in antenna-- I didn't have to stretch any antenna wires or fool with a telescoping one.  The station selector is a turn dial so if you're constantly changing stations this may not be for you but we leave it on our favorite station.  For the price and convenience if you just want to catch some news or have background music in a room I recommend this . And it's got a nice retro look to it.
2,Sound was disappointing. Controls are flimsy. Two of the three control knobs stopped working properly with a few months. Tuner is OK just have to fiddle with antenna. Price was low for a reason.
4,Yep- you really can’t get any AM stations in this radio. I know other reviewers warned me but I figured “come on... it can’t be that bad!” But the AM reception is indeed that bad. I had hoped that I could listen to the Trailblazer games on 620 AM once the NBA season starts in December but that won’t happen with this unit. So if you REALLY want AM radio broadcasts (which I did) don’t buy this one.FM and Bluetooth work fine! Obviously with this teeeny tiny speaker the sound isn’t awesome but you’re just dropping $40 right? It’s fine. Everything is fine...
5,Easy to use and connect.  Better sound that expected from the unit - though expectations were pretty low. Looks great and the radio works surprisingly well!  Very happy with the product overall.
5,I bought it for the looks and it does look good.  Feels well built for the price. Friend bought one after he saw mine reminded him (& I) of Fallout.  So just get it and be happy.
4,I bought this radio because I like listening to classical music and as good as the speakers are for my Echo radio speakers are better. Sadly this radio just cannot keep my station in place it just wanders all over picking up whatever it can. I was on the verge of returning it when I decided to try pairing it with my Echo. Beautiful! Alexa sounds great and so does my radio station when I ask Alexa to play it.
4,The radio is attractive straight-forward and easy to use.  The sound quality is about what you might expect from a little radio like this.  It's loud enough for a small room or office but don't expect it to be the center of any block party.  It has only one speaker and broadcasts in mono not stereo.  FM reception is pretty good but AM not so much.  Bluetooth is easy to connect and works fine.Summary:  Decent reception on FM ok sound quality nice to look at easy to use.
5,I loved this radio because it has a Bluetooth connection to your smartphone and sounds great
5,The sound is excellent: the bass & treble adjustments give excellent results. Well made very stylish.  I bought another after buying the first.
5,I was pleasantly surprised when I turned on this radio.  Not only did I enjoy the rich sound of the audio but I was amazed that this set pulled in an FM station that my other table radio couldn't get all without even unwrapping the wire FM antenna on the back of this set.  I don't know if the cabinet is real wood but it sounds as though it is.  It's as good sounding as the KLH model 21 in my opinion.  The price point make it an even better purchase.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Love this thing adds a wonderful old-timey feel to our kitchen and sounds great playing “Old Scratchy Records” (which is playing in the video the music is scratchy not the radio) or “Music From 100 Years Ago” to complete the vibe. So cute good sound quality and makes me happy every time I see it.(Also in the video there’s some rustling in the background - not from the radio just my husband opening up other items from Amazon)
5,We purchased this radio for my mother in law. She loved it and hiw easy it is to using.  Funny but we have received more questions from friends asking us if the radio was old from her childhood.  When they find out we purchased it from Amazon they are excited.
5,This is absolutely BEAUTIFUL!! It is solid well made and has great sound!! It looks like it came straight out if the 50's. Heavy-duty and easy to sync!! My husband absolutely LOVES it!!
5,I purchased this as a gift to a friend of the family and she loves it! Her family always brags about how much they all enjoy it. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
5,Really cute at a great price. The radio feature works great and reception is good in my area (city). Brings me back to when I was growing up and all you did was listen to the radio instead of ITunes/Pandora etc...I have this in the kitchen and it looks authentically vintage! Bluetooth is also a nice feature for your modern playlist.Sound quality is good but not for playing loud music as it struggles. It’s perfect for my needs. I have a big stereo for when I need loud clear quality.
5,
3,I like this it looks nice but after about 4 hours of play (some radio some bluetooth) it hums.  You may not notice when you have music on a louder setting but when you turn it off it still "hums".  I planned to use it in my office so not at a loud setting and the humming is obvious on quieter songs.  The only way to stop the humming is to unplug it.  Now I'm worried that I have to unplug it all the time it's not in use and worried what may happen if I forget.  I will probably have to return it and it's a shame as it fit the decor and looks nice.
5,I bought this radio for my friend and she just loves it. It’s a great little vintage looking radio with very good sound.
5,Everything is good
2,Love the retro look but disappointed with the AM sound
5,Love this radio stations come in well and looks GREAT! Sound is good and I am extremely happy with this radio would def buy again!
4,Make no mstake about it this was a great buy for me. I listen to primarily college and public radio stations and they don't have the strong signals that the commercial stations do. For this reason it is imperative that the radio has a TRUE analog tuner. Many radios these days come with a dial which makes it appear to be analog but they are actually digital. There is no doubt that this done to intentionally decieve the consumer so beware!Besides the tuner the radio itself looks so retro and stylish. Even if it didn't work it would be worth the $30 that I paid for it just to be a peice of furniture!
5,I really LOVE this Radio ! No Buttons to push Just make your adjustments and tuning with Actual Knobs ! The Cabinet itself looks so Great and The sound is really clear ! I do not watch TV anymore so I am getting so much Enjoyment out of this Radio !! Thank You so Much !
5,Wanted the look of vintage but the functionality of 2021 and this is the radio for that.Excellent sound quality...Only issue would be that the radio know isn't exact with the radio station but that is minor detail as long as you know what you are looking for I was able to dial into my favorite station.Also use the Bluetooth function for listening to podcasts and have had no issues whatsoever. Was able to pair and operate without reading the directions. A win win in my book.
3,Will not connect to Bluetooth. I’m pretty upset about that considering that was going to be my main use for the item.
3,The look of the speaker is amazing although it is veneer wood not real. It's made in China so what do you expect. The quality of the speaker isn't good at all. The volume doesn't even go up that high. It also is not wireless it plugs in which was a huge let down.
2,Ordered this in late Sept 2021 and was initially satisfied but not impressed with the radio.I figured what do you expect for $40.00 ?Worked reasonably well until the warranty expired.Could no longer adjust the stations.  Every time you turned it on it would jump to another station.Dial was totally useless at this point.I figured  i got what i paid for and threw it away.I did not want to fight with the MFG.I got on 4 months out of it . 90 Day warranty should have been a clue.Would NOT BUY anything from Victrola again .
5,I live in an area with a limited strength for the one FM classical music station available. The hard wired wire FM antenna is able to pull it in most days. But if that wire antenna was a plug-in rather than built-in I could possibly use a stronger FM antenna; more multi-directional. As is I leave this little radio set to that station continuously and again because of its small footprint I am able to place this radio in the best location to get the strongest signal from that FM station.  I do like this radio very much.  John
5,A gift to my husband in a Memory Unit. We weigh the dial were larger so it would be easier to read.
5,Looks very nice I like the classic look. Sound quality is not so good but enough to enjoy in a regular ambiance.
5,Lo compre por su belleza pero al usarlo vi que es de muy buena calidad
3,Looks super cute and vintage. The sound quality is mediocre-low. It doesn't get very loud and the actual quality of the sound isn't great. There are cheaper speakers with much better sound. Blue tooth connects well. Picks up radio stations well. If you get it get it for the look not the sound.
4,Upon opening I was immediately impressed withe the cloth grill and wood exterior. It's a handsome little unit (not too small not too big) with very reasonable sound considering it's probably just a single speaker/tweeter combo. The dial is easily read even for older folks like me. The rotary switched feel like good quality though the switch covers are plastic. Operates well in all modes even the Bluetooth hooks up in an instant. I put it in my bedroom and find it to be a great accent to the furniture! I also bought it to keep my dog company when I'm out and so far she prefers it to the tv hands down.  I absolutely love it.  Best item that I have bought on Amazon period.
5,Great purchase and very well built.
4,Been trying to cut back on electronic entertainment and desided to stick to books and radio.  Selected this product for its simplicity and versatility to double as a blue tooth speaker.  I havent had any trouble picking up radio in my area and the speaker sounds fine in my quiet little place.  The radio is a bit smaller than I expected pic with a can of cola for perspective.  If youre looking for simply a radio with bt capability around the house its  a solid buy.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 It was an amazing device and I loved it so much
5,Just knobs for on/off.  No button control. AM/FM Easier to turn on & off & select chaneels than the overseas models we had.
5,I've taken to carrying this around with me in my apartment to keep using it it's such the perfect little companion. I use it exclusively for listening to podcasts or 1940s music so the sound quality and look are perfect for that. It does when Bluetooth is on and nothing is playing make a strange high pitched noise but the moment it starts streaming that goes away.The walnut color wasn't as pictured on the website which I was super disappointed about at first but a friend commented that the color in real life was probably more vintage so while it clashes with my (all black) furniture it's still a keeper in that respect just something to be aware of.
5,This radio is awesome. Love the vintage look. It has great sound is is very easy to use.
5,Just kidding but I do love this radio!  Captures all the area AM and FM stations I would expect it to and a couple of more challenging stations fairly well.  Blue tooth paired to my phone easily and sounds better than I expected!  I do have it near my bathroom sinks but after 5 months  the humidity and occasional few stray drops from the faucet have not impacted appearance or function.  Very happy with my purchase.  I have to say that my wife was showing our newly renovated bathroom to some friends and the one thing that everyone comments on is how cool the radio is!
5,Two things that I like ...and can seldom find in small portables... one a  tone control. Too manysmall  radios have a setting that promotes the bass part of the spectrum far too much formy taste . Small radios have a directional antenna which makes it impossible to positionthem on a shelf  so the wire antenna on this one is a welcome addition . The other surprisingfeature is a much greater volume than usual . The "wood" is obviously synthetic  but doeslooks smart enough. The tuning is  as most old radios used to be  a little "fine" but once set on yourfavorite it works well
2,This is a nice radio and easy to use and sounds great but unfortunately will not pick up very many stations to listen to
5,Bought this for a Senior neighbor. Simple to use for him and he loves it!
2,I bought this for use in the kitchen but even with the volume turned all the way up on both the speaker and my phone I cannot hear a podcast or audiobook over sizzling food water running or even if the floor robot is running in the next room. The sound is decent for the price though I would describe it as a little "light" - not for heavy bass. That would have been fine for my purposes but I can't stand right next to the speaker in a silent kitchen. Kind of defeats the purpose.
5,Cannot recommend this enough. The sound is just fine (though I'm no connoisseur) and the bluetooth range is great. It looks just as pictured and the knobs feel substantial their turn is satisfyingly smooth. It gets plenty loud. Other reviewers said their dial was off according to the radio station numbers but mine is accurate.Only downside is that the woodgrain is a fake veneer. You can't tell from a distance but it's still a little disappointing. Overall a great purchase.
5,I like everything about this little radio.  It fits perfectly on my kitchen counter it's very easy to use and the sound is really great.  It's a wonderful little radio with great sound and super easy to use.  I love it!
5,This fits well into a small area. The sound is excellent. I love the controls.
3,Nice to look at but the sound is not very good.
5,receiver limited - it may be my location - meets our needs for now
5,The sound is clear everyone they saw loved the fact that it looks old .
5,Nice little radio
5,I was amazed at the sound. I really didn’t think this sound could come out of something this small. I also liked the size it doesn’ take up a lot of space. It’s very compact.
4,I got this vintage style speaker because my husband wanted a bluetooth speaker for the bathroom/bedroom.  I did not want something overly modern for my mid-century decor.  This little radio fits the bill perfectly.  Easy to setup great sound can adjust the treble/bass.  Picks up local radio great too!
5,This radio works great. I got it for my sons room and it’s nice that I can play the radio or hook up my phone and play lullabies and then turn it off from another room!!
5,This is the perfect radio for a room that you may wish to have an old-fashioned look.  The dial is very sensitive and I can tune into my favorite station whose signal is sometimes difficult to receive.  The sound is pretty good for such a small device.  The best part is you don’t have to push a start button to get it going.  I just leave it plugged into a socket that is connected to a wall switch.  Flip the switch the music starts.  The Bluetooth connectivity works extremely well and I like being able to stream from my devices.  It’s a great value!
5,Love this little radio. Adds a touch of yesteryear to my kitchen. Great sound. Easy to use.
5,Adorable perfect size and the sound….. fabulous.
3,Works as described. When power fails it restarts without assist. AM reception is not very good. Some channels are clear but most have static. Otherwise it is a very good old fashioned looking radio.
5,I have this radio in my kitchen....after having an older Phillips. models that to turn on and off you had to aim a remote and hoped you could find the magic spot to turn off. The only thing I would of preferred was a lighter colored model. Dark brown isn't that attractive...alas it works great easy to use especially if you are not impressed with fancy gadgets and electronics. The sound is fine for the kitchen.
3,I like the look of this speaker but it isn’t loud at all
4,This inexpensive radio is adorable and retro and looks great in my daughter’s room. She mostly listens to music on her phone and computer but this sound quality is good enough for occasional use in her bedroom and it looks good too. I also bought one for my 80-year old gramma who seriously LOVES it.
4,Had to request a replacement soon as I plugged it in / on had a loud repetitive  electrical noise and wouldn’t function - also poor packing / shipping measures - replacement arrived promptly and professionally packaged this time  works & looks great !!
3,Likes: sound not too bassy or muffled on Bluetooth am and fm Bluetooth connection to phone works great I really like the looks. Dislikes: am reception is not very good. This radio doesn’t pick up AM radio stations that every other radio I own can (office home car work vehicles etc.) FM reception is much better but like others have mentioned the dial is way off. Don’t think I will buy another.
5,Great quality sound
5,Sound quality is pretty good. It might be better if I moved the radio around but it is where I want it so I am tolerating a slight background buzz.I believe this was advertised as a “wood” case. It is not real wood but wood-look.  I didn’t really expect it to be real wood so I am OK with that. There are several minor dings in the case not sure how they happened as it was packed conscientiously.  I will keep it but would be nice to have a partial refund offer because of it. Look around before you buy I found the same exact item marketed slightly differently for about $60 more. Overall I like the size I like the look and the sound is acceptable. I would recommend it.
4,The only issue could not untie antenna wire.  Other than that its a good product
5,This is so cute! The perfect little radio for my vintage renovated motor home
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             2 Month UpdateThe speaker no longer works. I’ve barely used it.This radio is the cutest thing ever. The sound is ok. If you’re looking for something that has base this ain’t it. But if your looking for something to set a vibe it’s perfect. I love the look of it and it’s a nice size.
3,For the price this is good. As others have mentioned it can’t go very loud. Also the stations do not match up with the dial. For ex. 99.5 dials up at 102. It’s a whole lot better than my iPad .lol
5,I live near power lines and even with 5 different radios even a radio stations channel on my smart TV I couldn't receive my favorite radio station that is only 6 miles away  This is my 2nd Victrola for another room in my home and I am receiving the signal loud and clear right through those power lines.  Excellent product.
3,Great radio  but if you want to find a favorite station easily there are no presets. I'm looking for another radio. Outside of that great radio !
5,My 89 year old mom loves this radio! She’s at the beginning stages of dementia and having something that reminds her of yesteryears is very comforting. She loves it so she had a second one (darker tone) in her bedroom. Now she can listen to her Gospel music and Sunday service when she’s in her bedroom or living room! It’s a very attractive unit!
2,I got this radio because I wanted AM as well as FM with Bluetooth.  This radio looked and sounded nice but the Bluetooth skips several times per minute making it impossible to listen to audio books via Bluetooth even though the phone was sitting on top of the radio. The FM radio sounded great but as other reviewers mentioned it is about 1 *radio unit* (?) off (you are tuned to station 101 when 102 is showing on the dial).  The dials turn very well and feel substantial and secure not like cheap plastic knobs.I had to return it due to the bluetooth issue.
2,Worked nicely for a few months. But then one morning it only buzzed and doesn’t work now.
2,Great looking shelf resident however the one job it has is to play my music and this speaker doesn’t do it well. Sounds like it has one tiny little quarter-sized tweeter tucked in one corner of the housing (which again looks great) and produces tinny-sounding audio with the wrong kind of vibrations. Volume is low.  Spend an extra $50 and go with Bose. This sounds like a $25 item not nearly worth its price.
5,I bought it because it reminds me of the radio my grandparents had in the kitchen. It’s larger than I thought it would be which is awesome. Connecting Bluetooth is super easy. The radio works great and the sound is good. I’ve only had my phone for years so a speaker is definitely nice in the house. Already bought a second one for my mom.
5,Thanks again for a classic shell but modern functionality!
5,Have one of these in two different houses in the kitchen! Just for easy listening while cooking.
2,It would not connect via Bluetooth. That was the reason I bought it.
4,The radio is a great decor addition to our midcentury modern living room. Reception is good and you can bluetooth your 1960s playlists through it. But the sound quality is what you'd expect from a midcentury AM/FM set
2,I ended up returning this product because of the poor sound quality when listening to Bluetooth. When connected to Bluetooth some songs will be fine and then the next will be wavy and seem muffled. I am not sure if that is a speaker issue or a Bluetooth problem. I never tested the actual radio because I purchased this item with the intent of using it play music from my phone. The item looks great though. A retro radio for your desk or a conversation piece for somewhere in your house. Just wish the sound quality was good enough to keep.
5,best radio i purchased in years
5,This little Bluetooth radio is absolutely amazing with it's beautiful classy true vintage look and feel minus that little Bluetooth feature. The radio is clear as a bell and the overall sound quality is perfect. This little unit puts out a decent amount of sound but even full blast does not distort the sound in any way. Very easy to use and elegant for any space especially if you're going for a retro vibe!
5,I bought this for my kitchen because it's adorable and it has am/fm and Bluetooth capabilities. Works well good sound quality has character. My only complaint is my husband loves it too and keeps moving it all over the house!
5,Bought this for my elderly dad as a birthday present. He loved the retro look. The quality was nice size was perfect and the sound was as expected simulates the old radios back in the day with much more clarity and bass. Would buy again!
4,Sound is fine for a smaller radio and is easy to use. We live in rural area with limited stations but works great with included FM antenna.
2,the wood
4,I like the retro look and it is nice that I can use the blue tooth feature to play music from my phone. Using the tonedial I can fine tune music from the twenties up thru the sixties which is a nice touch. I wish that they hadincluded buttons along the back for play pause and next for blue tooth control and had the radio dial back litto see better.
4,Great little Bluetooth speaker for the price.  It’s not Bose quality but it’s everything you would hope for in a light shelf unit.  Good radio.  Average range.  Simple to pair.  Definitely received our money’s worth.
3,I like how when I leave and come back into my shop it will automatically reconnect to my Bluetooth on my I phone dial is off with stations speaker sound quality is not so good but overall it’s a good little radio for Or Bluetooth for my shop!
4,This radio does exactly what I wanted it to do:  pick up stations by turning on the device and locating the desired station.  It is Bluetooth enabled but I do not use it for this purpose.
4,A really nice unit. The sound is fantastic (much better than one would think for its size) and super easy to use. I got it for the bluetooth connection and it is easy to use and does most of the work by itself. Just switching it to bluetooth is all that is required. Great for classical music and old style jazz (Billie Holiday Louis armstrong etc).
4,It is a small radio so I didn’t have big expectations. The sound is good it looks cute and picks up stations easily which makes it easy to use.
2,It sounds decent and plays music well but any time I try to listen to a podcast or audiobook on any app it skips the first work of every sentence. It’s disappointing but ultimately works great if you just want radio and music
5,Love this little honey from the age of real radios.  The sound is fantastic reception unbelievable and the station tuner so easy to use.  I turn it on for classical music ambience in the morning.  If Prairie Home Companion was still on the air this would be the way to listen to it.  Haven't used bluetooth feature yet.
5,This radio is super stylish! The reception is so good where I live that I didn’t need to unravel the wire antenna (I live in the Great Plains but still I was worried about the reception.)My only grievance is that there’s only one knob to balance the sound which makes it a little annoying to listen to classical music and talk radio. What can I say? I’m an old soul at heart!
4,Bought this for my husband for Christmas and he was impressed with how well it tuned stations in and that he can hook his phone to it to play music.  Looks great too.
5,Super Easy to Use great sound quality for its size. Very convenient. A great value!
3,I have several models of Alexa as well as other off-brand bluetooth speakers around my house so this is an informed comparative analysis. Additionally I just bought a mini bluetooth radio for my mother (Greadio Walnut Wooden FM Radio with Old Fashioned Classic Style) and the sound quality of the mini radio an unknown manufacturer blows this Victrola out of the water! The Victrola is big and bulky and so I expected fantastic sound -- what I got was fair sound and a constant buzzing in bluetooth mode. It looks cool on my midcentury modern desk but I'm purchasing the Greadio for myself given how disappointing the sound is on the Victrola.
4,I think this radio is a very good value for the money.  The retro appearance is attractive.  For it's size the sound quality and signal strength are great.  I like the fact that it has a base/treble tone control.  I saw several more expensive radios that did not.Now for the complaints.  The so-called wood case is not wood.  It is an unknown substance covered with a wood-grained contact paper.  At least for the FM band the rotary dial is wildly inaccurate.  This makes tuning in a station very frustrating.
5,I realized that I didn’t own an AM FM radio so I started looking for one. I saw this and had to have it for my home office/library. It was just what I wanted and the sound quality is good. I can pick up many local stations and I feel like I have been traveling back in time.
5,bluetooth good Radio alittle diffecult to get on the right station. singal strength not so greatunless its the building im in.
5,very easy to use  just turn it on but the quality of the sound is not the best  too much static
5,Love it so cute.
4,Great radio but the dial is off like most of the reviews say. Not a huge deal to me but it’s a great radio otherwise.
2,Looks great but I literally have portable Bluetooth speakers that are so much louder in volume than this. It's unfortunate because it looks great and the radio volume is really loud. Something is wrong with the way they configured the Bluetooth chip as you'll never get the same level of loudness as the radio setting of this unit. I am returning it because I primarily use Bluetooth streaming in my kitchen dining room and this thing isn't loud enough to be effectively heard when the faucet is running.
5,I have no complaints. It arrived on time. It works really well the sound quality was awesome. I was surprised at how many radio stations I was able to get in clearly since I live in a relatively remote area. Had some trouble with the bluetooth option but turns out it was an operator error.  Originally got it for the Bluetooth but been using the radio more.
3,The blue tooth works well but I am disappointed that the radio station I purchased this radio to listen to does not come in at all.  I should be able to listen to the station in my secondary office as I listen on my Bose radio in my other office across town.  I work in a small town of 15000 people so it's not a metropolis by any means. Sound is good on other stations though and it is very retro looking so I have had compliments on that. Okay for the money but not sensational.
5,Loving the design. The sound volume/quality is more than decent for my small living room. Had an issue with the volume dial the first item I received: no sound until 1/8 of the way (too low) then no sound again till 3/8 of the way (too high); Amazon CS sent a replacement got in 2 days after and it works without issues so far. Happy with the purchase.
3,You get what you pay for maybe a little less. In my picture of the front I have it tuned to a local FM station 101.1. As you can see it's almost at 103.0. I figure this is the reason a few people have complained about finding stations. I did take it apart to see if I could adjust the needle but it would take too much work.The sound quality is pretty bad and it's not loud by any measure. The MDF used is extremely cheap.If they could fix these problems and put a back light in for the tuner it really wouldnt cost much and I think they could charge double for this thing.
5,5 stars on looks right out the gate. I was skeptical with the bluetooth capability but we were mostly buying as a radio to keep our dog company while we are out. But I was pleasantly surprised that the bluetooth paired and connected very easily. The radio reception was great too and have not had to use the little wire antenna. We were able to get both AM and FM stations clearly. The dial may not be 100% accurate with the station number but that's a minor issue for us since we mostly leave it on one station for the dog and aren't constantly trying to find others.
4,I just needed a little radio to use in my Barn - nothing fancy just a little background sound. This got better reception than I expected so for 40 bucks it was a win.
3,It has AM/FM radio but you only can use FM AM dose not work at all  Bluetooth is nice the volume is not that loud but is ok for the kitchen area
4,This radio sounds better than the much more expensive Crosley Solo or Tivoli Audio Model One.  I tested all three as an office radio and the Victrola has the best sound.
5,I bought this radio for my office at my new job and it is so awesome. People stop and compliment the space I created and the #1 thing they gush over is this radio. They are surprised at the authentic vintage look but with all the new technology. Beautiful design sounds great and now one of my favorite things!
3,This product functions well as a radio and bluetooth speaker. The radio is easy to dial in stations and has good reception. The problem is there is a constant hum coming from the radio when it is turned off no matter what type of surface it is placed on. The only way to get rid of the hum is to unplug it.
4,Good for the money
4,Other reviewers are right when they say it isn’t loud  but the question is not loud enough.  Loud enough for me and as for sound quality... I don’t know what to say... you want retro in a box with one speaker and top quality sound??? And you want it for under $50?!Looks classy volume good enough for use in our kitchen to listen to books on tape some low key jazz classical or NPR.  Again could be louder so I took off a star.
5,My husband bought me this radio as a Christmas gift and I absolutely love it. I have been using it everyday for about 3 months and it is perfect. The sound quality is good it connects to my phone via Bluetooth very easily and it picks up radio stations way better than my car in our wooded neighborhood.The look of the radio is also very good quality. I love that it looks vintage and the wood surround makes it a very sturdy little piece. I would definitely buy this again!
5,Great little radio for grandparents guest room .
5,I purchased this for listening to old radio shows some music and talk radio.  The sound quality is good easy to use and fun design.  I wouldn't say this is for audiophiles but it is a good quality Bluetooth speaker.  As I am hard of hearing having something of superior sound quality is not that important for me; I just need to be able to hear it.
5,This little radio is so cute! I absolutely love it's look. It gets excellent reception and I am pretty distant from any good station. My previous radio was getting really spotty reception so I thought a newer one might work better and this one really has. The volume is also great. There is very little distortion when turned all the way up. Sound quality is excellent.
4,Sound quality is mediocre but it's small and simple to use. Sufficiant for an inexpensive small radio. I also have a similar Wolverine bt radio which has way better sound. A small battery operated speaker for abt the same price likely would have better sound granted I was drawn to this one because it plugs into the wall.
5,Got my order in this afternoon and set it up works like a champ and sounds great.  Picks up my two favorite stations down in the basement.  So glad I ordered this and got it the same day as well!!!  Sounds great and the blue-tooth is great as well not to mention I love the look of the radio.
5,MUY BUENO
5,Sound is great looks authentic 🙂
5,Looks very nice works great
5,I bought the radio only (no bluetooth) version.Radio is still a miracle to me. Turn the knob and there it is! Music News & Public Affairs etc. etc. I like to have radios around the house and these fit the bill. Simple not too big good sound and reasonably priced. I am also a fan of the non-lighted dial - the darker I can make my bedroom the better. I am experimenting with a way to cover up the red 'on' light but that shouldn't be too much of a challenge.
5,Too many radios today have a very bass heavy sound which is horrible for talk radio. So I love having the Tone control. I use Bluetooth to stream music.
5,We've had this radio for about a month now. It lives in our kitchen in our coffee corner. It looks cool. It picks up AM/FM quite well and the bluetooth works fine. Sound is good perhaps v. good for this affordable little wood unit.
5,1. This looks great is any room with a classic retro look.2. The radio gets really good reception.3. The Bluetooth speaker function seems to pair easily.4. The speaker had great sound quality for its size handling treble & bass well.Definitely a great bargain at this price point.
4,During daylight hours it is easy to select a station but at night I have to use a light to see the dial ...
5,Ordered this for my 8 year old Grandson and he loves it. This radio has good volume and it’s easy to tune and gets good reception. Excellent quality for the price.
5,This radio looks really retro. Plays loud
3,i had to order this twice before i got one that worked the first one when i turned it on would work for about 5 seconds and then the sound would quit the second one works but something is lose on the inside and it clunks when i move it. i do like the "retro-looks" of it though so i'll just say buyer beware on this one
5,loved the small size and beautiful sturdy construction of this radio so much that I bought a second one for studio workroom.... the other one sits in the kitchen. nice to have something that serves purpose so well and doesn't look like a robot.  great sound cozy looking. love it
5,This radio is perfect in every way. Looks very vintage (at least to me) way better in person than in the pictures even. Everyone that sees it wants it. Great sound quality and super easy to hook up to bluetooth. I would give it 100 starts if I could.
4,I love the basic calm look of it..not big chrome and flashy.Melds well with wood furniture. Very good reception.I was so happy not to have been disappointed!dianne
4,Nice little am/fm with bluetooth radio. The antenna is junk but we really only got it for the aesthetic value and bluetooth capabilities.
5,This is a sweet little radio that looks acts and sounds like the old fashioned transistor radios of old. We had a pricy plastic modern radio before this and it wasn’t half as good as this beautiful radio. Looks good of the shelf of our mid century modern home.
5,I don't live in the past yet I love to revisit pleasant memories. This radio now lives in my kitchen where I can enjoy my breakfast and morning coffee while listening to golden oldie favorites from the Rat Pack era. I do this by streaming tunes via the Bluetooth feature from my phone. (It connected to the phone in seconds!) The music comes alive through this beautiful little radio with a clear sharp tone. The same goes for listening to local and surrounding broadcast reception using the tuning knob and dial. For me totally worth it!
4,The quality is good and it looks very nice.  Arrived on time in a very timely manner.  The sound quality is good but not something I would brag about to friends.
5,Product looks great and sounds wonderful!
4,Only had it a few days but so far I can confirm the following:Pros1. Seems to be of quality construction for the cost.2. Easy to use (Bluetooth connection good straight forward instructions on speaker)Con1. Volume not so great on Bluetooth connected content (Spotify)
5,Works well for my purposes. I have it play music nonstop at my bathroom. Feels great. But it has limited number of stations available.
4,Product used for casual listening.
5,Simply put  this is an inexpensive radio that sounds like high Quality!Love the look and the sound . Usually these cheaper radios have a hard time picking up even the local channels . But this little baby picks up clearly jacksonville fl or savannah ga  which both are 70 miles away .Big Bang for little bucks !
4,My only wish is for a little more volume capacity in Bluetooth mode. Otherwise a great little radio with good sound.
5,I bought this for my office. It has a fun retro feel.  Easy to pair with my phone to play music from my apps. Great reception using the FM radio too. Very happy with this purchase
5,I don't know if I'm the only one but I feel like going backwards sometimes.  Got some vinyl looking for a cassette player....lol.  This little radio although it has updated technology (Bluetooth) it definitely has a retro feel to it.  I got rid of television and the radio plays all day long in my home.  I haven't encountered any problems thus far.  Would recommend to anyone who wants a little unique piece gracing the bookshelf or tabletop.
5,This radio is great the reception is good in Northern Michigan. The bluetooth feature connects easily and the sound quality is good.
5,Love the vintage look!! The sound is very impressive and the stations tune in very well for no external antenna sticking up!
4,Hard to find am channels ( even w using antenna & proper placement).  Cool design though.
4,It’s a good speaker but not as loud as I would like.
4,FM and Bluetooth work wonderfully. Sound is solid. However AM band picks up nothing. All my other radios are able to receive local AM stations this one just picks up repeating static 'bumps' up and down the dial. I might look at the circuit board myself or replace the pcb with my own.
3,If you don't care about sound quality but love how it looks I suppose $40 is a little too much for its subpar sound. The sounds it produces are just like radio-quality whether or not you use the radio or bluetooth. This may be good or bad depending on what you're ultimately using this for. Good sound? Don't buy. Sleek and retro look? Sure buy it if you have money lying around. This isn't a good investment but I loved the aesthetics of this bluetooth speaker compared to what's available now on amazon.tl;drIt looks pretty but the sound could be way better for the price.
5,All good.
4,It works quite well and looks great. A good value. It has a radio dial which means sometimes you tune into something and the next day you have to find the station again. Also the Bluetooth acts a little strange about allowing a need connection when it had a different one recently. A quick power reset seems to allow pairing with a new device versus just turning off Bluetooth on the old device.
5,Stylish retro easy to use bluetooth easy to pair good sounding unit for the price.
5,Love the color the sound is very good.  No regrets about this purchase.
2,I love how it looks and the radio works well but if I use the Bluetooth feature it is barely audible and the sound quality is very poor. (Radio sound quality is fine.) I use this at work and I cannot utilize Bluetooth for anything other than inside my office with my office door closed and my fan turned off or I cannot hear it.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                           Práctico y fácil de usar se escucha con nitidez. Me encanta. La calidad del sonido es buena y el volumen se controla fácilmente.
5,I bought this for my kitchen. Sadly I have bad reception where I live: although a few stations come in very clear.  But the Bluetooth has been FANTASTIC! Clear easy to use and fits anywhere! I love a classic item w/a modern twist! Highly recommend.
5,I LOVE IT!!! It's exactly what I wanted!! Thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you!Started getting static and it got worse so I returned it.  You say I got my refund on June 3 but I STILL HAVE NO REFUND ON JUNE 17!!  I need to talk to a person but that doesn't EVER happen.  I WANT MY MONEY!!
5,No-nonsense plug-in and use radio.
2,This Victrola is SO cute and for exactly 30 days it worked great radio and Bluetooth. Then today when I tried to use Bluetooth a weird crackling rumble came out.No more iPhone playlists!! The radio is still fine but I’m sad.
5,Love this radio
5,We use this radio as "background music". Great sound quality for the price and its vintage look is perfect in our mid-century home.
3,The sound quality is decent enough for a reasonably priced plug-in BT speaker. I like the retro looks and feel...however the tuning knob isn't accurate. 89.7FM is 92.5 on the dial.Sound doesn't pack too much of a punch so if you're looking for something with a fatter low end that doesn't sound muddy look elsewhere.
5,Way better quality than expected. It adds a nice vintage touch to my space. People are surprised it actually works. Super neat
5,This is the coolest radio! I'm so glad we purchased this it looks so old and cool and the sound quality is great. I also love the fact that it has Bluetooth! A touch of innovation in a product that looks old is so interesting and cool!
5,Great strong sound for such a little thing. Looks so pretty. Good purchase.
4,I absolutely love the look of this radio. It’s nice if you want to listen to the radio and connects to Bluetooth easily. However it’s for quiet listening. If you are trying to play music to listen while you clean this isn’t it. The sound quality isn’t amazing.
5,Good sound with moderate volume.  Good value for price.  Tuning is a little touchy but useable.  Picks up numerous stations very well.  Bought for my 90 year of technically challenged mother so she could have an "old fashioned type tabletop radio".  She enjoys it!
5,I bought the espresso version of this radio and it is absolutely beautiful.  The sound quality is great the nobs are made of real metal and the radio is easy to tune.  As a possible recommendation perhaps you could add a backlit dial to future models.  I feel like that would give this model a cozy appeal.
5,I love old radios and was looking for a "modern" one that looked old.  This one fits the bill!  I get many clear stations on it and love the dials.  It it the right size for my kitchen too.  I am very pleased with this purchase.
4,Sound is on the quiet side at the top of volume dial but gets loud enough when I turn up sound on my phone. It's a cool looking little radio/bluetooth thingy that works good and plays my tunes while I make dinner.
5,When I bought this radio I did not know what to expect. I thought maybe it would be big and gaudy and not hfit in the kitchen and maybe hang over the counter. When it arrived I was very pleased by its compact size and when I turned it on I just filled the room with beautiful music. Both myself and my wife love it. It was not a disappointing buy.
5,I love this speaker and get compliments all the time!
3,Unit is very aesthetically pleasing Bluetooth works well. However I personally purchased this specifically for AM radio and unfortunately the AM tuner is not great. Very scratchy (as in more so than the low fidelity offered by AM radio in general).
5,This retro looking radio is better than I expected.  Easy to link via Blutooth and radio stations are easy to find/pick-up...I love the dial.  It's bigger than I thought it would be.  I love it!
5,There is nothing so far I dislike about this product.  I like the simplicity of it.  The traditional look blends in and the operation is very simple.  Most of all I like the sound quality for the size of this unit it has exceptional sound quality with a dial for treble & bass.  I'm glad I bought this I had concerns it would be cheap but it is not.
5,I needed something unobtrusive to listen to news and classical music in the background and occasionally listen to music via Bluetooth from an ancient iPod. This radio suits my needs perfectly. It's not for an audiophile and it's not an exquisite piece of furniture it's a simple and solid Bluetooth enabled radio with an analog dial. I am very happy with it . I should've bought it years ago. Don't hesitate.
5,It is a dial radio and the dial is smaller so kind of hard to get on a station but not super difficult. The sound works well for our office and it looks great. Really glad I purchased this.
5,Can’t beat the price for the quality you get. Yes it is plastic and not wood but the grain and color will fool you from a foot away. I get compliments on it in my office and the sound is consistent with what an old wood radio sounds like. Worth it.
5,Y'all this radio is SO cool!! I just moved and my new home theme is country chic. This goes so well. It has incredible sound! I love the "oldness" of it. 5 stars across the board.
5,The sound quality is fine for AM radio - its not like a good stereo by any means.  It pairs easily with my iPhone and with Alexa.  I’m happy with this radio.
5,Better audio quality than some much more expensive radios I've owned. The AM/FM range is impressive and the Bluetooth connectivity is reliable.
5,Vintage look and simplicity works for me.
5,I bought this for the Livingroom just to have the radio playing in the backround It is such a good radio and it looks just like it does in the picture. The Bluetooth feature pairs instantly with my phone so I am very happy with this product and highly recommend it if your looking for something more affordable but with good sound quality.
4,Nice looking radio. Connects to bluetooth easily and gets good reception on both AM and FM. Doesn’t get super loud. Perfect for an office bedroom or small living room but you aren’t going to crank the tunes on this. Perfect for my office at work. Sound can be a little “tinny” as is the case with most small speakers but this isn’t a system an audiophile buys. I’d buy it again.
5,Would buy as a gift again. Big hit!!!
5,I liked the style and the old non-digital technology.  Looking for stations while turning the dial brought back great memories.
5,Love the look and feel. Easy to use and works great! Perfect!
1,AM broadcast feature does not work at all  cannot tune to any station without static
5,I bought this for my 80 yr old Mom for Christmas. She absolutely loves it and uses it everyday. I was worried it would look like a cheap knockoff of an old Victrola radio but it definitely did not disappoint. The sound is fantastic.
5,Love it- just needed a regular radio fir my office. Great sound super retro looking and great price!!!
5,I got this for my elderly mother who was having a problem adjusting her digital radio. She loves this finds it easy to use and said the reception is great! This is a quality radio both in looks and sound.
5,I love this radio I wish I had purchased it when I added it to my list instead of just adding it to my list a couple years ago.
5,Me wncanta
2,We loved this radio when we first got it in August 2019 but it no longer reliably works. The volume knob seems to have some static issue to where you have to get it just right to actually hear anything no matter what mode you have it in and often it just won't work at all. Don't waste your money on something that doesn't last longer than two years.
3,It looks great and sounds good. The major issue is that the radio dial doesn’t at all line up to the correct radio stations... if you want say 99.5 on the dial you turn it to roughly 102.1 to actually get 99.5. So the details are off but the product looks really cool and it does sound good. Hard to tune but works.
5,The casing is classic the sound is wonderful and the Bluetooth connected seamlessly
5,This little radio is cute and works great.  The Bluetooth has a good range and the radio does an exceptional job at picking up signal.  Great value.  Couldn’t imagine not having this.
5,As soon as I plugged it in it picked up on the FM station without unraveling the wire antenna.. and the sound for this little sharp looking radio is just perfect when I listen to it.. and the rustic antique look looks great with my other antiques.. great buy and sound for the money.  Victrola you never cease to amaze me with your products.
2,Couldn't get good reception in the center of Minneapolis! Sound when I was able to get it was very poor. I Sent it back.
5,Bought this for a gift for our daughter’s BirthdayShe loved it! Sound quality very good!Delivery was great!!!
5,I’m going through an Art Deco / Mid-Century Modern phase right now and this piece fits perfectly with the surrounding pieces. Very happy with this purchase and pleasantly surprised by the quality of sound.
4,It’s pretty good
5,I live about a mile off of any road and cell service is hit or miss. But this radio works amazing even in a metal pole building. I was actually shocked at how many channels it picks up. I am highly impressed. Would definitely recommend and buy again if I had a need for two.
5,Era lo que esperaba. El diseño es precioso y suena muy bien.
4,We bought this mainly for my husband to listen to AM radio in the kitchen. AM sounds awful. Very disappointed. We are choosing to keep it for the Bluetooth ability.
4,The look is great. The sound is average.
5,I have it in my living room and I love it. Good quality. I would recommend this to anyone looking of a smaller radio to just have in the house.
5,I love the retro look of this radio.  I have it on my dresser and I listen to AM talk radio in the morning.  It pulls in many stations very clearly and has great sound.  It reminds me of the old fashioned radio my Grandmother had in her house.  I'm totally happy with it.  The only thing I wish it had is a dial that lights up but other than that it' s great.
2,The sound quality is terrible for such a large speaker. Additionally it’s not wireless. The only knob to affect sound is “tone” that just goes from muffled to clear. It’s cute. Would be nice for an elderly person who doesn’t care about sound quality so much. It literally sound like an old fashioned speaker.
3,It looks cute but the quality of sound is very poor. The volume control isn't great eather it goes from very quiet (almost can't hear it) to loud like it's only two options. And my phone is as loud as this speaker but with better quality sound
4,This inexpensive radio sits on our kitchen counter and it looks good for the price. We listen mostly to FM news broadcasts and the sound is clear. Analog tuning works well enough. This is not a Hi-Fidelity product but for about $40.00 including shipping it serves its purpose at a very low cost.
3,Sounds ok but isn’t loud I’m at all
3,I bought this thing with the almost sole intention of listening to AM sports radio at home. But alas it gets the worst AM reception ever. I live in LA and can't get AM 570 OR 710 anywhere in my home. If you live in the area you know these stations are the only 2 sports stations and you can usually tune in from under a rock next to Dodger stadium. So to not get a clear frequency on either was ridiculous. BUT the FM antenna works fantastic. Go figure? That is the only saving grace. I get crystal clear FM reception and it has a decent sound and cool aesthetic. Still super bummed about missing out on my redundant sports talk though!
4,I wanted a retro style radio that had FM and Bluetooth capabilities. This one fit the bill. The sound quality is good but it’s not going to be top quality. I use it in my office every day and love it.  Such a fun addition.
5,Got this as a gift for my husband for his birthday. He wanted to listen to the radio again in the kitchen of our new home. It fits our home decor which is vintage. Great radio good sound easy to use and operate. Bluetooth is very easy to connect. Super happy with the purchase.
1,This is an adorable radio and I was excited to have it. Unfortunately it stopped working after two uses not sure if anyone else had that problem. I did not turn it super loud since I was using it in a small space. I tried everything to get it to work and it wouldn’t. Since I didn’t use it that often I wasn’t able to make the 90 day window.Cute radio. Rip off tho.
5,Adds a great touch to the home with a small cubic footprint. Not huge and not incredibly loud but nice crystal clear sound. Vintage looking and easy to pair and though I don't see myself tuning into the radio often It's a nice added functionality.
3,I purchased this speaker so I could listen to music and podcasts while I wash the dishes. It’s beautiful and easy to use but the volume is TOO LOW (lower than my battery operated speakers) so it needs to go back. I expected a corded speaker to have more power than this.
4,Love it! Just wish it could go louder
4,Works great the only problem was they delivered it to the wrong house and I had to go door to door comparing the walls and cement in the picture where my package was left to find out which neighbor of mine it was delivered to.
4,Love the retro look! It is a little hard to tune and the sound quality on AM is not great. I do recommend it though. It is a good value for the money.
5,Such a cute Bluetooth radio! I’m in love with it. Sound quality is pretty good and it’s bigger than I was expecting. Very happy with this purchase!
5,I just wanted a radio because face it streaming music through your phone is sometimes good sometimes crappy. This has a nice retro look.  Easy to use.  Good size with updated components.
5,I love this product. It's so cute and works just like it should
4,Good radio and blue tooth speakerSimply and straight forward
5,Everyone who comes to our home asks about this radio. Stunning sound quality and the practical radio is a real bonus. It took seconds to pair the unit with our phones and our ipad. Easy to use excellent style and just the right size for our kitchen. Make sure you read the dimensions they are accurate.  The radio arrived on time and exactly as picture. Very nice quality piece.
5,I bought this foe my daughter for her her 11th birthday. The sound is great the size the look. It’s exactly what we ordered. She loves it.
4,Works great as I use it to listen to Coast to Coast AM at night when I read. For the price it’s rustic/antique and suits my tastes. The dial is not illuminated but I hardly change the station. Also the Bluetooth has had no issues connecting to my iPhone. The podcasts play and listen fine. However music isn’t exactly this radios strong point.
2,Bluetooth works fine i bought this two listen two the redsox on 105.9 so the dial seems cool but in the dark is hard two find the right dial two shut off THE RESEPTION IS TERRIBLE  the sox are on today.... in ma so we will see but good little radio for the money. it does play the radio station fine had two compare it two a hand held radio the dial is way off 1059 is not ware it should be...no worries... it works i would rather have a different antenna or a wire antenna that plugs in these wire ones suck...i would have returned this honestly but i burned the box..
5,I bought this for my dad and he is obsessed with it! Definitely a great choice - he loves it!
5,The radio is easy to tune and sounds great Bluetooth connection was quick and also works well. I would definitely recommend this radio. Great for RVers.
5,Sound is good and fits my retro decor
5,I like to listen to country music in the background so this radio is perfect for me. If you’re looking for a party boom box find another radio.
5,I love it & the Bluetooth. It look great on my table
5,The media could not be loaded.
5,This radio is fantastic for the price. I read other reviews about it not picking up radio stations well and I expected to have issues because there are few stations around here that come in very well but I was stunned at how easily this picked them up. It’s not a Bose so don’t think you’re getting that level of depth out of your music but for the price this is actually REALLY nice. The retro vibe is perfection. Wish Victrola would consider lighting up the dial though :)
5,I bought this for my friend Lei Lani she is 95 years old. She mentioned she wanted a radio and this one was perfect.
5,Just what it says and just what I needed!
5,This product is crazy cool and it looks very nice. Absolutely amazing for the price.
5,I am an aid on a special needs school bus . I purchased this radio for one of the kids on the bus. He has limited use of his hands . This radio is perfect with it's large dial that allows him to change stations easily He tells me on the bus how much he likes the radio
5,Hard to find stations but like the older days you can pinch the wire with a clip and get a station.  Awesome vibe.  Love mine.
5,It was exactly what I husband wanted. A radio hit his work area in the garage with personality and a treble and bass control.  A little pricey for basically a transistor radio you can plug in but not having to feed it batteries will be worth it.
5,easy to use and very sturdy design  just right size  picks up many stations and also does bluetooth  very good buy
5,I love the look of this radio and it's compact size. The Bluetooth sound quality isn't the best but not bad at all. It's an excellent little decor piece and all-in-one device. I love it :)
5,Great little radio looks cool too !
5,Its beautiful and the quality is excellent. Sounds awesome.
5,Great sound quality. I can have it playing in another room and still hear it very clearly good range of sound capabilities aswell.
5,Great speaker! Easy to connect. Good sound quality. Turns off for phone calls so you don’t accidentally answer on the speaker.
5,Loved this vintage radio love the Bluetooth option. Very easy to use and set up. Fabulous add to my vintage table.
5,The sound is good not great but good. It has a nice vintage look.
5,I love the wood cabinet and old-timey feel.  The sound is good.  I seem to keep getting the knobs mixed up tho.  The right knob turns it on and the left knob changes it from bluetooth to the radio station.  Somehow I keep getting them mixed up because they look exactly the same.  Maybe it's just me. Probably just me.
5,Super easy to connect to Bluetooth.  Fm receptionist excellent.  AM reception is terrible-if am is your main interest look elsewhere.  It’s not hi-fidelity stereo sound but it’s definitely enjoyable.
5,I really like this radio! It's got a retro look but with the benefits of modern technology. I'm not really an audiophile so I find the sound quality to be quite good. It's small enough to fit at my bedside receives all the local channels well and connects to my phone for Bluetooth. The only con I've noticed is that the tuning dial isn't 100% accurate but it hasn't been a problem when it comes to actually accessing any stations. Good deal!
5,Cute product the station we normally listen doesn’t come in but that’s ok. We use it for background noise in the kitchen.
4,I would have given it a 5 star if it would have picked up AM. AM does not come in well The sound is good  and just the right size.
5,I bought this radio for my home office when my previous very old one stopped working.  I like the looks of it I like the low-tech functioning (dials!) and it has good sound.
5,i love this radio
4,Small speaker lacks good bass response otherwise a nice table-top radio simple controls
4,This is a nice little radio for the price.
5,we use it for pleasure
4,After reading the reviews I was sure this would play AM in my office. No go. You do have to turn the dial slowly for FM to nail the station and when you move away it affects the sound. Very stylish.
4,It's a very nice addition to my bedroom the sound quality is nice on Bluetooth though I haven't been able to unwind the antenna. Overall I'd reccomend it.
5,Precioso!!!super funcional  el sonido nítido. Me encantó!!!!
5,I have had this for several months now and use it as a desktop speaker for my computer at work. I use it daily and I LOVE it. Its plenty loud has good sound quality and clients and colleagues alike love it! I was a bit wary as other reviews mentioned static and such but I have not experienced any of these issues.
3,It is adorable I really like how it looks the radio function gets pretty loud but the bluetooth not so much sadly. it sounds good just not very loud. I'm keeping it in the bedroom but it wouldn't be loud enough for the living room.
4,This radio is great. Looks and sound good and the size is larger than thought! Looks so nice sdded to my modern Polynesian decor!
5,This was purchased as a Christmas gift and she found it exceptionally easy to plugin and use.  A simple radio for someone not very tech-savvy.
5,Such a great speaker. The sound output is way better than I had expected and my MIL loved it!
5,Love love love this product! Works great and has great sound quality! I use it everyday
5,I bought this for my 75 yr old mother. She is NOT tech savvy so this old style was a perfect choice. It’s better than expected plus when I visit her I hook to Bluetooth and play oldies for her. Great value and worth it.
2,After almost exactly a year of using this radio almost every day (and it sitting in the same spot) it started to get really annoying. The sound would cut in and out randomly and I would have to play around with the knobs to get it working again.I'm assuming some kind of corrosion or other problem leading to a loose connection somewhere.  I think the problem is the volume knob maybe the rheostat has corroded where I usually have the volume set. If I have the volume higher than normal there is no problem.Either way it's sad because I really like this radio but I don't want to buy another in-kind if it's going to only last a year.I'm going to try that seagan to replace it.
5,It is handsome and so easy to use.  I can turn it off just when I am almost asleep.  It really looks great on my nightstand.
3,Received in somewhat odd condition box looked like it was opened and rummaged before it was shipped to me. As a result the radio has a "c" scratch on it so the aesthetics of it now downgraded.
5,This little gem makes for the perfect mid-century decor!
2,Had a VERY hard time finding normal radio stations. I placed the little antenna high up and it did not matter. Other radios I have had in the exact same spot work great. You could be on a station and it would cut out and go to a complete different station. Sound quality was just OKAY. I wouldn’t waste your time on this product. Looks great but not functional.
5,I got this for my kitchen. While streaming music is great they keep asking if you're still there and when I'm busy cooking and cleaning I don't need the distraction. So back to radio. Even in my apartment it's got a good station pickup and clear sound. It's compact and simple so it's easy to use while I'm busy. Great little radio.
5,Was looking for a small radio for my kitchen and this one is just right. Has good sound and easy to use.
5,outstanding product. looks great. only issue is the dial indicator isn’t synced. e.g if you’re looking for 97.1 you need to turn the dial to 100
5,Bought this for my 89 year old mother in law who was confused about using all the Controls on her CD player.  All she wanted was to listen to the radio with a knob she could dial.  I doubted I could find anything like that but was thrilled to find many retro styles on amazon!  She absolutely loves it!  Easy for her to use and sound quality is great!
4,Very practical little radio to get retro vibe and use Bluetooth. Decided on this for retro apartment project because it offers Bluetooth and AM/FM radio. Works great and gives entertainment options Bluetooth speakers alone lack. Very cool and handy.
1,I love this speaker because of the retro look and the fact that it has FM AM and Bluetooth capabilities. However whenever you connect your phone via bluetooth it cuts the audio in and out. It happens so often that whenever you're listening to music or a podcast you can't tell what is being said. I've tried connecting other devices (tablets other phones laptop etc) and it doesn't change the glitches in the sound. At one point I put my phone on top of the speaker to see if it was a distance issue and that didn't make a difference. love this speaker and this is such a deal breaker and makes me want to return it or open the back and add a smart speaker in the back. Still annoying for the price point of this speaker.
5,Love the retro design and it works so great!! I’ve got so many compliments on it as well!
5,Great radio. My 86 year old mother-in-law loves it!
5,Sound quality is amazing. My wife listens to talk radio only and doesn't use the Bluetooth feature.
2,Wanted the product to listen to basketball games but there was too much static so I had to return the radio
5,The overall look is super nice. I searched for a little while for a radio like this with Bluetooth. Decided to go with this one based off the reviews. I'm so happy I got this one. Trust me when I say you will be happy with this product it looks and sounds great. Just enough sound to fill my kitchen. I highly recommended this product.
5,It can be a little tricky to get a station tuned in but it looks and sounds great.
5,This is a great vintage replica. I absolutely love my new gift!!!! The sound isn’t super loud but good enough for me. Cute and useful.
5,Genial funciona y esa imagen vintage está espectacular
5,The sound is clear easy to find stations that I couldn’t get on a boombox.  Needed something easy for elderly person.
5,This was purchased for my 90 year old aunt. It was easy for her to use. She didn’t need to be taught how to use it. She LOVES it!!
4,Cute speaker. looks nice in person the sound is not perfect but I usually play classical or musical so it doesn’t need a full bass speaker.
5,I bought this radio as a gift for my father and he loved it!! Sounds super well and clear. Definitely worth the money!!
5,A nostalgic radio with great reception to listen to while I am relaxing or working in my office.
5,Wonderful  little radio & the sound is very good. It accentuates my living room & is exactly as pictured...very pleased.
5,Easy to use
5,This radio sounds really good for its size and I love the vintage look perfect in my kitchen.
5,I bought this radio to listen to Sox games. It does the trick
5,I love you so much I have it at my salon everyone complements it I love it it plays the radio and also connect Bluetooth to your phone so great
5,I ABSOLUTELY love this radio! Its beautiful very well made and the sound is awesome!!❤❤ Great buy I want more!!
5,I just wanted to say that this is a great radio.  I'm 72 and I wanted the kind I had in my teens.  This is great.  The sound is fantastic.
5,I liked everything
5,Nice radio.  My husband likes it when on his treadmill..
5,all great
5,My son bought a second one he liked it so much
4,Not loud or fantastic quality but it works great for the price. If you’re looking for a party speaker this isn’t it. If you’re looking for a decoration piece capable of playing music this is it.
5,The style is Retro.  The operation (dial to tune) is vintage.  The bluetooth is modern.  Great sound.  This radio is enhances my home office and WFH life.
3,sound quality is poor and the dial is "off" about 2 numbers (my 101.3 station comes it at 103 on the dial...) but it picks up a fairly hard to get station well.  The sound is tinny and the bass/treble adjustment goes from really tinny to 'underwater'... a better speaker in here would make this a wonderful radio.  For a cheap radio that has some style tho it serves the purpose.
5,Bought this for our mother who is 96 years old. We wanted something that would bring back memories easy for her to use. Mom has dementia and this radio brought her mind into focus she has no trouble using it! Made her happy! Thank you!
5,The FM section has GREAT selectivity stations just snap in and lock. Many adjacent stations in Las Vegas and the tuner locks on immediately. Very good sensitivity as well as I can tell. Haven't uncoiled the antenna wire no need to.The sound is excellent for its size.Just tried out the bluetooth with some John Coltrane jazz from my laptop. Excellent sound.Great value highly recommend.
5,Audio is clear.  Good looking and classic style.  Easy to use!!!!!
5,I gave this as a gift for a friend and it was very well received...
5,We bought this for our 91 year old mother. She loved it and was so easy to use. The sound quality was awesome!
4,Sound quality is okay at best with tinny treble and almost no bass. Yet for the price it make a solid radio for the garage.Looks 4/5Sounds 2.5/5Value 4/5
5,Works great. Does exactly what it says it’s supposed to do.
4,Bought this for my uncle for his NPR. Perfect fit for an older man's apartment. Very well made and good sound for what he uses it for (he's not going to Rock out or anything with it). It looks very retro! Really nice gift!
4,Sound quality is very good.  Easy to use.  Compact so doesn't take up much room.
5,Bought it for my granpa who loves music and this is perfect for him!
4,Looks great! Radio works well the bluetooth is kind of quiet for some reason. Works well though and ive had hardly any issues with it. For a while the bluetooth was stuttering but the issue went away!
5,Sounds nice good selectivity for radio.  Have not used Bluetooth but setup was easy.
4,The sound seems distant in the only place I can put the radio.  What I mean is although the radio speakers are in front the sound is as if it is coming from the backside.
4,This is the perfect radio for listening to podcasts NPR and old radio shows.
5,Great sound!
2,Decent sound. I like the "tone" knob. Auto connect is nice. I like the look. FM reception is good enough for me.The Bluetooth range is garbage. Sometimes skips around 10ft (3.3m)If phone is in your pocket forgot about it. The Bluetooth can't go through your leg.I'm keeping it. It "works" but this is a huge flaw.I'm not 100% sure the problem isn't on my end but my Bluetooth headphones have way better range with same phone.
5,it plays music. got what i payed for. 5 stars
5,I have received several compliments on the looks of this radio. It works well for use in my office.
4,Good looking little radio - little pricey for what it is but what you gonna do?
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Purchased on 3/28/22. Stopped working on 4/9/22.We were very excited about this radio and it worked and sounded great when we first recieved it. The dial was a little off but that didn't bother us. On the 10th day of using this radio I went to turn it on and there is no sound. Assuming the speaker blew (we only used this as a background noise around the house so it was never turned up loud).Very disappointed as it is a really cool looking radio.Do not recommend.
5,This radio was extremely easy to use.  The sound is good.  Exactly what I was looking for.
3,The unit looks great but the volume control is impossible to fine tune- hard to set it low- its very fussy
3,very poor reception on both am/fm stations
2,Fine product when you can get it to work. It will work for a couple of days then it will stop to function properly. Then you need to change the setting until it starts to work again.
5,An excellent radio for the price Great reception and sound.  Looks good.
5,Love the vintage look and it’s easy to use and connect to blue tooth. Sound is nice.
5,Not only is this a beautiful reproduction the sound quality is great.  Absolutely perfect for our master bathroom!
5,Nice little radio. It picked up the stations easily and can get pretty loud. The sound was better than what I was expecting. For the price I’m very pleased.
5,Sound is great considering how small the unit is. It picks up all the radio stations I like even some harder to get. Bluetooth connects fine. Great little radio
2,Looks and sounds ok but I listen to a local station that is 102.5 and I have to set the radio to 104+ to pick up 102.5.
5,Need a radio for elderly and this did the trick.
5,good quality. My husbands listens every day to it.  very satisfied.
4,Doesn't get as loud as I would like. But all in all. Worth it
3,This speaker worked fine for the first few months. Now it has such bad interference with Bluetooth (no matter which device it is connected to) that it’s hard to use because the interference is so obnoxious. My husband works in IT and tried to fix it for me to no avail. Seems like a product issue. Too bad!
5,I like everything about this radio good lookingeasy to usesound is good to me
5,Good quality and nice for the office.
5,Very cute radio.  Works well. Glad I purchased it.
4,Very simple but adequate radio for shop environment.  I like the retro style.
4,Sound quality is far from perfect. 3/4 is max volume you want to push this before the speaker crackles.
5,If you want just a radio one that has an excellent clear sound you'll be very happy with this one. I've used mine for about a month and have been very happy with it.
5,Great Clear Sound.. But it in my old cabin for a cute little radio that works.  The Blue tooth is nice to have also.
5,Bought this as a gift for quite an elderly woman hoping to bring some nostalgia into her lonely life!! Yay!! She loved it. Easy to use and good sound.
5,I bought this for my mother because it has a vintage feel and she loves.
5,I wanted a home radio that had great reliability reasonable sound quality and a classic look. The Victrola radio really delivers and continues to work just fine. I have no complaints. I would recommend this to family and friends who want an affordable no fuss classic styled radio that consistently brings you the radio you rely on.
5,Everyone who sees this in my living room loves it! Cute addition and has great sound.
5,Very good radio my mom is very happy she loves it 10/10 recommend really good radio and very well packaged
1,I've been looking for a true vintage table top radio but they can get expensive.  This seemed to tick a lot of boxes in terms of a vintage replica.  The looks are fantastic.  The features are great.  One major problem.  I can't get any AM stations.  There's a horrible buzz up and down the AM frequencies.  I see now others had the same issue.  If you only want to listen to FM I think you'll be very pleased with the appearance and sound especially for a smaller table top radio.  However if you want to even occasionally listen to AM I think you'll want to look elsewhere.  Unfortunately I'll be returning it.
5,Exactly what I was looking for. Looks and sounds great!
5,Great bluetooth speaker! Easy to use and great sound.
5,Purchased for my dad and he absolutely loves it.
5,Sound quality is excellent.Blue Tooth - excellent.Build is excellent.Very satisfied.
5,This was a gift for my husband. He absolutely loves it! Definitely fits his style. Very easy to use especially connecting to bluetooth. I do wish the sound quality was a little better but you can change the bass and treble.
5,Sweet little radio Once ordered arrived real quick. Good sound Good reception matches our decor nicely.
1,It stops working after a month  It's a piece of crap.  My grandson was very disappointed in this "gift".
5,This thing is great. People that are posting about volume issues... idk man. It’s a small radio that sounds great and blares well I’m my garage.Sound quality- checkLooks cool- checkBluetooth easy- checkGood price- double check
1,We were very disappointed in the sound quality of this radio.  All AM stations had an annoying buzz which detracted greatly from the listening quality.  I tried various locations in the house and the buzzing sound was the same.  I would NOT recommend this product to anyone who wants quality in a radio.
4,It's adequate for our needs on the enclosed patio. We don't get many stations to come in clearly but this one does.
5,Listen to music.  Radio is great and has a great retro look.
5,Perfect retro look with today's technology and great sound!
5,It’s cute and easy to tune in stations or pair your blue tooth devices.  The sound quality is just so so. I purchased two one for a family member and then another for my “she” shed.
5,Nice Purchase! Looks great on my kitchen table.
5,Sounds great! Love the vintage look!
5,I purchased this for my 85 year old mother.  She loves it and it fits with her decor perfectly.  Set up was so easy she was able to do it herself. She has it on and was listening to her favorite AM stations in no time.
5,I love this radio!!! I love the antique look
5,Love it. Exceeded my expectations. Picks up soooo many FM stations. Better than my car! BT feature works great. Sound quality awesome. And so aesthetic. It looks like a true vintage piece. Doesn’t look cheap at all. So cute.
5,Looks awesome especially if you dig the retro look and the sound isn't bad!  big plus it has fm/am built in!
5,Volume dial has a nice click!
4,I enjoy everything about it but if you have your cell phone or anything WIFI related it makes  crackling buzzing feedback.
5,Works well. Nice radio for the price.
5,Easy to use.
5,I really love this little radio!  It's quite small but the sound is amazing. It was easy to hook up to Bluetooth and I can pick up radio stations I've never even heard before. I love the retro look of it!  We use it daily and we all love it!
5,Bought for a gift. Arrived well packaged and my sister loves it!
5,Great retro radio and sounds good !!
5,I absolutely love this little radio! Right out of the box it was picking up radio stations without even undoing the antenna wire from the tie! I still have it tied up on the back! The Bluetooth feature works great as well! Synced up perfectly with my iPhone!Great buy! I’m really enjoying it!
5,O bought this for my mother she loves it!
5,Great for listening to the radio. I was afraid that my boyfriend was going to think it was a waste of money but I think he likes it even more than me.
5,so cute in my room. Sounds and looks great. Highly recommend.
5,Arrived quickly and works great.
5,Present for 90 year old aunt. She loves it
3,Weak sound -- I was disappointed with this product.  I bought this to replace a Bose Wave at our AirBnB so I guess my expectations were too high.  It's a very nice design -- I just wish it would have a stronger sound.
5,Love it! Great look and sound quality
5,Has a vintage look not a plastic box.  Works well although dial is sensitive since it is small and there are hundreds of stations but turning slow and carefully yields any kind of music or whatever you desire...  Very nice looking unit...Does have an antennae wire attached...
3,Received today and it looks like it was returned at sometime and repackaged. I put it in my office and we’ll see if it works well. Perfect size and very cute!
5,Me encanto 💖
5,Very antique..ish and looks and sounds great.
5,Wonderful device for the price!
5,So far so good..
5,Love the look and everything about this radio!
5,If you just want to listen to the radio it works great.  It also has Bluetooth which is a great addition.  It would be nice if it had an AUX port.  Worked great for my mother that needs something simple to use.
5,It was exactly what I wanted!!
2,I like the looks and sound of this radio.  However when I shut the radio off I hear a noticeable buzzing sound.  I sent first one back ordering a replacement.  The replacement had an even louder buzzing. I moved the unit to different locations and outlets no change.  Couldn’t stand the noise so am returning second unit.
5,Looks great and sounds nice too. He loves it!
5,Easy to use
5,Got this for my wife as a gift  she loves listening to the radio in the morning before work and it blends in great with my room color and sound great.
5,small but makes great sound
5,Super happy with this purchase so far. Lovely sound quality easy to use great vintage look that blends with my furniture and 1960s condo. Size is very nice too- not too small not too big and cumbersome. Would definitely recommend.
5,Sounds great love the retro look
5,Love the look. Love the sound. Perfect!
5,It freakin' rocks m'kay?
5,Amazing
5,Got it for the office in an area that doesn’t usually get good reception. We use the antenna (wire) and it works perfectly. We get many compliments on it!
5,This sounds pretty good for the money.  I mainly use its bluetooth function to listen to podcasts.  Works great.  Picks up radio stations easily too.
5,Sounds pretty good for the price at moderate volume. Nice simple retro look. Bluetooth works fine.
3,I love the look it picks up great stations it looks amazing playing oldies and it is lovely overall. It just isn't loud enough.  I have this on my sewing table and when I am stitching I can't hear it at all even turned all the way up and that is with the radio on.  Forget bluetooth.  I really wanted to love this too.
5,Super cute
4,Looks great has really good reception. Sound is just okay. Main complaint is small writing and knob labels make it difficult to operate for older people who wear glasses.
5,excellent
5,My son loved this radio he liked the retro look the tuning dial was accurate and the sound very nice.  He likes that he can wake up to smoothing classical music. Perfect radio and speaker for a dorm room.
5,good quality for the price
5,I bought this radio to play Christmas music in my kitchen through the holidays. The radio looks great sounds great and I love that it’s also Bluetooth!! Great buy!!!
5,Love it! It fits in with my decode perfectly and sounds great. I do wish it could go a little louder but overall I love this little radio!
5,My college son asked for this for Christmas. He mostly uses as a speaker to play music from his phone. He really loves the look and sound.
3,Nice little radio.....all that stuff.But the reception is terrible. AM or FM....
5,Very nice retro radio with bluetooth. Looks and sounds great!
5,As advertised
5,I like everything thing about the Victoria Retro Bluetooth Radio. The style sound and the Bluetooth capability is great for what I need/use it for!
5,This radio is quality. Bluetooth works too. The reception is great. We live in the country and the antenna picks up a better signal than the car! The dial is off a bit but no biggie.
5,I absolutely love this! Although it was bigger than I expected it is so cool lookingAnd sound is great! Very retro and cool.
1,I already own two of these and love them. Gave a third to a family member as a gift. Six week after delivery the power/volume control knob has a short that keeps unit form working and of course this happens two weeks after the return window has closed. I expect a replacement ASAP!
5,nice looking good sound
3,I was super excited to get this radio. But looks is the best part of it. I cant really get AM and FM is okay. Bluetooth works but I was really wanting the AM to work. also the higher you turn it up you also get some odd sounds.
5,Christmas present for my mom and she loves it. Easy to use and easy to adjust. She loves the vintage look and is using it all the time.
5,First it is very handsome with the retro look but almost more importantly it is very current with the Blue Tooth capability.  The radio is now paired to the Alexa to make it sooooo convenient.  Also looks really nice in my guy's office/retreat.  A good choice
5,Worth every penny
5,I gave this to my elderly mom as a Christmas present. It is very easy to use and the sound quality is good enough for a basic radio.
5,Looks good sound good
5,I bought two of these  one I keep at my studio and the other one in my bedroom . I really like these radios ! They are classic looking  sound good and the Bluetooth feature is great . And they aren’t that expensive to order more than one .
3,AM stations I wanted didn't tune in well
5,Great radio! I have mine in the living room for just background noise and it's easy to use and sounds great.
5,Sounds clear beautiful fits on my desk
5,I wanted this to decorate the guest room and for the visitors to have something for music. You are not going to make a party out of it but you can chill out in your room. And in my opinion it really looks nice
5,Me gusta que seve antiguo el sonido como los de antes pero se escucha bien
5,Great little radio. Looks great and sounds great. Perfect office radio
5,Looks beautiful on kitchen counter! Sound quality is great. I have had many compliments already
5,Love the antique look. And Bluetooth capabilities.
5,I bought this radio for music while I got ready for work in the morning.  It's perfect for that and it looks great in my sepia times bedroom.  It gets in more stations than any other radio we have.  Great purchase.
5,This radio was a big hit!  Purchased this as a gift and it’s great.  The Bluetooth connected quickly and easily and the sound is good.  Radio also works well.  Nice vintage radio look makes it perfect.  Highly recommend.
5,Looks like old times
5,I sent to my mother for Christmas. EVERYTHING I call her She playing it loudly!!!  Lol! She loves it!! She said the sound is Awesome!
5,Nice
5,Just what I was looking for! Its and old school vibe. I listen to my podcast and audio books etc on it. Makes me feel like I'm traveling back in time before t.v. came along!
5,I use and enjoy this every day.
1,It stared humming like crazy after about a week. Even if it wasn’t on it would hum. I plugged it into a different outlet to see if that was the issue. Still hummed. It hummed while off. It hummed while on Bluetooth. It hummed while on AM. It hummed while on FM. Contacting support was met with a two paragraph reply that could have been simply “uhhhh I dunno”. When it wasn’t humming this thing was great. Now it’s just a pretty piece of junk taking up space in my bedroom and I’m too ashamed to get rid of it having spent what I did for it and after a week it’s already broken.
5,What a great radio and quality is unbelievable vs the cost.  Very pleasant to look at.  Job well done.
5,This is such a nice tabletop radio.  Great quality great sound and excellent price.  I was looking for something exactly like this....and I appreciate that I found this!
4,Good value
5,Absolutely love it. Matches my room decor so it fits right in. Speakers are great too! Easy to hook up.
2,Works ok most of the time I use it solely for Bluetooth and sometimes the sound is scratchy or sometimes it’ll just stop for some reason. I smack it and it works again. Not sure if mine is defective or not? But it works 90% of the time
5,This radio was perfect for my apartment!
5,Worked as promised very pleased

5,I bought this for my She-Shed and its perfect. Great sound and reception!
5,Good quality sound very nice to decorate your living room. And it is actually a radio.....
3,Loved the look but the reception for AM was poor.....also  dial tuning for FM and AM  required the touch of a brain surgeon to find the exact spot for best reception. I returned it. :-(
5,Beautiful
5,Got this for my wife for Mother's Day.  Awesome sound from such a small radio.  Even the kids loves playing with the dial.  Also extremely easy to sync your phone to.
5,I bought this as an Anniversary gift for my husband and me. We love the look the sound and the simplicity of its dials. Fits perfectly with our tastes & style.

5,Bought this for my office and I love it. It goes well with the vintage look I was going for and it gets lots of compliments.
5,my kid loves it
3,Love it Great sound quality easy to use. Only issue is that that dial doesn't match the frequency. Off by about 3... 101.9 radio station dial turned to 104 or so. Have to search around a bit when switching stations. (Not worth the return hassle IMO).
1,Poor sound quality and reception was awful. Lots of static. Return immediately.
5,Great sound
5,Cool retro radio that lets you play Bluetooth and regular FM/AM radio. Love the style and colors of it!
3,It’s a cool looking radio but I was not able to get good reception.  Also not having digital channel selection was a disadvantage.  I returned it.

5,This radio has a great old school look and great sound. The radio is the main reason I bought it becauce sometimes you want the radio over internet music.
3,Love the look but the dial is WAY off for tuning. Also the reception is really pretty bad where I am but that might be because I live pretty rural...
5,This is an excellent little radio.  Great sound picks up all the local stations with clarity.  Great value at areasonable cost.
5,This little radio is great. We just use it for a little retro ambient music for our Victorian Airbnb. We like to be low-tech but high quality and this fits the bill.

5,A tremendous amount of great resonating sound from this little radio!It is an adorable replica of days gone by.Very impressive!  I purchased 2 and love them both!
2,Loved the style of this. Sent back first because the station didn't match up to the numbers on dial.... not even close.  The second one was better but still not accurate. Sound isn't all that great. Disappointed overall.
5,This is a lovely little radio. nostalgic from my growing up years when everything was simple and useful.

5,Great little radio good sound quality. Nkt the loudest in the world. But great for an office or kitchen!

5,Sintoniza muy bien las emisoras  buen poder de sonido  y muy claro
5,I love this and may buy another for another bedroom.  Sounds great and love the way it looks!
1,It’s mind boggling how any company could go to such lengths to make this retro radio SO beautiful and then use such a worthless speaker. Seriously the speaker is useless I’m going to have to return this and I hate to because I love the looks of it.
5,I get so many compliments on it.
5,Worked well. You get what you pay for. Ok quality sound for its price.
4,Nice sound quality!
5,Bought it for my Mom I was surprised at the quality and she loves it.
2,The radio is a beautiful wood with a fabric face but the quality of the electronics is lacking. I cannot get 1 radio station on both am & fm with the antenna taped to the wall high above the radio. I used another small radio i have and get great reception with a medal antenna so i know its not my location. The blue tooth makes a crackling sound when connected to my phone so the quality of what i am listening to is not so great. It comes and goes.
3,Blue tooth is quick connect and reliable. The radio and antenna are sub par. Dial has very little give so tuning is difficult. The display is installed out of alignment with the tuned station.
3,Nice looking Radio. But she had to take the back off and attach a wire for the speakers.
5,The sound is great and it blend in well with the decor.
5,We use it every morning it has worked great.
5,I have it by my bed and enjoy listening to it at night
5,I bought this for a family member who has a cognitive disability but it is simple enough that he can use it fine.
5,Got it for work I love it works great.
5,As described great quality and sound good value.
1,Absolute garbage. Third time I turned it on I got nothing but a constant buzzzzzzzzz. No AM FM or Bluetooth. Probably built by democrats. Do NOT waste your money.
5,Love the vintage look!!! And plays well with nice sound.
5,Sounds real nice for being so small and love the blue tooth option
5,Gorgeous Little Vintage Radio and sound is Great!
1,Radio function did not work out of the box. Just cheap junk in general my bad!
5,My father needs something easy to use
5,Clear crisp sound for any room. Old school for sure. Only used for a few weeks time will tell.
5,Perfect for small room adequate sound volume and tuning.
5,Great gift.
5,Love it!  Sounds great looks great!
5,Great radio! Works very well I’ve had no issues with it.
5,Wow!  What a great radio!  So happy with this purchase!
5,the sound is okay but for just some background music it works great.
5,Not hi-fi by any measure but does the job and looks cool as hell.  I’ll settle for that.
5,The look and sound are great
5,Love it!
5,This radio is a bargain.  It can be used in any room and delivers very good radio reception.  Looks nice anywhere too!
5,I use it for mainly background noise
1,Doesn't work. Can't listen to the radio and when I connect to Bluetooth it is whisper quite even with both my phone and radio volume all the way up.. I'm very disappointed...
3,Nice looking radio good features but the AM radio had a LOT of static.
5,Great quality. Sound is amazing and works great with blue tooth
5,Nice simple perfect for my mother in law’s art table

5,Great product and would highly recommend it for clarity!!
5,Music and news in the Lab.
5,For elderly people it was easy to use.
5,great product very satisfied .  I use ii in my office
5,Easy to use.  Sound is pretty good. Antenna not needed where I live.
1,I wanted to love this. It used to work for a moment but then my Bluetooth cuts out when playing from my iPhone. The unreliable connectivity makes it a burden to use. At this point (just a couple months after purchase) the volume doesn’t work at all. I have tried everything and asked help from others because I feel like an idiot since I can’t get it to work but alas no dice. Light turns on shows up as an option to connect to but nothing. Radio doesn’t work at all. Too late to return so here is a review 😣. I reached out the manufacturer but their recommendations were all things we had tried.
1,....signIt is too bad!!!!!!! The sound breaks a lot especially when the volum is at high position or in high pitch/loud sound. Bluetooth does not work when my phone is not located right next to this speaker.Volume is really low even I turn all the way.I have been waited for too long to get this speaker since they raised the price $29 to $70. Now the price dropped to $40 so I ordered right away.And I am very disappointed...The color is not the same as the picture either.It is more like cherry I expected lighter color.
1,Had a good review but the dial stopped working right after return date was void...
5,Enjoy radio in kitchen for company
5,What a great radio for my office. The quality is very good!
5,Small and subtle good sound quality
5,Love this radio! Solid wood and decent electronics.
5,Looks and sounds nice  people comment on its looks when they come in my office
5,Nice radio for the money.
1,I had read other reviews where this stopped working and I found out why. It worked very well for me for a few weeks but then suddenly wouldn't make any sound after turning it on a again (some fluctuations before that).I opened it up and discovered its a faulty volume control because when I shorted that connection I got the sound back (but at full volume). I recommend upgrading the volume control to a more durable part. An extra $2 would be worth it in my opinion.
5,Awesome little radio!  Works great highly recommend!
5,Awesome sound looks authentic. No complaints
5,clear sound and cool vintage look. built sturdy enough for the price. worth the money
3,Great product but sometimes can have a high pitch ring that won't go away. Also will just shut off for no reason.
5,A very nice radio. The Bluetooth is a great addition. I have it on my desk at work.
5,I was pleasantly surprised at the look quality and sound of this retro styled radio. It's in my cozy country kitchen.
5,I put this on my bedside table. The sound is great and it looks so pretty and retro.
5,Very nostalgic looking and sounds great. After using a $10.00 coupon it was only $29.00
5,Works awesome and looks great
5,Great sound and look at the right price
5,My senior mother loves it for the ease of use
2,I bought two of these... the first didn’t work at all. The second works but sound is of poor quality and sometimes it sounds distorted. It looks cool but it’s not
5,Good product and value
5,everything great but the AM reception otherwise a great sound and look.
3,Needs a little more power Bluetooth is almost not even loud enough to hear with connected device volume all the way up.
5,love this radio
5,Nice look decent sound
5,Love the clarity of sound!  Adorable vintage look! Highly recommend!
3,It’s a good radio but the Bluetooth doesn’t stay connected and when it is connecting there is a lot of static.
1,I should have realized there was a  30 day limit to return??  I bought for my friend in assisted living  simple easy to use design.  I did test at home before bringing I guess for not long enough.  Radio works for 1 minute flat then no sound at all.  so was a waste of money given  that I was  just able to get it back from her.
5,Sound quality is great!
5,I love this radio! Bought it for my dog to listen to while I’m out.
5,Bought for parent wth Dementia. Simple to use. Sound quality good.
5,LOVE this radio & keep it on the kitchen counter in my old home. Fits the era!
5,I like it
1,Glad I didn’t write the review right away. It worked fine at first. Connecting to Bluetooth could be challenging somedays but not impossible.  I could listen to the Bluetooth connection for hours at a time without any problems. The sound was never excellent but there wasn’t any actual problems. Now I can’t listen to the Bluetooth for longer than 20 minutes before it gets distorted.  My phone (playing the music) won’t move but the quality will become intolerable. I went back to an old device and able to listen for hours again (meaning it isn’t the internet connection). Don’t waste you money. It’s in the donation box.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Everything looks good but no sound out of the speaker on Bluetooth on FM/AM.
5,Good sound and easy to use
5,Use it for my office at work. Love it!
5,Love this radio.. everything I wanted and more.
5,I love the look and sound of this radio!
5,Works as advertised
1,Bought this radio for my Mother who lives in a Senior Living Community. She listens to religious services on the radio and it brought her joy. This radio failed in less than 3 months. The On / Off volume dial broke. It was a nice radio before it broke. Having a difficult time contacting any one about a replacement or refund.
5,So easy to use!👍
5,Product works great and Bluetooth is easy to pair!
5,Great radio!
5,I like it.
3,Not very clear on the sound. Could use a better speaker
3,Good but not great
5,A great radio for the price. Looks and sounds great
5,Cute gift! My little brother looooves it.
5,Grrrreat!
5,It's great
2,The numbers were not right  did not match the radio station number!
1,Vino dañado es malo
5,Easy connect sounds good in a regular size room
3,Ok ok okNot greatTuning is terribleLooks nice but that’s it
5,Beautiful sound and look!
1,Bought for granddaughter for Christmas broke down had it replaced now that one broke down. Getting refund.
5,Arrived so fast. Enjoying radio stations here in Hawaii once again.!
5,Good product.
2,I bought because I liked the retro look combined with the modern features. The problem I had was that the radio (both AM and FM) did not receive signals and I had no station receptions. So basically it was a bluetooth speaker and not a very loud or clear sounding one. I sent it back
5,Love it
5,Pretty cute and the sound is good.
3,Not well made
5,Not disappointed
5,Good
5,I like it. It looks good and works good.
1,I love the look of this radio and the function of the knobs but the sound quality is terrible. I think there is a loose connection to the speakers which results in lots of crackling. It's probably a problem with this specific unit and may not be reflective of the product as a whole. Planning to return and ask for replacement.Amazon asked me to include 'sheerness' in this review. I have no idea what this means!
5,Love it
1,Hard to tune-in lots of static
2,terrible amount of static even with antenna and otherwise very clear station
2,Even though it looks great the sound is terrible as a result of static. Instructions says in case that happens you should put the device close to the speakers. I did so and it still doesn’t work.
5,I love this radio!
2,I loved the look of the radio. It is cool. But the reason I ordered it was to get the AM radio so my husband could listen to his baseball team. The AM radio did not come in at all. We don't live in the country either; we live in a city. I sent it back.
5,Good size for my desk like the look
5,Like the look love the functionality.
5,Great little radio!
1,A real Pity. I had to import and pay international shipping. Upon arrival didn’t work. I sent a video of the malfunctioning but still was requested to ship internationally the product. So all in all not worth it !
1,I just got it for a few minutes...plugged it and it blew off!!! how often do you get an item thinking that it's bluetooth and a bit in the techy side is not 110-220 V compatible??! I'm so disappointed...so mad! there was not on it's online specs that mentioned that it's 110v power supply only? So much for my mom and dad's Christmas present!!!International be buyers...BEWARE!!! This is 110V.
5,A+++ quick ship.  Works perfect
1,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my nephew.  I was so excited about giving this gift but when he tried it it didn't work.  I know life is not perfect so I returned it and bought another one.  It had good reviews I thought I just got a dud.  The SECOND one didn't work either.  So disappointed and embarrassed.  My nephew means a lot to me and I feel like I bought him a piece of junk!  Choose something else!
2,Poor tunning
5,Love the old fashioned look
5,As described
5,Love it. Sounds much better than I hoped.
5,The best I have purchased yet!
2,Unless you are in the same room with your phone Bluetooth is patchy.
2,Build and looks are nice. The speaker is flat and has no character.  If sound is important spend more money on something else.
5,Looks awesome! Love the sound!
5,Good product and service
5,Stereo music all day long!
5,Easy to use great price for product
1,I bought this for my mother who is 96 because she likes to listen to our local AM stations . Well it workedfor a few months and now the AM part isn't usable. I know all about radio locationlocation to pick up AM radio stations but even moving it outside doesn't help. The controls are retro and my mother has no problemwith them but they do no good if the AM stations won't come in.
1,Once I opened it up I turned it on but no sound. I had to open it up and fix it myself because there was pieces not attached and cables not connected
5,Sound is great.
1,I love they way it looks just wish it worked. Bluetooth connects easy but no sound comes from the radio just a loud click from the speaker. I can’t even get radio static on fm or am. I’ve tried unplugging it for a while and plugging it back in. Still it doesn’t work..
5,We like this radio as much if not more than the radio it replaced.  It is a nice size for the area we have it in .  The sound is very good.  My husband says the volume control is too small but he has a large hand so that might have something to do with that.
5,Works great looks very retro!
2,The A.M. station did come through even though the transistor radio put in the same spot did. I didn't even try the F.M. stations. My daughter bought this at my request but I'm terribly disappointed.
1,I received the packaged radio in good shape. I unpacked the radio and read the instruction pamphlet. Plugged radio in and the power light came on. I then Switched selector to Bluetooth and light turned blue. Selected AM and the FM but no sound came out of the speaker. None at all not even static when close to a radio station. I tried many different locations in and around my home. Radio remains silent even when paired with my phone. My phone verified the pairing.
1,Bought for an elderly lady that wanted something low tech and easy.  She liked the concept and the radio was very cute but sound was very low and not clear.  Returned it.
1,Looks kinda nice but sound quality is terrible tuning is terrible (even when wire antenna is deployed) just disappointed.
1,Absolute garbage. AM stations will not come in at all. There is no AM antenna. Nowhere to plug in an AM antenna. At most you could use this as a paper weight for oversized paper. I would not recommend anyone buy this product other than for decoration. Junk
1,Great little radio. I bought it because it is not digital.  Be aware it is a radio and not a stereo.  The volume goes up quite high and some quality adjustments can be made. I like the small size because it fits nicely on my counter.  The only problem which some others have mentioned is that the tuner is not accurate.  No real problem  for me since I am able to find the station I want easily.
5,Neat radio.
2,NA
5,Great product!
5,Highly recommended
5,I love this little radio!
5,listening to radio
1,This product is adorable and worked great for a few months. Unfortunately one day it just stopped working when turned on. It received light use as I only turned it on for my dog while I was away from home.
1,We purchased this item to get baseball games not aired on Tv.  The radio does NOT pickup the channels.  We asked to return this but denied.  Baseball just started.  NOT our fault.  This item is still for sale.  We want to return for credit or refund.  It does not deliver what we want.  Lill Johnson
5,Good
5,Great
1,Plugged in this Victrola radio and received AM stations without a problem. Switched to FM. Did not receive any FM stations. Tried using the wire antenna without success. I didn't even get static! I returned it  immediately. DO NOT BUY!!!
1,The dial on the radio was so off you couldn’t find a station you were looking for.  Lots of static compared to an old radio we already had.  Returned
1,I liked it for the week it worked.  The Bluetooth quit working.  Now its a nice paperweight on my desk.
1,It's difficult to find a decent AM radio anymore.  I was hopeful for this one but seriously disappointed.  About all it picks up is static and a weak station reception especially when compared to other radios side by side.  FM reception was not particularly good either.  Altogether a beguiling but underperforming product.
2,This speaker is gorgeous! Unfortunately the sound quality is so poor that I pretty much just use it as decoration. The volume is always a bit low and the feedback is ever present.
5,Very nice radio.
2,I was looking for something with good AM reception . I moved it all around and different locations but no luck achieve it .
1,Returned
1,There is no reception/ It has an exterior piece of wire for an antenna. I can barely pickup FM and no AM.I missed the deadline to return. I'm sorry I let that slip or it would have been returned.
1,Day 3 and the bluetooth function no longer even lights up to connect to my phone. Didnt do anything out of the normal for a bluetooth device and its bricked on me. Save your money.
1,This speaker almost immediately stopped working correctly. You can only get about 3 FM radio stations to come in clearly and the Bluetooth works for about 10 seconds before it drops the connection. Cute speaker but does not work at all
2,The am reception was terrible.
5,I love it! Use it to stream music and fall asleep. It isnt the loudest speaker but it fills my room. Perfect for a bedroom dorm or small apartment.
1,Radio is junky. Does'nt pick up stations. Poor sound quality.
1,Beware of this product. The AM section would not pick up the local high powered stations. I sent it back. The radio is very attractive and I wanted it as a shelf radio with AC only power.If they can't get AM right then I can't trust them to get anything right. I will NOT reorder it.
1,Worked for about a week then developed loud crackling sounds then no sound at all. Could be a simple wiring issue but I’m not opening up a brand new radio.
2,did not pick up standard stations I listen to.  I gave it away.  Cannot recommend.
2,Bluetooth worked on and the radio looks very cool. The radio aspect of it did not work very well at all and that was the reason I ordered it.
1,Volume on maximum and sound was still low. Cheap quality cheap price. It worked ok but not worth keeping with such poor sound.
1,Find a station sounds great then makes obnoxious popping sounds. So disappointed it's really cute looking
1,The radio looks nice and has a solid feel. The sound quality is awful as there is interference whenever Bluetooth is on. Victrola customer support refused to help.
2,It hummed. Very annoying. And the antenna is a wire that must be mounted.
1,Could not receive any AM stations only FM. Tried different locations through out house. Radio has no place to hook up additional AM antenna. Bought for my elderly parents. Very disappointed.
2,Super cute sounded like crap... Had to returned it.
1,I couldn't get the radio stations I actually listen in clearly. Not at all.
1,Used it four times in two days - the fifth time....no good. Read about this issue in reviews.  Too bad I really liked how this looked in my kitchen.  I did not purchase another one.
1,Worked for about 1 hour. Turns on but no sound on AM/FM bands. Tuner dial is no where near accurate. I tried tuning in a local station at 99 but the dial was at almost 101.
1,Cute which is why I purchased it but it is absolute trash. Sound is terrible. It cuts in and out while connected to Bluetooth. The volume controls are are basically useless because it plays at whatever level it wants.
1,Sounds like crap
2,Too  expensive for its audio quality!
1,Complete piece.
2,The radio sucks it is impossible to tune
1,The radio stopped working after 3 days of use. The sound is not good in Bluetooth Mode
1,Reception and antenna are terrible
2,It does not function propery
1,AM radio did not work which was the main reason why I bought it.  Could not even get one clear channel.  Also sound quality on FM radio and blue tooth was horrible.  Returned it.
1,First one had heavy bluetooth interference popping and crackling.  Exchanged for second one which doesn't have bluetooth radio but am/FM radio does not work wont pick up any channels.  Quality clearly very shoty.  Will be returning for refund.
1,Easy to use
1,Has a lot of static.  Will return
1,It was not working when arrived
1,Could not tune this radio on the AM or FM dial to a station. Worthless
1,Looks nice but the Bluetooth is constantly giving me trouble and disconnecting or not connecting and the volume is very low.
1,The sound quality is awful and the unit barely works (in fact it often doesn't work at all!). Maybe I got a dud but not worth the money.
1,I have returned this ready and did not get a refund.  Please let me know when you will refund me for the radio.  Thanks!
1,I was sent a used defective radio the sound was on for only a day and went out. Terrible
1,Just didn’t meet our requirements.
2,Not very loud
1,AM was static.Stations dial is hard to pinpoint
3,I have only used it for the radio function but the knows are so cheap that they easily slip and cause issues when changing radio or volume.
1,poor reception. in same place as new one which works fine. its not me its you.BTW it's September 5 and still waiting for refund!!!!
1,bad product
1,Poor quality cheap vinyl veneer not worthy of the name "Victrola" made in China.
1,I enjoy talk programs on AM. So much static on AM stations that I sent it back.
1,i LOVE THE WAY THIS RADIO LOOKS. BUT THE QUALITY AND SOUND ARE TERRIBLE.
3,I noted in the comments after I had made the purchase that the tuning dial is not accurate. That is putting it mildly! There simply is no correlation between the dial and the station selected. It is how the tuning dial is made and there is no way to improve accuracy. If you cannot handle having to tune by ear then this is not the radio for you.Other than than I love the retro appearance the ease of Bluetooth pairing and the sound quality is not bad.
1,This piece of trash won’t even turn on.
1,I did not pick up AM stations at all.
1,Nice looking radio but with very bad reception it wasn't useful.  Returned.
1,High pitch sound on am. Bought it for am coast to coast.
1,We couldn’t get it to turn on.
1,Bad reception and a constant buzzing while in use unusable for me
1,Horrible. It looks good but it’s junk
1,The sound quality while connected via Bluetooth is awful.
1,No am reception.
5,Love it!
5,Very good sound quality! Exceeded my expectations 100% satisfied.
5,Bought retro radio for my 16 year old and the quality of the radio was worth the price and it’s cute!
2,It looks nice and sounds fine except… it’s really quiet for a Bluetooth speaker. If I have my fan on the speaker barely plays loud enough to be heard over the fan.
4,This is an attractive reproduction of a radio much like my parents had. I am a radio announcer and have collected many radios over the years. The dial is off and that’s disappointing but I still enjoy it.
5,It is a great little radio.  Looks absolutely beautiful.  Sound quality is not super high end but I would purchase it again.
1,Zero quality.  It does not work.
2,I bought this for my grandmother so she could listen to her favorite radio station. It worked fine when it was on FM but she's recently moved (to a more populated area mind you) and she can only get her station on AM. Not a single AM station is clear which makes this a useless waste of space for her. I'm really disappointed as she really liked the look of this and struggles with more modern radios. Unfortunately it's too late for me to return it. Also the tuning is way off and more of a guessing game.
5,It's the perfect size for my end table.
5,I didn't expect too much from this little speaker but it has better sound and volume for the price. Overall itbwas a solid purchase with a neat vintage look.
5,This little thing is great.  Sounds clear with plenty of bass. Love the bluetooth feature.  And a dial knob for channel searching.  Digital channel turning only gets what it finds.  The dial knob allows me to find the channels i want.
5,Perfect vintage style for our vintage camper!
4,I bought off of Victrola's  web site. Better price. Should not have. Radio construction seems fine. Blu-tooth works fine and clear. FM got the 2 stations I always listen to. Selectivity is not so good but okay for what I need. Now for my issue.  I listen to Coast to Coast at night. This radio I was hoping would workout. No way-AM sounds terrible. And on the headboard there is only so many ways it can sit to adjust the reception. I wanted a nice looking radio on my headboard. This fits perfect and looks good. Reason I should have bought from Amazon is then I could return it without charge. If you do not need AM this and poor selectivity on both bands.  This will work for you. On Bluetooth sound was very good. So I will keep for an extra speaker out in the garage.
4,I bought this at Khols last year just happen to see it when browsing amazon. It cost $60 at Khols at the time if I recall correctly it was on sale and I had a coupon or something but I paid $30ish maybe $40 and i don't regret it.It looks great doesnt take up much room and makes me feel fancy. It is loud enough for a small room such as my bedroom when I'm just relaxing or about to sleep. Blue tooth works great. The only thing i noticed the needle isnt accurate when looking for a specific station. I see other reviews having trouble finding stations and 1 even mentions it's the needle and I agree. I found 105.3 on 108ish so its about 3 numbers off. This makes it a pain when switching between stations I listen too... would still recommend though
4,Got it for Christmas gift for my husband he loves it really much and looks fantastic.
5,Beautiful retro radio with Bluetooth. Picks up stations I didn’t even know were there. I really enjoy this radio.
4,Looks good easy to use. Wish it got just a little bit louder. Over all it is a great item. Bought it for my husband to use in the garage. Sounds great in the garage but if he is doing some gardening in the front yard its not quite loud enough.
5,This is a stylish addition to our showroom and the sound quality is great!
5,Nice little radio for your desk. Easy to set up right out of the box. Looks great. Constructed very solidly. The only negative is that the volume just isn’t very loud. Great value.
5,I was honestly surprised by the quality of this little radio. The sound and reception is really good not to mention the look.
4,I love the look of this speaker (that’s why I bought it) however the sound quality isn’t the best. It would also be nice if it was portable.
4,It would’ve really awesome if there wereDigital tuning. The sound is excellent
4,Good FM and Blue tooth not very good AM RADIO RECEPTION.
5,I had trouble getting good FM reception on several portable radios. After reading reviews on several options I ordered this one. The sound is very clear dials are easy to use and the styling is very retro. I haven't tried the bluetooth function yet. One thing though the radio dial is slightly off when tuning but it doesn't really matter. I know when I have tuned to the correct station. Would recommend this radio for its clarity styling and size. Sometimes the simple designs work the best!
5,I bought this for the kitchen to listen to the news and to music while cooking and sitting down to eat. It works very nicely and the blue tooth option works well with my iPhone when needed. I live close to the city limits and the AM/FM reception is excellent without the use of an antenna. Very solid feeling and beautiful styling including the retro cloth covered speaker grill. The only con is it’s power; The speaker is weak. Listening in close proximity is fine but if you leave the room the sound drops drastically even with the volume turned up. The speakers are just too small for broadcasting sound into rooms other than the one the radio is actually in.
3,I got this radio because it looked cute and vintage. However I did not expect for it to have a wire antenna. The only way I can hear my fav station is to uncoil the whole wire and position it in a way where I wont hear static. When using the bluetooth I found that even with the volume turned all the way up it isn't loud enough. This was the only radio I found that looked close to the one I originally wanted but was too expensive. Oh well it'll sit on my bookshelf as decor.
1,Inaccurate Actual station is not what it shows and it doesn’t play all stations. It just plays like 2-3 stations that are difficult to get too
5,People are expecting way too much from this simple little retro styled radio. The sound is not very good but that’s what makes it so wonderful. The dial is off but it’s really irrelevant. It looks wonderful sitting on the shelf and definitely a conversation piece. If you’re looking for hi fidelity sound order a modern system then. This is all about style. Retro style.
5,This was gifted to me and the packaging was sturdy because it survived being thrown from the fence. Everything was simple to use and worked and is brand new. Although the bluetooth is not portable(it only works when plugged by the chord) it fits my needs and looked great as an antique. The am/fm radio is awesome and it can get loud for a bedroom. I love it.
5,Great radio! I live in the country and the radio gets a great clear signal. We hooked Alexa up to the Bluetooth and it works great as well. Seems well constructed and very nostalgic. Even has a cardboard back.
5,So cool to listen to old radio shows on this retro radio using Bluetooth from my phone and the fact that it also has am/fm is awesome.  I live that it is just a standard electrical plug instead of usb.  I bought a send one for my cabin!!
5,Very nice radio with a retro look great sound easy to turn dials (not digital). I purchased as a gift and she loves it.
5,This was a wonderful radio that did everything I wanted with great sound and for such a good price
3,This product looks very nice.  Sound quality is tinny and not great.  Most disappointing is that I received it for Christmas and it stopped working on New Year’s Day!! One week?  Really??  Hopefully returning it will not cost me anything and will be easy!! Not a happy customer.  I loved the looks and enjoyed it while it worked.
5,I bought this for Christmas for my sister and she has told me over and over again how much she enjoys listening to her Christian radio station on this cute retro radio.
5,Great product! Super easy to use and it looks great. I got the lighter wood color and love it. Sound quality is good too.
5,Was given as a gift..Truly enjoyed the retro look..
1,Very simple and easy to use
5,Great radio for my office. It gets the job done.
5,Nostalgia and quality
5,Is voltage 220?
5,Love it
2,Bluetooth stopped connecting. So it’s just another radio. What I really wanted was a radio with functioning Bluetooth.  Sound is ok.
2,Nice solidly built housing. Looks terrific and found it very easy to use. Perfectly fit the space I wanted to put it in. Unfortunately however I had the same problem as another reviewer; the audio had static even when paired with bluetooth.  Reluctantly returning for a different model.
1,ordered it on the 12th for a fathers day present. said it would be delivered on friday then saturday now tuesday. wtf....
1,As soon as it came out of the box it paired with Bluetooth and turned on but no sound. Not even static. We tried the radio and different Bluetooth devices but nothing. Debating reordering if the first was such a dud. Other reviews seem ok though.
5,I had to wait nearly two months to get the radio after it was ordered but it was worth the wait.  The sound is really better than my Bose radio and it operates just like the old radios our parents had.  Plug it in turn the dial to the station you want and that's all there is to it.  I'm buying another one for my bedroom. This one's in the kitchen.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I loved the look of this radio and had been wanting to experiment with giving an old Google Home Mini a retro makeover while still keeping the radio functional.There is a ton of space inside this radio to play around with! I drilled a grid of sound holes in the back panel then moved the original speaker back there. Popped an old Google Home Mini in its original location. Sound from both is great and the GH is able to hear me fine for verbal control. There may be some interference on AM stations as I don't seem to get any reception - not sure why.Now I can play the normal radio but can also use the assistant to do whatever - stream music/play news/turn on lights etc. I imagine this would work well with an Alexa as well.
5,I was looking for a small retro looking wood table radio and the Victrola Retro Radio filled the bill.The wood cabinet front grill and tuning knob/dials are high quality and the Victrola logo on the front adds a great touch to it's appearance.The sound is crisp and clear especially for talk radio. AM works OK but you may have to position it in a area that's fairly free of electrical interference. FM works great with it's wire antennae. Music sounds fairly good for what it is (not a big stereo radio) but it does have a tone control. BT is great when you want to play music from your phone.I really like this radio and HIGHLY recommend it!
5,Sound is great. Bluetooth is great.  But best of all this radio pulls in stations we've never heard before!  We live on a ranch 30 miles out.  Nice to have quality sound and so many stations to hear!
5,This lil radio is super cute and looks very nice with my retro decor.  It gets great reception and connected to my iPhone with no issues.  You can’t go wrong especially with how inexpensive it is - highly recommended!
5,Bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it.  He loves listening to his music both bluetooth and FM radio.  I wanted a radio that went with our decor and this is perfect.  It sounds good and works well but also looks really cool.
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE! This is a must buy for yourself and a Christmas gift to someone else! It’s so perfect and goes with any decor! No more ugly black speakers!
5,Love this little radio. I prefer real radio to any app and this picks up stations great and has good sound
5,Its a nice product! Its a bithday gift for my father! He love it!
5,Love it. I still listen to the radio so I like using it while I clean. Super cute design looks authentic.
5,Great little radio and I was looking specifically if it had good AM RECEPTION and it does.
5,I love this radio! I love antiques so its even better! Its sounds good and connects to my Bluetooth. I may get another for my upstairs. I would definitely recommend.
5,works great on fm still working on am . not a bad radio . great for garage
5,If ur into oldie style... well this is it! It has modernity and old style... the quality of the sound is good (not great) but does the job and it’s great to have radio...
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Just got it today. Works great. Dial is off I am playing station 100.3 and the dial is on about 101.8. The finish is overall cheap. More like a $25-30 product
5,Sits on my desk and keeps me entertained through out the day. Nice look too my co-workers thought it was an antique lol!
5,I’m impressed with the quality. It’s sturdy and the wood doesn’t look cheap. Love the looks easy to use and good sound quality.
5,Very easy to use. A love it so much I brought another one to give as a gift.
5,Great retro radio for the price
5,Great sound and so cute
5,Nice product and easy to sync
5,Nostalgic look today’s sound.
5,I purchased this for my kitchen it is perfect.
5,Great little radio for our garage. I love it  wife loves it and the dog loves it! Sound quality is great for the size and price. Bluetooth connect was a breeze.
5,Cranks Dokken Well
5,Love the reception and sound quality! The retro look fits right into our home.
4,Nice radio simple straightforward controls. My only disappointment was no lighted station dial! Seems that should be standard and can’t imagine why this wasn’t added. That’s my reason for 4 star rating.
3,I got this as a gift for my office.  Love the look and easy to use.  Problem I'm having is since it's on my desk I can't turn it up very loud (shared space) and the lower volume does nothing but crackle my Bluetooth sounds like a bad AM station going in and out.  Most likely will be returning.
5,This product is so nostalgic & the speaker system is great quality as well.
5,Great buy very happy with purchase
5,I bought this as a gift for a relative who loves vintage. It was so loved that I turned around and got the same one for my husband. It's got that great vintage vibe and sounds great too! Highly recommend!
5,I love this bluetooth speaker perfect for my historic home :)
5,Quick delivery and easy to use.. it’s not stereo sound but it’s a good portable radio. i would buy it as a gift
5,I like the retro/mid-century modern look of the speaker.  It doesn't put out tremendous sound but if you are using it for music while sitting close it is a great item.  I use it to listen to iTunes from my iPhone while working on the computer at home.  No regrets.
5,So fun and love the style of it. Great quality!
5,First of all I’m an avid NPR listener. I wanted this cute radio for my kitchen so as I may tune in while making coffee breakfast- what have you. I live in between Tampa and Orlando two great NPR stations between the two playing different programming. In the car I can only get Tampa… with this little guy I can tune into both Tampa and Orlando stations crystal clear. So cool! I didn’t even know it has Bluetooth so that’s cool too.
4,I like the vintage speaker style!
5,I am so pleased with this radio. It matches my decor so nicely. The radio has great sound quality and a really nice look with a nice size not big and not small.  Very happy customer.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Just received today and got it in place. The second I began turning the dial to tune it I went waaaaay back. The sound quality was fantastic. The room style is "old"/"vintage" and this was the perfect accent to it!
5,Solidly built little speaker reception on FM bands is excellent even without unfurling the antenna wire and the bluetooth capability is quick and easy to set up. Sound quality is good for something this size.If you want a lovely retro kitchen radio and don't want a smart speaker this thing fits the bill exactly.
5,Using this to listen to old radio shows and loving the retro look and the seamless operation. Connecting bluetooth is easy and so far sound has been great
5,I bought one and was so impressed I bought another.Enough said > they are beautiful and have great sound clarity!
5,I bought one and was so impressed I bought another.Enough said > they are beautiful and have great sound clarity!
5,Perfect little radio for my kitchen/office. I listen to music 24/7 & love that stations come in clear and the Bluetooth set up works great. There’s not much boom (bass) so if you’re looking for a house party set up lol this is not it.
5,My wife and I are slowly going with a full 1950s theme in our house and this radio Is absolutely perfect. It looks incredible and sounds even better. It functions perfectly and pairs painlessly with any device I've tried so far and it gets decent reception too. Like other have said the dial isn't accurate though. I also have the little retro red radio by ______ to compare it with and while u love that one this one looks like oameyhing you could jave bought in the 50s rather than just being 50s themed. However the _______ radio is smaller and has a rechargable battery. And because aound quakity isbt as good it sounds more like its from the 50s and the dial is accurate as well. All in all though I would pick this victrola 10/10 times over the other one and in fact I did. I bought this one for myself and received the other as a late Christmas gift because it matches my appliances.
5,I highly recommend this vintage bluetooth speaker. The volume quality is pretty good. The speaker doesn’t feel cheap at all. Would buy again!
5,Looks great. Works great. Fantastic deal. Shipping is super fast
5,good
4,I purchased this radio primarily for background noise for our pets when we are not home.  It is a nice looking nostalgic cabinet.  As others have pointed out the dial is off a bit.  I live in a rural area and found the reception is not the best in the world.  With the antenna rolled out and tacked to the wall I get decent reception.  The volume is good enough for my requirements.  If you are looking for a high end radio with great quality sound this is probably not for you.  If you are looking for a basic radio with decent sound I certainly recommend this radio.
5,I was really impressed by how well made this thing is. Feels really solid and overall just great quality materials in the wood case and the knobs. Super easy to setup and the sound quality is solid. Really happy with the purchase!
5,They love it!!! Sits in the kitchen!
4,Am doesn't come in real good basically what I wanted it for but fm is good and blue tooth is nice. It's small cute and old fashioned looking.
5,This is just what I expected.  A present for my brother who likes antique looking things.  He was thrilled.  I would buy it again
5,This is a great looking cool sounding old-school type of radio perfect
5,LOVE IT
5,This thing is absolutely awesome! Originally purchase for an airbnb unit. Loved it so much bought 1 for my shop and 1 as a gift. Sound quality is wonderful. Volume output is amazing. Ease of use is understated. Highly recommend if you are looking for a nostalgic little bluetooth speaker/radio.
5,In my office space. Perfect!
5,Bought this for my hubby and he loves it.  We have it in the kitchen. Sounds great.
5,I used my bluetooth so I can hear my favorite Christian station BBN loved great sound
5,This works well and looks great on my table
4,The tuning dial numbers are off and the reception is not so good.  I guess if you lived next to the FM radio station you wanted to listen to it would be fine.  I have to put it sideways on a  shelf pointing at the water heater to receive the local NPR station whose transmitter I can see from my back yard.  I guess that must be part of the "retro" experience?
5,I love this little guy and radio works great too. A bit of nostalgia yet Bluetooth! You won’t be disappointed.
5,Good pickup for my nightstand. Even my wife who is very particular loves the retro look. Good quality of sound I can catch traffic weather fm broadcasts ornpair bluetooth and listen to internet radio. Worth every penny and came right on time.
5,Can't recommend this Bluetooth speaker/radio enough! The sound quality is superb and the aesthetic is charmingly vintage. Don't hesitate- just buy it!
5,I love this little speaker/radio! The sound quality is excellent and the best part is that it's so cute!
5,bought for a gift not gave it yet or used it but very pretty radio has retro feel.
5,Sure enough ---- it was a radio!! ---- Just what I was hoping for!!
5,Very stylish nice size great sound and easy to use for my elderly mother.  Very pleased.
5,It’s so cute and we’ve gotten compliments from everyone who’s visited us and seen it. It sounds good it’s easy to use and it matches my sons nursery theme so well! Very happy with this purchase
5,I am pleased with this purchase. You need to adjust the treble/bass knob to bring it to a true sound. Almost as crisp as a car radio! Easy to use and great to have the option of modern Bluetooth. The style goes great in my retro style kitchen. Good quality.
2,Came damaged. If I raise the volume more a 3rd the sound is awful
5,I bought this to create some sound buffers in my office waiting room. It looks so stylish and picks up the local campus station. Highly recommend.
5,Pretty. Looks great. Sounds good. Good quality.
5,10/10
5,Needed an old fashioned dial radio not one that just looks retro! Not an easy find. This one is really stylish works great does what it’s supposed to do. Moms happy.
4,This is a cute radio it fits my decor well. Not "stereo" quality sound but good for a room. Easily connected to Bluetooth. I haven't searched through FM stations but easily picked up a station from about 35 miles away...my dogs like it it stays on for them when Im gone! 😄
5,Such a cool item love how old and new are mixed. I use this item often.
5,I am very pleased with the reception I get on this radio. I can pull in stations from a considerable distance. It is very good quality and attractive.
5,Needed another radio for the kitchen.  This was a perfect size for the location I needed and I was impressed at how loud this gets.  Love it overall.
5,This may be my first Amazon review?  Just wanted to say that this great vintage-looking piece has nice solid metal knobs great sound bluetooth works first try.  Good radio reception.  The only thing that's a bit quirky about ours is the FM dial seems to be off by 1-2 numbers so to tune in to 89.5 you need to point it to more like 91.5.  Once we figured that out it's super easy to deal with.  I'm using it every day and I got big style points from my wife who loves it.
5,Nice Vintage radio 📻.  Plays well and sounds great. It is a plug in radio not battery powered. The antenna 📡 is movable to get better reception depending on the room your in. Keep it away from other electronics for better sound.
5,Like the old-fashioned look. Sounds great too
5,I will begin by saying that I also own Bose equipment. This is not Bose sound quality BUT it isn’t at that price point either. I also own three other Bluetooth speakers that I paid much more for that do match the sound quality of this little devise. And it isn’t puny sound. It has enough gusto to fill your room with sound. That paired with the fact it has an AM/FM receiver definitely puts it in the “highly recommended” category.
5,raido sounds good.
5,This radio is perfect for a bedroomthe sound quality is excellence you can control the low's and the high's and the radio reception is excellence
5,Love the style! Super easy to use. Great sound!
5,It’s plays loud and it’s the best thing I have I remember my grandma use to have one way bigger so I just had to get it and I love it Bluetooth works fine connectivity works perfect volume is loud over all love it
5,Love the sound the and the look. Bought another one fro my sewing room
4,Goes well with my themed office. Sound quality is okay but lacks a little clarity (however gives it a true retro vibe).
5,Looks really cool and fits with decor sounds great!
5,We received our radio promptly on time and were extremely pleased with the quality of its construction deep rich sound and ease of use. It even had a tone button to adjust bass and treble. The stations are so easy to find and the selector button—like the other two—is firm and easy to adjust. Absolutely worth every penny!
5,Great sound.  Good reception ability.  Looks vintage!
5,satisfied with purchase
4,Looks great but knobs are way off the radio is tuned to 97.5 and shows as 99.5 irritating but simple enough once you figure out how far it is out.  Similar with the am/fm/bt selections bt is fm fm is am... simple fix if they spent 10 seconds on additional quality control.
5,Victrola is a better value than the Crosley.  Victrola power supply is a better connection than the Crosley.Victrola treble/bass excellent idea. Crosley has too much bass. Neither has batteries.
5,Very well constructed. Straight forward and simple controls with solid feel. Stays on station. Bluetooth easy to use and setup. Would be nice to have a dial light but not crucial. Looks very authentic. Im very happy with it. I highly recommend it.
5,Cet appareil se connecte facilement via le bluetooth les postes de radio sont faciles à voir nous avons mis un point marker sur nos préférés et pour le prix le sont est très acceptable.  En terminant son petit côté rétro est agréable à regarder dans la cuisine
5,A mi me gusto mucho el estilo llego bien empacado y en tiempo. Tuve muy poco problema para que encontrara la estación que quería pero ajustando la antena de escucha perfecto! Se conecta muy bien con mi ipad por Bluetooth. Si lo recomiendo.
5,Liked everything about this radio - have it at the cottage and picks up stations easily and clear
4,I bought this unit to put in my office at work. Didn’t want expensive or a big sound system. Simple radio that I could blue tooth off mr laptop or iPad if I wanted ... it fit the bill. So far so good.
5,Very happy about this product cause it is exactly what I had in mind.
5,Fantastic little unit! Love it! Feels solid and looks great! Love the retro look and picks up radio stations really well.
5,Bought it for my mother and she fell in love with it.It is a very nice radio with beautiful sound
2,Very cheap finish for the price but sound ok just ok.
4,Radio had large dials so my mother in law could see it easily. Works well.
5,Satistait toutes mes exigences
3,Buen diseño pero no tiene tan buena recepción como otros incluso más baratos
5,Everything is Great! We
5,this radio sounds great and gets really good reception and seems to be great quality
3,Esperaba que fuese inalambrico pero no lo es y el nivel de sonido no es lo que esperaba eso si muy decorativo.
5,Awesome little radio!
4,What keeps it from 5 stars is I tought it was real wood but turn out it laminate
2,Es muy bonita pero se afloja el dial para seleccionar las emisoras de radio 🥺
5,Bon achat
5,Muy buena calidad
5,Great for the cabin.
5,Todo
4,Nice unit functions are straight forward and easy to use.  Does look very good.Only complaint is that the bluetooth connection does inject some high frequency noise.  Effect can be minimized by raising the volume but can be heard (and by extension annoying) at lower volume levels.
4,Works well. Not disappointed. I really like the retro design. Nice to have the radio and bluetooth combination. Could use a better speaker however. When using Bluetoothvolume is extremely poor. This is a negative. For this reason I would not buy again. Sound is a bit thin but this is certainly not a deal breaker.
2,Bought this for my mother to have in her assisted living residence. She loves her classical music. Normally listened to CBC Radio 2.I bought this to give her a feel of the old radios she grew up with. Unfortunately no matter how I play with the antenna I can't pick up that station or the other local classical station.Ended up going to a high-end audiophile store (Advance Electronics) and paid double for a similar looking radio of higher quality in feel and sound by Sangean . . . and it can easily pick up all her stations.Worth every penny. Should have bought local to begin with. I will be returning this one.
3,Was really excited and looking forward to receiving this product. I was really looking for a good quality reception AM radio. It is really unfortunate that the AM station is not receiving well.
1,I have had this radio in the past and it works well. However the one I ordered this time has poor tuning capability as the tuning knob is loose and even with multiple efforts to adjust the antenna and tuning knob  all the AM stations have major static.i am in the process of returning this radio.
1,One of the worst products. Spent 2500 rs to return the product back to manufacturer.very weak and horrible response from them.
1,Tried listening to a baseball game and the am reception was horrible!Also the sound quality is bad and the volume isn't loud enough to use outdoors.I wouldn't recommend and I'm sending my back.
3,This is such an awesome looking radio! Perfect fit for our cottage. I found the sound to be actually quite good for a smaller speaker until after two weeks of occasional use it stopped making sound altogether! Nothing on AM/FM or BT. Not even any static just nothing although power light is on. I love the look of this radio so much that even against my better judgment I ordered a replacement. Fingers crossed!
5,bonne petite radio
5,Lo mejor es el acabado que tiene da la sensación aunténtica de ser antigüo. La calidad del sonido es muy buena también.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 perfect tuner... for a quiet room
5,came quick  everything feels solid wood finish is nice  knobs are tight and feel solid comes with a power cord.... not Bose quality sound but still sounds good! great value for the price looks great in my office!
1,Fonctionnait super bien! Brisé après seulement 2 mois ! Est seulement rester sur mon comptoir .... Plus de radio am/fm et Bluetooth fonctiomne une fois sur deux ..
1,I do like the product although it does have an obvious flaw with the radio dial being set up wrong.
5,The sound quality is great the bluetooth and fm radio both work great as well. Looks very aesthetic and the size is perfect. Would recommend!
5,Compact little radio with good sound & reception
5,Not as loud as I was expecting good for an office setting but if you want loud music I would suggest something better
5,I really like this little radio! I listen to the radio mostly but also switch it to Bluetooth sometimes. The sound is not as good as portable Bluetooth speakers but I don’t mind it works fine and “sounds” like a radio so it’s all good! It’s really cute as well!
5,Great little radio - looks exactly how I had hoped and sounds better than I thought it would. AM/FM signal is good. Bluetooth too!
5,Works great! Took a year to decide to buy looking at all the retro radios . Very happy with the purchase . Well done
1,Died barely after the 1 year mark. Used a few times over 6 months in our trailer. Junk
5,Great quality looks and sound wise. Bought it as a Christmas present and the person loved it
4,Bon produit
1,Stopped working after 3 months. Poor AM quality
5,This is a great product. As advertised
1,This product does not work and I need to return it. Please provide details on how to do so.
1,Our voltage too high it blew up as soon as I plugged it in AUSTRALIANS don’t buy it’s a Canadian product only!!!
4,Le son n’est pas super puissant mais il reste agréable et juste.Super beau élément de décoration également.Bon rapport de qualité versus le prix.
5,Just what I wanted.
5,Very happy with the purchase. Nice little rig
5,Look rétro
5,bit pricey but it's cute and it works - haven't tried the blue tooth part
1,Continuous static on AM…returned
4,Perfect radio / bluetooth speaker for my work from home office. Does not take up too much space on my side table beside my desk. Can alternate between listening to FM/AM radio and using the Victrola as a speaker via bluetooth to listen to podcasts from my phone.
5,Excellent son et bonne captation de la bande FM

5,Vraiment belle et de qualité. Le son est vraiment bon les postes de radio rentrent bien!J’aime vraiment le fait qu’on peut ajusté avec une roulette la quantité de base dans le son!Très satisfaite!
5,We have an outlet in our bathroom that is wired to the light switch so we like having a radio that can stay 'on' so when we turn the light on the radio starts.Our old radio kicked the bucket and I bit the bullet and bought this one as a replacement. I was concerned about some negative reviews but I am glad I went with my gut.It works and I couldn't pass up the 'vintage/retro' look for a FM radio to add a bit of style to having a radio in the bathroom.The volume is better than I expected (we don't even have it up to half and its more than loud enough). It picked up the station we want without any issues and the quality of sound is clear- it doesn't cut in and out and there is no static.Setup was as simple as turning on the volume/power and turning the dial for the station.I tried the Bluetooth and the sound is more than adequate and I had zero issues pairing it with my phone.Overall? It has met my requirements and exceeded my expectations.
2,The radio design is pleasant - The sound quality is good .. The hum - buzz is really annoying !!!!When off it makes a hum - buzz .And - The tuner has good strength - A semi negative on an analog tuning dial ... Staying on a station is a challenge ...
5,Son juste  capte bien le AM/FM.Très beau radio pour ceux qui aime un son doux et juste .
4,Excellent and simple radio. Not the loudest but sounds good. Great for a kitchen.
1,This product should be 240 volts if sold in AUSTRALIA AND NOT 110 VOLTS.IF A SELLER IS POSTING TO AUSTRALIA THEY SHOULD BE AWARE OF OUR ELECTRICITY REQUIREMENTS.
5,The radio looks really nice. It has that classic feel which makes the area where I placed it really nice. It replaced another radio I had that was basically staticky and hard to dial radio stations. I was replacing an old unit with a newer on and a classic look. It did not disappoint. The sound is good the stations dial nicely and there is no static. The unit is loud and the sound is amplified when turned up. We keep it a low level and can hear it nicely from a distance. I am happy with my purchase and hope this radio lasts longer than my previous one.
5,I bought the radio for my Dad it reminds him of  his older radio with current technology. I like the Bluetooth feature if there’s music he doesn’t want I use my iPhone to send his music likes. The only issue we had was the tuner his station can be hard to tune in other than that it was a good buy
3,It's OK for a small room.  Maybe a little expensive  you are just paying for the look.  It just sounds like a small radio from the 80's.  The treble/bass control is very minimal.  Hardly any change to the sound quality.  The volume control is OK plastic not much power.  It's a plug in not battery operated.  It's like a cheap radio made in China that looks retro.  I wouldn't buy it if you are looking for good sound.  It goes in my bathroom for the look.
5,Listening to the the Radio.
5,Just what I needed for my studio
5,A vintage look with simple controls and clear sound.  Everything we were looking for.!!
5,Phone Bluetooth transmission for music streaming
5,great
5,Great sound cool look. Love it
5,This is just what I was looking for. It’s perfect for my space!
5,like the styling and sound
1,If only this radio could hold a signal  tuner does not dial in properly if at all. Total waste of money.
5,I wanted a radio for morning news and one that plugs in so I don't have to recharge it all the time.  This has the added bonus of being a bluetooth speaker.  For the price it is a great deal
1,could not get any AM reception
1,Very poor reception
1,On the picture you can see a light brown and the other one is dark expresso. But the light one is cleary a dark brown. I ordered a second one thinking it was a mistake. Now I have to return both!!! Such a waste of time ( mother of 2)!!!!!
3,Beautiful and solid but the sound cuts out abit not to bad for jamming out on the step ora shower but not for serious soundheads
2,La calidad del sonido es muy mala
5,love it
5,Looks great and works great! It’s wired so you have to plug it into the wall
5,Amazing product! I highly recommend the place I bought from
1,Terrible quality for what was passed off as a reputable brand.
5,Worth every penny! Sound is great and so is the look! Picked up our local radio station right away!

5,Looks great  very loud  dial seems to be slightly off.
1,Après deux semaines plus de son je le retourne.
4,It's beautiful and works as advertized. However the color is darker than expected. I wanted a natural wood color like the one in the pictures but it came out darker which does not go well with the color of my other decor and furniture.
4,Dislike AM sound quality .A lot of static.Sound is good on FM
4,The FM and the Bluetooth functions are good. The AM function really suffers without a dedicated antennae though. I might try to add one myself.
5,I really like the overall quality of this radio.  It is simple to use attractive and has terrific reception and tone.  The construction appears quite good but the finish is not wood but plastic that does resemble wood.  It is a neat package and its compact size does not take up much shelf space yet still allows for good sound quality.  I also like that you can choose between three different sources and can adjust the tone to suit what you are listening to (it has a good bass sound which enriches music very nicely).  It is a worthwhile purchase and in my opinion fully deserves five stars based on appearance sound quality and function.
1,When turned on it just emitted thumping sound. It was supposedly slightly damaged. I wonder how many times this has been sent out?
4,Work like it should
5,Simple to useGreat sound quality
