3,Uniden pulled out of the am/ssb market a long time ago leaving a large vacant hole. Evidently they have decided to return to the market with the Uniden Bearcat 980SSB mobile. Initial impressions (just looking at the pictures) are that it looks like the typical cheap looking chinese stuff I've seen pushed on us for decades.Call me old fashioned but I prefer a analog s/rf meter vs. the digital ones. Like many CB's sold today you can play around with color schemes to find one that suits you. It doesn't have any great mods and reminds me of Radio Shack CB's which were pretty darn hard to modify if at all keeping their nose clean with the Feds.It does come with weather bands (Ooooooh). Personally I'd rather have a smaller meter and a frequency readout rather than channel numbers but that's just me.From reading about half the reviews and doing some digging around I came to three conclusions:1. The BEEP is annoying but apparently there is a fix for that out on the internet2. Most of these seems to arrive dead-on frequency which you'd really (REALLY) want if you couldn't mod the clarifier for SSB transmissions otherwise you'd get a bunch of sidebanders kinda angry at ya.3. Unless someone comes up with anything else the "Beep" mod is it.Okay Review Part 1 is over. Expect updates to occur from time-to-time as I find things I like or don't care for not to mention performance. I'll also keep updates fresh on my Blog. 'Nuff Said WoodyUPDATE: 031813We're on PART II of this review and I expect it to have many parts [ed. - "many" = more than 3]. In my haste to get Part 1 off I should have proof read it AND used my reading glasses because I never saw the tiny frequency readout ﻿under the large channel number so I sit corrected.I've yet to dive into any reading material so I may have to correct myself another time - we'll have to see about that or what time I will have to read. The radio has a channel 9/19 push button switch which has been around forever (or maybe it just seems that way) and except for traffic from Mexico or further South I've never heard anything useful on channel 9 for decades.Some radios I've run across let you set another channel for channel 9 like the local hangout channel and I do like being able to jump to 19 for a quick update on traffic from time-to-time. With this rig being computer controlled it would have been nice if you were (for example) on ch.38 LSB and switched to channel 19 that it would be smart enough/or programmed to change the mode from sideband to AM for you automatically and then back again when you return to 38 LSB.Much like a Blogger or anyone who writes regularly they should have proof-read the box the radio comes in. For instance it has three modes: AM USB and LNB. I know I've been away from buying new rigs for awhile so maybe there is an "LNB" mode but I doubt it. As far as the color schemes go to be specific you have 7 options and I like the fact that it has a 9' cord on the hand microphone. While we're on things I like I may as well mention the adjustable Backlit control. As for the physical outlay it is just "okay". Depending on how and where you mount it depends on whether or not it is more-or-less "okay" with you.The ON/OFF squelch/volume control is located on the top left side of the front panel with the microphone jack being just below which is convenient but I would have arranged the placement of the push buttons differently. Along the bottom of the panel you have push buttons for:S/RF/SWR CalibrationCB/PAMem/Scan9/19/NormalANL/NB andAM/USB/LSBAbove the AM/USB/LSB button you'll find buttons for:WeatherMic GainRF Gain andTalkbackThese are farthest away from your reach in a typical under the dash mount so I would have preferred the bottom row to be (in this order):AM/USB/LSBANL/NBMic GainRF Gain and9/19/NormalWith the remaining buttons along the right side farthest from your reach but not necessarily often used and I'm torn between leaving the on-off/squelch/volume to being on-off/clarifier/volume and yeah I'm being a bit picky now. On the box it mentions that the radio is "wireless microphone compatible" and directs you to learn more about it on their website. I learned that there's no picture of it that it's not available yet and costs $99.99.A very nice surprise is the warranty - 2 years. It's not very often you'll see that so I suspect they don't expect to get many sent back within that period and I was also surprised to see that they furnished you with a 6-pin to 4-pin microphone adapter as well. There is some slight confusion regarding the clarifier. On the box it states that it's 1.0khz clarifier (+/-) but in the manual it says it's 1.5khz (+/-).As far as the scan feature goes (usually not any farther than I could throw it) you do get the option to select certain channels for it to scan thus making the feature worthwhile. Adjacent channel rejection as stated in the manual is 60dB which is better than many CB's made in the last 20 years or so.And that my friends ends Part 2 of the review. I'll have to make some room in the truck and figure out where to mount this before proceeding.UPDATE: 032413 [Part 3 & 4]One of the first things you notice when taking the radio out of the box is it's size (smaller than a Grant) in fact it reminded me of another radio I've owned and reviewed in the past - Midland's 79-290 AM/SSB mobile rig. I didn't have the actual size of the Midland to compare with but I think these two are fairly close in their respective "footprint".While the 980 does not have a removable front panel the layout is strikingly close as well. Both radios have the Volume/Squelch control at the top-left of the front panel and the microphone plug below it. A set of horizontal buttons run across the bottom where in the bottom right corner you'll find the coarse/fine clarifier control and above it the channel selector knob. I guess if you've never held the Midland the similarities in physical size and control layout wouldn't be so obvious.I'm not inferring that these are the same radios on the inside - The 79-290 came out in the early/mid 1990's had dual finals and a removable faceplate; features completely different than the 980 as well as being fairly easy to modify for expanded frequencies FM and a open clarifier. Nonetheless it's something to wonder about....."Did the company that won the bid to make the 79-290 also win the bid to make the Uniden Bearcat 980?"As others have commented before this is a good looking radio - right out of the box but doesn't have that "rugged" feel to it. Give it six months in your vehicle and it won't look like the girl you took to the dance the black plastic will show dust dirt and scratches easily. Used at home with a power supply unless you own a cat that always finds an itch to scratch it should maintain the "newness" factor longer than if it were in your car or truck.I've read about low SSB output straight out of the box on some models and how to adjust it internally as well as that infernal beep - which I'm pretty certain is fixable now. I don't mind that it's a straight 40 channel rig because I usually run a 40ch AM/SSB mobile in the truck along with my HAM gear - I just hope it's on frequency when I get it powered up [perhaps Sunday I'll have a chance to clear off some bench space and do some initial testing].As far as microphones go I may use the factory mike and call it a day or use one of my dependable yet older microphones - but I'll have to test the factory mike first. Back in the 90's I owned a Uniden PC-122 am-ssb mobile. It was a little tiny thing compared to anything else available and I did a audio test with a friend of mind using an Astatic D-104m a Turner +3 hand mike and of course the stock microphone which came with the PC-122.The winner? The stock microphone on the PC-122. My friend said he had never heard me sound so natural on sideband in all of our years to communications and that I'd better not replace the stock mike. I took his advice and during the period I owned it I received many questions like "What kinda mike are you using 'cause it's one of the best sounding microphones I've ever heard" and other similar comments. No one believed me when I told them it was just a stock mike on a Uniden PC-122 so here's to crossing my fingers that I'll get the same results with this one.[....And now - finally to the end]In our last exciting episode I believe I was comparing this to Midland's 79-290 somewhat feature-wise but mostly the footprint (the space that it takes up in your vehicle) and comparing it to my daily companion: a Cobra 138 GTL 40ch. mobile.First the weight difference. Neither radio had mounting brackets or microphone attached so I was weighing the radio only.  The 980 was (to my surprise) 2lbs. 6oz while the 138GTL came in at 5lbs. 8oz.I can only speculate that the added plastic and SMD's in the 980 was the reason it was so light weight. Once again it's weight was similar to the Midland. I spent a week with the 980 in the truck and came up with these non-scientific results using Wilson's "lil Wil" mag mount on the roof of my SUV:Either the receiver was too "Hot" or the Adjacent Channel rejection NOT but I experienced/noticed an unusual amount of bleed over from channel 19 as compared to the 35 year old Cobra.YES - that damn beep was driving me freaking crazy. Why they couldn't have put an on/off control and/or volume setting to the beep is beyond me. For instance with Cobras re-designed 29 mobile you can easily disable the beep via the menu system in the radio.I never found a perfect visual setting for being able to see everything on the front panel during mid-afternoon driving time (I have the same problem with my GPS).Receive audio was done with Icom's SP10 external speaker which I've always used when mobile so it was the only fair choice I had to compare it with the Cobra's as it too used the SP10. Except for the extra bleed over I couldn't really tell a difference although I missed the receive tone control on the front panel of the Cobra.Transmitting audio seemed about the same. Those that replied to my A/B test were split down the middle - about 50% preferring the Cobra and 50% the 980 both using a non-amplified noise-blanking hand microphone.Noise Blanking. When it came to this category I'd have to call it even (which is good because many transceivers have lousy noise blankers in them).The weather function worked very well in fact much better than any other CB I've had with a weather reception feature.The purchase price was very reasonable compared to some online price gouging I've seen.And.....That's about it. The only really BIG question is: "How long will this last?" My Cobra is about 35 years old and still working fine. I don't expect the 980 to do the same but it would be nice to buy a new rig and have it last longer than a year or two before it's junked. When it really warms up (down in Texas you don't have to wait too long) I'll put the 980 back in the truck and see how it holds up under the heat.[I once owned a rig that was truck celing mount and I had to park in an outside parking lot. When I got out of work I'd start the truck up crank up the A/C and turn the rig on. Reception was a garbled mess as was the front panel - I couldn't read anything until the cab temp. cooled down. Once it dropped about 5 degrees I'd turn the rig back on and it acted normal again. So I'm curious on how well the Uniden handles the Texas heat. Look for an update then.]SUMMARY -In some respects the Uniden Bearcat 980 surprised me because if you're a regular reader of this Blog or my Amazon reviews you know that I'm not a big fan of anything made in China. The fact that it's not as deep as a full-sized rig may help those with limited mounting positions/space but they'll have to take the daylight driving vs. seeing the screen into consideration as well when choosing a mounting location. Perusing the Internet via Google I found a mod to kill the beep but no one replied that they tried it too and it worked so I'm still dubious about that one and really that's about the only Mod I found for this transceiver. If I were in the market for a new AM/SSB rig I would definitely consider this one (and probably buy it) but I'm not so the 138 is back in it's usual spot in the truck.'Nuff SaidWoody
5,I can't believe that I didn't review this a long time ago.  It has been a reliable radio I have been using this for several years in my Jeep without issues.
5,Like
4,This is a nice looking radio with a lot of options. First I'll explain a problem that I had because I didn't understand very well about single sideband transmission. When I installed my radio I ran it through the Diagnostic feature that is built into the radio (nice feature!). This feature allows you to test the Antenna load mismatch RF power level and battery voltage.  When I checked the RF Power output on the amplitude modulation function (normal CB mode) of the radio it showed a PASS in the diagnostic mode. However when I switched to either the Upper or Lower Sideband function the RF Power showed a Failure. I called Tech Support at Uniden and they said the radio must be bad and that I should return it. So I did. But the second radio did the same thing. So I went to Amazon and asked a Community Question about what I was experiencing. Several knowledgeable people responded and educated me about SSB. Bottom line is that when the radio is in SSB mode there is no RF Power produced until you speak into the mike. Consequently the diagnostic will show a FAIL when testing SSB transmissions. The other thing that has been mentioned in many of the reviews is the brightness (or lack of brightness) of the digital display. And this is a very real problem. While it is nice to have seven color display options only one option (white) even comes close to providing enough illumination to be used in daylight and it is still not quite enough. And that is after turning LCD Brightness and Contrast to the maximum levels. The fact is that on a sunny day it is hard to read the display. Doable but difficult. Another complaint in many of the reviews is the beep that occurs every time that you change something on the radio. But that beep can be shut off!!!! (if your radio was manufactured after 2015).  However I have not found the beep to be annoying. In fact since it is hard to see the display in bright light it is convenient to hear the beep to know that you made what ever change on the radio that your'e trying to make.  And here is a comment about the Single Sideband function. I decided to get the 980 ssb because it was only about twenty three dollars more than the Bearcat 880 . And I figured that I might find the ssb function useful at some point. And while that may someday prove true right now I'm discovering that there is not much benefit in having the ssb function. If what you really want is just the CB and the 880 already puts you at the extreme of what you want to pay for a radio but you are struggling because you think you might benefit from having the 980ssb rest assured at least from my point-of-view you will not miss the ssb function.  This 980ssb seems like a really good radio overall and I do not hesitate to recommend it or its non ssb counterpart the Bearcat 880 (which is exactly the same radio less the ssb function.)
3,I live in Mesa AZ where it can get up to 120 degrees and the interior of my car can get up to 205 degrees.  The display can't handle that heat and now I don't have a working display.  When it cools off in the winter the display partly comes back but not all the way.  I think the edges are permanently damaged.
4,The price and features combination make this a great buy. I have bought 3 of them in fact. I know the radio's  strengths and weaknesses. Why does anyone need 3 radios? I have 2 cars and a base station. These make great base stations if you know how to invert the power and use a battery in your home. Many radio buffs do this. Base stations cost so much more money but don't really perform much better. I have other radios too including HAM radios. This radio has a few things to be aware of. The beeps are great for driving since you can change or adjust the stations without looking at it. (The beeps can be turned off) On SSB (Single Side Band) the clarifier has 2 knobs on top of each other. One is a broad tuner and the other is the fine tuner. No more chipmunks talking in the distance! (The way people sound when they are no clarified properly) The broad tune clarifier has a "center" notch stop you can feel without looking. Brilliant in the car!The LED screen is just not very bright and for a mobile device this is a real problem. It can be made brighter using the adjustment buttons/knobs but even in daylight mode at the brightest setting it is hard to see. Still this is not important when you are driving you just need to know the channel and nothing else. It has a digital meter on it as well and built in SWR but I only use these when I am stopped and not driving. I tested the accuracy of the built in SWR as well by hooking up a SWR meter. It is VERY close to the actual SWR meter. I feel very safe after testing this over and over that the built in SWR is giving me good readings.Warnings: Do NOT use a power mic on this (With a caveat read on) it has a built in power mic (Gain control) for any mic hooked up to it. It comes with a microphone adapter too so that other mics can be used. DO NOT run this with a Noise Cancelling Mic and run this on volume setting 4. It will over modulate and possibly damage the radio. I know this first hand. I blew the radio up literally with a Noise Cancelling microphone. Smoke out of the radio. I should say I bought 4 of these because that is the real truth I learned a hard lesson.I found I could run a Noise cancelling mic if I kept the volume at 2 and never above 3 on the volume (gain) control. There are 4 volumes levels on this control. I would have liked to have seen a more finer adjustment for this (10 volume levels instead of 4) but this works.Getting the SWR is critical for AM broadcasting. If you get the SWR right your signal is cleaner and matches up better with the carrier wave you are sending out. You talk further and better with a nice SWR (1.0 is perfect but anything below 1.5 is acceptable most people who understand SWR can get their antenna tuned to 1.1 or 1.2) and this radio has that all covered nicely.In short this is a great radio and as a radio operator for over 40 years I really like this radio.
4,Tiny speaker
4,for the price the radio really seems to receive pretty well. a lot of the configuration is menu driven. i am using this as base station so i don't have to worry about trying to make changes while driving. i like the radio overall now that i have discovered it's two primary flaws: the display has issues and goes out over time (mine has not yet) and the stock mic that comes with it is pretty much bad. i replaced it with a powered mic (Astatic Road Devil; $40 approximately on Amazon) and that eliminated any problems transmitting. time will tell if the display has issues for me but for now this is a four star radio for the money. i also have several AnyTone AT6666s and those are worth their weight in gold. the Bearcat 980 is a great radio for beginners so long as you get a power mic to go along with it. photo shows both the radio with the Road Devil power mic.
5,Excellent price verses truck stops!!! Great product right out of the box
4,I like the sideband but don't like that the course and fine tune you cant see what frequency it is tuned to. I like the sound quality is great and other people say i sound great. I don't like that I had to buy a external SWR meater to get a accurate SWR reeding  . I give this radio a 4.
4,THIS IS THE SECOND 980 SSB I BOUGHT FROM AMAZON....IT WAS RECENTLY ON SALE FOR $122.00........I JUST COULDN'T PASS IT UP........THE FIRST ONE I BOUGHT IN 2013...........I NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEMS AFTER INSTALLING IT IN MY PICK-UP TRUCK  ALONG WITH A K30 ANTENNA.....THE NEW ONE WILL BE INSTALLED IN MY AUTO....ALONG WITH A WILSON LITTLE WIL'  ANTENNA.........GREAT SSB CB RADIO......THE ONLY BAD THING IS THAT UNIDEN MADE IT SO YOU CAN'T MODIFY IT.......DAM IT!!!!
4,This new Uniden CB is amazing the reception is so much better than the old ones from the 80's I got from Goodwill and the sound so much clearer I can hardly believe it.  It will pickup stations on almost every channel and the sound is clear so I can actually understand what some of the folks on there are saying now.  Besides SSB and weather band it has lots of extra features like a built in SWR meter and a voltmeter to display the power supply/ battery voltage.  Even though it receives good when I pressed the transmit key on the mic and talked into it nothing happened!  The meter showed that it was transmitting full power but I didn't hear anything.  Even though most CB mics have a 4 pin plug this one uses an odd ball 6 pin plug but they included an adapter so you can use another mic. I tired a different mic and it worked so I took the mic apart and the wiring seemed to be OK but I found a piece of white plastic stuck over the hole in the front that was keeping sound out. When I peeled that off it worked just fine. There is a black fiber piece stuck over the hole and the white plastic piece.  Take off the white plastic piece throw it away and put the mic back together and it will work much better.Also when using the WX receiver it would only play one strong channel and the others were quiet even though I know there are more channels. The problem turned out to be the Squelch control for WX on the PC board being turned up too far.  If you remove the bottom cover and look at the PC board there is a square metal box near the center with a lot of solder on it. Just to the right of it is a tiny trim pot called RT500 labeled Wx Sq.  There is a special tool that's used to adjust it but a tiny Philips screwdriver will work too. If you look closely there is a center point on it that will be set point down at about the 5:00 position.  It needs to be turned clockwise to the 6:00 position or about 20 degrees to turn down the Squelch in order to get weaker stations.  It's not critical and if you turn it too far it won't hurt anything you will just get noise on the channels that don't have a station.BTW don't buy the used ones.  While it looks like a good deal to get an open box item at a lower price they are bad ones that were broken by the first buyer then returned which is what you will get since Amazon doesn't test them.
5,Very nice easy to install more than I expected for the money. Very happy with it.
5,Uniden's mid-size Bearcat 980 SSB sets a gold standard for modern consumer-grade CB radios. The array of features such as scan functionality CB/PA/NOAA Wx customizable screen colors on-board diagnostics and single-sideband are -- in my area at least -- usually found in much more expensive radios. The 980's most direct consumer-grade competitor might be Cobra's 29. The Cobra has many of these features for a similar price but lacks the sideband that affords the 980 effectively 80 additional 'channels.'Signals even at the edge of reception are incredibly crisp and clear. The sound quality is impressive if slightly soft in my soft-top Jeep. In my first attempt at raising someone on the radio I made a contact from my driveway that measured less than a tenth of a mile shy of five miles. The other party reported my signal was strong loud and clear. (That’s a barefoot radio and the stock mic pushing out on a four-foot Wilson Silver Load fiberglass antenna.)It's not the fault of the radio per se but I do have to keep the squelch up a little higher than I’d like to drown out RF interference picked up via the antenna while I'm in town. I'd prefer to keep the squelch almost all the way down and use the RF gain control to dial in signal reception. But since the 980's RF gain consists of five steps (push-button) rather than a dial it's a bit more difficult. As a result the squelch stays up higher and the RF gain a bit lower (setting 3 out of 5) than I'd like.Out of the box before any adjustment my SWRs ranged from 1.0 (Channel 1) to 1.5:1 (Channel 40).I've only two complaints with the 980: First switching from night to day mode is slightly cumbersome. The CB-only Bearcat 880 employs a simple button to toggle back and forth. With the 980's single-sideband functionality this is moved into the menu to make room for a clarifier knob. It’s not complicated but it’s more than I’d like to do when the vehicle is potentially in motion. Second the plastic used for the volume and fine clarifier knob feel of lesser quality than I'd expect in a radio of this size or price range. They're holding up just fine but it's a shame that at least one of the controls you're most likely to use should feel inferior.Overall this radio is a bargain!
3,Uniden makes good radios these days. I worked for Radio Shack in the 70's and In the 1970's you'd find these at your local McCrory's or FW Woolworth's and other retail outlets. Though it was originally sort of a low-end near Kraco and Midland. Uniden (and Midland) has changed its style and operating procedures and moved up a lot.Plusses. Uniden gives you an adapter cable so you can use other brand manufactured microphones with this radio. That puts a touch of humanity in their brand. I like that. Its a well-thought out and diplomatic gesture that endears me now to their brand. It comes with a decent manual that explains all of your features. Kind of important because there are few knobs more buttons and its a much more complex apparatus than what you found in the 70's - 2000's. Its light relatively compact for a full bore SSB radio. The radio is strict in its power limits. There is no fudging this radio but a really great mike paired with it will give you some additional performance. I took this on the open road and got some great distance with the same K-30 I tuned using a Cobra HH RoadTrip. It came in handy during a 20 mile long traffic jam and proved itself to be a skip radio as well. I didn't intend to go hunting for skip on the road but the receiver is incredibly good! I managed to converse with a guy 30 miles away as if he were next door to me. Another guy about 120 miles away was easily reached and heard. For a radio with strict technical limits this radio reaches out and grabs them. I might add I just used the stock mike that came with it. No screaming whistling or any drama on my part.Power wise it puts out 4 watts on deadkey. You can maybe peak it out maybe 6 or 7 AM if you're loud. I'm not loud so I didn't see that kind of performance. Triple that on sideband about 12 watts output give or take. Its intended to perform as a stock radio so its within strict power limits that are not really going to budge except by use of an amped up mike on AM.Minusses. Its till big. I had to leave it on my car seat. Its made for  underdash mounting so the speaker's on the bottom (as with most radios) and so an external would've been better than reading everything upside down.The digital metering is quirky. Its supposed to measure RF/Signal Strength and SWR but I found that the onboards did not agree with the SWR/Signal Strength and Watt meter I picked up at Ham Radio Outlet. The weather channels stock out of the box are all squelched so unless you're close you may not pick them up. I don't know how to unsquelch them yet. So there you have it. I have to figure that one out as the manual doesn't explain this phenomena.As a stock bargain priced SSB its worth the money. It performs as good as models that cost twice as much so at the price at about $120 give or take its a good deal.  Performance is mediocre compared to some of the models out there that likely will outperform this unit. However you get what you pay for! It suits me for the road but just doesn't fit anywhere in my car! So it'll end up a base station as soon as I home brew an antenna for it.
4,Radio has a lot of features but does not come calibrated. Took quite a while to calibrate the channels where they need to be
4,This can radio is very good. It is a great value considering the price point.  There are better radios out there but this radio does the job as it is intended and has been of great use.
4,Good cb I installed it in less than 5 minutes to my semi. I have it paired with a Wilson 2000 antenna I don’t have the charger and antenna tuned in all the way yet but I can still reach 1.5-2 miles without a problem the noise block and anolog noice block don’t work the best but not bad for a off the shelf cb
5,I absolutely love this radio.  All the features and accessibility make this the best I've owned so far.  I was skeptical at first due to some of the negative reviews on Amazon but after playing with it all day today I'm glad I bought it.  It can be peaked and tuned though it's set perfect out of the box.  Doesn't drift at all and the internal diagnostics is a plus though I'm not sure how accurate it is.  I purchased this as a replacement from a burned up unit  so I thought.  Old one wouldn't transmit and it was very old.  Plugged in my new cheaper antenna to this one and the diagnostic test failed the antenna.  Actually metered it finally and sure enough my antenna is bad. So I threw away my old unit for nothing I'm sure.  Albeit aside I'm more than happy with the clarity out of this one and is a huge upgrade from what I had.  Weather bands sound great.  Memory scan and full channel scan as well as side band are great features.  Can fine tune everything quite easily.  I watched a single YouTube video about this radio and that's all I needed.  No need to break out the manual for this unit.  Once you get the idea it's very simple to navigate through all the features.  I put this one in my 2014 Silverado z71 right in the center console.  Easy power access and ability to hide all the wires.  Looks like it belongs.  Highly recommend this unit for new or seasoned operators.  Just make sure you don't skimp on the antenna.  I'll be buying another Firestick and mounting opposite my radio antenna on the hood.  I would also recommend not getting a roof mount antenna for this unit.  From other reviews the cb will fail the diagnostics test.  Get a good center load and ground it properly and make sure it's tuned right. Order a Firestix antenna as well Walcott radio has the best prices.
4,Good radio so far. I've had it for a few months and been on several trail runs with it. I was having a problem with intermittently distorted audio on receive and was beginning to think I was going to have to send it back for repair but finally discovered that my coax connection in the rear of the radio had loosened. Tightened the coax connector and haven't had any issues since.OBJECTIONS / ISSUES:Beeps for EVERYTHING get kind of annoying.Uses a 6 pin mic plug instead of the standard 4 pin but comes with an adapter so you can use aftermarket mics like the Astatic RD104E-4B Road Devil I use on mine. (See review.)Plastic face plate scratches VERY easily which is unfortunate in a dusty environment like an offroad vehicle. Also prone to bad glare so if you prefer dim displays you'll find yourself unable to read it in bright light. LED intensity is adjustable but the process to do so is unhandy. So switching from bright to dim for day/night is really not something you're likely to want to do on a regular basis. Not sure why they didn't just put a "dim" button or switch on the front panel like they did with the Bearcat 880 and 680 models.You'll almost certainly want an external speaker for any sort of serious use. The internal one is just barely tolerable.If it sounds like I hate it I don't. It's a fine radio. I'm just trying to point out some of the issues where it could stand improvement. If you don't need SSB save yourself $15 and get the Bearcat 880. Or if space is an issue the Bearcat 680 is about another $15 less but you sacrifice some bells & whistles with the 680 Wx being one of the very important ones in my opinion.
5,*** UPDATE *** 9/24/14I have been using this radio for 2 weeks now have made contacts all over the US of A on SSB and locally on AM.  I am getting great feedback on the audio quality using the included mic and everyone says it is very clean sounding.  The scan feature is a huge plus for finding our local forestry and logging operations to communicate with log truck drivers and heavy equipment operators when hunting.  The WX channels come in better than my table top unit as long as "scan" feature is used to pick the best station.  Good to have different display colors to pick from the red for night driving is a very nice touch.  All in all - this is possibly the best radio from Uniden (Bearcat) since the PC-122.This radio has really outstanding reception good noise rejection is very stable on frequency output.  Compares nicely against my IC-736 Base HAM radio for reciving weak signals only way I beat it is by turning on my preamp.  The radio transmission on AM and SSB is close to perfect as one could ask minimal adjustment to bring in clearly and zero drift.  Audio output with stock mic is as expected but improves dramatically with power mic.  Is slightly smaller than my Cobra 29LTD (original version) and slightly larger than my PC-122 it is replacing is much more sturdy considering SMD devices that have been used through the build.  Talk back is interesting does nothing for transmissions but does allow you to hear your audio to make audio adjustments as needed.  Using 5' FireStik antenna FireStik coax with premade end for stud mount vs. PL-239 ends 18' length.  Waiting on FireStik 3/8" stud to complete the radio build out.  Going with the coax / sealed stud end for weather protection as mount is on front window gutter of my truck.  Wish they would have powder coated the mounting bracket the bright gold metal finish is standing out like a sore thumb sending out for paint next week.
4,Works good enough for me out of the box with factory Volvo coax and antenna (with that stupid multiplexer system). Lots of nice features compared to my old Cobra 29NW/ST. This thing even picks up the weather bands so much better than my cobra despite a few other reviews saying the contrary. I bought the insurance Amazon offers just in case the screen takes a crap.
5,EXCELLENT receive audio. I have mine plugged into a hifi speaker that came off the side of a plasma TV sounds great. I've gotten great audio reports on the TX quality. I'm even pretty happy with the stock mic. The display looks great. The changeable display colors are a lot of fun! Will be great when the radio eventually goes in the truck. You can match the color to the rest of your instruments or go nuts with some of the wilder colors. ;) The brightness and contrast controls are really slick for setting it up so as not to cause fatigue or distraction.Now here's a few concerns and criticisms but for me it does not sour me on this radio in the least: Mine out of the box does 3W dk. Have not gone inside and turned it up yet though I plan to. We're allowed 4 Watts so that’s what I want! All that I've read indicates the adjustment will work out fine. I did however do the "beep mod" in which you unsolder one SMD resistor to get rid of the ABSOLUTELY USELESS ANNOYING and LOUD BEEP every time you twist a knob or push a button. This radio is annoying as heck esp. with an external speaker until this is done. Google for it the instructions are out there youtube. This radio does indeed have the Mitsubishi RD16HHF1 Mosfet final I've confirmed it in mine. I had some concern in reading in forums that these radios blow finals but once I learned what the part was I was ok with it as I already have a couple of these parts in my bin. Replacements are a whole $4.75 from RF parts or 2 for 10 from this guy without RFparts' minimum order: www.kitsandparts.com/transistors.php I have some ideas in my mind of adding an external heat sink to the back of the radio I'm not really convinced the final has adequate heat-sinking just the thin piece of aluminium that makes up the rear panel of the radio.This is a great radio for the tinkering hobbyist and its the most inexpensive new SSB CB out there.
5,This new uniden 40 channel cb ssb mobile radio is no doubt a winner except for the annoying beeping when performing functions as simple as changing channels . Radio output was down  2 watts on am  and 6 watts on ssb as others have mentioned. We easily found the 2 pots inside the radio  to adjust both power levels  am to 4 watts and ssb to 12 watts . I will give it a 8 out of 10 and is a definite keeper .I now have plans to purchase another just to keep in the house  sometime after xmas 2012 . We was very happy to find that the sideband frequencies were aligned properly at the factory on lsb  and usb.I left the radio on for 48 hours to burn it in and there was no drifting period on sideband. The receiver was very quiet and when needed the noise blanker took out any noise . We easily heard a station on 38 lsb  50 miles away on our base antenna at the house for those wanting to try sideband at home. While trying to talk locally in the midwest we had several stations in california commenting about the transmit audio quality of this 4 lb radio .Yes it is very light weight and will be a easy install in the car.Below is a added plus in my book ........ Having the 7 noaa weather channels will be a plus on long trips to keep track of changing weather conditions on vacations with the weather alert function .We took a vacation trip to Wyoming last year and ran right into bad weather up in the high country of NW Nebraska 80+ mph winds . Had we had the weather warnings  we could have avoided the 2 lane highway  and stayed on the major I 80 interstate  instead we was 50 miles up the road  in the middle of no where before we seen what was headed right at us.!!!If you want a radio that can be modified for extra illegal channels This is not your radio !!!
5,It has great audio plus is super user friendly
4,For the price the radio is a good buy but be warned that the LED screen during daylight conditions can be difficult to see.
4,I am impressed with my radio out of the box. There are a couple things I am not fond of however. The color and display brightness is almost a deal breaker. Mine is mounted in a semi w/sleeper and damn near dark all day and still barely visible. If I had this in a sedan or day cab/pick up I would have to return it. Major fail on uniden part. But I have made it work in my situation.The RF gain being a digital 1-5 seems to lack fine tuning. And the squelch is almost turned 3/4 up to hit clear.I have used it both ways RF on 5 squelch turned up and squelch turned off and RF to 2 or 3 and she works fine out of the box. But neither adjustment seems to have a sweet spot. Could be my experience.Now both are small potatoes to how good the radio really is. It is a shame about the dim panel display cause this radio gets out and and hears great. I do plan on removing the rubber device in the mic(or replacing it) then tuning the radio but otherwise I will leave her stock.I had an old old hand me down cobra 29 that would have a gremlin here and there (for what it was though I loved it) and a brand new galaxy 949 that spent its life being returned repaired repaired.... Not a fan. So I tried a old friend from my youth and I am happy I did.
4,First set up as an inverted V in the attic and the SWR was bad enough that I couldn’t use the radio; the company was no help.  I changed the configuration to an L and the SWR improved and showed that the legs had to be shortened.  I just folded the ends just before the plastic insulators to shorten the legs by about 3”.  The SWR went from above 3:5 to about 1:0 to 1:1± on all channels (by the radio’s SWR meter).  I am within five miles of an industrial area with a major rail to truck terminal and I know that at least one business uses 19 to contact incoming trucks so I should get a lot of traffic on 19 but so far I don’t.  I’m giving a four for the SWR but I’ll edit this review if I don’t feel that I’m receiving correctly.
2,I purchased the Uniden Bearcat 980SSB radio about a week ago and have had some mixed results after 24 hours or so of operation over the period of the week since then. The serial number on this unit is X000CIQY01 and the unit looks brand new not refurbed or rebuilt.The radio is a real sharp looking piece of equipment the controls and buttons have a good feel and the price is good for being both an AM and SSB radio.  Sound is good and mostly the radio can hear and talk as good as any CB or ham radio I have owned.  I don't have any calibrated test gear but I believe it meets it's published specifications.How-some-ever the operation and display to have some curious faults.  The RF control doesn't exist in the sense that the operator's manual describes.  The RF control is described in operation in two different ways in the operators manual one way on page E-5 and another way on page E-10. The button depresses on the RF gain and a small indicator lights up with the indication of "LOCAL" comeing on in the upper left hand corner of the display section of the front panel.  This indicator isn't mentioned in the manual.  There is no corresponding LED coming on and variability using the Channel Selector Switch as the manual describes for the RF control rather it's just a sort of On and Off with the RF gain at maximum all the time when not in "LOCAL".  The AGC circuit in the radio seems to work well though and the radio is very sensitive on receive.The display has 7 colors you can select which is real fine if you have time to play with this while driving which would have about the same result as "texting" while driving probably resulting in a bad car wreck.  First and foremost you can't see the indicators in the daytime.  Any ambient sunlight washes out the display and you will be lucky to see the channel you are on with the settings on high brightness and maximum contrast.  I like the Green setting but in fact I don't really care.  I was using a PRO505 before and it had Yellow I think and was very readable in daylight.  The display is dazzling at night and maybe I should mount two of these radios one under each front wheel well of my car for extra bling.I haven't been able to get the scan to work yet so perhaps it really does but I will work on that with the car parked this weekend.  All of this sort of leads up to the final problem which is the method in which the operator gets to most of the settings.  The MENU/OK and SELECTOR knob combined with the other assorted buttons and contortions make this a pain-in-the-butt radio to set up.  I suspect some young software guy who doesn't operate mobile CB did the semi-demi-drop-down menu for this radio.  Who else but a nerd-bird would think that pressing the PTT while the function button for MIC GAIN was activated for 5 seconds after pressing and you are scrambling to run the SELECTOR knob to the desired MIC GAIN setting would be a cool thing to do?So overall I would again say it's a good radio but Uniden messed up on this one when they rushed it to market.  I have read a few reviews and it is total microcomputer controlled and no schematics or service manual are available.  You can't fix it and you can't mess with it so Uniden has you by the proverbial (fill in as appropriate).Therefore I am thinking of removing the 980SSB from the car just as soon as the Galaxy 959 AM/SSB unit arrives.  I will use the 980SSB as a base station rig.  Probably will never take the top off until one day the microprocessor goes nuts and then just to look at all those surface mount parts.  I design microprocessor driven systems plus a lot of homebrew RF so this ain't my first rodeo.
5,Just getting back into the CB/11 meter world I wanted a compact unit with legal power and SSB I could set up as a base.  So far this little radio has worked phenomenally for my purposes.  Paired with a Vertex power supply this little radio has been quite the legal powerhouse.  The built-in SWR meter seems to work well sound is decent although I use an external speaker and the features are great.  Of course you must have a good coax and antenna.  Presently while I await my base antenna to arrive I'm using a home-built field antenna on a tripod with a 102" whip 4 10' radials and 50' of quality RG-8 coax.  All in all the tip of the antenna is about 14' or so.  Swr is registering 1.2-1.4 and this Bearcat eats it up.  I've been told my radio transmission sound like a cellphone and even with a ground oriented home built antenna it talks and hears exceptionally well.  I've hit 14 miles verified from my front porch and the receiver was surprised I was running barefoot since it was such a strong signal.  At first was it was reported back that the mic was soft-sounding.  Since I was going to buy a new one anyway I modded the factory mic and now there is no need for a replacement.  If you open up the mic you will see there is a piece of soft felt over the mic hole.  Once you remove this the rubber covering has a tiny hole for speaking.  Using a pocket knife I increased the size of this hole to about 1" and it seemed to work wonders.  I still have the mic gain on 4 for it really gets out there now.
5,I gave this radio 5 stars because it's been years since Uniden has come out with a Single Side Band radio and this latest radio seems to be pretty stable with good audio reports. I have the radio for a couple of months now and so far so good. I've been using 11 meter radios (CB) for around 40 years so I'm not exactly a novice. The verdict of course is still out on its longevity and durability but seems well built and I intend to mostly use it for a base station application. I also purchased the wireless mic and both the mic and the radio have never failed to pair up and I have gone about 200 ft. from the radio without loss of signal even with the radio inside the house.This is NOT  a radio to tweak and tune which is totally fine with me so you 'hash & trasher's' might not like it.PRO'S:Digital tuner and as yet hasn't 'drifted' staying right on frequency on SSB with no warm up time needed.The ability to adjust the lighting and colors for various lighting conditions.Weather Band with alerts on CB mode. Alert does work but be ready to jump!Simple diagnostic mode for quick check on SWR antenna match.Fine AND course clarifier.CON's:ANNOYING beep on every knob - except clarifier - or button pushed.Passive frequency counter which really doesn't need to be on the radio since the clarifier is locked.According to my Dosy meter the RF Power isn't quite up to 4 watts AM or 12 watts SSB but so minute that I have no problem with that but some might.I'll try to update this review after several more months or until something fails.
5,every good ham shack should have a CB because in an emergency situation it's a bad idea to limit your communications to just amateur radio operators. This a decent SHTF tool. No complaints from me.
4,Good product only with the right antenna the recommended antenna is very weak only giving one or two mile range. You will need 10 mile range to make it a good radio
2,Absolutely awesome CB in concept but poor in execution. It's like they took a list of everything a CBer would want and handed it to engineers who know nothing about CBs.The good:* Solid SSB. No drifting due to temperature changes.* Great audio. Everyone says I sound perfect.* WX works well.* Numerous colors for display.* Built in SWR meter.* PA feature (non-amplified)The bad (and there is a lot of it):* The annoying beeps everyone talks about. What were they thinking?* You will have to buy an external speaker. Stock speaker is absolutely useless in even moderate wind/road noise. Pathetic 2.5" and 16 ohms. Even for an indoor base station this barely adequate at best.* Display is just as bad as the speaker. Even at night it is too dim and disappears when looked at from the slightest angle. Daytime viewing is absolutely unacceptable. Why this was allowed to be built this way is beyond me unless Uniden just didn't give a damn whatsoever.* QC is just as bad as the speaker and display. Out of the three units I've owned one had the display stop lighting after six months of extremely light use (as pictured). Then the AM/WX decided to stop working after six more months of sitting in storage. The annoying beeps still work just fine though.* The second unit I had would not transmit beyond 1/4 mile from a rooftop base station antenna. Many buyers report the unit not putting out full power even TXing as low as 2 watts.* Noise filtering is hit and miss on each unit. My two units that broke had good noise filtering. The one I have that still works picks up alternator whine which can only be drowned out with the squelch knob. These were all tested on the same vehicle.* Hardware is locked tight and can not be expanded for extra channels.* Uniden's warranty is only one year and they make the customer pay return shipping for their lousy products that should have never left the factory in the first place.* (On a side note this model disappeared from Amazon's listings for about a year. I strongly suspect it was due to the large amount of returns they got.)If you have the extra money look elsewhere. This model had great potential but its drawbacks are just not worth the headaches.
2,Can't add much more than the other positive reviews except that when powered by a power supply indoors (12.5 volts) output power is 3 watts AM 9 watts SSB.  When running off of truck/alternator (13.8 - 14.3 volts) output power is dead on 4 watts AM 10-12 watts SSB and have not made any internal adjustments.  Also as far as the screen scratching easily I agree.  My solution was to get a screen protector for a Sony PSP handheld game system and trim it to fit with an x-acto knife and a straight-edge.  Made contacts from Midwest to New York Northern Idaho Ontario-Niagara Falls and Puerto Rico on SSB with good reports on my audio.  I have this paired up with a Solarcon I-Max 2000 antenna and no radial kit running barefoot.  Overall very happy with this radio and purchased another. Recommended.***UPDATE***My second radio stopped transmitting and the screen started going nuts 15 days after purchase.  Amazon was great and sent out a replacement with 2-day shipping.  I have to knock off 1 star for the transmit and screen going out.  I do understand anything made on an assembly line will produce a few lemons out of the bunch but I have read of this happening to others and hope it is not a common occurrence.  My first radio is still working great.  I will update if anything else goes wrong.  I do give amazon 5 stars for their great customer service.*****UPDATE 12/17/2016*****I purchased another one of these and it was way off frequency on receive and transmit.  Contacted amazon and they sent another one very quickly.  The replacement looked used (packaging looked like it had been removed radio had large grey possibly paint thumbprint on back of radio would not wipe off).  This one was way off frequency also and was sent back for a refund.  This is a newer design Amazon is currently selling and the model is 980SSBW (maybe the W designates "worse") the older ones were model 980SSB and they are good radios.  Uniden also dropped the warranty from 2 years on the older model 980 to one year on the newer 980's that is very telling of the quality.  I recently had a bad experience with two different Galaxy DX-979's (See my review they both had  receive problems).  All the CB radio manufacturers seem to be making their radios in Vietnam now and I think the quality is suffering.  I wonder if they use calibrated frequency counters when building these new Uniden 980's or maybe the workers are rushed or don't care.  Uniden needs to step up their game on these radios.  If Uniden would make their service manuals available maybe these radios would not have to be sent back when the frequency is off.  I don't know what is going on with the radios going out used.  I was told by an Amazon customer rep that returns don't get resold but There are other reviewers that stated they received used radios also.  Maybe Uniden is repackaging factory serviced units as new.  I really like the two 980's I purchased in 2015 but these new ones are lesser radios in my opinion.
3,has a weak display and cannot be seen in daylight
5,This radio let's you test SWR. Has mic gain Rf gain and noise blocking.
5,The Uniden Bearcat 980 SSB is a good sounding radio with exception reach with a GOOD antenna.I spoke with a man in Georgia from Phoenix. (Conditions we’re right)Accurate SWR built in with fine tuning adjustments.Many features you won’t need and it has “beep” canceling.STRONGLY RECOMMEND
5,For the hard core CBer I assume this would be a prize radio. As for me I am a ham radio operator; my use for a CB to my surprise came when we bought our Motorhome. The CB is a necessary tool on long trips cross country journeys to listen to truckers on Channel 19. CB is handy to hear traffic reports weather and local chatter than one would not normally be privileged to. Ham Radio would not have the arcane yet gruff world of trucking yet I find incredible utility and use when traveling with my CB. That said the Uniden Bearcat CB Radio is a smart system of technology.The sleek design with user-choice multiple colored display looks sharp and compliments the dashboard / cockpit of my 2016 year class A motorhome. The ease of tuning the radio without the need for an external meter - was a plus feature that I was not expecting from a radio of this class yet Uniden always impresses me with their unique equipment options with users in mind. I use Uniden scanners and handheld radios; this CB radio is no exception it's design is first class. I like the weather push button option quick easy way to check the local weather from NOAA wherever you are. The microphone is high quality with a push button that feels like a team of designers decided to make this one last. Personally I like the look of the mic as it has this sort of space age look to it. The radio performed well on our last 4000 mile journey across the USA. The sound is that CB sound that cuts through road noise but easy to squelch out if desired signals boomed in from far away and my signal reports combined with the Firestik CB antenna were stellar.
4,90% of CB radio is the antenna so not much to say here other than this is a good radio with lots of features. I used it in my Jeep for offroading. Kids like the selectable colors for the display and wife likes the weather band feature. Although weather band as with any frequency is useless if you are down in a valley or gulley where the signal can't get to you. Also the radio comes with seven selectable display colors but no amber color. Two different greens and two different blues a purple a white and a red but no amber. I would've thought amber would be a no-brainer. They have a nice red so I guess that will do for night work. Controls are easy to use and selecting modes fairly intuitive. The power wire connection at the back being a plug in style instead of hard-wired to the radio was a nice touch I thought. Nicer than my old Uniden Pro520XL anyway.  Also emblazoned fairly obviously on the box are the various benefits to having an SSB mode. '80 extra channels!' it says or something like that. But inside the box? In the manual? Not a word about SSB what it is or how it works. I guess they expect you to already know that part or muddle through but some support literature to go along with an actual feature they are selling on their radio would help.  Other than that. good equipment so far.
5,The reviews about this radio are mostly accurate. Radio has little Modulation swing out of it using the Stock mic but put an 'Astatic Road Devil noise cancelling power mic' on it and it gets out very very well and is very has very clear audio out. The channel scan functions work very nicely for entire 40 channel scanning or the Favorite channel scanning modes.SSB Frequency is dead nuts ON frequency right out of box which I have never had a radio which did that (not my 2510 or Yasu). Very easy radio to use on sideband because of that. I had to tune my Sideband power up a bit as it was only 5 watts out when I got the radio so I turned that up to the legal 12 watts and left the AM power side at the legal 4 watts out.I am using this radio as my Base station radio because it is so easy to use (for my wifey) and hooked up to my Antron 99 which is 36 feet high (Full wave height) I can talk barefoot 30 miles no problem. Running a little extra power (linear) is also simple with this radio and you WILL be heard using the power mic on the radio.I run a local Emergency Radio Club for emergency response team coordination and help and Typically NEED to be able to scan favorite channels members may be on during emergencies and this little gem of a radio fits that bill EXACTLY for that need...I am highly recommending this radio to all new radio team members because of its ease of use dead on frequency channel scan ability and it is priced right here on Amazon as well IMO.
4,It's good
3,The main reason I bought this radio was for monitoring sideband frequencies - I have no plans on using it for talking locally or skip…I have a different radio for talking. I sent the radio to a tech to have it peaked and tuned and it now works like a champ. I love the layout of the radio (buttons and knobs) and the size of the unit is perfect for use on the desk in my home office. The channel scan works great allowing me to tune out all the noise with the squelch as the radio scans through the channels looking for transmissions….sweet! Unfortunately I have two major complaints. 1. The built-in SWR feature simply does NOT work! Once calibrated the SWR results always read 1.00 across all channels on AM - even with No antenna connected! If you're using a poorly adjusted antenna you will no doubt have a high SWR which will result in your radio being damaged. Purchase a separate SWR meter - don't rely on the built-in SWR feature on the Bearcat 980.2. The coarse clarifier knob was installed incorrectly! The knob should self-center in the middle of the adjustment range (12 o'Clock) when twisting the knob either left or right - but it centers just to the right of the middle (12 o'Clock) position throwing any channel you're currently listening to off frequency. The tech who peaked & tuned the radio was able to make adjustments inside the radio to compensate for the hardware fail but the knob could NOT be re-positioned to the correct orientation.These are two EPIC quality control FAILS in my opinion and should be noted as yet another example of how companies could care less about quality as long as the money keeps rolling in. By all accounts I should have returned the radio but I'm using the radio as a receiver only so I can let slide the lack of attention to details on the assembly line. Sorry Uniden but I will most likely NEVER buy another Uniden radio!
4,This radio is very functional and very powerful! The clarity with which I can transmit and receive is a substantial improvement over my old little radio. The menus are easy to navigate once you get the hang of it (Very short learning curve) and the display nicely tells you what you need to know. I have seen people complaining about the menu selection beep that you can't turn off and you can't adjust the volume of it but it hasn't really bothered me personally yet but I can see why a lot of people might dislike it!The only gripe I have with this radio that is definitely preventing me from giving it the fifth star is that the display is hard to see in the sun. I have this radio dash mounted and no matter what color I set the display to it's still tough to read whats on the display if it's a sunny day. That really is the only truly negative I personally can find with the radio. The ability to change between a night and day profile for the color is a very nice feature though. I will most likely make a small shroud for the display to shade it a little bit.Overall I would certainly recommend this radio especially if you plan on mounting it away from the sun so the display is more visible.
1,UPDATED REVIEW:I picked mine in September 2014.  My initial review gave 5 stars but my Bearcat 980 stopped transmitting after 6 1/2 months. I've used CB radios for close to 40 years so I'm pretty familiar with what's out there. I take good care of mine. My closet has a small warehouse of about 30 different CB radios accumulated over time and put to use in various applications - mostly camping and boating. An additional CB radio was not needed but I got too good a deal to pass this one up...or so I thought.The Uniden Bearcat 980 SSB mobile has an amazing number of features. The built in SWR meter and mic gain alone will save you $100.00 in additional components that you otherwise would have to buy. The best part is that they really work! I tweaked the mic gain adjustment and regularly got compliments on the audio quality of my transmission using just the stock microphone. There's no need for an amplified mic.Other features include talk back SWR warning PA RF gain scan weather channels bright/dim control color selection for your read outs noise limiter/noise blanker diagnostics (voltage in and RF out) etc.  It has so many features I'm was reluctant to use it in the car.  I'd be so busy playing with all of the features that I could easily take my eyes off the road.  Its short life span was spent exclusively as a base.On the down side the radio only put out 3 watts instead of the legal limit of 4 watts on AM. Similarly it put out about 10.6 watts instead of the allowable 12 in SSB mode. The below-specs output seems to be a common problem with new radios. On the other hand the tolerances on this unit were great. It was consistently right on frequency. Other high profile manufacturers have problems with their radios drifting off frequency.  Not Uniden.  In the big picture I was willing to live with the 3 watt output and enjoy everything else this unit did right.Unfortunately my Bearcat 980 died an early death.  It stopped transmitting after 6 1/2 months. Uniden requires that warranty repair be initiated by the seller. My seller ignored my requests and simply did not respond. Amazon stepped up to the plate and refunded me my money with no non-sense.Amazon is now selling these for $105.00. That would be a steal for a single side band radio but I have seen too many reports on various radio websites about Uniden Bearcat 980 failures. Considering the reliability issues that are coming to light I'm going to pass on replacing this one - even at the bargain price Amazon is now offering them at.I now using a 23 year old Cobra 148GTL in the spot where I previously had the Uniden Bearcat 980. The 148 GTL sits next to a 34 year old Realistic Navaho TRC 490 SSB base. My Uniden Bearcat 980 experience confirms for me that they don't make CB radios like they used to.
4,I operate this unit "barefoot" as a base station connected to a Tram 1499 antenna mounted about 25 feet above ground. This radio is priced cheap but has excellent performance. Without getting technical there are a lot of factors that contribute to reception and transmission distance but I can say that from my location I am able to consistently speak with people as far away as 15 to 20 air miles while operating on standard CB AM mode. But this radio also functions in (SSB) single sideband mode so don't be surprised when you realize that you're talking with people in other states and other countries so enough said about that. I could go on and on about how good this radio is and how much sweeter it is because of the low price but I won't. If you're into CB curious about CB or just want a radio around for a possible emergency then you shouldn't hesitate to order this one. This is a great unit and I without a doubt recommend it and would purchase it again.*I did hold back a star only because the knobs feel a little flimsy but it's not something to stress over. Purchase this radio and you'll be as happy as I am with it's performance. This is a great CB radio.
5,The built in SWR meter is accurate and easy to use. I verified the reading with an external SWR meter. Power output is at specification when using a tuned antenna. The supplied microphone is adequate for mobile use but a good power mic does improve sound quality and reduce distortion. Good radio.
5,Very nice radio. Quality is good.
3,This product is guilty of false advertising.  It DOES NOT come with the removable mic and doesn't say anywhere in the advertisement its sold separately. I bought this for my husband and was very disappointed when it didn't come with that mic. Buyer beware.
5,I like all the  lights on front  plus Radio seems to receive very good just made contact  about 14 miles away and other party sounded like he was in my front yard very loud I'm getting 2 mod to 4 watts output. I'm using 102" whip up about 30ft to tip of whip. can't beat whip for receive.. Other party said he had good strong copy on me also running barefooted radio. I just wish remote mike had squelch control on it would be great then. It even let me know my linear was ok during transmit  later  radio started loosing Audio at times. off & On problem sent back to seller for repair or refund liked radio functions
5,Love all the features.
5,Pros:1) Good solid state typical well designed Uniden radio/unit!Cons:1) There is no real time clock so the dim profile display lighting settings do not revert automatically during the morning hours.  As such during the daytime manual setting to the daytime brighter display setting is required with a display not easily viewed due to being too dimly lit.  (Luckily the display brightness/contrast profile setting is the first menu item!)2) Can be not bright enough or not enough contrast during daytime and/or not dark enough during night time.  My Uniden BCD996T had an inverted display and the inverted display is more easily dimmed during nighttime use and/or easily bright enough during daytime??3) Corded microphone is a little on the weak side?4) Does not seem to scan the frequencies as fast as some of Uniden's other units.5) No mic key signal albeit most CB mic key sound effects (AKA "roger beeps") are horrid sounding versus the more professional FM/VHF radios which typically use something called "wait tones" and are usually extremely brief.TIP: Make sure you buy a good CB antenna and tune the antenna by adjusting the antenna length and the 980SSB menu antenna tuning option!
5,After researching this unit on line I decided to take the plunge and purchase this radio. Past experience with multi-mode CB radios dictated that one always had to "unlock" the clarifier in order to keep the radio on frequency. I can say with this radio frequency stability is NOT an issue. Out of the box the radio was within 10-15 Hz to my Kenwood TS-850 HF Transceiver this radio uses SMT and gone is the through hole 30+ year old circuit design.Bench testing the radio revealed that the radio does 3 watts unmodulated and 4 watts modulated on AM SSB the radio did 11-12 watts. As I stated frequency stability is excellent drift varies between +/- 10-15 Hz (at least with the radio I purchased). Viewing the output on my scope and spectrum analyzer revealed a very clean signal on both AM and SSB.The radio has some very useful features such as weather alert and the ability to scan all 40 CB channels. The built in diagnostic feature is very useful for testing voltage and SWR. One feature I would suggest to Uniden is the ability to adjust the volume and or disable the beep whenever a button is pushed or channel is selected. Uniden definitely raised the bar circuit design wise with this radio and I would recommend this radio to someone looking for a modern SSB CB radio.
5,wouldn't hesitate to buy another one. At the current time non mod able BUT!! htast fine. As a basic am/ssb cb radio its a good one. Has great recieve like an old uniden grant or cobra148gtl. Good single final radio. DOes the 12 to 15 watts PeP on ssb out of the box and deadkey 5 and 8 to 10 on AM out of the box. Mine was a rev2 board. Power is adjustable to a point but honestly as a stock radio its fine as is. Some folks said they were junk because they were not like export type radio out put. Not everyone is looking for a 50 to 75 watt radio. Excellent as a base station and works great in the mobile ANL/NB that works....good tone . decent audio with stock mic. I didn't have the bluetooth mic that you can get. My review is of the stock out of the box unit. The board is surface mount parts but looks to be able to take a bit of a beating if in a big truck or in heavy equipment. I have installed 2 of these in stock form in big trucks and had one for my self at home. If you can find a good deal grab one if your a daily talker on the radio...
5,Speedy delivery!Tricky to learn all the functions but it’s great
4,Ive been a radio operator for over 40yrs and over time collected ALOT of equipment. Ive always done my share of research before making a purchase .Back in the day research was done mostly by making distant contacts and  comparing how radios sound today we have the internet. This radio is very new in design and very compact which is a plus for smaller vehicles. Myself a truck guy it looks alittle lost in the cab. I have opened this radio and peaked it out . Mind you this radio doesnt have alot to really tune alittle power and modulation thats it .The best i could do with  this radio was about 6watts dead key and just under 15watts on Sb audio maxed is clear crisp and loud but doesnt provide the big swing we look for. All in all this radio looks great and has many features. This radio is not my long range choice but i will keep it in my truck and put it though the motions. A great radio at the price But wait till the export radio becomes available that maybe a radio to compete with but till then my 959 Galaxy cant be beat. This radio would have been a 5 STAR radio if it had the punch like i said wait for the export radio that maybe the one 73s Rick
5,This is an awesome radio! lots of great useful features to be had here. The wireless mike option It's a must have. You cant go wrong with this radio...
4,Great radio weather is clear and really pulls the signal in. SSB works very well also(made a 15mile contact first time out). I would have given it a five star if the readout was brighter/less glare. The screen or polished face plate has a glass like finish and reflects something awful during the day making it almost impossible to view the screen without moving your head around to cut out the glare/reflection. Otherwise a great radio.
5,I started out getting a cheap CB with no "extras" to see if I liked it. After playing around for a few days I decided I wanted the extra goodies. This radio is fantastic; I chose it over the comparable cobra. The Bearcat 980 is the same thing except with SSB. I've read that most people don't use SSB but if you are planning on using this with an exclusive group this option may suit your needs.I put this on my 2000 Chevy Astro and am using it with a 4' Firestik. Here are a few notes:1) Forget the cigarette lighter plug buy some 14 gauge wire from the auto store and run it directly to your battery. This will GREATLY reduce the electrical interference from your engine. I first used the cig lighter and the interference was terrible.2) This unit has a built in SWR meter antenna checker ANL AND NB (further reduces interference from outside sources) weather alert all channel scan and RF gain control. I use all these features regularly. These are the major "goodies" you're paying the extra money for and they make it 100x more enjoyable.3) Make sure to tune your antenna's SWR to prevent damage to the radio.4) The aesthetics and build quality are great - being able to change the colors is way cool.
4,Overall a good radio in all honesty especially for the price. On SSB they do not tend to drift. I've enjoyed two of these things. However I'll get down to some cons... Do not under and circumstance clean the screen with anything other than a microfiber cloth. These screens scratch VERY easily. In a mobile truck application where things get a film of dust on them good luck.... Next I'll point out the screen backlighting is not quite bright enough for sun contact in a mobile. Warning you on that as well. Lastly my oldest one I've owned has developed an issue to not turn on when I turn the power knob. All I get is a screen flicker or a flash then back out again. It at times takes multiple tries before I get it going. It's like a pull start motor....sometimes difficult to get the thing going but once going it has NO issues when it is going. Strange. My oldest unit is only 1yr 5mo old.
5,This CB is awesome. You can digitally tune the antenna but it's not like old school ones where it's precise. It is a digital step that makes it slightly too high SWR or slightly too low. But works great anyway.The SSB feature is totally amazing. I've never messed with CB band SSB and wow do you get some far out stations!Audio is pretty good. But the display has to be a just the right angle for you - otherwise it's too dim - even with adjustments.A quick thanks to Amazon.com.I ordered one of these and had it shipped to my work - so I could sign for it. Unfortunately I work where it's starting to become "ghetto" and someone stole the package right off of my desk after the secretary signed for it. I filed another police report (we have bad internal theft now-a-days). I contacted amazon to see if there was any chance of them having a serial number for tracing. I didn't think they would and they didn't. However I was sent an additional radio at no charge! Let me get this straight - Amazon wasn't even to blame in the least yet they sent me a replacement radio just because they felt bad? Holy s***.  One percent faith in humanity restored 99 to go.
3,I purchased a president McKinley.  Then i thought i would try this one also.  Honestly compared to the McKinley thos is a cheapie.  Receive is choppy and more static.  Mic is cheap.  And definitely not 4 watts of power.  If you want a cheap radio and don't care about range its ok.  If you want clearer receive and transmit. Get the mckinley. Its a solid radio. And the automatic squelch on the mckinley is also great
5,PROS:- Super sensitive receiver- Digital display- PA and speaker outputs (I have a AUX speaker and the fidelity is superb!)- Scan function (can scan LSB USB and AM)- SWR and antenna calibration is awesome- Mic gain for adding accessories and cutting down on noise- Microphone clarity is very clear- RF gain "Local" button is spectacular for knocking down DX noise- Display color changesCONS- Annoying "beep" on every button (there is a video on You Tube to remove a small chip and this loud beep will go away)I did the mod and the beep is about 98% gone...barely audible. Easy.- Weather station call up seems to be a tad on the weak sideOVERALL- Been working with CBs since 1975 and I can say this one is by far my favorite. In fact I am using it solely for my base station with a small 12v battery and Battery Tender charger (works awesome!). I am running a Firestik II (4') on top of my chimney about 30' up and I can pick up DX on skip and local traffic with ease. I live about 1 mile from the interstate and I can pick up chatter crystal clear.- ANL/NB seems to be a little weak but does cut down on noise
4,As described
5,This radio is simply the best radio I've ever owned. I previously had a small basic radio from Uniden and this one blows it out of the water. This radio has every feature I could dream of. The weather stations are an awesome bonus and had a clean strong recieve. The built in SWR meter is accurate the RF gain gets me out there farther than I can even recieve! The AM stations have a clean reception and the speaker quality is great. The SSB is a home-run addition. On top of all of this the customization options on the radio are amazing. I love the choice of different colors contrasts and brightness. The diagnostic features are great too. The only place that this radio lacks is with the microphone it's very quiet until you really get up into it. This is partially fixed by the mic gain on the radio which helps enough to make it work. Definitely plan on upgrading to a power microphone. Other than that this radio blows me away. Definitely recommend over any other radio on the market!
4,I was pleased with the overall quality and operation of the radio.  I have not experienced the weather alerts nor used the SSB operation.  The one problem I had was the screws provided to hold the microphone to the side of the radio did not match the holes in the radio.  They were too small or too large depending on which set was chosen.  I close to tap the holes in the radio and use machine screws from my shop.  This will not matter if you  plan to mount the microphone holder on some other surface.  Just drill holes to match one of the two screw sizes provides and you will be fine.
4,This is a nice radio it talks well even without tweaking.  Power output is close to legal output 3.8 watts deadkey on AM right at 12 for SSB.  The NB and ANL are effective and the scan function in conjunction with the memory channels is a nice plus.  The case size is about ¼" bigger then DIN top and bottom but I was able to fit it into a DIN pocket with an awful lot of modifications (Key word being "awful").  As another reviewer wrote I wish they did make it DIN size it's so close I sure they could have.I did find two faults the most important one being that the SWR meter is inaccurate.  Anything below 3:1 reads as 1:1 on the radio.  The meter is only good to tell you if your antenna has fallen off not good enough to tune it.  The other problem is that the display washes out in sunlight regardless of what setting you use.All in all I'm happy with this radio and think the price/value ratio is high.  I hope Uniden keeps them coming.
5,Transmitting and receiving are very good! Happy with my purchase! Was easy to use and setup! See was right where they should be with the k30 I got with them!! Love it
5,Excellent product
3,Radio functions OK.  The radio needed a power microphone for use on SSB as modulation level is low.  The stock mic would only drive the SSB transmitter up to a few watts.  Things not seen in the instructions... To use the channel scanner  You must first turn the squelch up.  The scanner will not start if there is any noise coming from the speaker.  The RF gain is adjustable if the RF gain button is held down and the channel knob is turned.  Numbers appear on the face as the knob is turned indicating the RF gain level.After 9 months had trouble with the radio not turning on.  Switch would have to be clicked on and off repeatedly for the radio to come on.  Took the bottom cover off and sprayed DeOxit into a small crevice on the closed up rectangular volume control.  Found a small metal tab on the side of the volume control that was touching a rectangular pad on the daughterboard for the face but not soldered to it.  Soldered it on.After having an external speaker plugged in for 9 months found the internal speaker no longer works.  Think the speaker plug contacts are not springing back properly.  Left that as it was and plugged the internal speaker back in.  Radio turns on OK now  still using it.
5,Bought this for long road trips.  Imagine my surprise when I discovered that on a long haul to Texas there was barely any traffic.  Had it on scan the whole time and only occasionally heard anyone else on the circuit.  The weather scan was quite helpful it quickly shifted from one transmitter to another and gave good and clear weather updates.  Great radio.  The 4X4 group I drive with uses GRMS so I have two radios now.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The LCD STOPPED WORKING AND THEY CLAIM 90 day warrantyMany other people have same problemUnable to return and replace
5,I am a Ham operator and wanted to pick up a cb for SSB work. Most are well over $200.00 US I found this one and tried it out. I have been using it for months no issues no complaints no worries. Great features easy to read display and buttons. The mic is better than what I am used to on a cb. I am running it barefoot (no amp) and they tell me I sound fine .I can only get out about 1-2 miles with it but that is my antenna not the radio. I can tell you the first day I picked up skip from about 5 states away I knew it was money well spent.
1,Right out of the box can't see the display.  I used the manual to blindly go through the menu and turned the color to bright green set the contrast to high and brightness to high.  Now if I cover the screen I can just make out what channel I'm on.  Transmits and receives just fine and by the looks of the reviews the company doesn't do much for you so I'll use it until it dies completely like it has for so many others.  All my other radios (truck off road dump loaders) are Cobra and when this one is dead my next one will be again.
5,It’s a gift not sure if they will tell me anything g about it.
5,this radio is great easy to use all functions work get a good antenna and your good to go i am using for a base stationbuy a base station antenna and this radio will work like a race horsepower is good the built in swr is a great feature no need to buy onecheck out the functions wow i talked to someone 30 miles away on am side band works great too if you buy this you wont be disappointed and the price is nice too get one.
4,It was great and the trick and of the 980 and i received was exactly what i wanted
5,I chose this radio after reading all the reviews. I like talking on side band it is a kick to talk to people around the US or world for that matter. This radio does come tuned a little low but the frequency is dead on.  I had it peaked at 15 watts on side band and around 12 on AM. I removed the beep chip as well. So much better with out the beep every time you turn a dial or push a button. The mike that comes with it is great however you do need to dismantle it and take out the little piece of paper the factory puts right over the mic int the front doing this makes the mike A LOT louder. No need to purchase a power mic. The swr meeter is acurate don't believe the reviews. When tested with a digital/analog meeter by a professional the swrs read 1.3 on the radio and 1.2 on the meeter. So it is accurate! I paired this with a 7 foot fire stick on my s10. First day out I talked to southern Florida and I live In Denver! If you like to talk long distance or local this is a very good radio!
4,What I don’t like is the display. I have it set at its brightest level (15) and have trouble seeing the channel number and swr and s/rf levels. I drive a dump truck and when you swith between pits/jobs and certain drivers are on certain channels you struggle to see it at times during the day which is very distracting. Shouldn’t have to struggle seeing the display during the day time. Please fix that area!!!! Other than that it works great!
4,DO NOT TRUST the built in SWR meter! More than one person has reported the SWR meter reads 1.00 on all channels which just isn't right. Three will always be at least a small variance between 1 and 40 and it certainly won't read 1.0 across all channels. Buy yourself an inexpensive SWR meter or have a competent shop check it for you before you transmit out. Other than that this is a decent CB. The stock mic worked well enough on a mic gain of four. I got good reports with it. The sound was a bit "tinny" I thought. I now have a D104-M6B. I set the mic gain to one and turned the mic up to about three and it modulates very well. This is my first CB and I am enjoying it. I've had this for about 9 months and no problems to report other than the SWR meter.
4,Awesome looking radio. Easy to adjust vr pots for best performance. Great on side band no drift. You will not find a new radio with the features of the Uniden Bearcat 980. Now the 4 star comes from the SMT board this radio uses. There are NO MODS out for the radio because the radio is run by a cpu. The radio beeps EVERYTIME you push a button or change the channel. The beep can be turned off by removing a very small resistor on the smt board hard to see but easy enough to do. There is no mod for extra channels. But for a first time ssb radio or a great sounding stable ssb radio this can not be beat. Get a power mic and your good to go. Size is about the same as a cobra 29 ltd but not as deep. If you want a LOUD radio to freeband with this is not for you. I love mine and will live without extra channels
2,I've had the exact same model of this CB for many years without any issues.  The display on the old one started becoming dim when it got warm and I was unable to read it (a known issue with this model) so I opted to purchase a new one just like it.  What a mistake.  First the display is very dim on it's highest setting.  Hard to read in bright light. (that never happens outside!)  Second I was unable to get an SWR below 2.3.  Three different antennas--same thing.  Power output was ~2 watts half of what it should be.  On a different radio SWR about 1.1 on each antenna with ~4 watt output.I was really hoping this would be a good radio like the old one I have.  I love it's features and the fact it is SSB.  With a couple mods and better QC this would be the radio to have!  Returned it for a refund as I don't know what I want to get now.  My 15 yr old Cobra SSB still works great!
4,This CB works quite well.  It receives signals better than I thought it would and seems to be putting out a decent amount of wattage with a variety of antennas. a Cobra unit had outrput problems so I had to send back...twice.  It has a load of features including weather and SSB which I have yet to use. The only complain I have is that the readout is a bit dim to be seen in daylight no matter what color you put it on.  Too bad as it has a nice look t it at night.  I was also able to figure out a way to mount it in a 2014 F150.
4,as far as the radio goes it is very good and user friendlythe problem is that it is am with side bandhere in australia am is not popular cb so I have limited access to other am usersmind you this is not the sets fault it is mine as when i ordered it I didnt reaslise what it wasthe limited use I have had the set functions very well you can see i have given it 4 stars and I think it derserves itI have since purchased a uniden uh7750nbcb and have both mounted in my 4 wheel driveguess I have the best of both worlds a mistake that may have put me in a great position when on the roadthe bearcat blends well with the rest of the equipment I have mounted in my ride.
5,The display is a black background with illuminated lettering.  Most displays are background lit and black lettering.  Very easy to read in full sunlight and great in night time use.  It won't blind you at night!  Weather alert works and SSB and AM are clear and sharp.  I like that you can simply push a button for the PA.  I did not that while in PA mode if there wasn't anything being received over the CB it acted like a PA.  But if you received a broadcast while in PA mode it would go out the PA speaker also.  Mic feels good in the hand and feels like it is well made.  The radio seemed to meet the FCC specs properly.  A very nice mobile CB/SSB!
5,I really like this radio. Much better than I expected. Not quite the equal of my vintage Grant radios but not as far short as I expected. Blows away Cobra. Stable and fairly sensitive. Good reports after removing paper inside mic. Really like the feel of mic and cord.  I use the heck out of the handy and fine performing weather radio. For me the best performing colors are the palest blue in daylight and the darkest green at night. The red puts out a bit less light but is not as readable to me. Get a clue and save the menu functions for when you are parked in a safe haven. You'd be better off texting than messing with menu functions while driving. Not designed for modifications but R M Italy makes some dandy accessories that have been perfectly compatible with the fully factory stock and unmolested radio at least in SSB with a very low SWR(read on a separate highly accurate meter).
5,Awesome 😎
5,Giant quality and features in a small package. This is the 1st radio that I have ever purchased and installed from the box to the vehicle without any tune ups etc.except for tuning the SWR. It's been a fantastic radio so far. I am using an Astatic 302-636LB 1 noise cancelling mic & a Wilson 1000 roof mounted antenna. I live in a very rural area so I can usually pick up 1 weather channel in each of the local counties I travel. I've had very good response from others on the channels as far as good quality of sound as well as decent distance. I'm sure that if I peaked & tuned it it may be even better however for out of the box you can't beat it. One of the best features is the size. It allows for many options when mounting since it is so small. So far... very happy.
4,I installed it and it seems to work well. I have not been able to talk to many people over it.In my 2007 Hyundai Santa I took out the stock radio and added this one and an aftermarket car receiver. They did fit but the 980 is to deep to fit nicely. It sits proud of the dash.
5,I use this as my primary CB in my F-150. Has great reception around my area and the reports have been good from other drivers using the included mic. Weather channels come in a bit quite but no big deal. I haven't used the SSB yet so I can't comment on its performance. The included SWR meter is nice for setting the antenna up. I paired this with a firestik mounted on the truck bed and average a 1.2:1 ratio. Many people comment on the beeps but they honestly don't bother me as I typically have it set on only channel 19.One issue with it is that I had to send back the first one that came in because of a faulty on off switch the unit wouldn't turn off. Amazon was quick to send a replacement and it's been great. I highly recommend for a radio that works well right out of the box.
3,I like the overall function of the radio and its many features. The only problem I have experienced is that the display after nine months has become patchy and partially disabled. Uniden service has been very helpful at offering repair options. I understand from a local shop that this display problem has been a common complaint brought to their attention by other customers. They no longer carry any radios with this digital display for sale in their shop.
5,Ssb radio cb. Easy to modify. I added the wireless Mike and will rate it all soon.Pita to see display in the sun. It sucks.But it is close to perfect.Would buy again. Packed with extras. Nice to have a swr built in.  Update soon on receive and transmission.Powering a k40 mobile antenna.
4,Radio for the cost is great. However the display is pathetic in the daytime. If it's a big deal to be able to read this in the daylight choose another radio.
5,Let me start by saying I am not a CB expert. I don't crack radios open and adjust and tweak. I use then as they come from the factory. With that being said this is one of the best out-of-the-box CB radios I've ever used. It has a ton of features. The audio is good the range is excellent the output power is a perfect 4w. Sideband works well what little I've used it not slot of sidebanders around where I live. I love the scan and memory-scan feature. Probably my favorite feature about the radio. The mic is not bad. I've had no one complain about not being able to hear me. I've since switched to the wireless mic which is also excellent. All in all I would highly recommend this radio. It is priced right for all the features packed into it.
3,Worked great for three days then broke... Swr was 1.0 with a 108" whip for whatever reason I was talking to a local on 19 am and out of nowhere the reception seemed to vanish and the on radio broadcast indicator didn't go past the second line. Did the self diagnostics and it failed.  Requested a replacement hopefully mine was just a fluke I'll update if the second is better.Update so I got the new one PROMPTLY from amazon took one day! So kudos for getting me back on the air so quickly the new radio seems to run cooler indicated the same swr as the first (1.0-1.1). New one seems to receive better with less interference and static and I get good reports of the audio as well as an increase in range. I believe the first one was just a dud time will tell with this one! I would still recommend this radio it's nice modern and the comparatively lower (legal!) output is PERFECT for driving an amp if that's your thing. With my 102 whip drill mounted to my roof it throws out roughly 10 miles! Plenty far.
1,I brought this for my work truck after 2 months having issues with it the squelch has stop working now I have to have it fix or replace it with a different CB . To bad when it was working properly it had a good sound to it
4,Noise blanker seems weak almost like it doesn’t work.  My other radios kill most noise using the NB (noise blanker). Automatic noise level does more. The screen is hard to see in the daytime this needs to be much brighter.  The good is these are on frequency and has been very stable on SSB mode.  Weather radio works well
4,Works great however output power is somewhat low. Would be better with a power mic. Has good reception on side-band and the clarifer has a much wider range than my Cobra. The scan function is also a major plus not available in most other CB's . Audio output is about what you would expect the best option is to use a powered external speaker. CB technology stalled out about 30 years ago this is the first one I've seen making an attempt to use some of the current ham radio technology. Its not near the quality of a Kenwood Icom or Yaesu and is far from Mill-Spec but for most users will work fine.
4,Got this radio refurbished from "Online Best Deals" USPS delivered in 5 business days. So far the radio seems great. My son in law and I tested it out against the CB I have on my Harley and it sounded GREAT much better than the Midland 9001z I had before. Only reason I gave a 4 was because there was no manual included... However you can download it from the Uniden web site. If I have any problems I will update my review. I was kind of worried about getting a refurbished unit but the radio was in perfect condition the box looked a little worn (worried me until I opened it up) but the radio looked brand new with all the plastic wrap and screen tape still attached.
4,SO FAR SO GOOD RADIO APPEARS TO BE EVERYTHING IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE. I WOULD GIVE IT 5 STARS BUT I STILL HAVE NO IDEA IF IT TRANSMITS OR RECEIVES AS I HAVE NOT HEARD A SOUL ON IT. WEATHER CHANNEL IS USELESS IN AUSTRALIA WITH THIS RADIO APPARENTLY AS I HEAR NOTHING ON THAT AS WELL. NOT MY FIRST TIME WITH CB RADIOS. BEEN AT IT FOR OVER 20 YEARS BUT WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE SKIP COMES BACK IN HERE. UNTIL THEN I WILL SIT AT 3 STARS. IF I GET SOME REPLY TO ANY OF MY CALLS I WILL UPGRADE THE STARS THEN
4,I have had this Uniden 980 for about a week and a half now.  Installed in my F-150 with a Wilson 1000.  Great reports on air love the options and controls.  The power knob is placed so I can easily turn it off/on while driving without looking.  I seem to have great range around town and beyond with low interference.  I will update more later but in this 11 Degree weather it's great having "Other" options to my cell.  I am keeping my Sparky's CB shack Galaxy 979 but for now I really like the 980 by Uniden and plan on Keeping it long term
4,Very nice quality radio the only thing is is it's a little confusing to set up program otherwise very small doesn't take a lot of space but works very very well.
5,This is best radio out there in my opinion.  There are some quality sideband rigs but none of them have all of the features that this one does.  It has everything!  The NOAA comes in clear and the channel scan is a great feature to have.  It's compact and can fit in any vehicle.  As is common with stock radios you may want to replace the mic with a power mic but the one that comes with it is sturdy and comfortable in your hand.  This is definitely a quality radio.  The one drawback is the loud beep sound every time you push a button or turn a knob however!  There is an easy mod you can do to turn it off.  There's a video on youtube that will show you how.  After the extensive research I did on the radios out there I couldn't be happier with my purchase.
3,May 25 2018 - July 122021She was a great road companion with a clear voice and long legs.But lcd screen failed as it seems many of this model do.LLAP
5,I am big into CB DXing. I own 2 high powered  Ranger radios. I was browsing Amazon and come across the Uniden BEARCAT CB Radio With Sideband And WeatherBand (980SSB) and decided to order it. I figured I couldn't go wrong for the price. Delivery was very fast. When I received the radio I connected it to my base antenna and called out for DX. I was very surprised when people came  back to me from up and down the east Coast. I'm located in Arizona. I got some great reports on the way the radio sounds. My local Cb friends say's the radio sounds great on the air. I love the features on the radio. Going to keep in line on my base antenna mainly to use for local chat with my CB buddies here in the area. I didn't go wrong on this purchase. Very happy with the radio!
5,Great radio straight out of the box. 4W DK average and better with good PEP. Drives my 300a on high well. Modulation is good. I use a Plus 3 on it and have it set up as a base next to my Washington. Like the scan feature. Controls feel a little plastic-y but for the price I can overlook it. You can take your chances on that auction site for a clean old SSB rig or save time and buy this.
3,Great but range & tuner sucks.
3,Really like the look of this radio. Have had cobra before and though this would be a little easier to keep clean. Owners manual was vague but watched video. Was very disappointed in Amazon fulfillment when radio arrived and was obviously installed before. Marks on side from mounting hardware out of bag but most annoying is the face screen was missing clear plastic shipping cover. This left the face exposed to vibration against box leaving scuffs and scratches.
5,Best SSB CB for the money easy to set up once you are familiar with all the options.  The backlight is a little lacking in direct sunlight even when set all the way but if you're not messing with all the options while your driving not a showstopper.  One suggestion is to tune your antenna manually before you use the auto-tune feature then once your at an acceptable SWR level complete the auto-tune steps.  If you have correctly installed system with quality components you should see near perfect SWR readings.  The 980SSB is a full-size unit and will take up some space wherever you plan to place it used this in a 2016 Jeep JKU install using a center (navigator side) quick disconnect mount.​
5,Like the ssb
5,2nd one I've owed. The 1st one damaged by faulty base loaded mag mount antenna. Not sure were I bought antenna but check your SWRs often. Also be careful not to scratch the screen easy to do. What does SHEERNESS mean sorry.
5,My son is helping me get into ham radio. I haven't installed yet for use but he tells me this radio is the best SSB radio for the money for starters. It is full of features found on more expensive radios.
5,This is what modern radio is about.  The unit is one of the few now that has the SSB option. You can get something from the ham band that crosses into the CB band to use SSB but that is illegal.  This unit is legal because it is designed for it.  The unit has a scanner that runs through all the channels so you can listen to it all.  There are some after market mods that you can get to make some things easier like setting controls..  All in all it is a nice unit.
5,I love this radio. My wife got this for me. I love the design even though it's not for everyone due to all the buttons and selections. I love the different colors I can change it to. Makes for easier reading at night and day. Next stop is a CB shop to have it tweaked for maximum range. It is a great radio. Oh and I've checked other sites and stores for this exact model. Most stores carry the lesser brand for about the same price if not higher and other websites have a ludicrous asking price for this same radio. So over all I think my wife did her research and came out strong
4,Very good CB radio.  It has lots of bells and whistles and reports on the air are good. It's noise reduction microphone is great for truckers however for base radio operations a power microphone would improve transmit audio.  Internally the circuit board contains very very small components and will require special equipment to remove or replace parts- for that reason I gave 4 out of 5 stars.  In summary I like this radio and would buy another one...in fact I did buy a second one.
4,A good and simple to use CB radio with SSB capability.  This radio is a SDR rig where the SDR stands for Software Defined Radio.  So basically this is a pre programed computer that controls various chip and operates on the CB frequencies.  For this reason there are no modifications that can be made to make the radio operate outside the CB band.The microphone that comes with the radio is specific for the radio and uses a proprietary connector however Uniden includes an adapter cable so that you can use most aftermarket microphones with the radio.
5,Have Had Bearcat Products For Over 30 Years And They Are Still A Very Good Product. Straight Forward Front Controls Make It Easy To Switch From CB / USB And LSB With Ease. Nice Feature It Has NOAA Weather Channels Also. It Has A External Speaker Jack Which Is Very Useful. Reception And Transmissions Are Clear.  I Recommend This Radio To A Friend It's A Good Solid Radio.
2,Love the ssb part of the radio it seems to have a noise problem I’ve tried grounding to frame/ battery even bought a noise canceling device that didn’t work I’ve got it hooked toA Stryker antenna
5,I work in the oil fields and different trucking companies use different bands - This helps me communicate with truckers on USB LSB and CB when needed. Also the weather alert works perfectly and in North Dakota having an weather alert is critical.The radio was easy to setup right out the box - No issues. good clear sound plenty of power Tx/Rx was perfect.The Mic and Cord are well built and feels good in my hand.
4,The display brightness is very poor I have it adjusted all the way up and I can barely see it!Uniden...YOU NEED TO FIX THIS PROBLEM!!!I know I am not the only one complaining!
3,what i dislike is its not as bright as expected even on high setting when its sunny out very hard to see what channel you are on  works good at night but not able to see screen in sunlight. overall its gets out great but thats the only good thing
3,uniden these days seems to be the only company that cares about anyone wanting to buy a radio with ssb (single sideband). ive used a cobra 19 before and now have a 29wx in my vehicle. i wanted a base radio and the only one i could find was made by galaxy and that does have ssb but doesnt have weather frequencies.pros-new design look- works with unidens wirless mic allowing for use around house- weather alert/ability to listen to noaa weather- ssb finally a company that keeps single sideband in at least some of their radio- priced at 109$consuniden spent time and effort to get the fcc to allow them to design and sell a microphone for this the 980 and the other model the 880 that is wireless yet the cb law still stands on having only 4 watts of power on am and 12 watts on ssb. this is not the 1970s this is 2015!
5,Loved how easy it was to install and get comfortable using.
3,I've been into CB for 30 years now and this is radio has the lowest AM RF output of any radio I have ever bought at just 2 watts. I understand that if they set the radio for exactly 4 watts they run the risk of selling a radio that puts out more than the FCC allows but setting the radio at 2 watts RMS is awful. That is half the legal power. It is a shame because the radio had great frequency stability on SSB but I just couldn't live with such diminished power on AM. I also couldn't hit the 12 watts pep allowed on sideband either even using a power mic.
5,This radio is super it's easy to use audio is clear SSB is spot on RF power is great and it works.  I shorted out one of them using cheap coax and I miss it I bought another radio to replace it and I wish I had bought another 980SSB.If you want a simple SSB radio that works gets out and does it job then get this on. now the Bad... The mic. is poor no matter how load you talk you come accross softly but a power mic. takes care of that and when using SSB you would want an power mic. on this radio or any other.If I have to buy another CB I will buy a 980SSB.  Whis I had done that when I burn up'ed up the one I had.
5,Australian Communications and Media Authority:Operation of a CB station must only employAM with a transmitter power not exceeding4 watts pZ with a necessary bandwidth notexceeding 6 kHz.Operation of a CB station must only employ:(a) AM with a transmitter power notexceeding 4 watts pZ with a necessarybandwidth not exceeding 6 kHz; or(b) SSB modulation using USB or LSB witha transmitter power not exceeding12 watts pX and with a necessarybandwidth not exceeding 3 kHzOperation of a CB station must only employSSB modulation using:(a) LSB; and(b) a transmitter power not exceeding12 watts pX; and(c) a necessary bandwidth not exceeding3 kHz.
4,The radio is good.  We had bought one and really liked it.  We bought a second one for our trailer and had to return it.  It would not transmit.  Amazon shipped us a replacement (Within two days!).  This time the radio worked but the mic did not.  We don't want to exchange the radio as who knows what would happen the next time.  I wish there was a way to exchange the mic however.  So the radio is excellent the mic is useless.
5,Installed this in my 1988 Toyota pickup extended cab so I could yell at truckers on the freeway. Seems to work great also has weather channel direct.
3,Great sounding radio; however the display is not as bright as it needs to be. If mounted on the dash the sun will wash out the display even on the brightest setting. I taped a piece of cardboard over the display to be able to see the display.
5,I do a lot of traveling and I had a CB when I was little some time ago and thought it would be outdated and no one would have one. I was wrong a lot of action on the air waves. Plus this will pick up SSB I listen to people in Tampa. Los Angelus CA. Canada Cuba New York driving in Louisiana. Since I have purchased I found out that a lot of trail riders 4x4 people in the woods use CB radios defiantly NOT a dead forum of communication.  The adjustments that are build into the unit are great no need for the meters to adjust and A-line the antenna it is right at your finger tips and the choice of colors for the display NICE  all in all  Nice unit
4,Good radio. I think that when Uniden made this they were thinking about how they could make a fancy CB and forgot about the simple basics to a CB Radio. The squelch sucks on this radio. Almost too many fancy gadgets that you can't just use the CB for it's main purpose Communication. The weather feature works very great! Myself and a friend found that out one evening when there was a thunderstorm rolling in the radio's siren went off 4 times within an hour. If you want something fancy buy this radio. If you want a radio for Communication purposes buy a Midland.
5,As the headline says the radio is great but nobody uses radios in those days so the only thing the radio sounds is noise noise in all channels. Since everyone left the radios for the cellphones and internet and due the large number of electronics devices around our lives today the airwaves are full of noises and empty of people. Only if you have a specific need buy a Radio if it’s not the case just ignore any radio transmitters they’re like the 8 tracks cassettes obsolete and useless.
4,Never could quite get a good clear signal through it but I'm sure that's 100% user error in my own inexperience tuning and nothing to do with the quality of the CB. Very nice radio although they're plastic the tuning knobs have very positive strong clicks when you turn them. Everything about this radio felt quality mine even came with an adapter for a different pinned mic and mounting brackets.
3,I bought this along with the BC906W wireless mic and found out I didn't need this radio to make that mic work after all.The good:1) Big bright display2) Buttons are easy to use3) 1 click Weather channels4) Transmit Audio is LOUD and CLEAR for this class of radio (almost as good as the $500 cb's!)5) Wireless mic option is very useful!6) A lot of empty space inside the radio to add additional boards and larger components.The bad:1) Receive not as sensitive as I'd like maybe better filtering?2) That annoying click-beep from every push and turn of the controls. LOUD AND ANNOYING and no way to turn it off.3) Not easy to modify service manuals hard to find.4) Frequency counter is locked to the channel selector. Should be a true to the actual transmit and receive freq as determined by the clarifier and god forbid transmitting off frequency.4)
3,It’s a great radio with plenty of options most people aren’t going to use. The screen is very hard to see in daylight. It’s even hard to see at night unless you’re looking at it straight on. I’ve had it in my Jeep for 5 months and I can no longer read the screen. It does have a nice meter so you can adjust your antenna easily. It is kind of big also. I would pass and get a much simpler unit if I were to buy again. Going to try to get a warranty claim on the screen. It’s a shame because I really like it.
3,If you want to settle for middle of the road this is it. I returned mine. 1. The readout out during the day time is terrible even with all the illumination settings maxed out. I really don't know who thought this was a good design. The weather rx is terrible because your using a 27mhz antenna for 160mhz rx on the weather rx.  The microphone is stupid looking and seems like it needs some help as far as audio.  I rather go back to a 20 year old 148gtl.
5,The BEARCAT 980 40 install was seamless. I connected a Wilson lil Wilson and tuned it in and was talking within 30 minutes. Great radio I'm enjoying it. 2 year warranty says alot.
5,Works excellent. I like the scan and priority functions as well as weather alert. Back light colors and brightness able to be changed and adjusted
4,I bought one of these around 3 years ago. I was not impressed. But they work. They are not like the older radios like cobra. From what I understand they redesigned the board and the new ones are suppose to be a lot better than the older ones even though they look the same.
5,Set this up as a base station with a 12 volt/110 adapter.  Works great!  I've talked with folks in Vermont (from Wisconsin) and heard folks talking French I think from Quebec.  Locally I've gotten 10-14  mile range out of this unit with my mobile set up.  Couldn't be happier.  Welcome back CB!
5,Excellent visibility of display that can be adjust with several colors and different intensity's of brightness.  Sideband can be easily switched with a pushed button.  Easy of use volume and squelch control turn knobs.  Great price.
3,I love the radio but in the day light if not tucked back in the overhead you CANNOT  see the channel indicator not bright enoughscreen look like the radio is off can't  see anything!
5,Excellent price  shipped/received fast.I drive about 200 miles a day mostly local and I have had great use of this radio I am using a Wilson 1000 "Lil Wil" it gets out clearly about 10-20 miles farther on SSB.  Clear transmissions and receiving. I love all the features that used to be those we dreamed about in the 70's n 80's not to mention it looks great in my YukonXL and matches the dash display.  People have asked me what option is that thinking its part of the factory options. (I guess I did a good job installing it)
4,The weather part works great the DISPLAY is loosy. It is not bright enough to read in the light. You have to put your head strait infront of the display and the colors are loosy. there is a Day/Night brightness setting but if Day is supposed to work it did not seem to change the briightness. If you use this in a house it may be readable. in and RV with bright sun it is not readable.
5,Excellent SSB rig for the money.  I would highly recommend for anyone looking to buy one.Good audio reports...with a Wilson 1000 mag.... Read the instruction manual for the menu optionsOnly down side for me is..display is difficult to read in sunlight UPDATE:...................2022...still working excellent.  The radio is worth every penny...and I am an amateur radio operator...this radio works great!
5,Easy set up! And sounds great!! I only have it in my Jeep and only use it for Offroad but seems to get great range in the mountains!!!
4,Received a defective unit the first time didn't realize it until I had been messing with the damn thing for two weeks - Decided just for piece of mind to get another one and swap it out to make sure it wasn't the unit and voila works great! No problems since... Put this in my 2015 JKU paired it up with the Cooltech Gate mount kit with the Fire-Ring Wire and Firestick Antenna & Rugged Ridge Footmans loop mount...
4,Im an over the road truck driver. Works pretty good for the price. The screen is a little dim when the sun hits it but not bad enough to consider it a problem.
4,I really like all the features of the CB. Good sound quality. However built in SWR meter is way off compared to a normal SWR meter.  Screen color choices are cool but screen itself scratches very easily and I am normally a very careful person.
3,Great little radio.  Love the Weather scan and alert and the SSB.  Unfortunately the display has started failing.  Can't read anything in the lower portion of the display.  I am sending it back to Uniden today for repairs.  May update this review depending on their repair service.
4,good
5,Top of the line unit
4,Good little radio for the price but every time you do anything from turning it on to changing the settings switching to sideband etc it makes an irritating beep. Apparently the only way to make it stop is to open it up and do surgery on the circuit board. You can learn how on Youtube but I'm just going to learn to love the beep. Other than that It's a solid piece of equipment. Glad I bought it. Beep!
5,While I returned this to Amazon because CB doesn't work in my area due to too much interference and busy activity on the frequencies it was a kick butt CB radio and wished it would have worked out.  The radio is very advanced has side band for longer distances and has so many things the CB radios of the 70's were lacking.  I'd have told you that if you can use CB's in your area don't waste your money on more expensive radios - these are work horses and have many many features.
4,Good radio nice and clear. Fits well in the c.b. space in my cab. Easy to use.
2,I bought this radio bearcat980ssb and three months later no transmit. Very disappointed in product. Weeks after purchase the ear on the mic broke off. The mic is very light and cheap feeling.  Other stations say this mic is weak and my 40 year old stock  Navaho 457 barefoot sounds better than this 980 ssb. Now I have no transmit . All of my other radios work great on my antron 99 except this one now. I wasted my money I guess. This isn't the first time I had problems buying radios off amazon. I bought a galaxy 959 at the same time as this purchase and no tx on ssb weeks after purchase . I sent the 959 back to amazon and they just refunded my money. I still want a 959 so why didn't they reach me to see if I wanted a fixed radio or new one? Nope no concern just ship and dip. Your better off at yard sales buying old cbs the new ones are hit or miss. I run my radios legal but they come so poorly tuned its sad.
5,Overall a good radio. The only complaint I have is in bright sunlight the display can be hard to read but other than that it's great. I'm getting close to 15 miles out of it on a.m. with a 102" whip and have made some cross country contacts on ssb. I did upgrade the mic. I would recommend this radio.
1,Well I really tried to like this radio. When it worked well when "they" worked since I had two of them they did work pretty well. I got great reports on both AM and SSB. The audio with the stock mic is a tad weak but an Astatic hand held fixed that up. The output from the factory is a tad on the low side too and was about 3 watts AM and 8 watts SSB. Anyway onto the problems. The first unit I had maybe 2 weeks. I had used it to receive and transmit fine for those 2 weeks. One night I sat down at my desk and turned it on and it received fine. I didn't notice something was wrong until I tried to key up and had 0 output. The microphone was still working as I could hear it through the talk back feature but there was no power output. I sent it back. No problem. I ordered another one giving it the benefit of the doubt...4 weeks later same exact problem. I sit down at the desk turn it on I receive fine..go to transmit and absolutely nothing. I am not sure what the issue is here but I know I have a clean 13.8 volts going to it and a 1.1 swr to my  I-max outside. This leads me to believe it was nothing I did that broke the radio. I have decided to give up on this radio and go with a Galaxy DX-959. So I suppose we will see how that works out.
4,Only problem I have is that it could be brighter.  Other than that great CB for the money.
5,I have used this radio for about a month. The performance was better than expected right out of the box and needed no adjustments. It is apparent the  BEARCAT series of radios definitely benefit from the latest in electronic technology and features. Compared to other radios that I have- with or without SSB- it is the cleanest most modern radio without all the "clunky" slide switches and knobs on the face like other units. The display screen with large meter graphs and numbers is easy to read at just a glance and the self diagnostics and other features are a nice addition and easy to use.
4,received my CB and was well packaged. however when I opened it up the face plate was severely scratched and now I'm wondering if this might have been a returned item. I'm not sending it back because it works fine and I need it. I'm just upset about the scratches but apart from that it's a great product and I like it very much--great reception; strong transmission and love the talkback feature.  I may look  into getting new faceplate at some point.  nice radio would buy another no question.
1,Didn’t even work when I took it out of the box would avoid buying better deals on eBay with legit warranties
3,It's a great radio the channel display is very dim. If you mount it where theres glare from the sun it's almost impossible to see it. Display should be brighter. Running it with a fire stick match is 1.0. transmits well.
5,Put this in my 4x4 truck along with a Wilson little will antenna had a perfect match on all channels with no adjustments I am from near Niagara Falls NY and made a contact 30 + miles away the first day on LSB. I have received DX transmits from all over US Nova Scotia Germany Ireland and Asia. I like the Weather channels they come in real handy with Buffalo Area Weather All functions of the transceiver work as they should I have owned many 70's and 80's radios and was looking into buying another used vintage radio i made the right choice going with the Bearcat!
5,Arrived on time as scheduled and works just fine.
5,Killer CB.. I use it for hitting the trails in my jeep and it’s very effective in our convoys and in deep deep woods. There are so many useful features on this unit. We have a large jeep club and I and help a lot of members with their CB’s and this 98o is in my opinion just a beast compared to those $99 units. Pay a bit more and get a lot more for your money!
5,best radio for the money. period. totally drift free on sideband if its turned on at -40 degrees OR 100 degrees If you have room for it-- buy a 102" whip antenna. no spring on it. - forget the 18 foot coax. totally wrong lengith. Get someone to make you a 21 foot long RG8X-- aka mini 8 coax cable -- then you will see the swr test mode on this fine radio say  SWR-1.  from channel 1 tru 40.  perfection.
5,A little better shape than expected am happy with this purchase
5,This radio is really something.  It not only has great receive but also great transmit.  This unit is worth a lot more than what I paid for it (under $100.00).  Just beautiful display and features that are outstanding.  Check it out!
1,I really wanted to like this radio.  It seems very similar to their President Grant II line however was quite disappointed in the receive sensitivity.  Signals were much weaker with this radio (often not heard at all) in comparison to their President Grant II version.  Heck even my 20 year old Cobra receives better.  This may be fine for duing the daytime when it's noisy however I and all the locals do most of our talking at night when it's quiet.  I couldn't talk very far with this radio only because the receive on it was very weak.This radio has a local and DX RF gain position the problem is that even in it distance/DX RF gain position the gain is quite poor.  They should of left the receive in high sensitivity like in the President Grant II version and let the consumer decide how much gain they want by using the Local/DX position switch.  It's just disappointing when upgrading an old radio with this and my 20 year old Cobra 29 LTD walks circles around this radio's receive.  I don't even consider a Cobra 29 a sensitive receive it's just average.  Signals that were S-3 on an old Cobra I couldn't hear at all on the Uniden 980SSB.  Quite disappointed in the weak receive.  I also don't like the way you can't turn the loud beeping noise off whenever you change the channel.
4,This is a great starter CB with a small footprint.
5,So far this is a great radio. Love all the bells and whistles.
3,So sad that such a good radio is paired with a cheap mic.  Second radio purchase installed in our trucks.  Keep breaking and you cannot replace that part.  You have yoe a whole mic
4,Getting feedback from another device on the socket but works as expected.
4,Great radio for the cash. You can mess with the settings and others will come in crystal clear. I have heard nothing but good about my transmit. All around GREAT.I only have one issue with it; the weather alert alarm is flippen LOUD. Which I'm sure could be gotten used to but the first time it goes off you'll consider taking the truck through the woods You be been warned.
5,I have never been a fan of anything Uniden had a hand in but this time Uniden did it right. I had kept a couple of old TRS485 CB's for years that were basically the same as Cherokee & many other CB's and Ham Radios that used the -485 moniker. These were the most versital line of radios out there for years unfortunately I lost them in a flood a few years back and had not found anything truely acceptable to replace them until this model came out. This is a fantastic little radio that has almost all the bells and whistles that I wanted. To get a better featured radio you will have to make the jump from CB to a licenced Ham radio.
3,Had it since 2018 power knob developed a short in it and wouldn't turn on and sometimes it goes on this problem developed in the last week mailed it back to uniden for warranty will write another review when I get it back . It kinda sucks this is the nicest radio I have ever owned
5,It arrived as described.  This is a great radio!  I combined it with a Solarcon A-99 Antenna with A-99 Ground Plane Radials and it delivers spectacular performance.  It is easy to program and use and it has a multitude of useful features.  It is a good looking unit and it performs equally well as a base or mobile radio.  It along with the antenna delivered an SWR of 0.04-0.08 WITHOUT modification or cutting.  Immediately after powering up I talked skip with Florida and Southern California from my hone in Central New Mexico.  Amazingly I talked directly with a trucker at a distance of 40 miles.  GREAT Radio!  Frank C.
5,Using as a base works great with a 5/8 wave sirio and LMR 400 coax 120 ft  1 to 1 match after set up. Barefoot LSB Channel  38 I've  talked  DX from Australia  to Hawaii.  With a little  help you can talk to anyone  you can hear. "not barefoot". Make sure you upgrade  the mic. And I did lower the volume of the beep by cutting part way thru the part you can remove to make it go all the way away.
4,Works Great had to get it tuned side band was only putting out 2 and a half watts am was putting out a little over 3.  Works great nownice and clear on the radio checks. Weather alert works great too.
5,Works really good with the right antenna and environment it has a really decent range. I drive in a mountainous area with lots of trees and I can get up to 10-12 miles no problem.
5,Best radio out of the box on the market
5,I’m very pleased so far. A word of caution ground directly to your battery. The receive on this radio is very hot. My Cobra 25 never gave me any static ground to the body this rig required 2/3 squelch until I ran it directly to the battery. I picked up MI & OH from MO right after hooking it up. SSB is awesome. Let the DX quest begin.
4,having issues with the number display  seems after 8 months it starts to fade making it difficult to read wich channel your on.
5,all a round grate by;  local lock in  works great saving  your receiver from heating up grate receive with good untinna it dus  all the it can do
4,Radio working OK. However did not appear to be a new unit. Fingerprints and scuff marks on the radio. Since the radio is working ok decided it was not worth the cost to send it back to E&B Electronics for a replacement. Disappointed in quality control at E&B Electronics and Amazon.
4,Volume is alittle scratchy not as clear as I expected.
1,Well I originally ordered a Galaxy 959 off fleabay with extra stuff done to it but after 3 weeks and it never was going to show up do to USPS lost it my next choice was the Uniden 980ssb.  I have this as a base station with na solocon A99 antenna the tip reaches 38' up. I have high tension power lines about 600' away from me.  I talk clearly for 10 miles and I hear other people very clearly too. Theres no amp yet ?  But what was really cool here in central florida is theres a bunch 6-8 other peps that have cb's  via base stations around me pretty cool I have a SWR is 1.1 never had to adjust antenna the radio?  Im very happy with it I just had the weather alert go off while writing this.  I've watched all the videos on this radio it just boils down to the antenna I grounded everything thats 10 gauge stranded with the green insulation on the radio If you get your antenna SWR right you will be very happy with this radio. Update no weather channel  it just quite workingwould not ever ever buy again.
5,Does what it says would recommend
5,This radio is really pretty nice the size is perfect for small areas the functions are great the weather alert system is perfect for travel features are super easy to figure out the digital display with the capability to change colors is Awesome! the radio works great on AM and really is a solid performer on SSB good solid radio well worth the price! I liked it so much I bought another one!
5,Awesome awesome awesome. An up to date SSB CB. Easy to use for newbies and experienced alike. Lots of features many of which will be found useless once you figure out what color(s) are preferred. SWR meter/ing is easy to use. Only complaint is the mic as you have to shove it right up to your mouth to be heard. On SSB you can talk across continents without help when conditions above are right. Run it with quality coax and a whip in a mobile setup and you will not be disappointed.
5,I like the modern look of this radio and the digital display makes it easy to read. Output signal is remarkably clear and the volume is not bad at all.
5,This is my first digital cb.  I have always ran Cobra and Galaxy radios but wanted something that was more up to date for my late model Jeep Wrangler.  This one does the job.  I was skeptical at first but have fallen in love with this unit.  I really like the backlit buttons over the knobs on previous units that I have had.  It sends and receives great loaded with features excellent volume on the built in speaker.  I will update this after I beat it up on some trails and it takes an accidental shower or two.
5,I use this radio for my entertainment it is one of the best and I prefer the SSB over the standard CB. the weather bands are real handy if you are at the lake
5,The radio is truly a leap in the right direction as far as  Being  user friendly  powerful as Big Bother will allow in general laid out nice with multi choice screen colors The down side is with all the advancement in communication devices CB radios just are not as popular as they were years ago. At times its hard or impossible to find someone with there ears on ready to communicate
5,I won't get into technicalities but this thing does exactly what I want it to - talking to buddies when I'm on the trails. I like the weather band love the 19/current channel switching and enjoy occasionally listening to SSB. Some people don't like the mic but it works perfectly for me and the speaker is loud enough to hear even with my sound system up loud. Not that important to me but I could set the color to match the rest of the interior lighting in my Jeep.
5,Great unit I love it
4,Nice little radio on frequency and very stable right from the moment you turn it on..Love all the features..The only thing i found a little disappointing was my radio would only peak around 9 Watt's on SSB..But apart from that I quiet like it.
4,Thist was advertised as new.  It came with everything but the face panel is marred. Looks like it was used cleaned and then put back in the box. Possibly a return. I just took it out of the box!.. I will see if it works as I can get pass the marring but would have been better if it had been shiny and new.
5,It is a very nice CB Radio.
5,This radio is AWESOME! Probably the best CB I have ever owned. RX is clean and crisp TX is clear and reaches. I get many good audio copies with this rig. Love all the features including the built in SWR meter/tuner and having sideband. If you want a quality product that works I would highly recommend this product!
4,I have already recommended it to 2 co workers and they have purchased it as well.the only thing I don't understand is you wont send the accessories to Canada they are supposed to come with it but if you live in the USA you send them?If you want to send me the aerial and coax cable at no charge I will push your product even harder.Hoping to hear from you thanks Bill Cook
4,Good quality feel nice display easy to use... just get a really good antenna and your ready. I have had no problems with the two I have. Out of the box no issues.
3,The first one didn't have functioning Talk Back and Mic Gain Buttons.  I ordered a replacement.  If things go well you wont hear back.  If not...Update.  Received a new one and it functions properly.  Good stuff...
4,Looks nice haven't installed it yet still has clear film on radio face and noticed it's got a scratch on it looks to be into radio face plate not sure yet what I want to do on it yet tell I install it to see if it affects the scene our not.
5,Great radio scan feature is excellent. Radio checks were positive for good audio especially when using mic gain.Readout is tough to see in broad daylight/sunlight.Overall very satisfied.
2,Excellent transmit; excellent receive. Lousy factory mic. Many nice features. Factory settings are weak. AM power needed to be turned up; modulation need to be turned up. Sideband was outputting only 6 watts! Whiskey tango foxtrot! The display washes out in the sun and is unreadable--even on brightest setting. Worked very well in conjunction with a RM Italy KL 60 amp.Now let's address the beeping sound.Dear UnidenPlease remove the beeping sound from your 980 Bearcat radios.Thank youBipedal HominidEvidently Uniden executives never tried using their 980 Bearcat with headphones on.. Nearly made me deaf!!! This is my second 980--traded it for a Cobra 148.The Uniden 980 Bearcat CB gets only two stars because of the annoying beeping sound; because Uniden won't address the issue and because there's no way to disable the beeping noise without removing one of the delicate surface-mount tech (SMT) circuits on the flimsy wafer-thin circuit board.
4,Great radio BUT the screen on radio is cheap plastic it scratches very easily . Uniden needs to remedy this with a better quality screen.The WX band just failed after just  8 months poo quality control shame on unidentifiable !
4,This is a great looking unit that takes a little getting use too. It's like setting up a computer with a bunch of program choices to get the most out of it. So if you want straight out of box in a hurry not for you just an opinion of course unless dealer sets up or your teenager.
5,Very nice unit. Built in SWR meter is a plus as well. Sounds nice and clear receiving as well as transmitting. Easy to use along with nice lighting day and night. They did get rid of the beep after you transmit that I read about in other reviews. This is a plus. I would recommend this to anyone.
3,Cheaply made with thin metal and surface mount parts you can't fix yourself. It's small. The knobs are loose and jiggle a bit. The display could be brighter.  It's light weight. It looks cool in pictures.There are several mod's out there for it. 200+ channels built in 100 Watt amp unlocked clarifier etc. Look on YouTube for all that.For $112 Dollars in 2018 it's okay.
4,good radio but hard to see the display in sunlight even on the brightest setting. this is somewhat due to how i have it mounted to fit in my vehicle
1,No range cannot get reception and if you do everyone sounds like Donald Duck. Went back to a Cobra 29 LTD Classic.
3,This is a great looking unit but unless you are going to mount it in a place where the sunlight does not shine on display you cannot see the display in daylight hours. The unit will not produce over 3.5 watts on am and will swing to 10 to 12 watts on ssb. If you are looking for a radio that produces the legal 4 watt output this radio is not for you. I have been using Galaxy cb's for nearly 30 years and because of good reveiws I decided to try the Uniden 980 but the results are disappointing. The use of a good (D104) power mike does help the modulation but the power is not there.
1,This unit SOUNDED good but the display is so dim it is useless. I tried every imaginable setting. It is unreadable in all conditions except the blackest of nights. Save your money and look elsewhere. I am returning it.
5,Have only had a chance to use it a few times due to very nasty Thunder Storms in the area but every contact I have made with it has been solid.  I have gotten very good signal reports and audio reports every time.  Nice clean sounding rig with a lot of features.  Would definitely recommend this radio to anyone.
5,I drive truck. This was a replacement of my last 980. Works good out of the box works even better if you have a cb shop tune it as I did.
5,Worked as it should. Easy to learn. It had full power and the internal SWR meter was accurate. Received good audio reports.
5,So far a great radio. Using with a Sirio 2016 base antenna. Today I talked to a couple of people in Maine New York Rhode Island & South Carolina from Lubbock Texas. A lot of features and works very well with a SWR across the board at 1. Will be using a K40 / K30 auto antenna but haven't put it in yet. Using a Pyramid 12v power supply for home use. Everything so far performing great.
5,Pros: different background colors for the display.SSBWeatherFairly quick scan and pauses for ~2-3 seconds for response on signal received.Easy install mounted to the dash in minutes.Built in SWR and other dianostic features.Cons: the beep can't be modified and is active on all of the digital controlsNo ambient light sensor or timer to switch light modes since it supports a preset for day/night.The radio has been great for my long commute helps me watch out for traffic issues that can be drove around with enoughforewarning which the radio and truckers provide.
3,This is an excellent radio but the big problem is with the angle of the radio in my jeep and the placement I'm unable to see the screen during the day and unfortunately it doesn't compare a galaxy so if you have the money a good radio I'd go with would be a galaxy dx 979 it has the side band and is about the same size as this radio at least with a galaxy you would be able to see the display
3,I have two and so far they are great radios with very good noise filtration. The bad news is the back lighting.You can barely read any settings during the day.Update:12/21/2017...Out of the three units I have purchased only one has yet to produce problems. Unit one has to be used with an external speaker or you have no sound. Unit two just started changing channels when you key the mic. i'm holding my breath now for unit three. Good Luck!!!
1,I received this CB today and was excited to install it.I quickly found that this was returned or damaged item.  I noticed the following immediately.1. The box inside the Amazon Box was damaged - there was a large hole in it.2. The back of the unit was scratched up and had fingerprints all over it.  It even looked like someone had opened the unit based on the fact that the fingerprints were under the edge of the case.  God only knows what someone could have done on the inside.3. The faceplate was all scuffed up.  It had the protective coating on it but it looked as if the unit had been installed with the protective coating and overtime it looks as if items had rubbed against it.For all I know it could run fine but then again someone could have gotten in the unit to mod it to make it run "gooder".I shouldn't have to roll the dice on a new purchase.I am asking Amazon to immediately accept the return and immediately send me what I ordered.New is new.  Used is used.I will post back with comments on how Amazon treats this situation.
4,don't use it as a base rig if you have a alloy roof i broke 6 of them doing that. its some kind of static feedback issue the smal FETs cant handel. even grounding with a 8 foot copper grounding rod couldint solve it but its perfectly on frequency a joy to look at and to run in the car
5,I had an old 23 channel pierce Simpson cheetah side band in my old rusty 4x4 when I did a body change nothing re fitted so the bear-cat came to be.Could not believe in the hills of Victoria in Australia I was picking up skip from all over the states and talking back to them.What else can I say.
5,Been a long time since I bought a CB as I am a Ham Radio Operator but I like having a CB in my vehicle when I travel. Works great and I look forward to my next trip to see how it does. Like the features and digital display. The beeping noise was a little anoying but with a MOD was able to get rid of that. If you purchase one and need help with the MOD to get rid of the beeping sound contact me at n4urw@cfl.rr.com
5,Awesome radio. I was sceptable at first but have been using my 980 for several months now and couldn't be happier. I get good reports on AM and side band and have made several DX contacts with good reports. Weather functions and channel scan are awesome features as well. Solid loud clear cb radio. Great stock driver. Dead keys 2.25
2,Works great but does not hold up in the heat. I have permanent LED display damage on parts of the screen and if it gets too hot from ambient temperature you cannot see any of the display. Stick with a non LED display when buying a CB. Unit is barely over a year old.
5,Just what I expected
5,It works  love the swr meter and the side band
1,The display doesn't work for very long. And once it is gone. There is nothing to do.  I own several Uniden products. This is a disappointing.
5,I bought this radio recently because I wanted to upgrade to a modern looking radio with USB and LSB. I almost always use sideband anyway since its more professional anyway. only issue was with this radio skip seems rare anymore. I heard some very distant station's but not much skip for the first day. I did mess around with the different colors of the face a bit. there are day/night settings it appears.
4,The lighting in it didn't work well in sunlight it was hard to read. As far as the C.B. it worked flawless.
5,A little bulky but the radio works great.
5,This is a "B..A... Radio.  Was thinking about returning this but after fine tuning  all the button settings and adding  a superstar  echo Mic all I  got was excellent reports. Now it's definitely a Keeper.  Awesome modulation and punches out long long distances.
5,This radio has great receive and it gets out really well. The scan function and weather channels are really handy. These newer Uniden radios use surface mount technology so the mods are limited. Don't expect to take it somewhere and have a swing kit installed. You can have it peaked and tuned and squeeze a few more watts out of it. It still performs very well. I have gotten good reports on it. The only gripe is the display. It is difficult to see at certain angles.
3,Just got the unit today. Already pretty impressed by it. But it has a major glare issue! The display is not bright enough in direct/indirect sun light. Night time is visible but green is the most visible at low and high brightness and contrast.The swr meter seems to be ok accurate.Not sure if it's just my Mic but I had an ok cobra mike and the 6 to 4 pin adaptor didn't work out to well. So I'm sticking with the 6 pin Mike.
5,Excellent radio for the money! Looks good talks good packed with features!
4,Just what was needed
5,A good cb radio for the price. it works well and you here who you talk to.
5,Works great
5,Is good!
5,Had mine for about 8 months just the CB nothing else Fancy with it works great literally just bought it through it in my truck and love it
4,WORKS GERAT BUT DOES NOT HAVE ALL THAT GOOD PULL ONLY PUTTS OUT ABOUT 10 WATT IF U PUT IT ON A AMP U CAN DO 100 AMPS ON A 300 WATT AMP I HAVE A 325 THAT I USE EVERY DAY ON IT WITH A TUNE UP ON BOTH U MIGHT SEE ME OUT THERE SPEEDY LEE :)
5,I like the simplicity of the radio and the overall looks. Price was reasonable and delivery time from USA to Australia is really good.
5,Absolutely love it. I use it as a base setup in my garage. It has performed consistently. Only issues is the stock mic is a bit weak. Replaced that and have had better audio reports.
5,I bought this Radio to be installed into a custom ordered 2016 MB 2500 Sprinter Van that is not yet here. Looking forward to installing it sometime in June after I take delivery of the vehicle.  The unit looks Great and I fully expect it to live up to the excellent reviews that I have read from numerous different sites.
5,Works well and easy to use. Many color choices for the display and day-or-night mode is a nice feature.  It doesn't glare at you at night like some other radios.  Cannot be tuned up or modified for more power or out-of-band operation for the so-called "freeband"operation but that's not why I bought it.  A good multi-featured AM/SSB radio.  Recommended.
5,This Uniden 980 is loaded with features and includes the microphone adapter cable for 4 pin Cobra style microphones.  Great reports from contacts.  I just ordered the Uniden remote microphone to go with it.
5,Great product
5,It’s a great mic ! This is a awesome radio for SSB .
5,I purchased two of these uniden bearcat 980SSB. And I fully tested both of them on am and SSB and through all of settings and options  continously for 4 months. It's an awesome radio. I just might buy 2 more that's how happy I am with this product.
5,None
3,These radios transmit ok and recieve excellent you just can't see the display in a bright environment when the radio warms up.
4,Have had this radio for a while now and its ok. I would have thought they could have made it a little less bulky. I guess I'm used to 2meter ham radio's. Other than that its ok.
5,Very good SSB radio. I use it on AM but really like to get on the LSB. It really shines there with very stable operation and no frequency drift. Have gotten many great reports on this radio. I run it as a base radio with a good antenna system. That is key with any low powered radio. Good radio. Works good and looks good too.
3,Hard to see the screen I think the radio works but no one talked to me so I don’t know how or if it works. I am editing this review to say that the screen could be brighter but it is as it is!  Receiver Seems to be Ok!!
5,I love this CB. the Only drawback that I see is that I can broadcast farther than I can hear. I can shoot 6-10 miles barefoot but can not hear them after 4-5 miles. (thank god for cell phones to test this) But other than that I love all the features and the functions.
5,I really like this radio for what I paid. It's my first CB so I have no other comparison. It does everything I want weather upper and lower sidebands. I have it hooked up with a Wilson t5000 antena I can get out about 10 miles and that's not tuned or anything. I'd suggest it to anyone.
1,I bought this model (Uniden Bearcat 980SSB) based on  internet reviews stating that it was one of the best CBs on the market.  I had my vehicle in a vendors shop to get installed and it took longer than expected which was out of my control; therefore out of the "return policy."  When my vehicle was out of the shop I clicked the mic button one time and something blew up in the circuit board inside the CB. The installation was completed by a highly credible electric shop.  Now I'm out the time money install fee re-install fee and the frustration of dealing with a "reputable" company.  I own and operate 250 Commercial tractor with 600 trailers and I will be certain to suggest any manufacturer other than Uniden to the people who seek my advice both internally and within the transportation industry's associations.
4,Great radio for the price. Cheaper price than the truck stops. I drive for a living and this works perfect for what I need it for. Love the weatherband alerts.
5,Bought this for my wife to put in her car she wasn't thrilled at first but after a few trips where we took both of our vehicles and being able to communicate instantly without taking our eyes off the road she loves it now! Great product description and fast shipping!
5,easy to use and install. Colored options are bonus.
5,This is such a great radio! Talks loud yet clean and is dead stable on SSB. Nice features and modern looks goes great in today's vehicles. Stock mic is pretty good but get a Ranger SRA-198 and have some of the best audio on CB.
5,Nice radio good quiet not silent  but filtered receive USB lsb sound well also.
5,A great rig.  One of the best receivers on the market.  The automatic weather alarm is also a welcome feature.It's not "modification friendly" but then such mods aren't legal.  Keep your fingers out of the rig set it up properly and enjoy great sounding audio.
4,This radio has given me no grief whatsoever. The only thing I wish was different: the screen plastic scratches easy. But other than that I have it paired to a 5' Firestik and a stake hole mount for my truck. Works with a 1:1 SWR Reading. Couldn't have asked for a better setup
5,Fantastic product! Easy-to-use control head and clearly visible display. Easy to install with the hardwire that Is included
5,Love the Sideband feature.  Two segments of channel display are fading and it seems to be stuck on Talkback. Good audio fun to use. Power mic made a big difference in audio transmission.
5,I love this radio. It's my fourth Uniden radio my first with side band. Could not be happier. By the way the 3 other radios are still at work and doing fine one over 30 years old.
5,Working like a cham.  The professional driver today use new technology like gps cell phone ect. But the C.B. radio will never die. If you don't have one at most gates like Walmart you need to get off the truck and check in.
4,Like the radio so far.  Love the built in SWR. Found the display to be hard to see in daylight even though other reviews say it's bright. Changing colors and other display settings didn't help.
5,This is a brilliant SSB Radio with sensitive receiver and great audio the microphone sensitivity and power output are not as good as I would like but are within specification.
4,the only fault i have found is the frequency counter only works in am mode it doesn't change when you put it in sideband mode
5,Very clear sound right out of the box. The led face plate looks good and the day and night setting is really convenient. The radio is easy to tune (YouTube) but you will not get a lot of power out of it stock (mine peaked at 4 watts)
1,reception is not good.I was going to return it for another brand but when I checked the return window closed 2 days ago..
5,This is a great sideband radio. 4 watts out on CB and 12 watts on SSB. A Lot of bells and whistles  like PA SWR meter weather band RF out meter and more. Don't let the low price fool you this radio rocks ! Buy the matching power mike HG M75 for increased modulation.
5,After doing extensive research I chose this CB radio to use it as a base station with a power supply because among the less expensive ones it has the following features: SSB scanner weather radio with alarm (not just a weather channel but also an alarm that will go off if needed) integrated SWR and power meter. Incredible!
5,first Uniden i have owned  great radio  love the features and overall design. will be ordering another one in the very near future  thank you
2,May be a nice radio if it had not been Dead On Arrival. I put my Ham radio on the same frequency as the 980 and it would not put out any signal on my meter or the Ham radio. Also The display was very dim as others said also.
4,Wow a radio right out of the box that's works great. People all over tell me it sounds great even for me trying to get over the Arizona mountain's with the right Ant you can talk all over the world. I had a galaxy radio that truly does not compare
1,I bought this BEARCAT 980SSB in October of 2014. couldn't get an antenna match so I never used it thought I had a ground problem. I got it for my 2014 Jeep Rubicon but just like the winch & high lift jack it was never used. I sold the jeep to mt Brother-in-law about 3 months ago. He just called me to ask if I ever had any work done the radio. My answer was no I bought it new and installed it but could never get it working. He then proceeds to tell me he is at a radio repair shop and that they have it apart. It has been refurbished with not only the incorrect parts but something was also soldered wrong that made a bridge across two parts that should not of been. After reading through some of the comments I'm not the only one with this complaint.
4,This is a new style Citizen Band radio using SMT. It functions as stated and is solid on sidebands. There's an annoying beep for every funtion that gets old and can't be disabled. It's small enough that I mounted it in a single din slot in my dash just below my CD player.
4,everyone complains about the beep (when turning the knobs)....its really not bad and its not like your touching buttons and knobs all the time....i dont even notice the beep anymore & my passengers never noticed it enough to say anything.great radio love the styling (over the cobra). very nice !
5,Saw this offered on CDL LIFE nice and compact for my 4 wheeler
5,Shipping was super fast...still learning the ins and outs of the buttons but so far its great
5,I have been purchasing and using Uniden products for over thirty years. They have always exceeded my expectations. This CB radio is fantastic. I am consistently transmitting 40-50 miles on AM and 150-200 miles on sideband with a mobile antenna. The controls are easy to operate and the channel scan feature is wonderful. I am very satisfied with this radio and recommend it to anyone wanting a CB radio with single side band.
3,Reception on the weak side. May have to have it tuned at a radio $hop. I should have read more reviews. Have not tried the sideband yet. Made in some place else. PLEASE READ THEREVIEWS  shame on you COBRA
5,Great reports from other stations on quality of full range sound
5,Well I got a great radio perfect on frequency and then it died no transmit. nothing I did wrong it stoped working one day when I turned it on.  .Amazon allowed me to print a return label and sent me a new radio no questions asked. and paid all shipping. First time it happened and Amazon was there for me Amazon 5 stars and the 980 5 stars buy this radio.
4,One complaint I have is that the annoying beep sound it makes every time I change the channel.  The SSB feature is nice.
5,Great radio for the price. I love the radio and the weather channels. Although the CB is not as active is still worth the investment.
5,Easy install all the bells and whistles Pro driver use t all the time
3,Not really sure at this time. Unable to find an antenna compatible to the radio. You can do a antenna diag on the antenna and it keep saying antenna failure and swr is way high. Thinking it was my older antenna I have purchased new antennas and still having issues. Thinking it is the radio now. Not happy
5,I wanted a cb radio with side band capabilities. Everyone I talk to gives me good reports with the factory Mic. Hooked it up to my Imax 2000 base antenna. I use it as a base station radio. I like it and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good radio at a reasonable price.
5,I have a 97 Honda civic I placed this cb radio in the dash where the stock tape deck went with a little cutting of the plastic and bending of some brackets it fit and works like a charm I haven't done much with it in terms of long range or ssb operations but it looks great sounds great and I'm pleased with how seem less it blends into my interior
4,Just revived the radio and it works great but the faceplate has several scrtches and it was brand new it is better to get a used one with scratches since it will be cheaper
5,So far So Good...  Just got it installed and get about 2-3 miles with a 3' A Firestick antenna.The antenna is not installed in a great location on the vehicle.  I went for not putting a hole in my roof and went with rail mount.  I am happy with the features of this radio.
1,lousy am  terrible out of the box  and even after retuning it dosent perform very well. squeals when transmitting.  lousy audio on am.  the meter in the radio is not accurate and cannot be trusted.  the radio will lock  up when using it too near a cell phone  and does lock  when charging a cell phone near it.  I would not reccomend it to anyone. Uniden made a big mistake when they stopped making the Cobra 148gtl. it is a much better radio. the diagnostics dont make it work better in the 980. and the color screen is just a gimmick. and talk back is useless as far as what the radio is actually doing on the air.  the radio is not worth the money and the one I have I wont even give it away. I wouldnt want to saddle anyone wit such a  terrible radio.
5,Uniden products never fail to be the best. This is no exception.
5,Got as a gift he loves it
2,I sent the first radio back to Amazon for replacement because the LCD was not working  correctly.  I sent the reeplamentt to Uniden Repair for the same problem. They haven't contacted me ....
4,A very good cb. I receive very well sometimes to much. The mike as to be expected is not great however it gets the job done. Other truckers has described it as quiet or silent. I will get a new mike eventually
5,For such a low price this radio does a great job and sound great!Not bad for an all mode (SSB and AM) radio!You won't be disappointed!I love having the weather band capability right in the same radio!
4,Good all a around performer.  If you are a hard core CBer this may not be the radio for you as it will not be field modifiable.  Sounds good and looks good
5,THIS CB IS A LOT OF FUN  PUT IT IN THE JEEP AND HAVE "NO" PROBLEMS WITH IT AND YES IT DOES GET BOUNCED AROUND :0) :0)
5,The cb it's great i love it but lower volume
5,Price was great and you can’t beat Uniden quality good looking and easy to use
4,A good quality mobile CB to have. I also use it inside the home using a 12 volt power supply.
5,This is an awesome excellent CB radio every radio enthusiast must have. Easy to operate.The delivery of this item from the vendor where I bought this item is very fast. Very happy about it.
5,great features this my second Bearcat 980
3,Very nice product works right out of the box the annoying beeps everyone speaks of is insignificant to me. The weather feature is a great benefit with the alerting function. Update: 9 Feb 2018 After a year or so of infrequent operation the LED's for the frequency are intermittent seems that this affects many CB radios.  The major issue is that you can't see what channel you're on.
5,This is a great CB with many features for the price. I've been using it as a base unit with a wire dipole strung in an inverted Vee in my trees. I have no complaints and this unit is very solid and well constructed.
5,Very nice radio with the right antennas.
4,Nice quality CB with plenty of user friendly and useful practical options but range is pretty short. Maybe a bigger anttena would help. I only have the 4' one. But the CB seems to be a very high quality.
4,Does everything but programming isn't the easiest to accomplish.
5,This is good radio. Easy to use and picks up well.
5,Great unit met my needs during long road trips.
5,I got my bestfriend a CB radio because I have one as well mine is 20 yrs old but it's this work's like it new.
4,Performs great. Receives and gets out nicely. Like the set up and controls and the memory feature makes flipping threw the channels that you use a breeze.
4,This is a great radio. Only reason I gave it 4*s is because the frequency counter is basically useless. It doesn't move when tuning in on sideband. Other then that I really like it.
3,Well.  3 years of usage.  The radio still works but it may as well not work because the display screen no longer functions whenever the TEMP is above 60 degrees average.  Overall the radio has been great.  Guess I will throw away and buy something else.
5,it nice sideband radio watch a video on out was surprise do dead key on am almost 3 to talking 12 ssb 10  that out of box weather real good sound if I can get ANTENNAS higher be nice to use i love it
5,Uniden bearcat cb radio is a great radio I don't seem to have any problems. Stock with out any tweaking I can get up to 25 miles away I might be getting longer distance but it's hard to really know. Just as fyi this radio only gives you a pig tail power supply.
1,I purchased a Uniden Bearcat CB 980SSB radio. It worked for two months. I sent it in for repair on 4 December 2015 at a cost of $17.00 to myself. On 6 January 2016 I received a replacement factory serviced model and guess what it did not work either as the freaking LED for RF gain did not work and the single side band was non-operative (totally distorted). Today (8 Jan 2016) I sent the radio back to Uniden. Yesterday I called Uniden and spoke with a Customer Service person and asked to speak to a Supervisor. He connected me but all I got was a recording telling me to leave a message and someone will call be back within 24 hours. Guess what folks no call back. I will not purchase another Uniden product. Lesson Learned.  Still waiting for resolution on the returned radio.  Will update as necessary
4,AM-USB-LSB- NOAA Weather.  With a good antenna this does the job for me.
5,Easy to set up and operate
5,perfect size these new SUV have very litle space for this kind of stuff rather have my import or Cobra but for the everyday CB guy this is a great radio
5,I use it for a base at the moment on a IMAX 2000 works great for local recieved skip few contacts side band is awesome.
4,Very easy to install and high quality unit. Love that it has the weather stations and the PA hookup for speaker is what sold me on it. My kids love playing with that.
5,Use this radio barefoot with a Ranger 198 NC mic. Talking all over the world on just 12 watts PEP SSB. If you're looking for a new radio this is the best bang for the buck out there. A+++. Get yourself a good antenna like a Sirio Turbo 5000 for mobile good coaxand start DX'ing. You won't be disappointed!
5,This is a good radio. Cb sounds and ssb works great. I like the tuning capability. Be gentle with the channel button.
2,Poor Quality control!  I purchased two of these radios and will be sending one back.  Plugging in the microphone causes the radio to power off.  The radio itself works fine but the microphone must have been wired wrong.  This leads me to believe there is little to no QC either that or the radios/microphones are of such poor build that they break in transit/packaging (along with shipping package issues).  But the good news is the radio itself does put out full legal limit according to my meters.  The display is hard to see during daylight.
5,Very pleased with the range sound and quality of this CB...would buy again. Husband is a trucker and loves it
5,Great Raido I really love it!!!!
2,The receiver sucks and the face plate goes dead fast… bottom line radio sucks! 100% sucks for sure!
5,Easy to use love the colors and being able to match them to my interior. Easy to tune!
4,Unit works well--But the display has several deep scratches in it.
1,1 year update: LCD quit altogether. Really disappointed. Old review when newer—>3 out of 5 because LCD screen can't be turned up bright enough in daylight to make it visible without a struggle.  Because this is something you need almost everytime you use it it is not good. I reviewed the instruction book and  tried all the different contrast and brightness settings and could not get it to go bright even though the level of brightness did work. The self test feature is nice- I am not sure how accurate it is relative to an inline meter however I was able to modulate the readout when I changed the antenna length.
5,This is a top notch cb and exceeded my expectations. It did not like my firestik antenna however so I upgraded to a Wilson 5000 it's a much better companion to the bearcat 980. Superior cb deserves a superior antenna
1,Installed in my jeep with a good cable great ground and firestick antenna. Battled with high SWR. Only use it got was testing SWR. Now it seems the transmit amplifier is burnt out. Waste of time and money. Wish I had read more about the delicate nature of this particular radio before I bought it. Don't buy.Receives great. Heard people from Australia. Person with walkie talkie could not hear within sight of me.
4,good product. great range
5,Great radio at a great price! I've read a lot of reviews on this unit that complained about all the control buttons "beeping"when you use them. I dont see any problem with this as a matter of fact I like that about it. Overall its a great looking solid functioning radio !!!!
3,Great CB mic problematic. I received the CB in good time had it all set up and was receiving just fine unfortunately the MIC was DoA. I guess this is a bit of a problem with these microphones according to some CB troubleshooting forums I visited.
5,So far VERY pleased with this CB radio.  I installed it in my jeep and love it.  No problems at all.  I really like the color schemes and the day/night settings.
5,This CB is awesome!! I love all the  features.  From the weather channel to the adjustment you can make  for your personal  Preferences. Very happy I bought it.
4,Really good radio for the price. Extra mic cable was missing.
5,Had hours of entertaining talks with fellow truckers. Seems to be holding up. Love the diagnostic feature. I'm a galaxy and cobra user but this one rides with the best of them so far.
4,Build in SER is accurate for once.
5,Very reliable equipment. I have received communications from far countries. Great hobby plus helps in security and when cellular wont work.
3,Doesn't look or feel to be built very well knobs are loose. A LOT of cool features though. One of the only CB radios with SSB so your options are limited. That's why I got it.
5,Not the greatest but if you want a decent package out of the box it's good.  If you are a company driver that can't upgrade wiring and other things  this is for you.
4,I am not a hobby CB radio person but I listen. It is more of an emergency readiness tool for me. I would feel better knowing that I helped someone. Oh the weather channel is awesome.
5,Brought it to modify to FM so once it's done should be a great unit thats the only thing it is missing but the wireless mic is the reason I purchased this unit for being a very handy feature
5,Awesome CB SSB Radio. works like a charm right out of the box  I might buy another.. For $109 dollars you cant go wrong.  An Solarcon A99 antenna really makes this shine.
4,Working well.
5,Awesome no problems works great
5,It's a great radio I really like the built in swr meter makes tuning the antenna easy people have said the mic isn't up to the task I have no complaints about the mic the display is not very bright that's the only thing I don't like.
4,radio works just fine with a  K40 brand K-30 mag mount antennacould use a little more receiver gain but works o.k. onchannel 19..
4,The first one didnt due the job?sent it back for a replacment.2nd one seems tobe fine.willnot know for awhile.useing it.freinds like it.love the colors that it shows.
4,Looks good didn't have Time to install yet
5,Replaced a Cobra 29 with this Uniden 980 SSB great choice! I like cobra radios but...appears their products changed in quality over the years. Anyway; this 980 SSB is far better! Matched it with a Wilson 5k and swr is at 1.2 on both channels. Thanks Amazon for all your help
4,holds frequency very well.good tx & rxbut dont work well with any of my many amps. when dead key is turned down the modulation drops out.as a barefoot radio it works very well.
5,Love this product. Many customization options and love the built in Swr reading and the calibration. Has a built in fuse which was great. Lots of wire about 4 ft or so. No complaints yet or in the future.
4,It was as described and delivered on time.
1,Wasn’t long after installation I noticed the screen was going dim and needed to set the brightness and contrast to max. Couple weeks later the screen was not displaying some of the characters and the channel numbers were not complete. The LCD was going out and only partially displaying. I sent in for warranty and Uniden sent me a replacement about 6 weeks later. 2 months later and the screen on the replacement unit has gone out as well. Two units in 6 months both with failed LCD screens. Time to buy another brand.
4,lots of features on this radio.  scans all or selected channels. side band gives longer range. Make sure you get a quality antenna so you get the most out of the radio
4,It's a good radio for the price
4,Larger than I expected. Was hoping it would be more compact.. This is a 1980's size radio.
5,meets my expectation for performance
5,Awesome....and for those that can't stand the unit beeping everytime u switch channels or press a button THERE IS AN OFF SWITCH "ANL/NB" held down will mute beep.  Read the manual!!!!!
5,Best radios ever
4,Nice unit but it's huge. Not for a small pickup there's no room for this monster
5,Have yet to install it into a vehicle but have talked on one and they are GREAT!! would recommend to someone looking for a Cobra/ uniden 148GTL as a good alternate
5,This radio is impressive.  I made several SSB contacts right out of the box.  The reports I've received indicate strong signal and clear audio.  That says alot for a "barefoot" rig!  It stays on frequency well.  I would highly recommend this unit and I would definitely buy it again.  73s!
1,I bought one of these Uniden bearcat980 SSB CB radios for my jeep. After I installed it and powered it up I could hardly make out the display screen. No matter what I tried. SO I returned it figuring that it was perhaps a faulty item that escaped the factories QC. So I ordered another one. SAME PROBLEM! So I'm returning it as well. The listed features on this radio was just what I was looking for but if you can't read the screen what good is it??? VERY DIS-APPOINTED!!!
1,So I rarely turn the CB on unless I'm traveling long distance. The LED screen fades out and you can't read anything on it (no matter what settings you put it at) when I turn it on it starts out bright some numbers you can read then instantly complete screen black out. This was the worst CB purchase that I have ever had and I probably will never buy a Bearcat again. It looks nice but it seems like uniden cut to many corners on these.
1,very sorry radio can not hardly see LCD even on the brightest settingRF power output nt as advertised picture of lcd brightness exaggeratedthe same goes for the model 880 am only radio...Many complaints on internet about the lcd brightness.
3,so far it works OK.  I can pick up some stations but so far no one can hear me.  I got it mostly for monitoring but broadcasting is still important.  If my cb buddy cant figure it out it is going back to amazon
4,works great
5,Great!
5,You got to have this if you’re a truck driver no duck great bye
5,Nice little modern style radio
5,Hands down the best CB I've owned.  Clear comes with a good mic paired with a firestik and quality cable.  Recommended.
5,I run this radio bone stock no transmit alignment necessary on the stock mic and get great SSB reports on both the transmitting frequency accuracy and the audio.  Some boots and you're ready to have a great time local or DXing. For the price you just can't beat this for an AM/SSB rig.
5,Great radio has all the features. All reviews I read before buying were great and has held up to my expectations. It you're thinking of buying it or similar I would advise going with this radio for the small amount it costs extra. You'll be pleased.
1,The radio was in my truck for awhile and I moved it to the garage.  After using it for a few weeks the LCD screen started to fade out and some characters and functions did not display.  I should have returned it within 30 days.  I thought I would give it a try but the display went south after a couple months.  I am stuck with junk.  It was a waste of money for me.
5,I've had this in my car for quite a while now. I absolutely love having it. My only problem is that the glue holding the screen down has started to come loose near the power knob but it's no problem.
5,Display changes color to match interior lighting.  Loud and clear on AM and SSB.  SSB is right on frequency.  Sounds good through stock speaker. Weather alert works perfectly and weather reception is excellent.  Scans favorite or all channels.  Great features and built in swr meter.
2,This cb radio worked good for about a week had to recalibrate and then the light features started going really dim weren't able to get a day time light feature to go brighter and by this time wasn't able to return product so I'm stuck with it.And know it has bad reception. Should have stayed with a cobra
2,I bought this and enjoyed it for a few weeks but now it does not transmit anymore. My SWR from external meter was 1.3 so that was not the issue. I had it on listening for awhile and when I keyed up the talk back worked but I noticed my external meters did not move. What a disappointment. Its a hundred dollar radio so I didn't expect much but this is not cool. I'm going to find a better radio.
5,Good radio. Lots of options for setup. Built in SWR meter is surprisingly accurate.Not the radio for you if you like to tweak output but as a stock radio it's a solid performer.
5,none
5,Not the smallest radio there is but for the features it has it rocks! I can match the screen color of my FM radio the weather bands are handy its not the strongest broadcasting radio there is but its got descent power more then enough for the average user.
5,Great product
3,It might be the stock antenna in my truck but does not get that far range and sometimes I can’t hear anything..
5,An easy to install and use radio.It's kinda large in size so think about how u gonna put it into ur car before purchase.Good function and handy when doing the settings/diagnoses.The annoying beep can be killed search YouTube for some walk thru.
5,Nice radio works up to expectations would buy again
2,Had my first one replaced the digital screen went out now my replacement one is doing the same thing lasts about 5 months not very good quality.
5,best CB radio ever the scan function makes this thing awesome! also its priced really well and works really well. It's really feature loaded as well.
5,Have used this on many road trips. Great product and totally worth the purchase. Easy to install and easy to work. If you're looking for a CB radio this is a great one to get!
2,Would have been a great radio if it wasn't for the screen going out within a year or two looks like it time to buy from a new brand.
5,Love this radio. I haven't had it but six weeks.  It doesn't drift like my Galaxy.  Get great audio reports.  Using  Turner + 3 mike.  Would recommend to a friend or enemy.
5,It's a great cb made a contact in Illinois and all around town.Its a good buy it comes with AM/USB/LSB functions well worth the money.
4,Great CB radio. Easy to install. Display is easy to read and instructions are very detailed. However Be ready to spend on tuning.
5,Wow.. great unitLong range and simple to use. Best part: Pass or Fail test options.
4,love this radio most of the reviews are true pros and cons. but overall a great cb radio !
1,Great radio.  Arrived in Australia earlier than expected.Edit:  To clarify I agree with those that mention the display is hard if not impossible to see in bright sunlight if the radio is off angle but if you can get over that obstacle it is a great radio always on frequency and packed with features.Edit 2:  Like many other people have said the display has faded and is impossible to see.  Amazon will not help and Uniden will not honour their warranty because I live outside of the US.I WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN!
4,Overall good radio expected more power out of it.  Not operating at full 4 watts however the sideband makes up for it.
5,Great radio I am looking at buying another.
5,Great CB definitely needs a good antenna as with any CB but the intent of makes all the difference. I get over 2 miles with a 4 foot tunable fire stick antenna.
5,Nice radio works great!
5,Works good. It's clear & loud. I would get the external speaker if you want it louder. I love it.
4,well some how a good radio for the price.
5,This 980 is super powerful right out of the box. It's easy to setup and looks great. The 7 color display makes it easy to match my stereo for both day and night mods. My daughter has loved talking on 'skip' to Ontario Canada... we're in central Texas!
5,Works damn good  side band work's like it should am work as well
5,Works great.
4,Great radio. Good sound. Good features. Love the display. Works well her in Australia. Very cool. Im impressed. :)  :)
5,Very good deal. Am looking forward to shop again in near future for more accessories for this  great radio. Thanks
5,Excellent radio when used with a quality antenna I can talk 30-miles no problem.
5,Great buy
3,WEAK ON AM AND WEATHER GREAT ON SSB I LIKE THE SELF DIAGNOSTICS
5,Works perfectly. Great features. Bought an open box item for half price and can't be more pleased not a scratch on it.
1,Sooo.... I’m on my third one of these units. The LCD goes out within the first week to the point that you can no longer read the display.After amazon replacing it I contacted Uniden who had ZERO solutions other than offering to have me ship it at my expense to their repair facility only to replace it with the same deficient board and display.After doing some research I’ve found like at least 4 other in my circle of friends that have had this same unit and problem.Still looking for a fix/solution.
4,Doing a good job for me. Havn't spent enough time on the ssb feature but will in the near future
5,Very happy with it. You need a good antenna as always but I like the many features this radio provides. Works great for me!
5,Easy to use stock mic not the greatest I use the 6 to 4 pin cord (included in box) to use my astatic mic works better
5,Excellent radio and features for the price.I read the dimensions before ordering.  I was a bit surprised that it looked bigger then what I expected. I'm getting better reception with this radio then I am with my base station!
5,This radio functions perfectly . It scans am  usb  and lsb with multicolor lighting options . Works great . Works best with a good external speaker .
5,Love it!  It's a beautiful piece of equipment; side band the whole shabang!  Works perfectly and is superb quality!
1,After about 6 months of use the display is dead on the unit. I keep my Jeep in the garage and don't wheel it hard so no water in the cab to cause the issue. Normally the top is kept up so not much exposure to the elements. For some reason the display faded out over about a 2 week period then simply died. Definitely look at another - this one is a bad unit.
4,Good little radio
5,I love this CB I put it in my big rig. The sideband weather channel is an awesome feature the other guys in the company I work for will use my CB to check the weather. Their CB's don't have the weather band
4,Szuper!
5,Great little SSB radio.  The unit is full of features and I like the weather feature since I use this radio on my ATV/UTVs.  Once you get the antenna tuned and properly grounded it talks like a champ.
3,A decent unit. Straight forward operation. Easy menu. So far as I see it the only drawback is the screen becomes difficult to see if you are not directly in front of it.
5,Nice arrived on time brand new works very well just need aftermarket anntena and to get tuned that it
4,no thank you
5,pretty great radio dont even know all the features yet.  way better than my old 19dx
5,Great radio good signal and can set the color perfect with my rig.
5,More than satisfied. Great unit for my needs.  Looks great in the truck. Many compliments.  I was able to color match my interior dash lights.
4,fun to listen to
1,So a friend and I got these just to mess around on. We got the package deal with the cb radio and the antenna. Went to go and install the unit and the antenna they sent was for a HAM radio! Just make sure you know what you are ordering.
5,I've owned the following radios: RadioShack TRC-502 Cobra 19 III Cobra 29 LTD Classic (old) Cobra 29 LX BT.The Uniden is by far the superior radio in my opinion!
2,I bought this CB back in late 2016 for my rig. It was working great then 1 year and 8 months later. Gone with the wind and Amazon won't replace it. The display sucks it can pick up a lot coming in but doesn’t put out well at all.
5,Great deal. Some of the reviews said this was a used product. This is not the case. Item was shipped in a retail packaging and was sealed. Worked perfect the first time. Fast shipping.
1,This radio is not used every day only once a week for radio checks. LCD screen is failing so it very hard to find channels anymore. No lcd makes radio useless.Purchased on 2018 so no warranty. Very unimpressed.
5,IT HAS BEEN YEARS SINCE UNIDEN HAS COME OUT WITH A SIDEBAND CB RADIO.  THE UNIT IS RUGGED AND HAS MULTIPLE FEATURES.  IT STANDS OUT WITH THE UNIDEN NAME FOR HIGH STANDARDS.  I LOOK FORWARD TO INSTALLING IT INTO MY TRUCK.
5,A very nice mobile CB.  Has a lot of nice things to it.
5,I have only used this for a short time. very satisfied. It works very good with the old antenna setup I have. Now for a new antenna to go with it.
5,tres bon cb avec une bonne portee en usb (35 km) avec une antenne Wilson 1000 !!! tres content
5,Great radio for the price worked great out of the box the only thing I did to it was disable the annoying beep inside. A you tube video shows you how.
2,radio functioned fine other than the fact that radio checks agree that it s too low on modulation. this radio had a 20 amp power supply powering it  and was transmitting through brand new coax and antenna with 1.2 swr s. i have a power mic on order.
5,Grate Radio eazy to use very happy with it although the weather channels are no good in New Zealand as we. Don't use that frecquencys !Also have new wireLess microphone works well
3,What else can be said its a Puny 4 watt CB With SSB it works but its Not a DX machine. Good set up mode for a toy . It completes my 1.8 to 440mhz Legal system. Don't expect miracals.
4,nice radio  but put keyed up low wattage..  but I just andded a amp..
1,Radio has a flaw in the display - Once installed and operating for a few months the display started going dim & I had to turn up the brightness all the way just to see the numbers.  Now only part of the numbers are lit up....  I looked up online and found out that this is a common problem.
1,Screen was burned out
1,It's a great radio but the squelch stopped working it's a common issue. Also having TX and rx issues  looks awesome but quality is less than ok.
5,Top notch.  Allows scanning of all channels and the built-in SWR is great.
5,I love it so much thank you
5,I really love this radio. sounds great and works just like it should.
1,This cb worked well for about 6 months then it began to not transmit well the mic died- replaced it with another factory replacement as it wasn't covered under warranty then the cb began to fludder with power issues... about three days later it died... Uniden wants $80 by the time its shipped and repaired and will not warranty repair... would not recommend this product to anyone... paid $150 for this upscale radio was a huge disappointment!
5,If you're looking for a radio that does it all this is the one for you liked my first one so much I ordered another for my base. best citizen band radio you'll find @ $140.00 !
4,Nice system works great.
5,works as it should. Nice sleek design and has great options.
3,nothing like the older sets side band good  am mode  not that great not much audio stock mic terrible go with astatic  road devil power microphone basic entery level set great size for mobile
5,I'm not able to mount it in my dash so I'm redesigning the dash mount to accommodate both my new stereo and the uniden I can hardly wait to see how it works out.
5,Awesome radio for the money. You won't get extra channels or a ridiculous amount of swing but the RX is great and it doesn't seem to drift on sideband.
5,Best CB for the money great reports when talked to someone
5,Great intuitive operation from a next generation CB radio. Clean and precise transmission and reception. Comes without that 1970's radio look.
5,Best radio I've had... Like it better than my Cobra.
5,Money worth spending On Great Radio for Sure!!!
5,Works very well. Fit into a '15 Jeep JKUR. Good sound quality fully-featured does great.  After lot of research really happy with the choice. Recommended.
5,only gripe is the night mode is hard to see in the day time(duh) i wish it would revert back to day mode when its turned back on.the side band stuff works great.
5,Seems to be a great radio. Honestly I don't use it a lot. I do turn it on when there's a traffic jam or something going on.
5,Great functioning unit. I love the display but cant see it in the sun adequately enough. Currently on my base and does great with an Antron 99. Great range on SSB.
1,The radio stopped working at the a few months It was a good radio to start off don’t know what happened and now I can’t return with that being said maybe try a different brand or something with the longer return Policy that’s the only thing I don’t like about Amazon if I would’ve got it from Walmart somewhere would’ve had more than three months to return something that I spent over $100 for
5,Seems so far to be a good radio I like the new features I received the radio and it did not work so i had to send it back for a replacement. I hope i do not have anymore problems.
5,Works great and nice features.  Dont care for the mic to much. Its kinda chunky in my hand but it works great.  I dont think ull find a better cb with sideband in this price range.
5,Works very good have a 300 wat liner hooked to it and boy does it get out about 150 miles live in the mountains gets out good have bad to the bone predictors hooked up very good
5,excellent cb . great price performs fantastic.
5,Nice radio.  I was able to modify a new dash plate and stuff it and a stereo in the dash of my Tacoma.
4,Lots of features easy to install good sound quality
1,Burned up two months after purchase. Return window closed. $150 paperweight. Had it on a protected power supply. Other equipment is fine. Hooked up to a pyramid power supply and fused the positive and negative with 5amp fuses. No idea but I’m guessing a faulty board.  Checked another radio on coax and swr meter is below 1.5:1. Lame
3,Its seems like a great radio. But it picks up a lot of sound from some were.
5,Love this CB radio and I have it paired up with the cordless Mic and can still talk when I'm about 100 feet away from the truck
4,Love this radio could use more power In broadcast.
4,nice product but the lens or bezel scratches easily.
1,Liked the radio a lot. Got my 980ssb September 3 2019 and it lasted until January 14th 2020. Took it to a tech and pretty much told me it was done. Finals were gone audio card gone and few other components. To replace the components cost more than the radio. And no luck yet with contacting uniden about the so called 1 year warranty.
5,This radio is versatile.  For the money the unit is great and has tons of functions.  I love the color changing.
5,This meets all my expectations
5,This is an excellent cb for the price. The ssb is well worth the purchase price alone! The digital display is a little difficult to see in day light.....but really nice at night.
5,Been wanting this radio for quite a while. $165+ at Truckstops. Very happy with what i paid for it and it's a darn good little radio
5,Looks good talks well. Perfect for what we got it for... an alternative form of communication and to monitor the highways. The SSB is a huge bonus as it's quiet and the range is good.
1,As soon as the warranty ran out so did the life of the screen. Radio still works but cannot navigate it at all. The screen is just blank but if I get lucky and remember what channel its on I can count around to get to other channels. I would suggest googling the screen issues so you see how common they are. Definitely wish I would have.
1,Very disappointed. Radio did not turn on after power was supplied to it. Unhappy customer
5,Worked great but can only be peaked and tuned to perform a little 32 year Truck driver still using my Galaxy
5,Been 25 years since I owned a CB but wanted some thing to do for a hobby and after a week of using it the 980 seems like a fine radio
5,This Bearcat is awesome. I'm temporarily is using this as my home base radio and loving it. Most of my CB BUDDIES don't realize that it's a mobile radio. Really pleased CB'er
5,This cb hears very well
5,This is exactly what I wanted.Great new technology.  Super on-air sound and receptin reports.The features make this a nice addition for either the new CB radio operator or the seasoned aficionado.
1,Stay away from uniden. This one only worked for a couple of months before the LCD quit completely. It has never been wet and is not mounted on the dash in the sun. I had to pay return shipping and when I got it back I had the exact same failure withing a week. Sad uniden used to be a good brand.
5,I have this Uniden c. b model 980 ssb in my 1988 gmc pickup using a Wilson little wil antenna works great. The weather band is very useful .
5,Uniden BEARCAT CB Radio With Sideband And WeatherBand (980SSB)         One of the best radios I've owned!
4,Love it
1,Display visibility is horrible at any thing more than 15 deg angle.Had it installed less than a week and now receive is wierd. Receive pulses on/off even on weather channelsCompared power output on an external meter and compared with internal struggled to make 4w output. Needed Mike gain maxed out to be understable according to local contacts.Bummed it took me a couple weeks to around to installing now I'm stuck with a defective pos.
5,Works great easy set up. Love the built in meters
5,Clear sound and good calibration possible - love it. Watch that Loudspeaker stays uncovered or add for 20 Bucks a extra Loudspeaker for having that clear sound.
5,Easy install works perfect right out of the box.
1,Unfortunately I didn't install this until after Amazon's return window.  Some of the LEDs were out so I couldn't read much of the display.  I had to pay to send it Uniden and hopefully they'll fix or replace it.  This is a common problem so don't wait to test your unit like I did.
5,I was a Cobra 29 user for years andSo far surpasses it in all categories.  This radio is in between your Cobraand a "Big radio"
1,the one i bought only worked for a couple of weeks before quitting from the very start the lighted display was so dim you had to be inside the garage or be using it at night to even tell what channel you were on. worked good for a few days but you didn't know what channel you were on i was very disappointed with it and returned  amazon gave me a refund. can i give it less than one star??
5,My boyfriend loves it!
5,good performance for the price
4,I like it
3,The LCD display too dimmed otherwise this is awesome CB radio unit
2,Order this October 26th 2019 it is now January 20th 2020 and my display is going out.... This is a brand new radio.....
1,I purchased this CB on May 22nd 2018 for my 15 JKU. The LED screen is already not working. I turn the radio on an nothing appears at all. I have to have one of my buddies next to me talking on his radio to let me know what station I am on. I really regret giving my non LED Bearcat to my sis now. FML this radio broke my heart.
1,Junk.  I bought this for my Jeep Wrangler.  I did not find out it was not broadcasting out for months.  The weather channel worked and  I could hear folks on the radio but I could not get them to talk to me.  It cost me another $ 40 to have my CB tested at a shop and they found it to be broken.  I never got one transmission out of the unit.  Junk junk junk.  I bought a Cobra LX 29 and put that on the same power source antenna etc. and it works great.  Don't fall for this one.
2,Faceplate was scratched right out of the box. However a couple of scratches won't hurt it's function. So I kept it. Now 4 months later unit receives but won't transmit. Really a waste of money in this case. And of course Amazon won't take it back 4 months out. So.. now what?
1,I don't like is the display the screen is very hard to see in the daytime the least amount of sunshine and it looks like a blank screen at night it shows up well I returned it because of the display I put it in a Jeep and even with the top on the screen is hard to see. Returned
3,A fun radio and lots of features annoying beep when changing channel and not easily servicable and didnt appear to be putting out full legal power.
3,Looks good works good but that constant beep every move is too loud and annoyed me.
5,Good CB
4,Très bon produit merci
5,Works great and good overall radio
5,A very nice radio. I will use and enjoy for years to come
5,Great out of the box radio. Weather bands are week though. Great features for a $100 radio
1,WX receive not working at all in any mode.  CB seems to be working OK AM and SSB.  I have been working out of town and it sat in the box for 3 months before I could open it up and hook it up so I can't return it now.  Guess we'll see how Uniden's warranty is.Big disappointment with a brand new radio.  Had high hope for this.
5,Please let me know how long is warrantymy 980ssb stopped working ughhhhhh
1,This was missing the microphone what a rip off
5,Great little radio. Good price.
5,I just installed it yesterday. I still figuring out all the bells and whistle. Everything I have used so far works as described.
5,nice cb with most of the things you want or need/arrived in a timely manner undamaged /if a good ssb cb is needed the price on this is also not to bad
5,Great Radio!  Works perfectly!  Love the weather radio feature.
5,Love this CB. Glad I went ahead and purchased it. I've had it a year now and no problems.
1,NO CHANNEL DISPLAY. GENERALLY POOR  OPERATION. TEST FEATURES MALFUCTION. LOST  RECEIPT CAN'T SEND BACK!
5,I really like this cb radio. Now if I could get a  few CB friends.
5,So glad I went wight his model. Plenty of bells and whistles. The SSB was the selling point for me. Paired it with a Wilson 1000 magnetic antenna.
5,Nice radio. Works great. Good on ssb.
5,I see mixed reviews but I purchased two and they work for me but I'm no hard core cb'r we talk ten plus miles everyday with them.
5,working great...a friend tuned it for me and with a noise canceling mike drivers I talk with say it sounds fine.
5,Works great happy with seller.
3,Product came timely but the low band is not working. Amazon has a wonderful return policy and it is on it's way back.
5,works good talks good too. it is a smaller unit so it fits in a smaller location than the regular size cobra 29 size radio
5,great radio! good noise blanking systemgood audiolots of features. would be better with an adjustable rf gain
5,Works awesome great to talk again to the world!
1,I can receive on the radio; however I have yet to make a contact with the radio and I have had it over a month.  All the diag. on the radio says that everything is ok but ....  It is too late for me to return it or I would and get my money back!  Bad Purchase.
3,returned a little to big for my needs
1,Internal speaker failed June 2019. Plugged in an External speaker and there is audio output. This indicates that the internal speaker is bad OR external speaker jack is faulty.I am past the Amazon return date for this purchase.I’m going to contact Uniden and see if they will help me.
1,IT IS NOT TUNED .TRUCKERS ARE GOING PAST MY HOUSE ABOUT 200 FEET ON THE MAIN HWY. AND CANNOT HEAR ME.I WILL GO TO TTT TRUCK STOP WITCH IS ABOUT 140 MILES EACH WAY. THIS IS NOT RIGHT.IT IS GOING TO COST ME BIG BUCKS. CAN YOU DO SOMETHING FOR ME? $$$$$$ ???
1,After doing a lot of homework before I purchased I thought I was doing good. The entire LED screen goes out and reception is not that good. I do not have the box to return otherwise I would. In search of better radio for my Jeep.
5,This is a great CB! Even without the mast of my antenna attached I can sit in my garage and pick up a weather broadcast on all 7 channels.
5,Nice
5,I love this radio Great receive and everyone I talk to says how good I sound.  The receive on this radio is amazing.
5,It performed great on a long trip to Tennessee.
5,Great radio but hard to find wiring diagram for power mics.
1,DO NOT BUY!!!! Finals blow very easy! Bought two radios and both failed about a week apart. If the finals where up to snuff this would be an awesome radio tho. WX squelch needs to be turned down to get weather channels. SSB is perfect with no drifting at all. Audio is crisp and clean. I will be sending them off to see if new finals can be installed..bigger and better with heat sinks.. if not they will go directly into the trash.
5,Gets things out quickly
1,Can't see display therefore can't operate it.
5,Simply will do what you need it to and look good doing it. Install is painless.
3,don't use it much bought for emergency backup for road trips
5,Best 11meter radio on the market to date very stable from the get go there has been mods available but you can't go very far with it.
5,Good radio easy to use and stylish but very large unit is my only issue
5,made my friend really happy
5,Works great! Looks great! Really reaches out to people.
1,Sent the first one back with a problem. Received the second one worked great till a few days ago. Problem with Side Band. That is 2 bad CB's and can't return the second one.
5,this is a great radio side band is rock solid with a ground plain i talked to Texas loud and clear
1,I purchased one of these are not even two weeks later the Radio went out and wouldn’t even turn on they sent me out a replacement and the screen has completely gone black on the replacement. Definitely not worth the money
1,I'm on my third radio of this model and just like the previous two the screen dies after a little sun hits it. Going to find another solution. When the screen works the radio worked well.
3,The radio works great the menu button don't work at all so. I will have it fixed.  Don't buy remanufactured.......
1,Love the radio and it's functions. I have had this radio for less than a year and the LED screen has already gone out. It costs right around the same price as the whole radio to replace it. Get a non LED radio.
1,After having it a couple of months the display failed shortly after that it stopped receiving tried to get it fixed or replaced and the warranty I bought with SquareTrade refused to do anything they said I needed to get the manufacturer to fix it
5,best radio I ever had for my big truck. Fits perfect in hole. would recommend this radio for any trucker looking for a wonderful radio
5,I really like this radio.  It has everything.
1,USED!  Received box at home and gave everything a quick once over the radio was wrapped in a clear bag and looked ok. Go to install in my truck and after pulling out the old radio/ mounting bracket/ power harness I find I have a new USED radio. Unacceptable! What a waste of my time. Returning for refund wish I could get my time back.
5,Great radio stays dead on frequency hot or cold would buy another for the base
1,Had it less than 2 months and the screen stoped lighting up.
1,Junk screen and no warranty
1,Not good and waste of money. Sound clarity is horrible. The display lasted 2 months till it lost half of the light up display and is continuing to to go out. Very disappointing purchase
1,Didn’t work right out of the box... calibrated it... poorly made unit... requires to many repairs right out of the box... disappointing to say the least
1,Screen has failed. Bottom left 3/4 of screen is unreadable and does not work. LCD screen has failed
5,This cb with the Wilson 4' antenna works great and the distance is unbelievable.  Defnitely one of the best looking cb's on the market.
5,Bought for a Florida trip works awesome I would highly recommend this product.
5,Love this thing.
3,Haven't had good luck with it.
5,awesome
5,Works Great Looks good Sounds Good. A keeper all around. Looking for a well made radio with a long history in the business  then this is it!
3,Good radio. Too many buttons and controls. You get too confused while driving.
1,Bought in November of 19 the led screen no longer works at all no recourse would not recommend for this money you think you could get a years use out of it....
5,Very good
5,Great CB Radio.  Waiting for my 2' antenna so I can calibrate it.  Should last many many years.
1,Bout this a year ago 2 months later the display went out got on here to get it replaced but was unavailable now how can I get it replaced now it's available again
3,Not particularly impressed with its performance.
5,Awes some cb now everyone I show wants one simple easy to use with all the necessary options!!
5,great sounding and talking radio. No expansion for channels just 40 channels am usb lsb
5,works as expected didn't arrive with any damage arrived on time and with no major problems.
5,Nice radio. Not a big power radio but nice loud sound.  Was aligned perfectly right of the box
3,AM and SSB power low on bird 43.
5,Mines been fine and on freq in the truck for 6 months
1,We bought two of these. One in July and one in December. Been trying to get them to talk to each other ever since. Now that we know the one we bought in December came broken it must be too late to return it. We can't seem to find any return info. We got stuck with junk :(
5,Works well.  Good price.
1,With less than ten hours transmit time display fail. Common for this model. Suggest Galaxy 949.
5,I really love his radio it is far better then any radio I have ever owned
5,Nice CB SSB deep voice sounds weather stations a real plus
5,as expected
5,CB is still cb but the weather band  is more useful to me
5,Best SSB CB on the market at this time for normal CB operation.
5,One of the best radios!!
2,it don't like the heat of a closed up cab . you can't read the face any more
5,Love it! Everything on it works as described. Put it in and out with an adapter power cord. Would purchase it again
5,I think they should buy it. It's exactly as described. I would recommend this to even people who are just getting into the hobby
2,This CB doesn't receive worth a darn. My 20 year old Cobra 19 received much better and was basically running the same antenna also. I should have just bought a $40 radio.
5,I love this CB didn't even have to get it tweaked worked good right out the box!! Good for 2-3 miles maybe 4.
2,Can't hear a thing except users from 1000 miles away with their big amplifiers.  Can't talk to anyone locally or on the road.  Antenna has been matched... problem is the crappy radio.
5,Works pretty good so far! Wish more people in the area were on the air!
1,Mine stopped working.  It turns on and lights up but won't receive and won't transmit.  Now I don't know what to do with it.
1,I'm a professional radio tech. Just wanted something to play around with on the Jeep. Bought this and after I installed it I hooked it up to the meter... 2 watts.
5,Great Product and great service from seller.
5,Display in sunlight is hard to read but sound is really nice.  Good radio for the price.
1,Update from 5 stars to 1... I had the raido since july 22nd 2018 and now the led screen is going out havnt left it out in the sun just in a vehicle with a rag covering it when im not using...
5,Great CB radio - gets out to where I needed
5,when you is a part of team is important to have this radio is like talk near or clouse to the others
2,Screen started fading after while some led lights never worked on it
5,I love this radio so much I bought another one.  :)
2,Looks good that about it
5,Works great - even with sun spots. Weather radio worth it's weight in gold when I'm on the road.
2,After the first year half of the display stopped working.  Shortly afterwards the on/off switch stopped working.
4,Para divertirme
5,This radio is super. Nice transmit. Great clean audio. Excellent receive. Love it! Connect to a Antron 99 you will be happy you did.
5,perfect
5,Works great!  Love the sidebands!
5,Have had no issues with this radio. Seems solid and lots of nice features. For the money you also get side band too!
5,Bought it for my father and he love it! So all is well. Weather band is his fav!
5,Lots of options. Can change display colors and with some cheap sticks I'm picking up 7 miles so far
5,awesone use it every day the only thing is it doesnt have a clock on it
5,Very happy with this radio. Looks great in my car sounds great. I've very impressed with it's features quality and sound.
5,good product
1,Received two radios all good. Mounted tuned antennas to meet SWRs only about a mile range not much better ob SSB. Would not recommend.
1,The red color option stopped working after a few months.  It was my favorite color to have on at night which is a bummer. I still love the radio though
5,Receive is perfect. Stock mic is clear and loud. Side band works great when conditions are right. Overall excellent radio.
5,Radio has everything you need.  Sounds good  and works great.
5,Very nice radio works great on SSB.
2,it not as good as the old one to much stuff on it and i don't like the side ban in it.
1,Display burnt out after only a couple of years. Id recommend a classic radio over new tech like this one.
5,started CB radio in 1967 great radio
1,Not nearly as friendly as my old cobra 148! Once I can find a CB shop to fix the Cobra this POS will be pawned of on some other unsuspecting moron!
5,Great unit.  Style that is modern very functional.  Works very well and highly recommended.
1,Bearcat 980  ssb does not transmit in am mode. Carrier dead key is 4.0 watts speak into Mike and Carrier on external wattmeter does not move. Am modulation not working?? Ssb is OK.Sorry to say looks like I need to exchange unit. Need modulation to be heard.Art Lutus WA6SBE
5,it's great.
5,Great radio lots of features display is easy to read with many choices for different colors.
1,After two weeks of being installed the radio failed on the trail.  Would no longer receive transmissions on the AM band and had severe weather band leakage into the AM band.Great radio when operational but kinda pointless to have a great radio that doesn't receive anything on the AM band.
5,Love the large display very easy to set up and use.
5,Best for money
5,Very good stuff thanck  :-)
2,Cheap crap radio. TX died after 3 weeks of use. This was not a SWR problem. The finals in these radios are weak and do not last. Deluxe Crap Box ...Chinese garbage.
1,First radio mic quit transmitting after 3 days the replacement one transmitted for 10
5,Paid for the quality and got it.Love it.
5,It's easy to learn to use and the functions does what it says
1,Product was received with a dent in the shipping box and dent in metal housing of the top of radio shell.
5,This system was recommended by a friend who bought and installed one in their jeep. We are excited to use it!
5,Does everything a larger heavier radio will do and more while taking up less space
1,Works great when it works... is say it's a 50/50 if it even turns on. Double checked all connections etc and all is good double checked install instructions as well it's installed 100% correct yet sometimes it just doesn't turn on.
5,Use this radio in truck. Talks great and a good power mic tops it off.
5,Good unit. Bought several.
5,So good I bought a second one.
5,UNIDEN the name says it all !!Always Top Shelf!! I Like It!!
5,This is a great radio!!! Amazon your service was great too!!!
5,Works well.  Have put it through the paces and it's solid.
1,After only seven months of use The display is fading out. My next radio will not be a Uniden.
5,Nice unit. Installed in a JK using a 3 ft. firestik antenna. Works well
5,Great Radio
5,Arrived as promised!
1,shaver head broke within six months of purchase.  can't find any info on the supplier for returning the razer.  frustrating!!!
5,I've been ordering Uniden in the past and still not disappointed.
2,the one I bought do not calibrate the anntena i run a couple of test and is no way i can calibrate the radio
1,It was a gift for our son. It took a little while before we could get someone to connect it. When we finally had someone it didn't work. Straight from the box BROKE! By that time it was too late to return it. :(
5,Nice easy unit
1,Even after tune and peak this radio just isn't what that great of a radio I can only receive about 1/2 mile to 1 mile even on a good day where as my cobra I get apx 25 miles on the same system.
5,the scanning portion is great
1,This was sent in the original package of the item not in any other box. The box was beat up pretty bad but was left at my doorstep. The Item I will take out this weekend and see if t works.
5,Amazing radio!! Works awesome has great range and is loaded with features!
2,junk.
1,I had nothing but compliments on this radio until it up and failed.Less than 90 days later I cannot get a replacement. Amazon will not take it back or replace it. I cannot recommend.It looked good though.
5,Good so far but have yet to put it through it's paces.
2,I returned this radio because it would not pick up low band signals.
5,Supper great love it came same day
5,It scans all frequencies that it can see how cool is that!
5,Ihave hhad this radio for about 4 weeks and it works great
5,Best CB radio I have ever owned today. Looks great too.
5,Very nice SSB cb.
1,Every time the temp gets above 80 the display turns black when cools off comes back guess only good in the snow !
5,The best Cb I have ever had the pleasure of using
1,TERRIBLE RANGE!!!  I even took the radio to a Electronics Shop and they tuned the radio and set the power level. The out going transmission would not pass 1/4 mile. I never had any weather channel reception.
1,Got mine today. Final blown (no output) and the screen was scrached. Did not care for the quality of the radio (felt very cheep} compaired to the radios I've used over the years. l expected more from Uniden.
5,Nice Radio love it
1,Works alright but as other reviews state impossible to de display in sunlight.Update: Now only 20% of the display works at all.
1,I can't adjust the clarity knob so I can understand people talking. I've got on YouTube and googled it. Still can't adjust it. It was a waste of money. Should have stayed with my little $40 basic CB.
5,Great reception. Works good.
5,Awesome everything I needed and wanted!
1,Don't buy even though it's prime if your not satisfied  because it's very cheaply made even for a Uniden  Amazon will charge you $10 to ship back. Very disappointed with PRIME SCREWING .
2,Mic gain  turned  up all the way yet I get told its vary week
5,Nice update to the classic SSB. Reception is good transmit clear.
5,Love this Cb.best one out my 20 years driveing a truck
5,Pretty good going getting out to other countries
5,the weather is just a bonus on a very good radio
5,love it

5,Very nice design with a lot of features!
5,Great reception very clear.Directions could be better explained.

5,Worth the money solid cb
1,Cb sucks not a good cb
5,Excellent product
5,I love this is radio
5,Very happy with this product.
1,Did not receive signals
5,good radio
1,Didn't work
5,Works excellent.
5,Great!
5,Excellent
5,I love the fact that SSB does not drift all over like some other imports we all know about. Old-timers it's not one of those radios with all kinds of trimmers and pots to be messed with that aside there are some basic alignment points. A simple microphone upgrade and other unmentionable upgrades will get you talking skip with a good antenna. The radio has a wonderful display and works really well in dimly lighted settings but as others have said doesn't look very bright in the light of day. I've found this to be no problem. The radio looks modern digital futuristic. Too bad everyone is on cell phones nowadays. All in all a very nice radio worth the money. Keep your hands off the display as it tends to get smudged.
5,thx
5,very nice
5,Good ítems
5,Awesome radio!
5,Great cb
5,Excellent
5,Works great!
5,aok
5,love it
5,I've had all kinds of radios.This one has taken a beating moving from truck to truck and still works great.Every driver personalizes their own with external speakers and upgraded mic's.What I love most is the ability to diagnose problems such as RF Ant And Power.Day/night display has various settings both in color and brightness.Believe me when I say brighter is not better for night time driving.The sub band is a nice feature it should be the only feature because it reaches out miles further than your typical AM band.But here's the problem..No One Uses It! lolSo what's the sense of using it?The main purpose of having a CB is to be in contact with as many other drivers as possible.Being aware of a problem before it's to you is the whole Idea.Many eyes make for a safer trip.Safe travels everyone.
1,I'm on my second new unit and both displays failed quickly. I've only rarely been more disappointed in a product. Never. Never ever. Never never ever Uniden anything again. Holy crap.
4,UNIDEN BEARCAT 980 SSBAfter my Cobra 29 Classic LTD bit the dust after only 3 years I didn't buy another Cobra 29 but got this radio instead because of the SSB and updated display which you can adjust the brightness of for day and night use.I like the blue color LED the most for daytime although the red reminds me of the lights that the military uses for low light signatures and is very Holloweenie at night...ooh scary.Unit is light weight and transfers well from truck to car.SWR calibrate function is way more sensitive compared with the Cobra 29 and my Firestik II antenna was way off as a result but now both the car antenna and the truck antenna are nearly the same which is cool. Now whether in the car or the truck I just get in install the coax plug in the power and go. I do still check the swr every now and then but it's right on at 1.00 and perfectly level at channels 40 and 1.The radio has a antenna check and a voltage check and a microphone check function in the Diagnose part of the menu which is cool. It will show how much voltage radio is getting when the engine is on or when it is off which kinda helps to see if your alternator is at 14v and battery at 12v so it doubles as a troubleshooting tool for those as well.If this function helps me from getting stuck with a couple of dead batteries or an 'about to die' alternator even just once this function alone will have paid for itself 10 times over.The antenna check -checks- the connection of the coax cable from the radio to the antenna and works well.OK now for the business end of the radio...I find that the receive and transmit are ok...just ok. Radio check from other drivers on the road are that the radio sounds good from about a mile or maybe 2 miles away on a cloudy day but no further. I can tell it's ability to receive is weak by just listening to the radio on 19 and waiting to hear drivers at truck stops and it's usually not more than a mile or so.I guess you can turn a couple of pots inside the radio to turn up the modulation on both the AM and SSB.SSB is a new function for me. So far USB and LSB don't seem to have much on it to listen to but I guess not too many drivers have it or I have a low powered stock radio that isn't receiving too well.The microphone jack on the unit is a 6 pin! but the included adapter will accommodate any 4 pin mic you have from your old setup.The included microphone is well one that looks like it's design was from the movie The Transformers. I guess some drivers will actually use this microphone if this is their first radio but I would advise an Astatic or a Road King microphone instead of this weak cheaply made p.o.s. stock microphone...Uniden why did you even bother? I mean C'MON guys.You could have given us a beep on/ off function but you gave us this stupid microphone instead thanks.Let's see here...well it's a quiet unit and I don't hear the power window motors or the heater fan motor through the speaker like I did with the Cobra which is a huge plus.Like almost every one else that friggin beep noise is an issue and the fact that Uniden didn't see fit to give us a menu option to turn it off is just a stupid oversight.The knob to turn the radio on and the volume knob are one in the same like on most radios and is wobbly and not solid feeling like a radio of this price range should feel in my opinion. I like the Cobra radio a lot better for the solid feeling knobs they have and it's a big deal to me so fix it UNIDEN!I'm not sure how well this radio is designed and how well it will stand up to wet weather here in the Northern part of the USA but time will tell if UNIDEN coats it's board inside with a resin so that water isn't an issue since CBs are left out in cars and trucks. In fact why doesn't Uniden just make all their CBs to marine standards and call it a day?For some reason Uniden didn't include Bluetooth so that I could pair it with my truck stereo and listen to it over the speakers in my truck bypassing the small internal speaker in the CB.My headset mounted Bluetooth is something I really want to use instead of a microphone so that I can keep my hands on the wheel and why Uniden isn't even thinking about how Bluetooth is a modern day utility is besides me?!Any how that's pretty much it and I know there are ways around some of the things I complained about I just think that this radio has a lot of growing up to do before it's worthy of heavy big truck use by professional drivers.
5,Easy to mount and use great quality!
4,For a new SSB CB rig you can't beat the price really. However it's not without its faults. The PERKS: Nice displays nice audio (With a decent mic.) good receive good frequency stability (Compared to Galaxy and Connex radios.) nice receive audio (Especially on a good EXT speaker.) two types of scanning functions Coarse and Fine Clarifier adjustments Talk-Back function pretty accurate SWR test and reading and NOAA Weather VHF Radio receive and you don't need a mic plugged into the rig for listening and have that +8VDC mic pin to use (Something taken from Amateur Radios.). But the JERKS: Stock mic has the audio of talking through a pillow (Easily fixable.) draws more current on just receive idle (Like .5A.) regulators get more than warm on just receive idle RF Gain not continuous and only 5 steps  being LoHS (Lead-Free.) solder means that colds solder joints may plague you later don't expect a super charged race car performance on transmit but more like a straight 3.0Lt 6 cyl engine (Does anyone understand my comparison there?) and still Uniden used under voltage electrolytic capacitors (Mine had three of them that I've swapped out.)  The only rig that I could really compare too in performance is the newer Chinese version of the Cobra 148GTL. (Don't expect race car transmit performance there either.) Some of the JERKS are fixable like that accompanying noise cancelling mic can be greatly improved by taking out that rubber disc in front of the mic element. (That sounds much better.) The under voltage capacitors can be replaced. The SMT components maybe difficult to resolder with 60/40 leaded solder but all the throu-hole components certainly can be. And a good power mic (Like the Astatic D-104-M6B.) will help make this radio shine better on SSB and AM. Plus that middle +8VDC mic pin can power the mic! (No more 9V battery leaking.) CB antennas do not make for a good VHF Weather Station receive antenna (Then again all Weather Radio equiped CB's have that problem. How about a separate VHF antenna jack for that?) We'll see how this radio holds up on the road since I've only tried it as a base thus far. Not a great AM / SSB radio but for the price a good radio to have and consider.
1,Just installed it in the screen went dim cannot fix it all the reviews that you were seen about this are very true do not get it it is not worth it this is the crappiest unit I can believe for $160 down the drain I am so beyond I installed this in a friend's vehicle and he is mad didn't even last 30 minutes being on do not buy the screen will go dim 🔅
4,Earlier this year I purchased this (880) at a truck stop. I use the radio occasionally mainly for work communication between transport and chase vehicles.It so far it has been a very good purchase. Its held up well to construction work (heavy equipment movement). I have had no issues with the radio at all.I think the stock speaker has too low of a volume (well for fast approaching 50 it is). I purchased a remote speaker and mounted it in the rear window area of my truck (F150) I have no trouble hearing now as I often have to turn it down. The remote speaker works well when you have the car radio lightly playing on the long trips. Then the iPhone giving NAV reports over the car stereo speakers too (CarPlay). That remote speaker still allows plenty of volume to properly hear your other vehicle.Since my job varies and I don't always need this unit hooked up or for quick changes. I elected for a slightly different approach. I used 3 magnetic car phone mounts and attached them to the front slide out cup holder assembly of the F150. The magnets will latch onto the radio allowing me to choose various angles of mounting it at. We always run ch 19 so really changing or seeing the display while driving is almost always not necessary for me. However it is easily accessible if needed. I find it helps cut down on the amount of light distractions with the unit side ways. Though the CB does have day/night mode if you want to use it.I have not seen any issues with the CB and the magnetic mounts. The 3 mounts have held the radio in some bumpy construction terrain and it hasn't fallen off yet.I am not by any means a power user I just need a good well made radio that will hold up over time. This unit fits the bill.
5,The Bearcat 980SSB radio works great. I am very satisfied.
5,Before purchasing this CB radio consider the following:This is a modern 11 meter SSB CB radio designed for use in North America not a 10 meter export radio. The radio chassis uses surface mount technology you are not going to poke around in there with your Weller soldering gun and big ole screwdriver and make things work "gooder".Forty channel sideband mobile radios built in the good old days would cost you close to double the price of what this radio is being sold for today.I purchased this radio to be used in multiple cars with a mag mount antenna.That means the radio is held in place to the center arm rest with a bungie cord and gets power from the lighter plug. It worked well during my vacation. The noise blanker did an excellent job of keeping auto electronics noise out of the receiver where an older radio's noise blanker could not keep the noise out of its receiver in the same cars. I received good audio and signal reports from everyone I spoke with using a D-104 hand microphone and the 6 pin to 4 pin adaptor that came with the radio. The factory mike is not up to the job. The radio came from the factory only producing 3.5 watts AM into a dummy load. Google is your friend. I came up with the info needed to adjust the correct pot to have the radio create up to 5 watts on AM. I didn't fool around with the SSB side. I'm not concerned about extra channels or unlocking the clarifier on a radio used in a vehicle so I did not pursue those aspects or modification. The weather alert works very well. It is NOT a SAME code based weather alert If NWS sends out the tone for ANY county the weather alert will trigger. Out of the box the radio beeps at you any time you press a button or twist any knob. That to me is very annoying. There are two youtube videos that show you how to carefully remove a SME resistor to turn off ALL the beeps to the point you can just barely hear them in a quiet environment. There is no frequency drifting on SSB. Compared to older radios this one weighs very little and the 7"x7" size may fit where others do not fit. To summarize this is not a flame thrower radio. It is a decently built 40 channel sideband CB radio that does the job for a reasonable price. If you need "more" than this you should look to other resources.
1,I have bought many CB radios through the years being a Commerical truck driver this is the only one I have bought that when I keyed the mike no one answered very low power out of the box very low modulation I am sending it back to Amazon Good Price Low Power Don't Need!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,As always uniden makes a fine radio. The 880 & 980 bearcats have some nice features However the display is not one of them. When the radio is on it quickly heats up and unless you have cooler air blowing on it the LCD display will fade to black. I have 2 of them and they are both this way.The squelch control isn’t great either. It has to be turned up 1/2 way or more to quiet 1-2 units of static. And it is very “jumpy”.Bottom line it’s a great radio with a bad display. I hope Uniden can resolve the issue going forward.
4,Works good. Was here on time. Wish the beep could be turn down some but it not all that bad.and with wireless mic it dont beep on it just the cb speaker has it .as right now i like it good buy..
4,Great overall radio. Takes some getting used to with the menu. Does not have much power but has great sound. Also handy that it is a little smaller than a full sized radio.
1,I have had radios (CB's SSB's and FM) for over 40 years without a problem.This radio broke that trend.Transmit power = 2 watts should be 4Display was poor in the beginning then became intermittent and finally totally failed.Good job Uniden.I won't buy anything they make again.
5,This radio is known for producing very clear audio broadcasts . And it produces spot on frequency even on SSB. These are the two biggest reasons I got it. I know this from researching it before purchase. And sure enough after installing it in my truck everyone keeps talking about how clear I sound. Though if youre looking for a radio that you can turn the power up on this one isnt it. Its extremely FCC compliant.Get yourself a 20 watt external speaker some kind of whip antenna type (longer the better) highly shielded coax cable and get SWRs set as low as possible to broadcast and recieve as far as possible. The saying goes for clarity its the radio and microphone (Astatic noise cancelling mic is great). And for distance its the antenna coax SWRs being low and power level that dictates distance of transmit.
5,I've been searching around for weeks for a replacement radio for my truck at workm. I recently stopped at a local cb shop and they highly recommended this radio. Not only does this radio have a compact design for small places it also has an enhanced recieve when listening to other users. The digital face allows great visibility with multiple colors to fit your style. And the mic that it comes with is a noise canceling mic which is great! That's why I give this radio a 5 star review I think it's time to get it!!! And also this radio has voice enhancement to give the user the best clean sounding radio when transmitting. With this radio having the upper and lower side bands it allows users to also communicate a bit further with side band users. Now it's time to scrape together some change to buy this radio 😂😂😂 I will highly recommend to anyone to buy this
3,This is more of a review of an answer in the Q and A section.  A gal asked about AM vs SSB and the answer was complete nonsense.  The "expert" who answered the question either has no idea what he's talkng about or lying through his teeth.  SSB and conventional AM are BOTH AM modulation. A conventional AM signal (like the one in the AM band in your car radio) has three components--a carrier wave and two side bands. The carrier wave is between the sidebands and carries no information. All the information (voice) is in the sidebands.  SSB stands for Single Side Band.  The transmitter suppresses both the carrier and one sideband which theoretically allows all the power output to be transmitted in one sideband thereby theoretically tripling the power output because it is not shared among two sidebands and a carrier.  SSB is more efficient because the carrier and one sideband is suppressed.  While it may be true that weak signal SSB can be intelligible where conventional carrier transmission is not--by no means will it allow you to communicate nationwide unless skip conditions exist--and then the conventional AM radio will do the same.  thing.  To state that SSB will allow the user to communicate over vast distances where the conventional AM will not is an absolute lie.
3,After 3 years it’s getting difficult to deal with the flaws. About  year after I got this radio it would occasionally change channels when I’d key up. Now it’s getting worse almost every time I’ve keyed the mic it changes channels the display is losing channels.
3,Cool radio but you can't see the screen in daylight..I have it mounted in the dash and it's hard to see
1,After purchasing new on Amazon the radio arrived and the display (as so many have pointed out) is UN-USALBE IN DAYLIGHT. Works fine at night but you just can't see it during daylight hours therefore I returned it to Uniden: they changed the display and returned it: WITH NO IMPROVEMENT. I still can't use it in the day!  Now that's crappy service.In this picture the radio set at it DAY 15 which is its "brightest" display level and the color blue which is the brightness of the 7 colors.Don't make my mistake: if you purchase one of these radio's test it well within the Amazon return date limit because other then returning it Amazon it's a lost cause...
5,This is one of the best CB radio models to come on the market from uniden in a long time.  Great receiver lots of options the built in SWR function is nice so you can see if your antenna system is working properly the scan function is nice.  Display options are nice too.  The only thing I don’t like is the annoying beep that it chirps out every time you rotate the channel knob.  Overall a great radio.  This might be a collectors item when they stop making them.
3,How this radio got through quality control without testing it in real world conditions like using it during daylight for mobile use is pathetic.  Brand new radio set to day or night with contrast and brightness levels set to 15 and the screen is not legible during daylight mobile use.
3,This is a great radio and a poor radio a the same time. Bells and whistles galore. Transmits well at prescribed power; receiver is just ok. The microphone is toy quality and broke immediately. The digital display is nice but really is a pain in the a%$ to use. I find the dial method faster more intuitive and easier to use. You will forever be searching for the correct button. Would I buy again? Probably not. KISS method works well for radio design.
3,Product works fine but the display leaves much to be desired.
1,I used this once in a while within the first year. It's now 1 year and 1 month old and the Weather recieve is now intermittent and goes out completely. I'm disappointed as I really like the radio scan features and good sounding reports I get with the CB transmit. I think there is a design flaw on the Weather receiver part as it's not a true VHF receiver. The circuitry in this part of the radio is most likely prown to heat and failure. I pick up only one of the seven channels an get no weather alearts. It just receives the audio but will not decode the Weather stream. Since it's after the one year warranty I would have had to pay for labor as only parts has a two year warranty. I bought a SquareTrade Warranty so they will be fixing the radio for me under their warranty. It pays to buy the extra warranty for this particular radio.UPDATE: The insurance repair department says that the weather portion of the radio is unrepairable and will issue me a refund for the full purchase price. Read the reviews on this radio and you'll see it has several problems that will develope in time so even thou it looks good and has extra nice features it's not durable. Expect problems and buy the extra warranty as most problems will be after a year of owning and using this radio. I'm sad because I really like this radio so I hope the manufacturer in Vietnam takes notice and re-invents this radio.
4,comes well packaged nice face dials and displayMicrophone has a "cheap" feel to it but for the price I think it is a great deal.Thinking of getting a second one to set up a home base station.
4,A cure for disabling the beep is out. You just have to Google it. I love this radio. Just make sure you get it tuned. Some 980's am&ssb power setting might be off.  It stays on frequency.
5,Nice radio. Got mine tuned dk 2.5w swing 17w AM perfect to drive my 1 2290 x 4 2879 amp 750w
5,works great and looks great in my wrangler
5,Good radio no complaints here. Installed into the dash of a 05 f250 with a 3 ft firestik on the toolbox.
2,For all the razzle-dazzle colors Unjden missed it for a display suitable for use in a vehicle during the day. The display cannot be read without practically putting your face in it on a sunny day even at maximum contrast and brightness. Looks great in a not so bright area but not practical for everyday vehicle use. I have other types of 2-way vehicle radios and even though they not all the color selections (why are they even needed?)  they are easily readable day or night. I would not have bought this radio if I knew how poor the display is.
1,I understand why this product is no longer available many of the units have a screen that is unreadable during the day. I wish I had looked at product forums I would then have found out it is a common problem. Uniden supposedly replaced my unit and it is exactly the same unreadable.Their telephone support suggested I build some sort of cover to shade it during the day...... seriously?The support supervisor said Uniden won't do anything about it So I am stuck with a $130 CB radio that I can only use at night.I will never buy anything from Uniden ever again and if asked about Uniden will provide honest feedback on my experience.They sell an unusable product and don't stand behind what they sell.
1,Worked good until it started intermitenly stopped working right. First it would randomly not transmit. Then it would randomly turn off. Then it would randomly not turn on sometimes requiring hitting it around. It beeping gets anoying too. Uniden is ripping people off with this unit.
5,I am a Wagon Master for Caravanas de Mexico who run RV caravans into mainland Mexico. This is the first season we have required CB's. I chose this as our recommended unit. The range is good but its small size also enables people who only want to use it temp to sit it upside down on their dash and do a temporary install. The only complaint I have is that the dispaly is difficlt to see in daylight and that it is easy to change the channel if you brush it. Apart from that it is great. When I paired it with the Wilson 5000 magnetc mount antenna it was perfected tuned.
2,Seemed like a great buy: Priced right feature packed well reviewed. After a couple of months I noticed some of the numbers weren't displaying fully. I'd be missing the lower half of a '2' or part of the '0' that sort of thing. Then the finer display components like signal strength were invisible. When turned on at night it looks great but then fades out again. During the day it's hopeless. Can't see the receive strength unable to calibrate SWR as you can't see the signal strength. Disappointed.
1,When I first bought the Uniden Bearcat 980 40-Channel SSB CB Radio .. I could barely see it in daylight... NOW after a YEAR it is going out completely... this seems to be a common problemThe worse part is that they changed the warranty from 2 years to 1 year ... ( gee i wonder why )DO NOT BUY THIS UNITAlso there website says repair  is  $69 flat rate... customer service on the phone says $89 flat rate ...DO NOT BUY UNIDEN...They have 28 complaints and a "F" rating with the BBB
2,As stated by another reviewer Uniden does not provide any support for their product. Although I have not been able to find anyone who uses sideband I cannot rate it on the performance of that function. What I can complain about is I had two of these radios and both times  when I plugged in the radio to an external speaker and used it that way for a while I removed the external speaker and the internal speaker both units completely no longer work. I have to use the radio with an Extertal speaker or I will have no audio at all. I think I will move over to a galaxy 959 or 949. Problem with that radio after buying on Amazon I didn't use it till two months later when I got assigned my own truck and the audio on that which normally is crystal clear is  virtually unreadable. I do not have the invoice to return it so I must find a radio shop to repair it  if it is repaiable for the money. At that time I will Have it peaked and tuned. Maybe I'll add 75  watt booster on the back otherwise just go out and buy a Generall Lee or other compatible 10 m/11 m radio from a reputable radio shop. If you are looking for a basic unit and don't need sideband I recommend the old cobra  29 classic.
1,Great idea however the cb  faceplate does not light up bright enough to be able to see in the daytime and after less than two months of use the faceplate at dimmer settings seems to have issues with the display being able to be read because of some sort of an issue and to top it all off when I paid for this radio to Amazon is not what they're advertising it for today what little time I spent on it it did great it was peaked and tuned I'm sure that helped it out a lot and it was professionally installed she looking for a single sideband radio put to the Galaxy line if you can do without the weather radio really wished this Radio had done better
2,After one year of use the digital display stopped working.  After one year of use the radio stopped working completely.  For the price I think one year of use is poor quality!
5,Great unit I have been working with CB's since I was a kid back in the 70's and this is a great unit for the price and look and what it has to offer SSB plus weather and PA makes for a great radio. If your looking for a great deal and a fun radio this is the one I would recommend.
5,A great product from Uniden. This unit comes out of the box ready to talk. No need to go trying to mod this and that and most certainly no need to go hauling it off to the Golden Screwdriver hack CB shops. This radio with its SMT(surface mount technology) is not meant to be tampered with. Why try to improve on perfection? There are tons of videos on YouTube of these Golden Screwdriver  shops doing this mod and that mod. Just smoke and mirrors with outrageous meter numbers while lifting hard earned cash from your pocket!!!! Buy the radio leave it as it comes and enjoy for years of trouble free service......
2,I really like the design which is why I've twice purchased this model.Both after a year just stopped transmitting. They continued to receive but no output. Tried changing out the mic (on both). Finding someone who is willing to repair a surface mount board for a reasonable price isn't always easy. So I've given up in uniden. Which is sad because I really like this radio.
1,The lighting  was only lighting up half the numbers and I had only had it for six months at that time but the really bad issue is the volume went out at 5 months of having it. I would never buy it again and it certainly isn’t worth the money you pay for it.
5,I bought this CB radio through Amazon and have been using it for what - two months?  It works perfectly fine.  The only annoying thing about the radio (and it's really not that bad) is - the radio beeps when changing channels.  I have been using it long enough now that I don't even notice it.  I use a Wilson 1000 magnet mount antenna.  Nice radio love the digital display and it looks great.  Thx.  Paul
5,This is a great radio. I had an echo board put in it and have been told it sounds like a lot bigger radio. I will be buying another. The Bluetooth mic is awesome also.
3,Thought it was new but telling by the scratched up screen used or refurbished
1,By the time I purchased an antenna cable mounting bracket and installed the unit I was 2 days late for a return. The display doesn't function and I receive no transmissions. The only thing that works is the Weather Radio feature.
2,Not happy at all.  Display is very dim (and turned up all the way) and there was even a finger print on the INSIDE of the unit face. (Can't be wipes off) this is ridiculous . I want a refund!
5,Get real peoplethis radio is $120 dollsI think it is awsome for price..bought cb s three times the pricehad to have aligned to even talk on 1st...980 dead on frequency out of box...Don t know what some people expectfor this pricebut great rigand for those say not tunable...Taking it to truck stop dummiesvery easy to tweak...
3,Loud beeps with any control changes.  I mean LOUD!
5,Love it!
1,Look at pics showing terrible viewing angle. If you are riding as a passenger you cannot see display at all.
5,I received it on time and it works well..
5,I was kind of puzzeled at some of these reviews untill my wife pointed out to me that many of them were for the 880. I guess thats what they mean by look at the fine print I think its just old age. My review will come soon after Ive had time to play with all the options. Out of the box it looks good.
5,great radio
1,I never got it to work. Tried different cables and antennas. Haven't heard a peep. I can get squelch static and weather station but that's it. But it looks cool.
5,This CB is everything it claims to be. Works great good reception and transmission. The color change for day and night is awesome. The scan function is very handy as well as the weather band.
1,bought two of these this year. despit glowing reviews it is a piece of crap.  both have stopped transmitting for no reason.  do not buy this uniden radio. review update.  it is still a piece of crap. had it repaired. failed again. finals failed first due to bias voltage being too high from factory.  now the volume/squelch control power on potentiometer has failed. uniden refuses to provide a part number for replacement.  have been unable to cross reference part to anything. local parts warehouse has had same results from uniden and trying to find part.  maybe i just got the  bad one i dont know. either way the radio isnt worth the trouble. no support from manufacturer. all they have to say about it is send it to us for repair not warranty  or buy another one.
1,get it and it worked for 3 weeks send it in for repair and it took 3 months to get it back with no communcations from the company. after I got it back it worked another month now its sitting in a box of junk
1,I have buy this unit just to try up and  honestly it's a piece of junk no matter what you do you would not be able to tune it up.  He's perfect if you want to play with your kids around a half a mile range other than that don't waste Your money.
5,Brought however as of yet I have not installed the products. Based on brand awareness I am confident all will be fine. The packaging was excellent and the contents were all included as packaged and agreed to. Will follow up after the install.
5,Calibration was very easy (watching YouTube helps) very clear sounding and transmitting. Lots of options and features a must for anyone on the fence about getting this.
5,Still brand new in the box. Used once and put back into the box! Supposedly there are mods now but I have yet to see one in person only on youtube. The super duper king chip mod or something. I am from Missouri the show me state. As a regular CB Single Sideband radio I guess it is okay for $125.oo -$130.oo + (when purchased).
5,so far I do like all the features but I live close to a major highway and got but one radio check. I might need to replace the brand new firestick. the SWR is set on both internal as well as external checks. weather station comes in crystal clear.love the internal SWR cal but not sure about why I cant receive a lot of conversations. Are truckers using CB's Still?
5,It did the trick
5,Great radio. Enjoying the wideband feature.
5,Everything is great don’t have no dislikes
5,I like everything so far. All parts are there will install tomorrow in my motorhome. Crossing my fingers that I got A Good One with no display issues. $169 decent price for the highest rated unit 980 SSB 🤞
5,Exelente inversión y lo utilizo para comunicarme a la casa cuando salgo....
5,Works great!
5,Overall best radio for the price and I have had many.  Good quiet receive too.
1,Ive had this model and the 1 below it. SUCK!I went with a president mck ssb. Been around for yrs and great reviews. Ibwas going to grt this model again sincr half my screen went out. Nooope great shelf piece tho this now is.
5,
5,I'm happy with this radio with one exception the display is difficult to read during daylight.
5,Great Value SSB CB. My 3rd Uniden radio. This one is the best so far.
5,Liking this radio. I ordered a 2 yr asurion insurance policy in case I have trouble with the display screen as stated in other peoples posts. I have talked to the west coast of Europe on this rig on single side band. I recommend this radio
5,I really like this radio.
5,Easy to use on the road and has all the features I would expect from a rig at the price range very nice.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 So far this radio has exceeded my expectations. I am using it as a base station so it shouldn’t take too much abuse. Everything about it especially the SSB is great for the price. Everything that is except for the annoying beep!!! I have seen many reviews (especially on YouTube) that state there is no way to turn it off but there is! If you think it’s annoying too you can turn it off by pressing and holding the ANL/NB button for a couple seconds as you can see in my video.  Time will tell if this Uniden 980 will hold up. If this review still stands unedited then it’s still holding up. If it does end up having problems any at all updating this review is the first thing I’m coming to do.
5,He loved it
3,As a ham operator wanting to get a CB rig for road safety went with this model because it has SSB. Push button menus were annoying to operate the box is big for a CB the comments about the brightness are right - even at the brightest hard to see during day and ok at night. The Weather band is useful as well as Weather alert (got one even in Canada just before a Thunderstorm warning!). The built-in SWR was not very accurate which could lead to you blowing your finals. Mic seemed good but oversized. Speaker volume was OK. Scanning nice but RFI would often break the scan so constantly adjust squelch and RF Gain - annoying. WORSE PART: on a dummy load and meter it would barely put out 3 watts (3.5 t to 4 is target) on AM and never over 8 or 10 on SSB (supposed to do 12). Plasicy feeling knobs too cheap for a rig this price. Make sure you test it extensively before deciding to keep it. Returned it and got a Pro520XL which is 4 times cheaper. Wasn't right for me.
5,Many mixed reviews. The radio works as it should... Invest in getting a good antenna and you will be truly happy. The beep can turn off and the settings are very easy to use. Spend the time to read the manual... I worked DX running just this radio on 38LSB from Nova Scotia into the USA & Various parts of Canada... BUT get a good antenna! I'm running a Wilson 1000 and these 2 together - you will be impressed.
1,J'ai un problème avec l'affichage de l'écran. par température froide l'affichage est très clair et je peut lire tout les chiffre sur l'écran. Mais par température chaude tout les chiffres ne sont plus visible meme a l'ombre !! Gros problème de conception de l'écran
5,Read the Installation and Operation Manual before you install this radio as if you don't it will be a problem to use.Installed with a Cobra magnetic mount antenna has a SWR of 1.1 on all Channels. Output is maxed out without any boosters
4,I use this fun little gem of a radio for a base CB indoors. It's a feature rich radio that performs great right out of the box but its weakness is the radios display brightness. Even when it is set to full brightness it is not bright enough for most Sunny conditions.
4,Nice radio and I like the weather channels. Nice clear SSB on both transmitt and receive. The receive is a bit noisy but still pulls in the weak staions well. Dispaly is a little hard to read from certain angles. I sent my first one back because of the display and the replacement acted the same way. Later I find from other users that this is normal issue with this model. Overall i like the radio for the price I paid for it.
5,This is my first radio so I can't really say much other than it works very well.Having SSB is a great option as well.A friend of mine has his amateur radio - ham license and an array of radios and also says it is a very good radio as well so I have to say no complaints.Very easy to set up and use with the digital screen and buttons.  Menu is easily to run through.  Color options are a great feature to help glare while in vehicle.
4,I read other reviews before purchasing. My complaint is the same as others you can’t read the screen from an angle. This renders the product useless in a motor vehicle.Fortunately for a stationary application it’s AWESOME ! and that’s where mine is.
5,Amazing quality! My man and I off-road so I bought this for his birthday as well as the wireless radio mic that goes with it. Both were easy to set up and work flawlessly.
5,I have had one since they came out always good products from Uniden. The new one I bought is kind of weird all the weather channels pick up my local police and fire and I don't know why.
5,My unit did need a little peeking as AM output was less that 4 watts and SSB was way less than 12watts. Receive is very sensitive and when using SSB  I turn the rf gain down a little to reduce background noise. I recommend this unit as I am pleased with mine.
4,Connected to a good dipole vertical I get outstanding performance especially on SSB. No problems when skip on. Local CB band traffic  is almost extinct so its a good point to point communications receiver. Added a little linear which has really opened up SSB when conditions good. Has made interested once again in the CB band.
5,Great CBLove the weather stations.Good options for colour on display which helps night/day driving.Simple to use and set-up.I wouldn't bother buying a seperate SWR meter. I'm sure this electronic device has enough technology in it to give you a much better reading than a $20.00 SWR meter.
5,Very fast shipping easy to use. My husband is happy too he can watch movies with subtitles on TV. I'm exercising using the USB connected with tv so I use it as a remote.
5,Awesome deal and very fast delivery  Got this one marked used and it didn't even look like the box was opened. Radio worked ok out if the box but really needed a pro tune up to get the most out of it.
4,if it wasn’t falsely advertised when I bought it I would give it 5 stars easy to set up and works great
5,Uniden quality scan mode SSB functions great cracked the case board set up shows good quality control pots aligned straight no visible corrections or deletions one of the best CB/SSB Radios on the market today.
5,Great CBLove the weather stations.Good options for colour on display which helps night/day driving.Simple to use and set-up.
5,I like the scan feature weather channel is great i have the same set up as a base station and one in my truck. Love it !!
5,J'adore ce cb laje regrette pas mon achat.Plusieur option plutôt sympa.Je recommande ce produit la.
5,I like that it can scan channels and change colour background
5,Has a lot of features to get used to compared to my old 48GTL but is a great performing radio.
5,Seams to be fragile but my truck has close to no vibration . Pair with a little Wil and it works great
4,Livraison très rapide. Il s'agit bien du Bearcat 980 SSB.. Comme sur la description. Très bon appareil plein d'options.
5,Love the radio and I'm going to order another one for the house.
1,Is not calibrated...after hours of fiddling and money on adaptersantennas ect...tried another old cb and it works 110% dont believe the hype
5,Delivery and material super!
5,Le meilleur à ce prix.  Tous fonctionne #1
5,Great radio awesome sideband capable and of course easy to install
5,merci
5,Great radio for the money. Display is easy to navigate and use. I love the back light.
5,Great item as described.
5,Good radio. Study the manual as it is a bit hard to set up .But overall a great value
5,Très bon produit qualité prix
5,I like this cb because it was bought for my husband and he enjoys it so much . Great bang for the buck and I'd recommend this to anyone .
4,Sorry about the delay thanks.Got the radio in and tried it out and I can say I am happy with it.
5,Looks very easy to use
5,Solid little SSB CB. Fair Price
5,I wanted an easy to use Radio  with the sideband feature . and the uniden gives me both . its a nice Radio .

5,Very fast shipping  great cb for the money
5,The display is big and full of information the scan feature is good it can scan memory channels or all channels.the weather channels are nice to have on the road. found the microphone not so good . ButIf you buy the wireless microphone for this radio like i did you will love it . it is a perfict match for this radio.yogi bear approved.!!!
2,the led display started crapping out in 2 months  should have never wasted the $
4,Back lights not very bright even after going into set up and picking brightness. Does sound good and sets up easy. Make sure you get good antenna this always makes or breaks your radio.
5,Love the scan function wish I had had this one years ago! Uniden has always been my CB preference and this one doesn't disappoint.
3,this radio sucks in out put power is only putting 2.75 watts should be 4 wats very disappointed in out put power.This is a add on to this review on Oct 14 2019 your radio is now at a lower price to what a paid for the price a paid was $185.16 plus taxes  the new sale price is $148.12 do you think this rite amazon and should i give  a discount of $37.04 will wait for answer.
3,Received defective unit.Power output on AM was 4.3w (0.3 above legal limit)Power output on LSB and USB is 7.3w (not the advertised 12w.)Frequency for AM and LSB is a bit off but still quite usable.  Frequency for USB is off by about 30hz which messes up voice readability.  This offset is 50% greater than the advertised frequency tolerance.Weather channel reception sensitivity is quite bad.  Even with a great outside antenna the weather channel is very noisy and cuts out about every 2 seconds.  To compare my hanhelds receive the same weather broadcasts crystal clear with just the supplied short antenna.From what I can tell my unit should have failed the quality check but somehow made it to me.Edit: I have received an exchange from Amazon.  AM is very clear.  USB and LSB are 4/5 with a slight hum.  USB/LSB are now 9.5w not quite 12w but good enough for a 154$ CAD CB.
1,Update: Screen is heat fading after less than a year to basically be unusable. Second Uniden to fail personally and have a few buddies running them that are doing the same. Uniden support is all but useless as they want it shipped to them across the border on my dime. Between the downtime and price it's more work than the radio is worth at that point.Great radio albeit I have seen better prices elsewhere. Only issue I have with it is the screen is a bit hard to read from some angles. Perfect barefoot radio if you don't plan to try tweaking it or if you intend to feed a small linear (in regions they are compliant)
5,Trabaja bien se ve bien hay que acostumbrarse a su calibración y yo encontré en YouTube tutoriales para ajustarse.
1,This CB was great for 3 months than for no reason half the screen went out and it's now impossible to see anything except the  channels.
5,Trabaja muy bien llegó en muy buenas condiciones el paquete tiene muy buena recepción de señal muy bueno
1,I was unlucky enough to receive a product that didnt work. I don't like this and amazons return policy states that it will be replaced by Jan 2019....I am honestly more disappointed with amazon rather than the Ghetto Retailer who is selling faulty devices. I would recommend another retailer as for the product unfortunetly not used but build quality seems very solid.
1,BonjourCe CB ne transmet pas à une puissance de 4 watts...... Mais plutôt 2.8 Watt - 3 Watt maximum.Ce Radio a toutes les options possibles mais très fragiles en fait de construction. Le radio est esthétiquement bien fait.Mais n’est pas construit pour la rigueur de nos froid ou/et chaleur. Problème de conception de l'écran. Les chiffres ne sont plus visibles lors d'une température élevée.La fréquence pour l'USB  a une déviation/erreur  d'environ 33 Hz ce qui perturbe la lisibilité de la voix. Ce décalage est supérieur de à la tolérance de fréquence annoncée.Le CB Uniden Bearcat 980SSB  ne fonctionne plus après 9 mois. A peine utiliser a quelque reprise.Maintenant Je dois vérifier si Amazon va respecter la Garantie ou Uniden.Merci !
2,Very nice CB that works very well. Good display and clear and loud sound quality. The S/RF meter seems to be a little bit low when I compare with two other Cobra CB's I owe. SWR also seems to indicate lower values. SSB works very well. The beep is indeed loud and annoying especially at night.  But overall this CB is still a great value.UPDATE:  Unfortunately the CB broke after not even 6 months usage.  Was not using it much but one day when I turned it on it got very hot at the back and started smelling burned.  Turned it off and disconnected it right away.  The CB is now fried will not receive nor transmit anymore.  Back at using one of my more than 15 years old Cobra CB. Very disappointed with this outcome.  Changed star rating from 4 to 2.
5,It’s easy to use an works great and looks great also.
4,Fonctionne parfaitement.C est regrettable que la façade ne soit pas en verre.J ai des petites grafignes après 2 jours juste en essuyant la poussière avec la main.Le son est excellent et les aussi dans un haut parleur externe.
5,5 minute pour installation
5,Good service and excellent value. Good equipment. Used for communication.
1,RF main power failure after less than 6months of use. Shouldn't happen on a 1.5year old radio. I don't recommend this unit.
2,Muy poco alcance
5,Good price
1,The radio itself is excellent.  The customer support is very questionable! I purchased this radio from Amazon Canada over 2 years ago. Not long ago it stopped working as transmitter although the receiving part is unaffected.  To repair the radio - it has to be send to the company address in the USA. The problem is that Uniden doesn't ship its serviced products back directly outside of the USA; to Canada in my case. I NEED AN INTERMEDIARY IN THE USA!!!Forget about it! I will never buy any Uniden product again!!!!!Thank you.
4,Display is hard to see in the Daytime. Was hoping to use the Red Color but impossible to see in the Daytime. Other that that Nice Radio. Dash mounted mine .... sound is nice and clear.
