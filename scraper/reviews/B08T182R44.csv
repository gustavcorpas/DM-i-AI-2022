5,UPDATE: WARNING this could drain your car battery if you have an older car. I left it in for 3 days and my car didn't start the first time during that whole time LOL. I was super worried but once I unplugged this charger my battery slowly recharged again and now my car starts every time with no issues. This is still a great car charger but beware if you have an old chrysler 300 2007 you're gonna have a headache. Just make sure you unplug it when the car is off. This issue is my cars problem and has nothing to do with the product but it's something to be aware of.-Original review:Does exactly what it's supposed to do and fits nice and sturdy. My husband can charge his phone super fast and I can charge my older phone in the other port. Haven't had a good car charger in years. (:
5,Got this because I game on my phone and my old charger would only keep me at my current % not charge my phone while playing. This charger works great and super fast
5,Most car chargers are so slow there not worth using! This was a great buy and it's a quick charge
5,Recommended
5,This is indeed a super fast charger. It charges my phone in the same time as my home charger.
5,Very good
5,Product stopped working properly after 2 weeks..
5,nice
5,A fast charger that really works in my car. I have a 5G Samsung smartphone.
5,Definitivamente el mejor que he comprado. La carga súper rápida es en el C. Comprare otro
5,Charges fast for a car charger best car charger I have ever had and it works for my Samsung galaxy s20 ultra just as good as my home charger
5,I have had this product for about two months. I have used it in my car once on a long distance trip to charge my phone. It is a fast charger as advertised. Seems to be strong and well made.
5,Absolutely a fantastic buy super fast charges my Galaxy S21+. Keep in mind you have to use USB C to USB C Cable!! Have one in both of my vehicles.
5,Best fast car charger I’ve ever had! Finally I can keep my phone charged on trips. If I stop to go for a hike or take pics I no longer worry about battery draining. I plug it in when I get back in car and it charges incredibly fast. Totally with it!
5,It charges your phone fast. I’m satisfied with this charger. So far so good.
5,Works great cuts my charge time in half!
5,I have a Samsung S22+ and I wanted a charger that would put it in superfast charge mode just like its wall charger does this charge does that. Works great for me.
4,Perfect for my vehicle love the durability and long cord. Easy to use
5,The first one worked so well I bought a second for our other car.  It charges as fast as any Super Fast wall charger.  A few months in and no issues.  Recommended.
5,This little charger with charge cable combo works so well we ended up buying 2nd one for my wife's car.It charges fast and the blue LED light is not too bright so the light doesn't impair night time driving.
5,Bought 2 of these one for car other for motorcycle super fast charging on my z fold 3
5,This product exceeded my expectations. Great product
5,I gotta say Ive been pleasantly surprised by this little charger. It Super Fast charges my Note 20 Ultra 5G no problem using any of my 2015 explorers DC charging ports. Im tempted to get a few more of these so that my wife and I can charge both phones at Super fast speeds if needed with out the need to move chargers from 1 vehicle to the other. I really like the USB C cable it came with. Its a good quality cable and will most likely last a long time especially if its left with the charger and not moved around a lot to be used for other things (I know people like to use cables for different purposes like connecting to a laptop or TV of they find a good cable Ive been guilty of it my self). This cable can probly stand up to being bounced around if need be but Ive become more of an advocate for having a quality cable for each task you need to help extend life of the cables. Im not hard on them but instead of getting 3 years Im not getting 5 to 6 (with the excption of the cables my 6 year old uses for her tablet lol). Overall this chargee does a great job. I go from 20% to 80% in no time at all. The cord that comes with it is more than long enough to reach passanger side or 2nd row bucket seats with out needing to move the charger to the rear DC charge port on the center console. I can keep it blugged into the the DC port inside the center consoles storage compartment. While charging can create a SMALL ammount heat whith the in CD phone mount I have I can point on of my vents at the phone if I feel the need (which I have yet to do) to cool it off. I would 100% reccomend buying this compact little car charger. For the price theres nothing out there that can beat it for quality and performance.
5,Love this
5,I've been using this dandy little dual USB/Type C car charger for about 3 months now and I am more than happy with it! Not only does the charging cable fit snuggly but my phone actually fast charges with it. The USB port works well. My only negative which is really more of a wish than a negative is that it had 2 of the C ports. I recommend 100%.
4,Not quiet as fast as home charger but still a lot faster then most about an 1.5 hours from a dead battery. Galaxy S22
5,Was just as advertised. Bought it for my new Samsung S7PLUS Tablet but I got the car charger 1st and tried it with my old tablet and it didn't charge it any fasterso I was ready to send it back because this is the 4th or 5th "FAST" charger I bought and none of them put out the promised 2 amps. But my new tablet came and 1st I charged it with the factory charger in the house and it was semi fast at charging the new tablet. Then the next day I had run it down to 35% power and hooked it to this new 12V charger and was completely charged in well under an hour and the cord and tablet never got hot or even warm. So I would recommend it to everybody. Was refreshing to buy the charger and it worked better than advertised. Worth twice what I paid for itBuy it with no reservations. Thanks......The Dude
5,Works great i have 1 in each of my cars
3,Bought this as a solution for work truck. Every going as expected. There was a decrease in charging  and eventually stopped working all together. Replaced the cord good as new. Ideally the cord would last more than a couple months
5,I usually travel a lot for my line of work and use my phone constantly. I'm one of those people that enjoy their phone being fully charged at all times in case of an emergency. This charger definitely charges my Samsung Galaxy Fold 3 quickly even on short trips. It beats my old car charger by a landslide.Pros:- Fast Charging- Blue light helps my see the plugs at night- Value for the moneyCons:- None that I can think of (Which says a lot considering I'm extremely picky)End Results:I would definitely recommend this charger to my friends/family/others seeing as I use it daily.
4,Real supercharger
5,I have had this for about 8 months now and initially it worked great! Lately I have noticed that my phone had not been charging.  The plug in is fine however the cable has randomly stopped working. I replaced the cable with one that I had in the house and all is good.
5,Best supercharger!
5,This charger works very well for my S21 Ultra phone an the price ain't bad either.
5,It looks very expensive and cool! It was worth the price and im glad I didnt pay an arm and a leg for a car charger. I recommend buying this to save money and if you want it to be for your Samsung galaxy s22 ultra! I know i did and it's a super charge. My phone charges really fast on the road. No issues at all.
5,Does what it says  supports Super Fast charging in one port and one fast charging. Ours came with a charger cable so Great value 👌 got a second one for our other car.
5,NOT A FAST CHARGER BUT GOOD DEAL FOR THE PRICE.
5,Very fast charge..love it
5,These are amazing initial numbers and it does activate "Super Fast Charging". It blew my older Samsung QC charger out of the water...but I do have questions about long term durability.The official Samsung one is sold out everywhere except on eBay it seems so I'm giving this a try. Will update if anything goes weird with it in the futureInterestingly the Ampere app detects this as a Samsung charger so not sure if it has a Samsung chip in it or why that is happening
4,The head charger works really good but the wire itself for some reason stop working after 2 weeks that I bought it no damage to it it just stop working.
5,Super fast charging as says and holds up had mine for months still works great.
5,Super fast charge samsung galaxy A72
5,I was so close to spending more money on the 45 watt samsung car charger and I'm so happy I went with this product instead. My main concern was getting super fast charging for my galaxy s22 ultra and this product does it. At no point did the charger or my phone get hot. Overall I'm very satisfied.
3,Takes a long time to charge the phone
5,I needed a car charging device that accommodates both a USB and USB-C and this device fits my needs.
5,'Nuff said.
5,Good quality charger.
3,Only the C port is fast changing
5,Fastest charger I've ever seen. Only issue is the rubber base is rather large. If the device case has a small port the large rubber end may not let it plug in. Other than that it's excellent.
5,Has to be the best car charger I have purchase in years! Cord is durable and perfect length A+ Product and seller Super fast delivery!
5,I like it all only took me 1 hour to charge my phone
3,Great charger. Charged super fast and then one day all of the sudden it stopped charging. Not very happy.
5,Extremely fast. Durable. Inexpensive. I got 2.b
4,If you have used multiple chargers on newer Android phones (specifically Samsung) you probably know there's a difference in charging ability. The newer phones are capable of "Super Fast" charging. The difference is significant. My previous car charger would only charge my Note 20 Ultra at the 'Fast' rate. This Binboubou (ridiculous name aside) charges 'Super Fast'. The difference is anywhere from 15-30 minutes from less than 10% to 100%.The charger was delivered quickly. It worked exactly as expected. And the blue light is cool looking. I'm happy with my purchase.
5,It works pretty good! I don'tget concern anymore if I forget to charge my phone at home
5,WORKS GREAT
5,I am very happy to report thisncharger is working well. The included cord is very sturdy and really nice
5,It super fast charge my Galaxy S21 ultra in less than 30 mins 70% from 20%.
4,No dislikes.
5,now that everything is going USB C its great to have both options in the car and the USB C cable with it is very good quality
5,I use this product in my vehicle so far its holding up well and charges superfast unlike other car chargers
5,very nice item works great
5,Amazing car charger. Super fast charges. Perfect for commuters
5,This charger is definitely worthwhile. Charges super fast!
5,This charger is awesome and fast...
5,Works great for our note 20 and Galaxy s21+
5,Charges my phone unbelievebly fast.
5,Buying electronics from unknown suppliers is always something of a gamble I think. In this case it paid off. This charger has worked perfectly. I like that it lights up so that I know immediately that I have plugged it in properly. (I always unplug it after completing a charge.) Furthermore when it said it was a fast charger it was absolutely telling the truth.
5,nice charger
3,It charges at standard fast speed ONLY; NOT Super-Fast as proclaimed in their ad along with my Samsung phone model which it should have charged at Super Fast.  Fast means a full charge at around 2 hours where Super Fast charges fully at about 1 hour 15 minutes.
5,Love the fact that the cable is heavy duty and the charger fits perfectly to the outlet have not needed to readjust at all
5,Product seems good. Looks as expected havent used it yet so I can't say how it works. Delivery was fast and packaged well.
5,This product is amazing and I would definitely purchase it again.
5,Been using this product everyday for 3 months and it's super fast charging would highly recommend
3,This product is great in the sense that is will fast charge. As a long distance driver. It will over heat and says it's charging but will not . You could be charging and lose charge at the same time. Have to unplug to let it reset and then it will charge.
5,This product is exactly as described.  I like it!
5,Quick charge it has a very nice blue glow.
5,A
5,Great charger. Does the job quick.
5,I bought this to charge my Galaxy A52 5G phone.  The charger works as specified.  Using the USB3 port the phone charges at 25 watts and using the USB2 port the charging rate is 15 watts.  The provided USB3 cord seems quite rugged and seems sturdy and well protected from accidental damage.  The idle power draw is only 10 Milliamperes when plugged in and not in use so it won't run down your car's battery is you accidentally forget and leave it plugged in for a couple of days.
5,So far I have not found anything that I dislike about the charger. It super fast charges my Samsung Note within 45 minutes. The cord is sturdy and comes with a rubber locking thing that wraps around the cord. The cord isn't that long but it's good enough for me. I suggest a longer cord but the one that came with it is good too.
5,I have had this charger two weeks. This charger is fast. Blue glowing light around the charger shows it's plugged in. When ordered didn't realize it had one USB port and one c- type port. The cord is c-type on both ends. Cord is sturdy braided cloth and long enough. Charged my phone super fast. So far so good. We'll see how well it holds up. I use it daily.
5,I have S22 plus works great
5,Me gusto mucho el producto en realidad SI carga en Super Fast Charger que es algo que otros productos te ofrecen y al final no se cumple.Recomendadisimo
2,Purchased less than 90 days ago and the cord has already stopped charging my phone. Not a happy camper. Will not buy again.
5,Cheaply made but serves its purpose. Charges as super fast on my A71 5G just like the original wall charger.
5,For the price well built and charged quickly.
5,I was so glad this came in time for our trip! It worked great in the car the length was long enough that I could use it from the dashboard or the back seat of the car which was nice so that when my husband had to charge his phone at the same time we could both do so. It also fits tight into my phone port which I was worried about so that's a great feature to the charger.
5,Love it and the charge is super fast!!
5,Exactly what I was hoping to relieve and it works perfectly well. Happy it came with a cord along with it to use.
5,I really needed small and slim charger that can charge my Nintendo switch doing driving.Also extra USB with quick charger for my iPhone to charge.I have been using for past 1 week andOverall it did charge switch and iPhone with no issue and it do glow in blue light which I thought it was handy using night to see.As bonus it comes with typeC cable which was very durable and thick cable which is very good quality than I thought.I would recommend this USB charger if you are looking for Type C port with USB for car use!
5,The first one was defective but the replacement works fine
5,That's what I was looking for and exactly what I got with this nice little charger.  Love it!  Ordered 3.Will update review in a few weeks/months.
5,Worked perfect plus it lights up blue to find it easier at night.
5,It was delivered quickly and it seems to be well made.
5,The absolute best car charger ever created. I can have my music playing using Bluetooth navigation running and still give me a full charge in about an hour from 15% (S21 ultra)
5,This is great! Charges super fast.
5,Charger works as described great buy
4,Better than what I had .
5,This is a very sturdy charger. My only complaint is that it's a bit hard to plug in and remove. But other than that very happy.
5,This guy does super fast charging on my S20 Ultra and the included usb-C cable is nice quality.A+ value for the price
5,Some people are complaining it doesn't work well that's because your phone doesn't support PD 3.0 or QC 3.0. So before purchasing this make sure your phone supports fast charging based on power delivery PD or quick charging QC.
5,This charger works well looks cool and charges everything really quickly.
5,As expected charges my Galaxy Note 20 Ultra with the same "Super fast" speed as the included wall charger does that my previous car charger does not.The cable feels durable so far appears to be a great value.The second port is traditional USB which is fine for my needs (other devices not same "quick charge" compatability).
5,Excellent Outlooking during the day time especially Cross Carbon Texture.  And Blue Illumination is very beautiful at night.  It is surely match in my Car.  Additionally there are both USB Type-C & Type-A.  USB Type-C built in "PD" function and USB Type-A built in "QC3.0" even "Compact Size".  Besides it is include USB Type-C Cable which looks Nice &Sturdy.  So it is just "Right" Car Charger for iPhone and other devices in my car!  So far I am satisfied!!
5,I like bcs it is fast charging which is very helpful. I like the design as well it looks pretty nice with the lights on blue.
2,Worked great super fast charging completely stopped working 31 days later. Shame was good while it lasted.
3,Sometimes work properly i mean sometimes provide fast and somethime regular charge
5,Perfecto justo lo que buscaba trabajo con el teléfono todo el día en doordash y nunca  aja de 100% compraré otro
2,The charger itself worked great. It had fast charging and would charge my phone fast. Unfortunately the durability was poor. I have only had it for a month or two and it broke down on me. I wouldn't recommend it for a long term charger.
5,The cords do not tangle. Super fast charges just like the Samsung-branded cables.
2,I drive a 2015 Toyota Avalon XLE Premium.... device wont stay in outlit..... have ro keep pushing in further in.... thats with all ports... Does super charge though! Using Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra
4,Light is too bright I don't use it because it's distractingly bright at night
5,I really liked this charger it charges fast.!
5,This charger is a beast charges my note20 fast better than my last one I had..
5,Super fast charges my phone perfectly.
5,It's charging in 100% rate for my Samsung s21 ultra phone.
5,good fast car charger
5,This car charger has works great for 3 weeks it real super charge my galaxy S20 and much quicker than my previous car charger the blue light is soft and makes it easier for me to find it since I do a lot of night time driving. The included USB C cord is surprise it fits the car charger and my phone well love it
4,Works as described
5,Not really a complaint but I killed my friends battery. Although I leave it plugged in constantly in my car. I would recommend unplugging it if you have an older car.
5,Saying that I'm driving from client to client a lot now and using my phone more the charger works awesome on my Samsung Note 20 Ultra with the fast charging capability.
3,Used it for a month and the tip at the bottom broke. Not durable at all.
5,
5,Very good charger.  Just make sure you unplug it when not in use.  It will last a long time for a charger.
2,Cord doesn't work.I plugged in my phone and it didn't charge. I tried different boxes and still nothing. I've yet to try the car charger. Will review once I have.
5,Super fast charge from your vehicle. Pretty straight forward.
5,This charger is fastbut I especially like the ability to use the extra cable to charge more items either in the front or second row of my SUV.  When charging one phone I can store the other cable out of the way.
5,Still going strong after 1 month. Super fast charged for samsung s21 ultra
5,Great product! Bought this for a trip and would have been happy if it sort of worked. Instead it of mediocre  it was great! Charged my phone fast and I listened to audio books without running the battery down.  Highly recommend.
2,It worked great when I first started using it. It would be unfair to say it lasted 2 months bc that's not the whole picture. It literally last like for 12 uses.  I always took care of it never dropped it. I had it in my car the whole time and would unplug it when not in use. And now it stopped working
5,I love it...it's defenetly a fast charger!!
5,Product  detail was accurate works great. Would buy the product  again when needed.
5,Looks durable and works as described. I like the carbon fiber look as well as being lit blue. The cable is very good and looks very nice. I give this 5 stars.
5,Is an aweso.e product. I use it every day.
5,Super fast charges as stated. So far so good.

5,Charges phone quickly and lovely blue light. Glad I purchased.
5,Works as advertised.  Very happy with DC Charger.

5,I totally recommend this product!!!!!
5,Carga rapido
5,Works great actually charges at the rate my wall charger does.
5,It's better in real life. Works perfect with Samsung S21ULTRA
1,I don't recommend this product after it cracked within the first 3 cracks

5,Poder de carga
5,Love it
5,Great product
5,This is a great charger for my S21 5G
5,Works great and charges my Galaxy S21 Ultra super fast.
1,I wanted a super fast charger for my phone to use in my car. I don't know if the one I got is defective but when I plug it in it says super fast charging but it charges slower than my non super fast charging charger. Currently I'm at 36% and it says "53 min until full" but at the rate that it charges it would probably take 8 to 12 hours.
5,Delivered on time. Great quality product. Thank you!
5,Easy to use
5,Durable fast charging adapter. Works perfect with my new Galaxy S21 Ultra. Must buy
5,Carga muy rápido y lo reconoce como original
5,Bright blue pretty cool sleek look! Great cable and the double port is awesome!
5,I loved it super fast change.
5,Bestt charger that I have ever purchased ... Very google quality
5,Worked great for Super Fast Charging for the Note 20 Ultra.
1,The cord failed after a week. The charger works great but I had to spend and additional $15 at a boslx store to be able to charge my phone.
5,The charger works as described
5,It gives a slow charge
5,it works well and fast
5,Good
5,Good product
5,Works as expected
1,This didn't last but just over 30 days so of course can't return it. It doesn't charge fast or hold a charge anymore. My husband's phone battery starting going down when plugged in
1,After about 6 charges the entire metal end of the charging cord came off! If that wouldn't have happened I probably would have rated 5 stars.....
5,Works great
1,broke eight weeks after purchase...connector comes loose. another garbage product sold by the new unfriendly Amazon. they refuse to return because the return window closed TWO  days ago. pathetic. Amazon is not focused on customer satisfaction anymore....too bad
1,I bought two of these. One quit working at 2-3 weeks the other lasted about a month. For a brief period it worked great with super fast charging then it just quit working.
1,Got it in January..stopped working in May. Used it sporadically so it wasn't overuse. Try another brand..maybe you'll have better luck.
4,Its sturdy
2,First times was charging properly then every time last longer to charge
1,I got it right out the box and plugged it into my car and it didn't work. Yes I've tried other cars as well.
2,Did not well while charging 2 phones on the sametime
1,Just use one month. Return window is 1 month .after 1 day return window closed is broken.
1,It only worked for a few hrs then it stop ... tried it in another car same thing maybe just the one I had didn't work but if it did it would have been perfect
1,Broke after 1 use
1,Fresh out of the box and it doesn't work. I've tried it in different cars with different cords and nope it does nothing. Ticked off bc now I have to find another.  Save yourself a headache.
1,Very durable and sturdy will last forever as neither my hubby or I can plug it in.
2,Had it for 2 months and it won't hold a constant charge.
4,This car charger works fine and charges quickly. Haven't had it long just hope it lasts.
1,Worked great for a few days but then would disconnect and now will not super fast charge. Would not recommend
1,The cord will not stay in the phone.  The charger once paired with a different cord is fine.
1,Feels thick and sturdy but stopped working after only a few months of light use. Junk
1,No matter how hard I try the cord will not stay in the device that plugs into the cigarette lighter..as I am driving it always seems to either pop out after I hit a pothole or it becomes loose and slides out on its own. It is not worth the price.
1,It did not work.
5,A true fast charger! Charges my s21 ultra in 1 hour
1,The provided cable does not work. Save your time and look elsewhere.
1,Not sure what happened but it just stopped working after 2 months.
1,Not good the cord it came with stopped working the first day
5,I bought this for my husband. It's common for him to forget to charge his phone so having a well functioning car charger has been beneficial. Unlike other car chargers that I've used this one actually charges the phone!!
5,It fits better in the car over the older chargers.  It is definitely a fast charger.
5,This item really works really good and charge very fast asbit says.
1,The first few days it worked great. After that the cords stop working.
1,melted down after couple uses cord got shorts in it within a week
1,Worked once with my s21.  Do not attempt with this phone
1,Unfortunately it stopped working after only two months.
1,Is burning the fuse in the car 2 times and smoking Don't buy
1,Didn't last a week just quit working
1,Slow charge
1,Only had this charger for about a month and it no longer works. Waste of money.
1,I have a Samsung A71 and have been searching for a "super" fast charging usb-c to usb-c  car charger just like the wall charger that came with the phone and lights up turquoise. All this charger does is charge in "fast" charging.
5,Definitely a must have I love this car charger!!
5,After a lot of unfortunate trial and error with other purchases of other similar USB-C "PD" car charger devices unlike the others that cost more THIS one actually utilizes "Super Fast Charging" (as opposed to just "Fast Charging" on my Samsung Galaxy S20+.  I also like the fact that the device lights up when inserted into the 12V port confirming that it's getting power.
5,Seems to be very good quality and is very attractive. My Galaxy S20FE charges in super fast mode on the the USB-C port with the included cable. Adding a cable on the USB-A port my Galaxy Tab A 10.5 (2017) charges in fast mode. I replaced the USB-C cable only to double the length and no problems. Compared to 110 volt chargers this is a better value by far.
5,I looked extensively for an inexpensive FAST phone charger for my Pixel 3a XL and found it with this unit.  Biggest problem since has been to find a good phone holder.  Strongly recommend this charger.  WalMart had one for $20 more but my phone would never enter Rapid Charging mode.
1,Doesn't work as fast charging. Its Showing fast but never work. Its take forever to charge a phone. Beware of this product. Poor quality
5,Many of the newer Android phones do super fast charging & this charger does this even if 2 things are charging simultaneously. I purchased 3 of them & my brother also has. Definitely recommend
5,The quality of the product is amazing. The length of the cord is perfect and it charges my (S20 ultra) super fast! 👌If you're unsure I'm sure for you DO IT! BUY IT!
5,Excellent fast 45 watt charger. Strong enough to charge MacBook Air.
5,I got this item because of the superfast charging claim.  So far this item works as described.  I will charge my phone from 4% to 60% in about 20 minutes (my commute home on a normal day).  I will be buying one for my husband's car as well.
5,Would buy again
5,Works as intended. The braided cord is durable and long.
5,El mejor cargador que he tenido me sorprende la carga super rápida. Excelente compra.
5,Good Quality and super fast charge
5,Works great in a mobile environment charges fast. Used with a Samsung Fold. It doesn't charge as fast as having it plugged in a wall unit but definitely faster than my previous run-of-the-mill charger.
3,The cord stopped working after a few weeks
5,Fast charger
5,Works great charges my phone quickly
5,😊
5,No problems so far. Super fast
5,It charges both my fiancé's Android and my iPhone! And super fast! It's perfect for road trips while using GPS and Spotify. I usually have a drained battery when I get places and now it's always at 100%!
5,Exactly as described! Thank you!
5,Works great and not a blinding blue light just enough glow
5,El cargador funciona muy bien para cargar mi Celular  Samsung S21
5,Charging power is great!
5,At first I was skeptical a charger that charges just as fast as my regular charger. I'm glad to say that this product is everything it promised a high output charger that will charge your phone to its fullest capabilities.
5,Very fast charging speeds at an awesome price
5,I bought a 2nd vehicle and the standard plug in wasn't charging my phone very fast. This charger works fast and it's what I was looking for.
5,Excellent product worth the money.
5,Charges super fast! I love the two port option. Affordable. I recommend!
4,Works great for my Galaxy S22 ultra. Charges rapidly. Seems to cut off when full.
5,Car charger delivers superfast charging love it
5,Works as well as the fast house charger I have. Good price. Bought a second.
5,with my old car chargers playing music and using google maps navigation used to drain the phone battery even when the phone was plugged into the charger on long trips. With this fast charger it actually still charges the phone even with google navigation and music playing through the car stereo with bluetooth. I'm impressed. Heck it even charges my ipad at the same time too!
5,good~!!!!!!!!
4,This charger is amazing.  10-15 charge will do your phone good.  So happy I spent this money.  The only issue I have is that it doesn't work with all phone case.  I have to remove my phone case while using this charger in my vehicle.  Small price to pay for greatness I guess.
5,Works as described. I love the light indicator. Let's me know it is active
5,Very good quality and cord is good better quality than the rest and looks cool
5,Great for my truck
5,I was pleasantly surprised with the fact that it was able to charge my phone at the maximum rate available for my phone.  I have never found another that would do that.  In fact most of the wall chargers do not do that.
5,I tossed all my other ones.
5,Works great and charges my S22 Ultra very fast. Seems to be made very well and the charging cable that comes with it is very good quality. Not a cheap cable like you usually get with chargers and other accessories.I still think they are a bit pricey for what it is but the price is way better than any accessory items at any of the phone stores and I am happy with the quality.
5,perfect super fast charger durable & love the blue light
5,Great product!
5,I do not write reviews but this thing solved all my issues with car charging!!!  Fast charging works fantastic!  My internal charger in my vehicle cannot fast charge my phone and this was a necessity with the amount of traveling I do.  Excellent product!!!
2,Definitely not the greatest charger but it worked for a week. Then just stopped working all of a suden. Its not used very ofet maybe 20 minutes per day.

5,This was a pretty good deal. The charger is a rapid charger so it works well.
5,charges charges and super fast mode on a note 20 ultra plus very fast
5,Superfast charging. The only concern is that the light never turns off when you turn off your car you have to unplug it.
5,Love the dual functionalities.
5,Like the product
5,Great item phone charges super fast!
5,I liked that it worked
5,Muy buena buena relación calidad-precio carga muy rápido más de lo que esperaba. No puedo opinar sobre durabilidad porque tengo poco tiempo con el cargador
5,Tengo un S20+ y carga al mismo tiempo que el cargador del celular ( 1 hora aprox)
1,El equipo viene quebrado
4,Update: the company had sent me a new one and apologized so far this one has been working great and is my fastest charger I have I love itQuit working in 5 days... do not recommend
5,Un cargador que vale la pena comprar. Tengo carga rápida en el auto algo que no tenía con otros cargadores convencionales. La pontecia de carga que logra gracias a las especificaciones eléctricas que posee son justo las que necesitaba. Consejo: Yo pensaba que todos los cargadores de este tipo eran iguales y me darían el mismo rendimiento; estaba equivocado. Importante revisar las especificaciones de carga para que la compra valga la pena y funcione como uno espera.
4,Es útil y practico
1,It will not charge my phone.
5,This product charges tablets and cell phones in a much quicker manner than most on the market.  Great value.  Would recommend for anyone who wants a faster charge time for their electronics while on the road in the car.
5,Woks well
5,The product is very good .. cable of good quality and the thing charges my phone really fast .. a really good buy
5,This car charger comes with a regular USB port as well as a USB C port enabling superfast charging for your mobile device. It charges My phone very quickly as I can basically put my phone in at 20% and in no time is charged up to 100. Is the added feature of having the extra USB slot baseline is perfect for older phones that don't use a USB C connection.
