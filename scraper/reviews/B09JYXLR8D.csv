5,So I was skeptical about purchasing any non HP brand toner because I've been reading some terrible reviews about how you had to take apart the toner and chip and somehow put it back together again to make it work.  Who has time for that? So I took a chance on these toners and said screw it if it doesn't work I'll return them.  So far it's been great!! Everything prints great no weird streaks or anything anywhere.  Also I did not have to fumble around with the toners and try to replace the chips from the original toners to these....what a relief!! Everything is working seamlessly.  I'm very happy with my purchase and will definitely order from here again in the future.  I mean who the hell wants to pay more for the toner than you did for the actual machine??? HP has gone nutts.  It's very disheartening.
4,I'm very glad I made this purchase. I've purchased other off-brand replacement ink and had to remove and install chips myself. It's not that difficult but it can be time consuming. With this ink the chip was already installed! So convenient!! And the print quality is much better than my previous cartridges. I actually removed them before they ran out because the quality was horrible. But my new cartridges...very satisfied and I will repurchase!
5,I work in IT for my company so my main focus is on ease compatibility an you can't beat the value. I recommend this product as I have purchased and used it twice in our busy environment (mortgage industry so we do a lot of printing) and each time it has been easy to replace (especially because the chip is already installed) and the print quality is very good (we print many legal documents that are used in legal filings). And courts require defect free prints for filings!!! I highly recommend this product you can't beat the quality for the price!
5,I work at an elementary school.  We go through A LOT of ink.  This works just as well as the original HP.  Have ordered several times and will continue.
4,Printing quality seems fine. Main thing to know is that the printer knows that these are not "new OEM" and so does not display the amount of toner available / remaining. Probably means the color cartridges need to be replaced in full sets.

I like quality toner just like the pickiest consumer but I don’t have purchasing agreements with HP I don’t have volume discounts and I don’t have any way to charge for it as a business would.  I buy toner for me not a Fortune 1000 company.The hunt for good generic toner used to be easier but with the chip there are only a handful of possibilities.  Thankfully ColorKing toner addresses my needs of quality toner at a reasonable cost.  Unlike other generic toner I have bought it is packaged with care.  The toner cartridges themselves are sealed and have all the protective measures in place that you will find on name brand toner.  Comparing the output on printed page one cannot distinguish any differences.  Unlike similar there is no inserted page for what to do if - because if doesn’t happen.The other issue I have had with generic toner is page yields.  While these are still new cartridges I plan to revisit this review as the end of their duty cycle approaches.  If I encounter problems I will revisit this review but otherwise know that no news is good news.  I have thrown away 3 toner cartridges that were outside of their return date that never worked - I used to always have an extra set of toner on hand but don’t anymore because of poor quality.  Of course when a cartridge gets too low this creates an emergency thankfully the quality of ColorKing toner has allowed me to resume keeping spare toner.Color laser printers stand head and shoulders above inkjets - in terms of speed and quality.  Having access to quality toner that is affordable makes the jump to color laser printing in the reach of more people.

I installed it on my printer (HP MFP M479dw) with ease (remove the old ones and put the new ones in their place not forgetting to shake them a little before so that the toner is distributed well). The printer recognized the cartridges and chips on the first try. The photographs were spectacular on normal paper (A4 80 gr.m2). I don't have photographic paper but having this quality on normal paper I think I won't need it. Text documents are equally perfect as well as those combined with text and images. I think I've made a good purchase and I've saved a lot of money. I recommend it.
5,Excellent product and easy to set up. Could not be any easier!
5,The ink cartridges fit perfectly and the overall product quality is very good. I would definitely order again in the future. I ended up substituting my own old chips in order to avoid getting error messages about my new cartridges containing "Used" chips.
5,After some research I decided to buy this 414A printer cartridge. It was easy to replace and the prints have a good quality. Definitely I recommend it.
