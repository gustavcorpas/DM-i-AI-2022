5,Update:  I've been using these cards for two months now in harsh conditions and I love them.  The CFExpress card feels more substantial than the SD card used by my D610 and is less clumsy to use than the CF cards used by my D3s.  I like that the card is shaped so that it's immediately obvious which way to insert them.  After some practice you can tell by feel and don't even have to look down as you put new cards in the camera.  This format is a winner and I hope it continues for a long time.-- original review --I recently upgraded from a Nikon D3s to a Nikon D5.  I stepped over the D4 because of Nikon's decision to have two slots with dissimilar memory types (one xqd and one CF) and turned my attention to the CF version of the D5.  I don't trust Sony.  They tend to do their own thing and their standards tend to become defunct.  I use my cameras professionally and I can't afford to have the card format become prematurely obsolete.Then Nikon released a firmware upgrade to the D5 for the XQD version that supported CFexpress which apparently works because the form factor is the same only the protocol is different.  This was the update I needed to finally pull the trigger on the D5.  I got a refurbished body that already had the proper firmware installed and didn't need to muck with XQD at all.The D5 can't take advantage of the full speed of the CFexpress card and for long continuous rapid fire you will eventually run out of buffer.  But it's definitely a step up from compact flash.Where the CFexpress card really shines is reading the photos into lightroom.  A good card reader on a USB3 port really blazes.I like the feel of the cards. They're thicker than SD cards which I consider an advantage and the shape of the card makes it easy to get it in the camera the right way the first time.Bottom line I like this format and I've been doing business with Sandisk (almost entirely their Extreme Pro series) and I suspect these cards will do well in the field.  I just put two more on order.I shoot professionally and am very hard on my equipment.  It'll be interesting to see how well the cards do under heavy workloads.
5,I took close to 3000 ( extra fine) photos in a safari trip with my Nikon D850. Probably could have taken 2000 more.Shooting continuously in many occasions had no hesitation was written instantly.Downloaded to the computer via cable no problem.No heating! Per my experience a great product.
5,I have an R5 and the transfer rate is Hreat with my Mac Mini with the M1 processor.If I had to Iâ€™d buy another.
5,I always use these cards.
5,Use these in my NIKON Z9 and they keep up with the Z9 when I am taking Football pictures
5,Very fast card works wonderfully with Canon R5.
4,Fast and efficient. Does the trick.Way too expensive. SD cards are like $50 and then XQD is $200. It's great but I'm not sure I would say 4x better.....Still kinda new so maybe I have some left to learn.
5,You can download a half-battery's worth of photos in a second. No more waiting. It actually takes longer for MacOS Finder to preview each HIEF file (btw don't do that just open them all in the MacOS Preview app itself).
5,I recently purchased a Nikon D850 which the cost was a shock but you can't beat the 45.7 megapixels and the sensors in it. Can't imagine needing anything more. Having the camera introduced me to the CFexpress Card Type B - SDCFE which I had never heard of before I owned the D850. When I started my research like everyone else the price took my breath away. The cost is so high that you can't take the decision lightly. After much deliberation I decided I'd go for it since I already invested so much in the camera. Wow... I mean WOW. With this card your camera is so fast you'll think something is wrong. I didn't even think the auto-focus had time to work it was so fast. If you are like me and HATE the lag time between taking photos even with the top of the line fastest SD or Micro SD cards you you'll love this card. You won't miss another shot waiting for the camera to reset. You won't believe the speed. I still don't believe the speed. With my D850 set at the highest level of quality raw photo setting the 128gb card I have has room for 9000 photos! I purchased my card with the reader and saved a little bit of money from buying them separately but it was a purchased well worth.
5,Pricy little nuggets the type Bs are.  But feel better than SD cards and the size is nice too. Fast in and fast out regarding photos.
