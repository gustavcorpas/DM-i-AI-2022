4,Resolution wise these are amazing for the price! I’m not so sure I’d compare them to something like a Pimax or in the 4K league but they do wonders. I hear a lot of people complain about periphery but I don’t see that issue as much partially because I tend to be tunnel visioned when I play games.  Primarily I use them on iRacing and Digital Combat Simulator which have both been amazing titles to play in VR.  I also played Assetto Corsa except that I can’t get the FOV to work for me in that game.I also ended up making a custom bracket to hold everything on the rig I use which made the whole thing much more organized to work with.That was a good here’s the bad.Nearly every time I start my computer and open up windows mixed reality I always have to power cycle or USB cycle the headset before I can use it. It will not come straight onto the computer without some kind of issue. It’s a very simple thing to address in drivers or what not I’m not sure why HP doesn’t deal with that. I heard on the newer revisions there’s a reset button on the power/usb block you push to jog power on/off.  Really???Then there’s just a general issue of getting it to work on the computer. Not very straightforward not that its HP‘s fault necessarily. There’s a lot of gears in the process of making it work. Steam VR is an option but very unrecommended if you want good frame rate without a lot of overhead from the system. That means doing a bit of detective work for now until vendors and software developers get their act together.Within 6 months the right ear cup has become chronically intermittent. Meaning you’ll be playing a game and the audio will cut out but shaking your head or tapping it brings it back. Some sort of disconnect. I’m eventually going to move to a set of Bluetooth earbuds to address this problem. I don’t put that many hours in the seat at a time so they should be able to last long enough. My other option would be to get some wired earbuds but that means running another cable to the computer which is difficult from a simrig plus the added cabling that follows your head.Headtracking overall has been very good provided there’s enough light in the room. That seems to be the only thing I’ve noticed in terms of headtracking issues. I imagine if you had something else with satellites (a la Steam Index or similar) this would be a non-issue in the dark but I didn’t want to have the extra equipment in the room just to use it. I rent an apartment so I don’t wanna constantly have to keep moving those things around form place to place plus it’s more things to break.For the image quality and cost hard to beat this!  Just know it may take a bit more proficiency and troubleshooting to iron out the kinks from day to day.
4,My headset worked right out of the box. Windows Mixed reality saw it and configured it for me. I rock an AMD system on Windows 11 with a 3080 gpu. I would not recommend this to someone who doesn't have a moderate level of computer savviness.I use it mostly for Dirt Rally 2.0 ACC project cars and a few other VR titles via Steam. It took a few hours of research and tweaking to get everything looking and preforming well. You will be disappointed if you launch straight into a game and try to start playing with default settings.I chose this headset because I mostly play racing sims. The clarity is incredible over other headsets that I have tried. Wish the FOV was a little bigger but I don't notice it as much now that I have gotten used to it. The controller tracking seems good enough for the few "full vr" titles I have played.Issues? Yes. I did not have these issues when borrowing a friends headset. However these issues really only came up while getting the games I play optimized.Changing graphic settings a lot while in game may cause the headset (and game) to crash. These crashes seemed to have gone away since I have my settings dialed in. Simple fix reboot computer and try again.Controllers might not always be useable through steamvr unless you connect them prior to launching steam vr. Fix=close steamvr connect controller relaunch steam vr.Headset dark while using steamvr (rare). Reboot computerAgain I would not purchase this unless you are willing to work through some issues while you get settings optimized. I'll come back and update the review if anything else comes up.
5,When I received the first headset it was used and missing cords. I returned it an received a new one in a reasonable amount of time. I absolutely love it. I am using it primarily for MSFS.
4,It appears that VR has finally reached the price and quality point that it is starting to take off. At the last Microsoft conference it is apparent that Microsoft is completely embracing integration Linux virtual servers services and Virtual Reality.So here is how this headset fits in.  The fresnel lenses tend to give a clear image in the ocular center zone but get fuzzy or out of focus if you look to the side. So expect to turn your head to keep the image crisp.It has the highest resolution screen for the price and the best Valve speakers just away from the ears. They don’t touch the ears but sound moves relative to your head movements to create immersive sound atmosphere.There is a newer more expensive model and the next generation of headsets will track eye position and focus with absolute precision to the point of being able to just look at objects or keys on a virtual on screen keyboard.The connector cable is the weak link. Be gentle and careful when plugging into the headset and securing with the clip. Keep the adaptor on the computer side as people seem to have trouble when using directly. I think the new cable and adaptor with power switch are addressing many cable compatibility issues. I use large loose zip ties to route the cable to the back of the headset.I can tell a lot of people are now adopting VR as the rate of VR software and driver updates is almost daily for beta versions on Steam and Microsoft.  The good news is that each version is getting better.We will see another push for VR when Windows 11 is released to the public too.Disclaimer - I have high end equipment for AI research so not sure what the minimum satisfactory level of equipment is required. I do suggest turning on motion smoothing where the goggles can shift the image according to movement between computer updates. This ensures a nice smooth movement as you look around.
3,The headset looks great and the ear pieces stay off your ears.  Look and sound great.  The software is clunky and some games you have to do extra steps to get it to work correctly.  If I could do it again Id go back to Oculus.
3,Bought this and it arrived yesterday. Several frustrating hours later and I am thinking about returning it. Going to give HP support a shot today otherwise it's going back. The issue:It goes black. Constantly. The screen just stops. I can see on my monitor it is still sync'd and senses movement. Rebooting my computer will get it to run for about 10 mins. Things seem fine and it looks amazing but then it glitches out and goes black.Things I've tried:1) Turn down the volume. Seriously this is the most posted resolution. Makes no sense whatsoever didn't work and if it is an actual solution it such poor engineering that I don't want it.2) New cable. Didn't make a difference. I had picked up a spare at a local hobby store. No difference.3) Use a powered USB C hub. Did that too. No effect. Tried USB C 3.1 port on the motherboard same problem.4) Machine is more than beefy enough and runs other VR headsets with no issues. It has about 4X the horsepower of the minimum specs.The Pros:- For the short duration of tie it's actually worked the view are amazing. Much higher resolution than any other set.- It can fit my glasses. A bit of struggle at first but once on is very comfortable
5,Field of view is impressive and the resolution is spectacular.  This is not for computer novices as you are required to adjust settings within games and the device itself but with a little bit of time will be rewarded with a stunning VR experience
3,Difficult to set up when gaming in games such as Elite Dangerous. Anything not specifically created for VR is a chore to manage.
2,Ill start off by saying that I am shocked that this headset is so mediocre. I have heard nothing but positive reviews. But upon receiving it the first thing I noticed was the flimsy build quality of the controllers but ok whatever I was willing to overlook that. Next was the face gasket it is held to the headset magnetically but the magnets that hold it on are not very strong so the gasket falls off all of the time. Ok another thing to overlook. When I was going through the setup process the controllers did not want to pair to the headset and I had to try around 3 times to finally get them to pair. When I finally got everything up and running the first thing I noticed is that the tracking seemed way off. The VR world around me seemed wobbly and nearly made me motion sick. After I unplugged and reset the headset a lot of that went away but I could still tell that everything seemed very wobbly. To fully test the headset I loaded Half-Life Alyx and played for about 45 minutes. The experience seemed ok but I then put on my Oculus Quest 2 and started playing HLA and the visuals were so much sharper in the Quest as well as rock solid tracking.In conclusion I cannot recommend the HP Reverb G2 headset to anyone. If you want a better headset at half the price go with the Quest 2.
3,This was a noticeable visual improvement over my Oculus Rift S.  Which is what I was looking for for my flight sim games. (However this added detail is not necessary for most other VR gaming. My Rift S was just fine and I will still use it.) You also need a powerful computer with at least a RTX 2080 to take advantage of most but still not all it's capabilities. (3080+ or next gen graphics for max setting sim gaming.)  It was also a real nightmare to setup for use within any Steam Games and some of the Oculus games still have problems with the hand controls.  There are work-arounds for all this but sadly they don't come from the manufacturer and you have to dig for hours on-line to find all the help videos and on-line forums to get this Windows Mixed Reality Platform working properly.  Windows Mixed Reality is still a work in progress for main stream gaming at this time.  Too bad because this product is excellent for build quality and comfort and visual quality. The 3rd party vendor was great promptly sending this to me in a quality shipping package.
2,I got this headset to use on my flight simulator. The headset CONSTANTLY gets a blue screen when turning or or just playing. They do not offer replacement parts and when I tried to get a new cord THE DAY IT GOT DELIVERED it would be 2 months and $110. I enjoy VR thoroughly but I could never recommend such a terrible product with even worse customer support.
5,Calidad de imagen y confortabilidad
4,Some heavy from cable and it is on your back or shoulder. Gonna need a pivot point on ceiling for cable to race/fly on motion chair. But GREAT for the $650 I spent black friday. Graphics are step up from rift s in my opinion. Controls are really good and strong feel  Give it a 7/10 and definitely a good choice for a first vr system now because few years old tech in it. This is my second vr system and I'm really happy for the money.
4,I recently bought my daughter an oculus and was pretty impressed with that so I thought I would come on here and order myself the grown-up version which I believe to be this HP reverb G2 VR headset and turns out you have to have a gaming computer in order to use it did not realize at the time I ordered it !!!
4,We moved from HTC Vive to this headset and we're very happy. BE CAREFUL WITH GLASSES I used it while wearing glasses and there's a small scratch in one of the lenses now but I found a solution online that I'll be trying soon. The resolution is great the only thing that I think is worse than the Vive is the hand tracking.
4,I love this headsets besides it tiny flaws that may not affect you. Within the first week I fell in love with this headset and it also failed be within that same week. I was having the infamous dead data cable issue giving me error 4-1. If you get this error save yourself the trouble shooting headache and either RMA or return. It’s not your pc it’s the cable. I returned my headset sadly but do plan to use once this issue is resolved by HP. TLDR: This is one of the best VR headsets I’ve gotten to use and own regardless of the lemon I received.
5,Pros…LightweightGreat fitExcellent audioVery comfortable even in long sessionsVery clear pictureCons…Sweet spot is pretty smallOverall I’m very happy with my purchase. Half Life Alyx looks so good. MS Flight Sim 2020 looks really good as does Assetto Corsa and Automobilista 2. A lot of people swear by the Quest 2… which I owned briefly. I just found it much too heavy on my face and didn’t like the fact I had to recharge the battery. Being wired to my PC doesn’t bother me in the least.Hope this helps!
1,I have just a few pros and all cons the cons firstCONS:1: Graphics suck in Assetto Corsa Competizion.  I tried LOW to EPIC and it just sucked stutter blur focus see 4.2: Setup for iRacing is far easier but graphics/visuals is better than ACC setup is cumbersome but graphics is the achilles heal.3: In spite of reviews never get the SteamVR Vive Tracker 2.0 will not pair with controllers4: Either the lens were not installed correctly I had to tilt my head up to see anything that came into focus reasonably.  This was true in Mixed Reality iRacing ACC and general setup5: Over all setup was a bust once I got it somewhat working everything disappeared6: If you are a glass wearer and the glasses are larger than 5.5 inches wide and 1.5 inches Good luckPROS:1: It was comfortable to wear with out glasses or smaller glasses then mentioned2: The sound was awesome.Overall I had high expectations after going through almost all reviews youtube how too's.  It was just not worth the pain of setup and torture to reset when it all went bad.  I purchased this mainly to SIM Race.  To be fair I did manage to run an hour in ACC no motion sickness but I had to run all graphcs at low.  I have a AMD 5800x X570 Aorus Elite WiFi MB Crucial DDR4-266 Memory and an MSI RTX3060 12gb Graphics.  With nothing running only ACC or iRacing stutter blinking was just not worth it.
5,The G2 is simply awesome. It's light weight has great resolution and is super smooth! The face mask fits well and is comfortable and doesn't let in any light. I give it 5 starts because of this. However there is a known issue with the cable and USB firmware HP is aware of the issue and is working to correct it. The cable may or may not work well. I had a cable that worked for about a week and it didn't work very well. Then all of a sudden my headset stopped working. I contacted HP support and they sent me a new cable free of charge. It took about two weeks for me to receive the new cable but the new cable fixed 100% of the issues I had before. Even though you might have an issue with the cable I would still completely recommend this headset but know that you might need a new cable. But it's totally worth it!!!
4,You need something better than a GTX 1060 6 GB for it to run well but the lag isn't as bad as it detecting your hight in Zero Caliber you will want new batteries soon after purchase
3,Initially this headset would quite simply NOT work with any flight simulator. It is still designed poorly. It has short-circuits with the left speaker and only works with very high end GPUs.But WHEN it does work it's not terrible. Certainly not the best either as its FOV is limited and it gets sweaty in it.But it's alright.
5,Clarity and Price and NO FB linkage!
1,I purchased a "Used Like New" unit ("Excellent Condition Original Packaging" and paid $550. My mistake.The unit is covered in little specks of white skin dust and had one or two small hairs on it. Ok I can clean it to save the $80 off new.More annoyingly though everything is in good condition it is missing the Mini-DisplayPort to DisplayPort adapter cable which I rely on to use it with my laptop. I can't believe this was designed with a full-size DisplayPort on the cable but it does and I didn't get the Mini-DP adapter it's supposed to come with.Extremely sad I can't use it out of the box and now I have to order separate adapters. Which adapters will work? Based on my research the following Amazon USA product IDs will workamazon . com / gp / product / B0925L4SSNamazon . com / gp / product / B07ZPCF4CHAlso why is it dirty? Just clean it. Wtf.
1,I am not going to criticize those who left positive reviews.  I am happy for them.  As for me I can state that the HP Reverb VR system is the worst.  It came with a broken right side speaker that if you move up and down and don't move much it may function.  Forget about opening a case with HP.  I rather chew on tin foil than deal with that level of incompetence.  Every time I sat down to play a game it became a support project trying to fix the viewer the game the system.  Stay away from this product.  It is truly horrible and a lesson in frustration.
2,It's great when it's working but it's super finicky and buggy. Only works on one of my front side USB 3.0 ports. After anywhere from 5 to 30min of game time it starts disconnecting and reconnecting and usually ends up causing the game to crash. Usually starts with audio dropping then video. Will come back after 10-20 seconds sometimes. hP doesn't accept the SN on the box for support help lol. Lot of money for such a buggy product
3,Never got it to work correctly. Lots of issues with cords. I returned it and seller couldn't have been better!
4,Good headset. Tracking could be better but not a deal breaker
1,They put plastic sheet INSIDE the buttons on the controller and it cant be peeled off.  Ive spent 2 hours in vain simply trying to get the plastic "protection" off the the BUTTONS....  Then when I plug it in my 3 screens and mouse all flash on and off for 20-40 seconds.  Then when it sleeps it constantly does the same nonsense.  They give you no way to disable it other than unplugging it.  What a bad joke.It seems as if these horrid electronic companies are purposefully trying to kill VR before it even gets started.  How little effort do they put into WMR/SteamVR in 2022?  ANY?What should have been a game changer HP/MS/Steam ruined.  Do they want their customers to abandon them for Facebook/Oculus?  This is how you do it.
5,Son loves this i do too
5,I am thoroughly enjoying my Reverb G2. The only issue I've found is that occasionally the headset will not start up (no audio or video). Unplugging the unit and rebooting usually solves the issue. I don't understand why this is happening but that doesn't stop me from recommending this headset.  The experience is phenomenal!
1,After only using it for a few days the left controller trigger act like it was pressed all the time therefore not being usable not very impressed for something that was
1,This item is very cheap and return is hell. There are so many wires on this thing that when I went to return the item I missed a wire and so I could not get a refund and now I have to use my own money to return this item and I have been stuck like this for 4 months. Do not recommend this item it’s horrible along side horrible seller.
2,The powerup is with manual in hand for my case is a MUST plug all the VR then turn on the pc or malfunction it's.Also it's battery hungry so buy before 4AA rechargeable batteries.The cable holder behind the helmet is kinda fragile so good luck don't breaking it.Aside from that excellent image nice audio; WMR is kinda acceptable and the control if not the best as all the needed inputs
1,This was a huge waste of my time between all the cords and buying ports and downloading programs and researching to figure out the 1-4 error that kept coming up and it changing reason every time as to what the issue is.  Horrible product and HP needs to really fix soooo many issues.
5,I was hesitant initially but I am so glad I bought this vr system. I heard nightmares about the wires blah blah blah but it really is well built and comfortable.
2,I had to fix a headset speaker problem upon arrival of product....construction is all plastic not sure of durability.  Cable strap pops off had to replace it with a zip strip.  Highest resolution does not work well with NVIDIA GTX 1060 had to select reduced resolution in headset setup.If you want to use this product you need a NVIDIA RTX 3000 series to get full resolution.
5,I use the HP with a 3080TI and a 10700k with 32GB of ram at only 32 00 speed and performance in FS2020Nearly equalled monitor FPS. WOULD DEFINITELY PURCHASE AGAIN.
1,Has trouble with accuracy in terms of the base stations picking up my play area and where I am in it description isn’t 100% accurate either that bed the customer
5,It cannot be described in wordsjust buy it
1,This headset is not compatible with many computers that meet the requirements. After confirming my system met the requirements (well over actually) I ordered it. When it arrived and i got it connected I got the dreaded 1-4 error. I spent 2 hours on hold with HP support to have a 5 minute conversation that lead to "return it it is defective" so I did. The replacement had the same error.This leads me to believe I either got 2 defective products (unlikely) or HPs requirements are only guidelines. Either way it's a roll of the dice with this headset. I'd suggest getting a different VR set but if you decide to get this one expect problems and don't expect any help from HP.
1,cable dont work and tech support blows
5,Works great on my flight simulator good picture and great quality work material
1,The entire VR industry is a wreck devices are cheaply made features work intermittently the software is massively buggy.  This headset is cumbersome uncomfortable cheaply made it fits an industry where that is the standard.  I cannot recommend bothering with VR at all in it's current state.
1,The controller is cheaply made. The vibration is making annoying noise. The cable is stiff and uncomfortable. I am shocked that amazon put this seller on top of the searching result. The seller doesn't cover return shipping. And they charge a restocking fee. The headset image quality is average. The windows mixed reality platform is as bad as windows.
1,We just bought a new computer and thought this would be a good addition to our set up. The A/V card on our new computer couldn’t handle the software and would have required a $400 upgrade. Upon deciding to return the product we realized there would be a 15% restocking fee and had to pay shipping to return it which was over $60. Between these two expenses this was not worth trying it out.
1,The cable on this headset went bad HP replaces them under warrenbty. I called HP and they said the warrenty expired in December of last year I bought the headset from Amazon less than 6 months ago.What gives?
5,Excelente
1,My husband tried this out for his NASCAR racing game and didn’t care for it. We returned it and there was no warning of a restocking fee so were shocked that we were charged $130 to restock plus the cost of shipping. VERY disappointed!
1,There are instructions in 20 different languages but not English. Only vague pictures.Couldn't get headset to power up.I returned the headset on 9/30/21. Almost a month and a half later I still haven't received my refund.
1,It was terrible box rip apart parts missing with a power supply in place needs to pay attention  what’s in the box before  shipping out.
1,Esta bien pero venia usado y le faya el audifono derecho.
1,Didn’t even power on. Not recommend
1,I placed an order right at HP's 2:30pm EST cutoff- I guess this then missed the cutoff to be shipped out the same day?  So when I was checking out the order said estimated delivery from August 12-17; but after placing the order the estimated delivery jumped to August 15-18.  The thing is that I am going away the following weekend and I don't want a $2000 computer and VR headset sitting in my building's package room for 1.5 weeks.So I reached out to HP help as soon as I got home and asked them to cancel the order without a restocking fee- they said they could not do this DESPITE THE ORDER NOT PROGRESSING AT ALL ON THEIR SIDE.  So I asked if the order cancellation does not go through could I return the items without a restocking fee- they said they could not do this either.  So I then asked if they could expedite the shipping for free giving this issue on their system's end- they said they would not do this either.Just absolutely zero help and zero effort to help (which is probably worse).NEVER AGAIN for me- YOU SHOULD STAY AWAY TOO!!
5,Like new! properly functional the package is good!!luckily it's a V2 vison no need to buy/print a wider FOV face gasket!!
2,I bought this headset from Wal-Mart.  Please dear user do not buy this from HP.com.  Get it from some place like Amazon or Wal-Mart so you have a quick avenue to return it like I did.  I'm posting this review to hopefully help that one person who is like me and doing deep research comparing headsets.  My setup as of this writing (May 2021):RTX 30703700XAsus TUF Wi-Fi Gaming X570850W PSU16GB 3200Mhz RAMI primarily play sim racing games such as Assetto Corsa (AC) iRacing and Assetto Corsa Competitizone (ACC).This headset seemed like a slam dunk for sim racing but the problems started right out of the gate with setup:1. Due to compatibility problems that still have not been addressed in May 2021 you cannot plug this directly in your motherboard.  You must use an external USB hub or a front facing USB 3.0 port.  That is the ONLY way Windows Mixed Reality will recognize it.2. You must go into BIOS and set your PCI-E slots to GEN 3.  Yes that is right you must "downgrade" your overpriced Motherboard you bought to use a state of the art VR headset.OK once you are done usually you are off to the races right?  Wrong.3. SteamVR must be installed next.  SteamVR really is where you will need to understand how to tweak supersampling and other features to ensure your experience is good based on your PC hardware.  You will lean hard on this program so make sure you understand it and the "handshake" it must make to WMR to provide your gaming experience.  SteamVR is fine and this is not a dig against the headset itself but just so you know the games you likely want to play/own are on SteamVR.You are now ready to game.  When it works:1. The graphics are incredible.  iRacing at full tilt in this headset is unreal.2. The audio from the little speakers is surprisingly excellent and the microphones work well in Discord after you tune your settings to make them a little less sensitive.3. The physical IPD adjustment is also a nice touch.4. The controllers were acceptable. I never used them because I sim race.Just as I was getting comfortable with this headset the crashes started to happen.  Random BSOD codes that all pointed to driver problems.  Sometimes the games would run 10 minutes sometimes 1 minute.  Clean install of Nvidia drivers uninstalling and reinstallation of all USB ports reinstalling Windows and heavy forum/subreddit searches did not lead to a simple solution.  This headset just does not play nice with AMD hardware.I appreciate Wal-Mart's easy return policy and am so thankful I ordered it through their site.  Personally if you have the money go for the Valve Index.  SteamVR is so critical to your experience get the headset that is meant to go with it.  If you don't have the money do what I am doing pick up the Oculus Quest 2 and sign the contract to give away all the data to Facebook.  There is a reason that headset is so cheap and I'd advise reading their privacy policy before you commit.  I read it sighed and just said "where do I accept?"Good luck in your search but this is not the VR headset you're looking for.
2,I purchased my Reverb G2 directly from HP 13 month ago.  If you have read any of the reviews on the various forums you will see lots of comments about issues with the connecting cables issue with displays going dark issues with the small sweet spot in the displays controller tracking blurriness and image flickering.In my case I bought the reverb because it was half the price of the competing non-oculus units and advertised better resolution.  It has definitely been a mixed bag. After you get used to the relatively small focus sweet spot the clarity is really pretty good.  But....the controllers are sub-par.  They have pretty limited tracking they do not have a trackpad so some games are very difficult to play due to a lack of good control mapping.  They also are power hungry and will devour dry cells if you don't get rechargeable aa cells.Using this system in steam requires Windows Mixed Reality and that isn't a huge problem but it is an extra software layer that adds no real value and makes navigating a bit more cumbersome.As for reliability my system died exactly 2 weeks after the 1 year warranty expired.  It has developed the dreaded one eye display flicker that is extremely annoying.  My calls to HP have not been successful and they simply suggested I buy another Reverb system since I am out of warranty.  While I understand the limits of a one year warranty. No one buys a product and expects it to only last as long as the warranty.  At $600 for a new system these things cost about $50 a month to own if they get replaced once a year!If you are looking for a lower priced non Occulus (Facebook) product these are a pretty good value but do some forum surfing before you pull the trigger.  You might regret your purchase.  I did!
4,I got this elsewhere as it was out of stock but saw the "most helpful" 1 star review.Let me tell you this straight: this is NOT 1 star. yes the USB-C cable doesnt work well with all USB-C ports but a USB-A is also included and this work anywhere just fine. No need for a powered hub or whatever just use USB-A until AMD fixes their chipsets for USB-C support.With that said:- Resolution is quite good one of the best better than the Index. On really detailed games like Alyx or DCS granted that you have a powerful PC (e.g. a 3080FE GPU) this is great. The realism is there. At this price point it's the best and why i bought it.- Headset itself is just fine you do not really need the alternative face shields (they improve FOV but barely). The cable is a bit annoying. But they're all like that anyway.- Aligning the headset correctly is key to get good visuals and pressing it a bit hard against your face will help so that it does not move around at all. Again they're all like that.- The controllers are just okay. The main problems is that this design has the large circles which get in the way when you do things such as reloading guns. You can get it to work but you'll collide quite a bit in the process fairly often. This is really too bad as it does distract a bit from the immersive experience unfortunately.  While it's not a deal breaker -1 star here.- The software and manuals are meh. You need to run the windows reality software in addition to Steam in order to get all/most VR programs. Not a big deal but it would be nice to be able to just start steam. Still keeping the star here because its really not a big issue.All in all i would recommend this headset if you're interested in the high resolution and don't mind the controllers too much. Say if you're going to play DCS (and have a beefy PC) this is quite nice. Other games still work and Alyx looks amazing despite being built for Index.if you're going to play all kind of games that require the controllers and want the controller experience to be better get the more expensive Index if you can. This is most people I think - but not all. And it is definitely more expensive (for a lower res. headset)
4,Bought this second hand first off it has the best resolution and best speakers on the market. I did have that USB connection issue via USB C but I just used the dongle and plugged it into another USB slot and it worked. I have a designated "VR" USB hub but that didn't work.Tracking is great in a dark room and the visual clarity is just amazing. Let's Hope the g3 has touch controllers!
1,I received this item with 0 damage to the box but once I connected everything No power.........
1,This might be obvious to many but I had figured that I would have received some support in order to get the headset to work with my computer.  When I contacted HP to get technical support they wanted my serial number. HP does not have a record of the serial number (that I gave them from the headset) so I tried reaching out to the seller in Amazon and did not receive any response; this was when I knew the seller was not obligated to help me.Be careful when you are buying tech products from Amazon. The fast shipping and slightly lower prices might be enticing but if it does not work then you are out on your own.
1,This headset was a disaster from the start. When I originally purchased this headset (direct from HP) nothing worked correctly. I had a few moments of a good experience where things worked how they should but ultimately my experience was terrible.Plagued with a ridiculous amount of bugs and instability crashing as soon as a game boots up losing tracking every couple of minutes jittery tracking even when the tracking was working as intended.By far the most frustrating part of using this headset is the crashing and loss of connection. There's probably a 75% chance or more of any game crashing at the menu even the SteamVR home hangs up so bad I can't click on anything and just have to shut it all down.For a brief moment after not touching it for almost a year I thought maybe it was working. But all the problems came rushing back. I've tried all the tips and tricks I've read online even going so far as to switch back to an Intel CPU (people were saying the G2 doesn't work well with AMD). Still I can't get this headset to work even halfway enough to enjoy it. The literal only good thing is the resolution.After awhile a friend of mine had a spare Quest 2 that he gave me which is the only reason I got back into VR after giving up on the G2. I got the Quest 2 setup and signed into my Facebook account.. it just works. I don't like Facebook as much as anyone else but the headset just works without issue. Air-link is incredible wireless PCVR that works very well. The resolution while lower than the G2 looks great. The tracking is infinitely better than the G2. The controllers are nicer more functional and don't sap batteries. My games don't crash they just load up and work.Moral of the story: If you're considering getting a VR headset save your money and your time and just get a Quest 2. Half the price and none of the headaches of the G2. Get a couple of mods for the Quest 2 (shallower face gasket ratchet style headstrap with a battery mount portable battery pack etc.) and you can make the Quest 2 the end all/be all of VR headsets.---Original Review---TL;DR: Was disappointed initially waited a while problems went away. Now I'm happy.I got my G2 in March of 2021 as a gift from my friends I picked it for the high per-eye resolution. Been playing video games my whole life and was wanting that "new and exciting" feel I used to get when buying a new game or console. I'm getting a little older and have been with PC for 7 or 8 years now going from poor hardware to nearly the best you can get. But I was still missing that excitement.Once my headset arrived I was more than thrilled. Opening the box everything was good quality. The headset felt and looked nice. Controllers weren't the sturdiest but good enough. After getting everything hooked up and going through the installation and general setup I was placed inside the WMR home. I walked around a little bit to get a feel it seemed to be working perfectly.It didn't take long to start having issues losing tacking with controllers and the headset itself. Something about randomly flipping upside down while in VR and seeing your "hands" drift away doesn't sit right on the stomach. The HMD would lose connection to my PC regularly black screens loss of audio randomly twitchy movements etc. Really takes you out of the immersion.After spending a few days of troubleshooting and wanting to pull my hair out I fixed a lot of the issues which ultimately came down to WMR not supporting the newer AMD motherboards with gen4 PCIE. Switching from gen4 to gen3 solved a lot of issues but some persisted enough to still frustrate me.After beating a glitchy HL:Alyx I boxed my HMD up and sat it in the corner for about 7 months until my buddy got a Quest 2 and wanted to play some games with me. I gave it another shot why not. Pulled out the dusty G2 box and hooked everything back up. Downloaded a handful of updates made sure to switch to gen3 PCIE again and loaded up. Everything just works now I don't lose tracking anymore I don't randomly disconnect anymore it just works. I was always kind of bothered by the "sweet spot" and pretty low FOV so I ordered a replacement face gasket and pad to get my eyes closer to the screen and that pretty much solved all that. So needless to say I'm pretty happy now after a long wait.
1,Headset was great while it worked.  Graphics are excellent although the head tracking is pretty sub-par particularly compared to the Quest 2 that costs half as much.  The issue is that it broke twice.  The first time was under warranty after a couple of months and that was fixed OK.  The second time was right after the warranty expired (one year) and support basically told me to pound sand.  So it seems this is a fine headset if you're OK with substandard tracking and buying a new headset every 15 months or so.  If you want decent support and a product that lasts there's other options.
3,The Great: Pixel density wise this HMD is fantastic  among the best available and the audio is also pretty great with close but not touching speakers near your ears so your ears don't get hot.  The HMD is also light and comfortable to wear for long periods.The OK: It has an industry standard 90hz refresh rate and 90ish degrees field of view (aka binocular type vision).  Controllers are no-frills no capacitive touch standard button layout 2x 1.5v batteries needed in each.The Bad:  Tracking is servicible at best.  The system has a narrow cone of visibility of the lights on the controller and isn't fast enough to re-acquire them when coming out of tracking range into tracking range.  Having your arms down at your sides is well out of tracking visibility.  So this is problematic for games in which you need to come back into tracking range at high speed/accuracy like say a rhythm game.  Another 'bad' is native support for the button mapping is pretty minimal.  If there is no native support you're stuck with navigating SteamVR's custom button mapper which itself is temperamental.  They have however had at least 2 updates since launching the G2 adding native button mapping support to a small list of games.Overall if you're a first time VR owner this might be an ok choice for you since you don't i know any different.  If you're an enthusiast and have had other systems you'll prob want to convert to Lighthouse tracking and index controllers aka a MixedVR setup to get the best tracking with one of the best pixel density hmds.
1,Like others describe cable is trash and works in 1 port on my desktop and zero on my laptop. Resolution is great but offset by horrible fresnel lenses where only a pinhole in the center is focused at any time. Also there is the hassle of dealing with the very user unfriendly WMR which makes the whole experience worse. Never buying an HP headset again.
1,It is a good car set but the cords break often.  I researched this and thought it wouldn’t happen tonight… I was wrong.  Not only that once the cord breaks you will not be able to get a replacement.  If you are lucky enough to find one you will be set back $90+.  My device was under warranty and they would not cover it.  Buyer be ware.
1,Let me start by saying I'm an early adopter and I buy a lot a tech. What that means is that I like trying a lot of things out while they are still in their infancy and by doing so I tend to deal with products that behave a little rough or are unpolished. NEVER have I had as miserable experience with a product as I am having with the HP Reverb G2. Being that this is a second-generation VR headset from a company as large as HP they do not even deserve the benefit of the doubt of attributing this to learning/growing pains especially for hardware in this price range.I ordered my G2 on Feb 01 and it arrived off backorder on the 15th. I set up the device and plugged it in and it only partially worked -- I could hear audio but I couldn't get an image. When I launch WMR on my desktop using the USB-C on my Motherboard (or on my 2070) I get an error that I need a compatible WMR headset in order to use the WMR app. Ok maybe both of my USB-c ports on two different pieces of hardware are both faulty. maybe. So lets try and use the included USB-C to USB-A Adapter. Ah ok now we have a different message. "Check your USB Cable. Make sure the USB cable is plugged into the SuperSpeed USB 3.0 port. Error Code: 4-1"Ok maybe that USB port is faulty too. let me try the other 7 USB Ports on the back of my computer. Let me try the two up front. Per the internets suggestion let me get a PCI/E USB expansion deck and try that. fail fail fail none of these solutions work."try and unplug every USB cable and only plug in the headset"didn't work."try and plug everything in only have the headset plugged in to the PCIE USB port and reboot. If you get the error after boot unplug and plug the headset power back in"didn't work."try a powered USB hub"didn't work.I reinstalled windowsdidn't work.This has been the most frustrating ownership experience of anything that i have had.  Do an internet search for Hp Reverb G2 4-1 Error and you will see that I'm not even close to alone on this issue so most likely what it comes down to is poor quality control by HP. I contacted their support and walking through all the trouble shooting steps that I have taken they offered to send a replacement cable. Some people are being told the replacement cables will ship out late April (today is 17 Feb) well beyond my 30 day return window. So I can wait and pray that the replacement cable is even going to work or i can return the device altogether and I'm leaning towards the latter.
2,I had high hopes for this hardware but ultimately I returned this to HP. I purchased directly from HP.When I received it I assembled it per the included instructions. However Windows Mixed Reality application repeatedly gave a 14-7 error a connectivity problem. The problem still occurs after I followed the HP troubleshooting steps. I search the web for answers and saw the same issue that I had with no real solutions.After a great deal of frustration trying to find a phone number to talk with HP technical support because their system would not recognize my unit serial number the tech took this in a new direction. He asked about the details on my configuration; Crosshair Dark Hero VII MB RTX 3080 GPU and a AMD 5800X CPU. He said that there was an engineering issue that required a different interface cable for AMD CPUs. What? HP doesn't not offer an Intel or AMD configuration and still doesn't. It appears that their strategy is the 1970 Harley Davidson strategy; get it off the lot and fix it when the customer complains.After reinserting the cable into the headset a few times and restarting the Windows Mixed Reality application many times I got it to actually communicate and work at least a couple times but not consistently. The resolution was great and it was what I expected of the display. But the final decision to return the hardware occured when the left speaker developed a crackle like a bad connection or a cold solder joint. Either way it was clear that  HP not disclosing the cable/AMD problem the quality of my uint was questionable at best.HP snached market defeat out of the jaws of a market victory. Too bad.Is HP another legendary company that is just stumbling along on a reputation of past greatness? I have my opinion. Really disappointing.
2,I bought this to use primarily with Microsoft Flight Simulator and in that regard I have been pretty happy with it as far as the visual quality. But as far as using it with other VR titles it's a mixed bag and the main issue is with the poor tracking which other have noted here but downplayed. But for me it's a deal breaker when trying to play rhythm games such as Beat Saber or Box VR where there is obstacle avoidance required. With the Reverb when you try to move out of the way the obstacles follow you and there is no way to avoid them at least that I've found. The controller tracking is also bad and I frequently encounter moments where tracking is lost and my controllers start "flying" all over the room even with proper lighting. Why does the Oculus Quest 2 do this so much better? I've given up on using this for any titles that need decent tracking and the Quest 2 is now my go-to even if the visuals are not as good; it's still a better VR experience overall.
1,I bought the Reverb G2 V1 not long after it was released so I have owned it for about 1 1/2 yrs. I did not purchase it through Amazon for what it’s worth.Bottom line if you want something you can plug in make a few software adjustments and play this is NOT for you. In fact I would say unless you want to spend half or more of your time with this trying different ports USB hubs and adapters and Windows Mixed Reality (WMR) and SteamVR (for games) settings the stay away. And if you have an AMD system plan on spending more time with those items or not being able to use it at all.WHEN it works the visuals audio tracking are actually very good. The operative word is *WHEN*.Here is some more detail on my specific experience. With the original set I purchased but would have to unplug/replug the connector multiple times to get my PC to even recognize the headset. This required using different USB ports both -A (via adaptor) and -C.After filing a ticket w/ HP I was able to get an updated cable (V2) which *supposedly* addressed these issues along with the AMD compatibility issues. And it did…for awhile. But now the new cable won’t power on and since I’m outside the HP 1 yr warranty my only potential recourse would be to purchase a new cable…which is out of stock. So I now have a $500 brick.
2,I cannot in good conscience recommend this VR headset. I pre-ordered mine and waited 3 months to have it delivered in late 2020. I had to upgrade my graphics card which was expected (but keep that in mind when purchasing - it needs graphics horsepower to drive its high resolution). I did get it to work out of the box on an i7 4771 motherboard but could never get audio to work reliably. This is a common issue. After repeated attempts at fixing the audio I gave up and began using some ear buds that fit under it comfortably. It is VERY picky about USB ports. Do a google search for this issue and you will see TONS of articles. Some think it's an AMD problem others an HP problem but I can tell you that I had many issues with the USB-C connection on multiple USB ports. I purchased internal PCI USB-C cards and finally found one that kinda-worked. Now on a new AMD motherboard w/ a Ryzen 7 it has become even less reliable. Constant common USB and Video 90 Hz error messages. The only solution I can find it so unplug the USB and plug it back into another board every single time I want to use the Googles.Again video resolution is great when playing Elite Dangerous or Flight Simulator 2020 but if you want something 'that just works' this isn't it.Alas I waited to long to get service or support from HP so I'm stuck holding an expensive paperweight.
1,It still looks like new.  But while playing an app I received a black screen and error message 4-1.  It appears this has happened to a lot of people.  The message says my USB port is too slow. But after hours of research that is clearly false.  Testing on a second computer with thunderbolt it finds these USB connections to be substandard as well.  This leaves the new looking cord or the new looking device.  The chord is out of stock everywhere and I am certainly not purchasing the device again:  Neither should you!
1,In the middle of using it the device shut down with error code 4-1.  (Same as many other users)  I have spent hours trying to resolve the fact that the device no longer recognizes any of my fully functional USB 3 ports.  Do Not Buy.  It also suggests checking the cable but the entire device still LOOKS NEW.  Oh yes and you cannot purchase replacement cables.  They are not available.
5,The HP Reverb G2 is a great VR headset for $500-600. The resolution is very high so the picture looks great. The colors are very good. It basically looks like a 1080p monitor in VR (which is very good). Other headsets get blurry fuzzy etc. This headset is very clear. Again it looks incredible. The audio is also top notch. And the headset itself is very comfortable.The controllers are actually very good and track very well. A lot of negativity comes from direct comparison to Occulus Touch controllers which are superior. That's just how tech people are if another product is better they tend to crap on everything else. It's annoying. Having used both I'm happy with the G2 controllers. They are very comfortable very functional and the button layout is great. The controllers are basically a clone of Occulus Touch controllers after all. Tracking works very well however it has limitations. It's not really a big deal you just notice some freeze ups here and there. I still use them in pavlov beat saber population one no problem. Every game is very playable and enjoyable but the Occulus Touch do track better. To get good results though you need a room that blocks out natural light. No open curtains no daylight lightbulbs no sky lights.The software is pretty good. WMR is a lot better than people make it out to be. I actually prefer the guardian system to Occulus. It is not as immersion breaking yet it reminds you to stay in your space. Adjusting the floor levels works well. You can pin steam vr games on the walls in the windows cliffhouse to direct load into. It's actually very good. There are no social aspects however it's very self-contained.A few negative... the usb connection is frustrating. It can reject most usb ports on a computer. I found the front usb works well the usb of the motherboard do not work at all. The controllers also drain batteries quickly so 4-1.5V recharagables are a must. And one last negative is how demanding the headset is. It is very powerful and requires a powerful pcAll things considered for the price this is a great headset. I believe if you have a more modest system a Rift S may be better. It's cheaper ($300) looks pretty good tracks well and will run very well on a modest system. On a more powerful pc HP Reverb G2 is the way to go. It looks much better has great audio and the tracking handles well enough to enjoy gaming on. For anyone looking for precise tracking for more competitive gaming you'll prob want a lighthouse vr system. But that being said for regular day to day casual gaming I find the G2 works great.My overall opinion: I love the HP Reverb G2!
1,This product never connects correctly.  This HP comes out with a replacement cable to fix the issue and charges you $90 for it. I will never buy a HP product again ever. Buy from another company!!!
1,This is a Windows Mixed Reality(WMR) headset.  That means it only works with WMR.  The problem is WMR is terrible.  For one you have to move your computer so you can easily get to the back because you WILL have to unplug it after using because it will randomly wake up for no reason every couple minutes and the WMR will steal focus and you'll be stuck in the cliff house.  Secondly half the time you launch a VR game and put on the headset the cliff house activates instead and even though the game+SteamVR is running you're again stuck in the cliff house.  Lastly this headset has no interaction button on the headset.  Many headsets have a button so that you can point the headset at a VR menu and press it to interact with the menu/button/UI without having to get the controllers out.  I'm someone who likes VR for it's 6DOF headtracking and stereoscopic display but I don't care for the controllers at all.  I play VR games with keyboard+mouse. It's very frustrating to get randomly stuck in the cliff house and have to get the controllers out to switch back to the VR game.  I've been a full time developer for over 10 years and have built my last 5 computers.  I am not a novice user.  It's incredible how terrible the experience is with this headset.Having to get up and fiddle around behind the computer to get the headset plugged in then getting infuriating trying to launch it I'm just so tired of it.  I wish I hadn't gotten a WMR integrated headset.
5,Absolutely awesome for consuming VR videos.  It is very good for MSFS 2020 however I barely have the graphics card to do both VR and the flight simulator.  If you’re in the same camp flying in lower populated areas is key.  It is very comfortable even if you have a large head it still fit me.  While I’ve heard there’s better controllers I wouldn’t absolutely would never give up on the image quality of this device.  Absolutely follow the directions installing the device.- Awesome Image/Basic Controls - Best for price point- Own the best graphics card possible- Fits different sizes of heads comfortably.- Follow the directions.
2,I bought this but still basically use my Odyssey+.It's buggy needs a USB adapter has connection issues on the headsetthe controllers constantly have issues and it's maddening.  50% of the time the screens or audio will stop working.  I'm on a 2080 Super so it's not a GPU issue.  The screens are great and it's comfortable the rest is garbage.
5,This is an excellent VR display at an affordable price.  It looks crystal clear I don't notice any screen door effect.  I can work on my desktop & read small text with no problem.  I upgraded from the original Vive & it looks much better.  I even have it set to 50% resolution since I have an old PC (GPU: Nvidia GTX 980) but it still looks great!  You will need a powerful PC to make full use of it's potential but you can turn down the settings (50% resolution & 60 Hz). I notice a slight flicker with light colored backgrounds but I think it's just because I'm using 60 Hz.The headset is very comfortable & it's fast & easy to take on/off.The controllers & controller tracking are terrible.  They are very uncomfortable to hold.  The are large & bump into each other.  They lose tracking if you move them out of view or too close to your face (aiming down sights).  If the controllers are so bad why the 5 star review?  At this price it's worth it just for the display.  You can play simulation games with other controllers like an xbox controller or driving / flight controllers.  If you already own SteamVR lighthouses Index controllers & 2 SteamVR dongles you can use them with it.  If you don't own them you can buy them but it would greatly increase the cost. Look up tutorials on YouTube if interested.The suggested retail price for this is $599.99 USD but you can often find it online at Walmart or HP for $500 or under.  I got it on sale at Walmart for only $400 recently.  I have no idea how people get away with marking things way up on Amazon that you can easily buy elsewhere for much cheaper. They should really have to show the suggested retail price.
1,I bought this headset spent the better part of a month trying to get it to work with my gaming rig only to realize that HP “expected” me to have dug through Reddit to understand that their unit has compatibility issues with non-Intel chips.  Sadly I discovered it past the return date and my only options were to wait until December 2021 for a back ordered cable which “might” rectify the issue or mail it in for repair for an unspecified period of time and it may or may not fix the issue.Heavily DO NOT suggest unless you like frustration being talked down to by HP technical support and enviously hearing stories from your friends with other brands happily playing No Mans Sky glitch- and hassle-free.I bought a high powered gaming rig especially for VR so HP nonchalantly telling me that “oh there’s a thread on Reddit you should have known” was a kick in the groin.
1,Bad product bad performance only good thing is the image and even that is minimal the surrounding area of the focus is blurry and it will damage your eyes.
5,It takes some tinkering to get it running optimally and a lot of users seem to get frustrated and call it a piece of junk when it isn't a seemless plug-and-play experience. There are plenty of detailed walk-throughs out there explaining how to get the headset working great.Once set up properly it's a great headset. Controller tracking is on par with the Quest 2 and Rift S. The screen looks damn good with only very minor screen door effect.People get up in arms about this headset for some reason but for anyone trying to get into VR that is either serious about visual fidelity or doesn't want Zuckerberg spying on them this is the best option on the market in the sub-$1000 price range.
5,Got what I ordered everything works. Also Fast delivery I am satisfied.
4,The HP Reverb G2 is an amazing headset when configured properly. However there are some drawbacks one of which tends to be common nowadays ... non technical or consumers with limited technical knowledge buying products that require real technical knowledge in order to get setup properly. Desktop and laptop computers have always been designed to be configured by the end user in order to enhance performance security and functionality.It doesn't matter if you have a super computer or a basic PC at home. If you don't know how to configure it you will most likely experience issues along the way. Most people today have been spoiled with instant gratification along with click & drag interfaces common among smart phones smart watches and the like. If you don't want to configure a computer or know someone that is skilled enough to do it for you don't buy products that require real technical knowledge.The HP Reverb G2 requires some tech knowledge because you're not just dealing with the headset itself but 3rd party software hardware and games that need to be setup properly to work together. You will be dealing with Windows updates SteamVR updates game updates graphics card updates and hardware updates too. That comes with the territory when you are dealing with similar products tethered or reliant upon a desktop system. Obviously you need to know what you're doing to have the best experience possible. With that said the only issues with the HP Reverb G2 are the following based on first hand experience ...1. The original cable doesn't seem to have been designed properly. It doesn't have adequate power to allow the built in microphone and the video display to avoid audio or video stutters while playing VR games or watching HD videos.This has since been resolved with the latest cable update which contains a switch on the power cable itself. Now it provides adequate power to handle the HP Reverb G2 as it was intended. Furthermore the image looks sharper more true to color and the overall VR experience is greatly enhanced with the latest cable. I believe it's called the Omnicept edition cable.I was sent a new cable about 2 months after I filed a warranty claim online via the HP portal. If your headset is still under warranty you should be able to make a claim if you can explain your issues and provide proof of purchase so that they can confirm your headset is still under warranty. I didn't have to send in my headset to resolve this I simply claimed the warranty and requested the updated cable model.** You can mitigate the audio and video stutter issues by disabling your headset mic and it should subside after a reboot. ( Assuming your system can handle VR gaming to begin with. )  The updated cable model should resolve it altogether.2. The FOV is not that great they could have given us a little more FOV but it is what it is. It feels like I'm wearing a scuba mask which kind of ruins the immersion a bit. I have since purchased a 3rd party VR interface mask to replace the original HP Reverb G2 version. I managed to get a little extra FOV out of it but a little bit is a big deal in the VR world.3. The WMR controllers feel a bit flimsy and the tracking works for the majority of VR titles but you can forget about boxing type games. The headset losses tracking when your hands are too close to the headset or just below your chin level.If you can overlook these issues it's an amazing headset! It shines with car racing games like Project Cars 2 AeroFly FS Flight Simulator and HD 360 4K+ content. With the right titles it pays itself off. It's literally like having your own amusement park at home with a private movie theater you can enjoy anytime you want.The HP Reverb G2 also works with the Valve 2.0 base stations HTC Vive tracker dongles and the Index controllers! Although I have it I barely use that setup. It requires 3rd party software to configure ( bind ) the Index controllers to the WMR controllers and you can't play with the lights off because the HP Reverb G2 is designed differently than the Index headset. It's a bit inconvenient but it does work & improves gameplay on games like Beat Saber and OhShape which are both rhythm type games. Lastly you don't have to use the WMR controllers with some games. You can use your XBOX ONE S controller in SteamVR if you enable it via the controller profile options.I highly recommend the HP Reverb G2 to get the most out of your VR experiences at home. You can't really compare the Reverb G2 with headsets that came before it. The image quality makes up for some of it's flaws and it's pretty much future proof. I think the next round of PC VR headsets will most likely be wireless for the ultimate freedom and VR immersion.####################################################################################################The issues stated by Ron are all caused by Windows 10 itself. Windows 10 has WMR settings that must be configured properly to avoid the issues he stated. Microsoft programmed Windows 10 WMR to utilize a clock that triggers the display after x amount of time. It will also trigger screensaver mode within WMR headsets to protect it from screen burn damage. This can be adjusted within the Windows Mixed Reality settings to some degree. I believe I have mine set to 15 minutes within the Windows Mixed Reality Settings. I also have manual switching between desktop and VR I don't allow auto switching. ( I have to press Windows key + Y to switch. )The original HP Reverb G2 cable did not have a power switch on it many end users would simply unplug the power to turn off the headset when they were done playing VR games. This would then cause all kinds of issues with the headset because it wasn't shutdown properly. You are never suppose to unplug a power cable from an outlet while a device is operational unless it was designed that way. That is an easy way to short circuit electronics and cause problems for yourself. As far as the HP Reverb G2 goes you are suppose to exit Windows Mixed Reality Home sign out of Windows and then unplug the power cable usb ect ..  You can also shutdown the system after exiting WMR Home and unplug the power cable followed by the USB ect ..With the new HP Reverb G2 cable you don't have to sign out of Windows 10 or shutdown your computer because the latest cable includes a power switch on it. You can now safely hit the switch and shutdown down the headset. You can then unplug the power and usb cables ect ..Yanking the USB connection from the USB port causes problems with SteamVR sometimes because the Steam client is designed to cache the Windows 10 VR settings. If you unplug the HP Reverb G2 USB cable from your system without a proper Windows sign-out or shutdown it may corrupt the SteamVR settings. You then have to reset the SteamVR settings to refresh the USB configuration. Failure to do so will may cause SteamVR errors to pop up when you attempt to launch SteamVR again.Another major factor is the Windows OS itself. Anyone whom installed Windows 10 when it was launched needs to download the latest Windows 10 distribution from Microsoft in order to be able to continue with the latest Windows 10 updates. When you run updates with the original release you are not getting the latest updates! You must update your installation with the latest Windows 10 release available for free to existing owners.  You need to create a USB or disc and run the update on your existing Windows 10 installation.You can get the official version here ..https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10The Microsoft Cliff House must launch every time that is the way WMR was designed for Windows. It's required to allow you to setup your floor space so that your position is accurately reflected within VR environments. However in SteamVR you can configure your settings to bypass the SteamVR home environment and simply display your game library by clicking the stick on the right handed WMR controller. This will help you free up system resources and reduce strain on your video card ect ...The video card drivers must be updated and you must configure it properly to squeeze maximum performance from it. Furthermore some VR games regardless of how much system power you have require adequate amount of virtual memory. I dedicate 5 GB to 8 GB of virtual memory on my SSD drive to Windows. It allows me to play at max resolution with only 16 GB of system memory. I'm on an NVIDIA RTX 2070 & can run just about any VR title at max resolution without a hitch. It mostly comes down to system configuration and optimization techniques.Turn off background services in Windows like Windows update once you are done doing the latest updates turn off real-time security scans disable anything listed in your auto-start ( msconfig ) to free up resources. You can always re-enable it later if you need it.One last thing ..There are updates you must acquire from the Microsoft Store ( Microsoft shopping bag icon ) within your start menu! The standard Windows updates does not get all the software and driver updates you require for VR. Make sure everything is updated or you may experience issues.I've shared as much information as I could to help all of you out ultimately is up to you to learn these things ...This is what I mean about people with limited technical knowledge egotistical people know the least. Someone starts preaching about how much they know .. run .. lol
4,Para analizar las Reverb G2 hay que separar necesariamente Hardware y Software porque lamentablemente no es posible encontrar un equilibrio en este HMD. El visor es liviano cómodo bien construido audio muy bueno y la resolución por supuesto la mejor característica que tiene es alucinante como se ven los colores contrastes y los negros son bastante buenos mejores que en Rift S o Quest 2 sin embargo en el software y soporte está la peor parte de estas Reverb G2. Fácil de instalar pero muy complicado para configurar con algunos juegos inestable a ratos y así un sin fin de asuntos relacionados con la compatibilidad que fallan de vez en cuando; por lo general siempre ocurre algún imprevisto que hay que solucionar y la experiencia termina lastrada por estos detalles.Aún así vale la pena probar este visor si la característica principal que se busca es la resolución bajo SDE y Glare además de una buena tasa de refresco (90Hz). Yo lo recomiendo sólo si se persiguen estas características y si no es problema trastear y estar buscando mejoras o solucionando problemas constantemente.
5,This thing is an excellent deal. I use it for DCS and various sitting VR games and it is excellent. I can read text on displays and virtual desktop. Only issue is it is very sensitive to the distance of your eyes from the lenses. If you aren't close enough it's like looking through a glass tube. Clear in one small area. Unfortunately to get it close enough to my eyes I had to cinch it down pretty tight.It would be nice to be able to get different "Interface" padding to adjust the eye distance from lenses. Something 2-5 mm thinner would be perfect.
5,This is my first vr headset and I gotta say I'm in love with it. Best gaming experience ever that you 😁
5,This headset has amazing resolution. I was able to bypass the recommended specs on my 1050ti gpu with a registry edit and am able to run cliff house to do my work in VR. The tracking is great on the headset but I have not tried the wands. There or some God rays and the exact spot to set the headset is tricky but the Velcro works well and everything fits great when configured. There is no screen door effect and I am able to flow in my windows mixed reality virtual desktop.
5,I like that you don't have to hook up to a computer or game system. It is very mobile. I like that I can buy the games from within the headset and it downloads to the headset. Pretty comfortable. A little heavy on the front but not bad once you get the straps set right. Only bad thing I can think of is wish I would have bought everyone in my house one so I could use mine more.
3,I bought this a while back to replace my oculus quest because obviously anything's gonna be better then a quest when I got it it worked fine and I enjoyed playing with it I played Skyrim VR also the interface is beautiful being inside the mixed reality home is better then the oculus or steam homes... Then I got around to playing vrchat which is the main reason I got the headset... I got a big "not compatible with this software" problem spent about 2 days doing research on how to fix it and have up... I'll just spend an extra 300$ next year for a valve branded headset instead of windows... Learning from mistakes sucks lol
3,Bought for my kid's birthday months ago.  Tried connecting tonight (his birthday) got the dreaded 1-4 error.  $700 for junk  my kid is in tears and I'm past the return window.  SO freaking disappointed in HP. Help desk was a joke.  Please don't waste your money like I did.Edit: I did get it to work finally  but not on my kid's computer.  It only works on mine  because I have the proper cable connections. My kid's computer only has USB  USB C and HDMI. If you're has that setup  this will NOT work.  Mine has USB USB C and mini display port and it works with the included adapter. You must have displayport or mini displayport or it won't work. Believe me  I've tried several different adapters.
3,I bought this and a Valve Index at the same time and spent a considerable amount of time comparing them. The Reverb G2’s resolution is a significant improvement over the Index and other VR devices but there were too many other problems and annoyances with it so I ended up deciding to return it.The primary problem I had was with the head tracking. Since there are no external peripherals to help track the head movement this device just can't match other headsets that do. There is a minor amount of tracking jitters (like millimeter precisions) that can be hard for some people to notice but can be incredibly nauseating to others.The color quality was on par with the index at 100% brightness for both systems but the index can go above 100% brightness which I find really helps make some colors pop (without becoming oversaturated).I am not a fan of the Windows Mixed Reality. SteamVR and the native chaperone system for the Valve Index are much better. Specifically where the Index automatically shows object outlines or the camera when you get too close to the playspace boundary (the object outlines especially).The controllers are a huge let down compared to the Index. They're probably the weakest part of the package. There is a way to sync and use the Index controllers with the Reverb but its a major headache and quite finicky (and expensive).The FOV is less on the Reverb and it really shows. The FOV optics are also abysmal. Anything outside of a 15-20 degree vertical range from the center becomes more and more blurry on a logarithmic scale. While I can read text clearer on the Reverb at eye level looking up or down with my eyes makes the visuals MUCH WORSE than the Index.My final issue is with the video hardline. It’s stiff and not pliable compared to the Index.So final conclusion the Index just gives a much better package and experience. I really had high hopes for the Reverb G2 and am sad that it didn't work out.Oh and one more note. hp.com had a 10% return fee but 30 day window to return. connection.com has a 15 day return window but no restocking fee.
2,The G2 was my first experience of VR and undoubtedly my last for the foreseeable future. Thought it would be the perfect addition to my new HP Omen 40L to enjoy Microsoft Flight Sim in all its fully immersive glory. Nope. Spent weeks following YouTube tutorials to find useable setting and countless hours of flying around in a VR world that was uncannily similar to the one I experience in reality only after 3 bottles of wine all to no avail. I've heard it said that everyone's first experience of VR is a disappointment in some way. But this transcended disappointment. The G2 was unusable. Blurry beyond belief jittery distorted. Ironically I achieved some of the best experiences with the device when I was plastered. I really don't know if it was my eyes (I'm mildly longsighted) or a defective device... or more worryingly the current level of technology that was at fault. But given the rave reviews of the G2 that inclined me to buy it I simply can't imagine the horrific nightmare of a VR world that lesser devices offer. The problem with the G2 for me is that I desperately wanted to get it to work. You can feel the potential if only you can get it to do what it promises. But for me ultimately I failed. One of the most frustrating technological experiences of my life. Don't think I'll be even considering VR again until HP release the G10.
3,Really poor experience so far. I received my Reverb G2 today and in under and hour it's decided to crash every time I want to load a game. Also funny the batteries provided for the controllers were at low power after 10 minutes of use. My old Dell Visor may not have the image quality of the Reverb but in the 4 years I've owned it it's never failed me.
4,I'm very impressed with my Reverb G2 . Delivery quick . Setup takes some time  and for me it was a steep learning curve . Suggest to get ' Voice Atack ' program because unless you are a wizard on the keyboard you are lost ! You can't see the keys !  Only 4 Stars because Amazon dosn't tell  about the EXTRA  £25 you have to pay because of Customs Duty . The vendor is in SPAIN Just recieved bill from the courier .
1,Even though I order this from Amazon UK it shipped from HP in the USA. It arrived and I cannot connect it up because it has no UK power lead. This is disappointing considering the high cost of this item.When I do manage to buy a power lead I will review the set properly.
1,I was spending more time setting it up than doing what i wanted to do - the graphics were great but what a pain it became - Be sure you are happy to set this up - may seem simple but its notJoe
5,I bought this primarily to play IL2 BoS. It's a flight simulator and I needed to upgrade from an early Oculus headset to improve resolution. I found the resolution to be excellent when using Steam VR default settings. However even using an RTX 3080 fps was about 30. It's possible to get steady 60 fps with Ultra settings for IL2 graphics if framerate is capped at 60 using Windows Mixed Reality. I'm happy with that as it's a massive improvement on the Oculus. Only concern is a small sweet spot for resolution. Head straps could be better. Not much room to accommodate spectacles. Controllers are OK but need to be visible to headset which limits freedom of movement a little. Not a problem for flight sims.
1,I had to return as it was intermittently powering off I suspected  the power lead but they just said send it back I have a quest 2 and the difference  in sharpness was so small  not worth  the upgrade also the software was not good quest is in my opinion better
2,If you don't look straight you get a blurry image meaning you'll need to turn your head every time you look at something on the side this gets so annoying especially in a game like Elite Dangerous. The IDP doesn't go lower than 60 that's massive deal breaker for me.  I'm IPD 57 and I tried and tried to get over the IPD issue but in the end I can't I always see a black bar in the middle and the image just feels wrong. I didn't know only 3mm would be that noticeable but I guess it is. One of the controller didn't even works out of the box. The HDMI cable is so sturdy that it's actually more annoying than anything. Image clarity if you look straight is the best I've ever seen but too bad the everything else is really bad.
5,DCS simulator
2,El tracking es una pesadilla la configuración es complicada y no funciona bien en cuartos pequeños lo uso para sim racing y pierde el centro cada rato. La resolución es buena.
5,I was happy to receive version 2 of the HP Reverb G2 in Canada.  It's a nice upgrade from the CV1 Oculus for the money.  The only lame things are that you will need to invest in some 1.5v rechargeable aa battery pack because the controllers use 2 each and the clip the holds the cable to the back of the headset pops out pretty often.  Nothing game-breaking so yeah I am happy with the product.
1,I’m already sending this item back but now I’m really fed up. This item is for United Kingdom and there is nowhere on the item description that says a 250 v power supply.
5,Great
4,If there were no cable on this unit it would be 100 %.  5 Star.
5,Réalité virtuelle avec MSFS 2020 parfait mieux qu'Oculus Qu'est 2
