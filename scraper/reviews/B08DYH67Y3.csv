5,Se paga lo q se tiene y esta impresora me pareci√≥ buena compra.
5,Not bad tho but printer is kinda slow than I thought. It‚Äôs too easy to setup
4,Overall the machine is good for the value.  Only complaint I have is the scanner will not scan more than one page at a time....very time consuming.
4,This printer is easy to set up and use with the HP app but if you want print speed this is not for you.  I don't print a lot so I can live with it but if you do spend a few $ more for print speed. Also buy an additional set of ink when you order.
5,Great printer. Support not so good
4,Printer is great but for some reason it won't let me finish setting it up on my phone.
5,Printing documents
5,The set up was easy but it is a rebuilt so it was important to read the directions. First it works then it doesn't. It's frustrating and it's going back.
4,Great for documents and shipping labels which is mostly what we use it for photos are on the blurry side but no complains for a $90 printer ink is fairly cheap. The included ink only lasted about 50-60 pages for us but the replacement ink has went longer. If you‚Äôre looking to print photos maybe upgrade.
5,Not much info on setup in the paperwork...I found someone more savvy to swim through the online support.üòèüòè
5,Had no idea I was buying a used printer (my own fault for not reading). But it has been great. Works like new though. Glad I found it.
3,Tough to set up.
3,1 black ink cart apparently only prints 130 pages.
5,Good product value for your money - it was actually somewhat difficult to install took three tries
4,The wireless connection is great once you get it connected but therein lies the problem. It takes numerous times to get it to connect to the wireless.Once you get it working and you have to reboot your modem router or both you have to redo it and it takes several tries.It's an overall pain in the neck to connect this printer to the network.
5,Worked great and took maybe a minute to setup n print
5,The print quality is great! Definitely good value for the money. The thing I like best is that it does not use the color ink jet when printing black and white! I also like that HP has an ink subscription service!
5,Took a while to get it to connect to phone
5,This is a refurbished printer.  My only complaint is that there were no instructions included for setting it up.  I found videos on YouTube eventually that helped me but I‚Äôm a 75-year-old lady and I need instructions I can read.  It took me several hours to set it up!
5,simple very easy to use great for the price!
3,The print quality is excellent. The person who helped me printed out a picture of some flowers and they are beautiful. The ink is great. Unfortunately trying to set it up was a total nightmare. It took a millennial over an hour to figure it out. I could‚Äôve never set it up myself.
5,Works great and easy to use.
5,Office
3,There is little in the was of instructions for installing the printer.
5,Good value
5,Best printer ive ever had
2,I do not print a lot. Maybe 5 pages per week. The ink that came with it was gone within 2 weeks. Bought an XL cartridge and was drained 3 weeks later. I had my setting on econo/draft and it still sucked up the ink.My brand new PC also struggled to stay connected. Every time I print something I had to run trouble shoot align the stars by hand and hope the gods were on my side; otherwise it wasn‚Äôt printing!This printer is not worth the aggravation and amount of ink you need.
5,Es muy buena impresora me gusta mucho
4,I returned to the USA after 50 years in a foreign country. You cannot imagine the amount of documents to be filled out and proofs to be scanned. This printer-scanner was a life saver.
5,This printer was great. Easy WiFi set up from my HP laptop. Once I had an account and the printer set up in my laptop it was easy to install the app from my phone and add the printer on the app as well. It does print a little slow but other than that it‚Äôs great. Love it for the price the scanning snd copying function are great. A great little cheap printer to get things done at home.
4,The printer was needed for a seasonal home and therefore limited use - this refurbished item does the job quite well at a reasonable price
3,No instructions. Set up via an app that refused to connect I had to have IT assist and even they had to spend time figuring out how to set it up. Frustrating. It works well but I didnt expect to waste an hour of my time and IT to get a printer set up.
4,just for coping and printing. it does the job
5,Easy copies in minutesCompact unit and light weightBluetooth copies from phoneGreat copier for the $$$$$
5,This is a printer for my painting studio. It doesn‚Äôt get heavy use there but it does need to be dependable when I do print. I‚Äôve had it a month or so & found it easy to set up easy to use & offers great & consistent quality. Whet else could I need?
4,Like the ease of use and results
4,This was a good product. It was a little complicated to set up but I got the hang of it eventually
5,Bluetooth installed itself for me
3,Not happy as having issues registering it
3,I like that it‚Äôs light doesn‚Äôt take up much space. However it can be slow to connect and print. Also ran out of toner SO FAST. My experience with printers is it takes atleast 6 months to replace toner but this was about a month and a half. I don‚Äôt print more than the next person. Just forms for appointments school etc. I wouldn‚Äôt buy again
5,It was such a great price and had no issues and still having no issues two months later. I needed a printer for homeschooling and it was worth every penny.
4,The printer is ok once it‚Äôs working. The setup is difficult. Once it‚Äôs disconnected from the WiFi it‚Äôs even harder to setup. The buttons are flashing and you don‚Äôt know why. You try to get the information sheet to print out... it‚Äôs just a mess.UpdateI‚Äôm still enjoying the printer. The WiFi still gets silly but overall I love it. The best part is you can fax straight from your phone!
5,Just when I needed a printer that does everything I found this printer only through Amazon! Thank you Amazon for the amazing service and products!
2,The glass was broke.  The colour ink does not work.  I have been told that if I buy a new ink it will work .  I am afraid to do this  I did not return the printer because I had not printer to print the DHL  I am also sure that they will charge for returning the printer.  Note the printer was up_ side down  At the moment I do not know if the scanner will work  I do hope so
5,This reconditioned printer is well worth the money ($80).
4,It's good for what I need it for. I wish it was a new printer but still good.
4,After 4 hours on the phone with tech support the printer was FINALLY set up to print. This was not easy one step set up as described
4,This printer does not come with the USB cable necessary to connect it to your computer.
2,The paper either would not roll down or it jammed up. Had to constantly reset it. I didn‚Äôt need great print quality but I did need it to print. Was mainly for home/personal use so it didn‚Äôt need to be very high quality. But I do need it to work reliably and it was too much hassle to unjam it every single time sometimes I‚Äôd have to unjam it 5 times just to get one clear page. Even bought new paper thinking it was poor quality of the off brand paper I was using. Tried 3 brands of paper same exact issue.
4,Printer is great for small jobs like I use it for set up was not that bad but I did needed  to YouTube how to set it up. But once set up works great. If you pan on doing a lot of color printing it does use a lot of ink for that. So be mindful.
4,it suited my needs...
5,I love how this printer connects to your Internet real fast. Sometimes I have to pack it up and put it away and as soon as I take it out and set it up it automatically connects to my Internet and I can go ahead with my business. I recommend this printer to anyone that needs a printer that works like it should with as little problem as possible!
3,Hard to link to my phone
5,I like the fact this was a refurbished printer kept out of a landfill. It looks and preforms like a brand new one.
3,Great little machine but prints pretty slowly. Especially when printing multiple pages.
3,cheap throw away printer
5,i PURCHASED THIS FOR A LOCAL NON-PROFIT TO USE HEBER SPRINGS (AR) HUMANE SOCIETY.  WAS VERY PLEASED WITH EASE OF OPERATION SET UP AND QUALITY OF PRINTING.
5,Easy to use and the print is very clear
5,I brought for someone else and they were able to contact to phone and computer
5,Excellent printer.
5,Great personal printer for home and ok with not  scanning multiple items or make several copies at once because it not capable of doing that. This all in one printer is a great value for the price. The ink isn't too expensive so you think you could just buy another printer every time you buy ink. The quality and ease to set up is worth the value.
5,Great little black and color printer copier and scanner in a small package for a great price!! Arrived faster than promised too!! Definitely recommend!!
5,Excellent printer! After purchasing two Epson HP printers in the 6700 series which did not work at all I was delighted to discover this simpler printer which uses the same size print cartridges as those others (important because it was too late to return the extra cartridges I had purchased) works quite well. After all the frustration with the more complex printers this made me very happy.
5,Super easy to set up. And a great value for the money we paid. Highly recommend if you're looking for an all-around basic printer but you don't want to spend a ton of money.
5,Even though it was refurbished it looked and prints like brand new without the new price tag. Being wireless I can print from phone or computer.
1,This product was so unbelievably awful that throwing it down the trash chute at my apartment was more cathartic than trying to get my money back. It took two hours to get it to print something and then two days later when I needed to print something else it kept giving me an error because the door on the front was blocking the ink cartridges and upon cutting that piece off the printer no longer registered that the door was closed and wouldn't print.
3,Liked it‚Äôs size aNo price for my home use. Unfortunately did not get to use it because it would not connect to WiFi.
5,Prefect size and good price
1,this printer is a huge headache. trouble connecting to the network and even when it does it just wont print 9 times out of 10 with no logical issue to even fix. save your money and invest in a laser printer.
5,A breeze to set up and use
5,Its ink does not last long print quality is mediocre but the price was perfect for a HP product‚Ä¶.. it serves its purpose! But for more professional type quality I‚Äôd bump it up to a 7100 series..
5,This printer was a renewed idem and it looks a works like a brand new printer/scanner
5,I do love the ease of the printer. It is tricky to set up. So make sure to call your internet company to connect it properly. That‚Äôs what happened to mine.
1,Tried absolutely everything I found online to try to get the printer to connect to my WiFi. Bought it specifically to be able to print photos via WiFi. It would NOT connect. Even hardwire connected it to router and still would tell me it couldn‚Äôt find WiFi connection. Do not reccomend
5,Is Work good
5,It's easy to operate.
5,Easy set up with app
5,Todos muy bien
3,I like it a lot but I can't get it connected to my phone
4,Tardo un poco en conectarse al wifi pero me encanto
1,Product failed within a year. Constantly jammed and did not function well up until the day it finally broke. I was able to use it less than 10 times in total.
1,jfc hp.  just spent the last hour trying to scan a couple of pages.  firstly this thing is totally wireless so you have to download a special app (great! you can print from your phone apparently just can't scan from your desktop) rather than just relying on drivers that use already installed software.  ok fine.  turns out pretty easy prints and copies fine.  but scanning.  not even an option.....unless you open the app!  (one more fing app ive got to keep track of.)  in the app hey there's the scan button not so bad.....except you can't scan a document without creating an account or signing into the account you've previously created.  w.  t.  f.  i just want to scan a document i don't want to create another fing account!!!  they're communicating with each other already!!!!!!!  why would i need to create an account with some service???  f. you hp.
5,I had an issue when it came to putting the computer online with the code.  I went for help thru chat and lost them but tried again with no luck.  So the printer prints wirelessly from your phone when you are on the same network
2,It was fairly cheap so I won‚Äôt complain too much but I needed it for school and the only thing I don‚Äôt like is the front/back printing is manual. And the amount of ink you have to use & it doesn‚Äôt hold much paper
1,I did buy a renewed product and will NOT do again I've had nothing but problems. It prints whenever it wants. Turn off/Turn on helps most of the time but not always.
5,Easy to install following directions from tech available to assist installation. Easy to use. Prints efficiently without hassle.
5,Had it up and going 15 minutes after I  opened  the box. Printer is quiet and of very good quality. Instructions were simple with no hiccups at all.  Thanks for the Experience.
3,Light continues to blink after one print had to shut off then turn on to correct
5,Love it
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†Yes I like it
5,I would have given you a higher rating for tech but I didn't need help.
3,The print quality has lines though the words; and when I tried to fix this by cleaning and print head alignment there was no way to do it!!!!!!!!
5,Good Item !Printer from HP Desktop Printer / Scanner
1,So this was the first printer I‚Äôve bought online. It arrived with black (1) and color (1) ink cartridges. So I was like ‚Äúokay so far so good.‚Äù I plug it up and end up spending about 3-4 hours trying to get it to connect to my computer. Bluetooth is AWFUL. Works with HP Smart app.. but only prints out papers the size of your device in my case was my IPhone 11. So it would print out the whole paper as the screen size of my iPhone. Never got it to connect with my laptop even after trying with a USB port. I.P address kept saying ‚Äúnot registered.‚Äù Or ‚Äúnot found.‚Äù I had multiple friends try to help me. Luckily I had another friend who was giving away their older printer being they do not use it anymore. I give this printer one star simply because I am INFURIATED with it. Total waste of money.
5,Was alittle hard to set up to print  but finally.
5,Quality printing at a great price
2,It was easy to set up but when I tried to print it it said the size of the paper was incorrect. I wanted to fix it change the paper the setup and everything but it didn't work.
5,Good print quality
1,After a few months the printer stopped connecting to the internet. MY internet is fine. After about an hour and a half on the phone with tech support they told me that my internet is the problem.
1,printer does not work....purchased in 12/2021...hard to connect and impossible to use!  it worked for awhile then quit ...very frustrating!
1,If you have an old computer this printer is not for you. I called customer and they told me to buy a new computer they would provide one at a reasonable price.
1,Once upon a time hp printers were good. Then over time they slowly reduced in quality to the sadness that they are today. I purchased this printer to be a reliable resource that I can use when I need it. The printer itself was a pain to get set up and connected via wifi. It regularly has connection issues that require turning the printer off and on with every use. The ink cartridges easily get clogged which requires cleaning.  Bottom Line: Don't waste your time or money and purchase a better printer from a different brand.
3,No written directions whatsoever. Had to pay $295 for online tech support to get it working
1,I do very little printing and this piece of junk--my second one by the way returned the first--could not produce. Both had similar problems including inability to feed paper properly. I will probably return this one also and try a Canon.
1,Paper jams every time. Does not work
5,Very compact and fits on a shelf. Can be used directly connected or over your system wirelessly. Very easy to set up and use.
1,beio printer with a broken flap and the quality of ink quantity for few prints
1,Save your money. Goes through ink like crazy. Impossible to connect to Wi-Fi. Feel like I‚Äôve been scammed by the POS product.
2,Had to download a manual -Finally found that it does not work with high speed Internet.
5,Hard to set up wireless had to buy USB connection cable that was not included.
5,Good printer
5,Easy to set up and good quality!
1,After setting up  through the downloaded driver and laptop app went through the add printer installation process. Then got repeated error messages for cartridge jam and paper jam and reset and powered down and powered up repeatedly. I followed the virtual help desk not helpful. I watched YouTube videos and reset the ink cartridges took out the paper and put it back. Error messages never went away. It never worked. There was no debris or blockage. Ink cartridges were installed correctly. No protective packing tape was left in place prior to trying to print. After navigating the HP Smart window and tabs for hours I give up. I am returning this printer.
1,Does not work will not connect
5,Very good purchase
5,Great product easy set up great value
5,Easy to set up. Prints well and scans well.
5,Great printer ink refills are reasonably priced.
1,Its been 6 months and i and no one else has ever been able to figure out how to set this up. This is beyond user unfriendly in fact ill bet you could take night classes and NOBODY would ever be able to figure out how to set these up.
5,Great printer for the price!!!
5,Quality is great!
1,Paper jams every timeDon‚Äôt buy it!
1,90% of the time this printer won‚Äôt print. Sometimes it says it‚Äôs out of paper and won‚Äôt print even though it‚Äôs full of paper. Sometimes it won‚Äôt print because it says the printer is offline even though the WiFi button is lit up showing that‚Äôs it‚Äôs connected. Sometimes it won‚Äôt print but doesn‚Äôt give an error message.Don‚Äôt waste your money.
5,This is a very good printer.
5,Easy setup
2,the paper gets stuck and I am unable to get the proper tech support and I dont know what to do
1,Does not print properly
1,Rite out of the box the printer Will Not power up.Tech Support is useless... I am NEVER EVER buying anything HP againüò°üò°üò°üò°
1,no program to download to laptop can't SCAN. REMOTELY
5,Its great!!
1,I can‚Äôt get it to pair with my laptop. So I haven‚Äôt been able to print anything. Waste of money.
1,Hey HP!!!! EVER HEARD OF CLIMATE CHANGE? HP needs to join the 21st century and make printers that are affordable and print on BOTH sides without having to buy another piece of equipment to make this happen. Even with the attachment it is NOT possible to print on both sides of paper. This printer is a piece of crap. don't buy it.
1,After 2 days and purchasing extra cables just to operate because it only came with a power cord it will not print it constantly eats paper causing nothing but one paper jam after another this was a complete waste of time and money and has been nothing but a headache  pay a few extra dollars and buy the new one you won‚Äôt be sorry
1,So many problems. Takes forever to connect to wifi tests prints but doesn't print it just rolls the paper through hard to connect from multiple devices. A litany if problems with this thing. Do not buy unless you want to spend hours and days over the phone to get help to get them resolved. Zero stars.
1,Isn‚Äôt able to find my wireless network. Everything wireless in my house has absolutely no problem. Never even showed up on their list once. Tried to call hp to help with this issue and they informed me it would cost $20 a call to get help with any issues.
1,The WiFi aspect hasn‚Äôt worked since I set up the printer. I followed all the directions correctly via the HP smart app with no success. Spoke with customer service and they stated they do not know why it won‚Äôt connect to the internet. The item did arrive early but I cannot recommend the product based on my experience.
1,POS
1,The main reason I purchased this was because of the wireless printing feature. However this printer does no connect to WiFi. I tried my husband tried we watched videos and did everything we can think of about 1 million times to get it to work. Still wouldn‚Äôt connect. Very frustrating. Hours of our lives wasted.
1,wireless does not work after 2 prints
1,I opened up shipping box printer was just wrapped in bubble wrap with ink and cord taped to top.Was able to print 10 copies and out of inkSo out another $30.00Looks to be maybe a refurbishedWhere's the printers box and paper work
1,Just asked for a refund. No offense the printer seems to hate my laptop. I have to type "Services.msc" every time and it did not work. Errors like user intervention the paper problems came out when I tried to set it up. This is the worst product I bought on amazon. Big Nah for me!
1,I've tried several different types of paper. I've tried using less paper. This printer just eats it up. Have yet to successfully print anything and unfortunately I can't return it because it's outside of my return window. $$$$$ wasted!! 10 out of 10 don't recommend
1,Its over complicated to connect you need to go through the entire process again whenever your phone disconnects from the wifi and tech support is shameful as instead of a set up for this specific model of printer they instead direct you to a website about this companys other printers
1,I like the printer. I am VERY unhappy about getting sold a one year subscription for tech support at $295. I will be changing to a different online shopping website. If Amazon is issuing refunds for this $295 surprise please put me on the list.
1,Have had this unit for three months and will be replacing. Ran through two ink cartridges with minimal use already. Would not recommend
1,There isn't any support from a live person.  You have to use the internet and it is sooooo frustrating.  The printer will not print there isn't a error message.  NOTHING!!!! No clue how to get it to print.  Printed before and now will not print.  Hate this product !!
1,It prints extremely slow.  It took 1 minute 16 seconds to print the "test" page and averages 1 minute 40 seconds for a color print.  Also uses a ton of colored ink when printing leaving the paper wet enough to wrinkle.
1,It won't let me log into my account & it don't have a manual so I can learn more about it i want yo replaced it I'm not satisfied
1,It's trash don't buy this
1,I will be returning this asap to much of a hassle and they give you a prepaid card that will not work for your printer it can‚Äôt even print labels
1,Does not include any manual book. Installation is hard even impossible . I encountered errors again and again. Too much time I spent while no result gained.
4,My husband ordered this for me and I was surprised to see that it is an Amazon Renewed product. I felt like this was a lot for a refurbished printer and I was nervous about getting a "used" or rejected printer. But the printer looks great and prints fine. It does not have a screen to connect to wifi so you have to download an app. My last printer had a screen and made connecting to the internet very easy. My husband tried to follow set up instructions online and became frustrated after about 20 minutes of the printer being unable to connect to the online app. I took over and downloaded the app on my phone. The app setup is difficult and faulty; I had to refresh and try again several times. For the first day I could not print from my computer. I had to send things to my phone to print--I was nervous because I don't want to print from my phone forever! Then all of a sudden we could print from our computers. Yesterday we got a new wifi router and therefore a new password. I tried to update the password for the printer. I went to the app and the app couldn't find the printer because it isn't on the wifi. I followed the instructions for the printer to print directions to connect to the new wifi network. These instructions were no help. I ended up having to plug in my husband's computer (mine doesn't have a USB port) to print my document. It is still not connected to the new network and I have given up.I like that this printer can scan too but these days you can scan on your phone. I wish we had purchased a different printer that is easier to connect for wireless capabilities.
1,There were no instructions I had to go to U-Tube to start set up.  Couldn‚Äôt get past connecting to internet. Tried for 3 days to connect!! Just wouldn‚Äôt do it!!
1,This printer does not work! Lights are flashing for no reason and it is not printing at all. I will be returning. Wish I could have given 0 stars.
1,opened ink package with leaking ink cartridge  had to buy new ink . there goes discount . called hp tech support hard to setup . was informed it's out of warranty and cast me 15 dollars if i need more help .
1,Product did not arrive with the USB printer cable that is necessary to set it up in the even that there is a wireless issue. Printer is unusable as is.
1,Requires subscription to set up. Can't use it without paying more
1,Can't print  Can't connect to wi8
1,Sent it back due to set up issues. Just got frustrated.
1,I've tried to get some help with it and I can't figure out how to get it to work
1,To small‚Ä¶ to slow‚Ä¶. Easy connect to internet is not true not worth the $$$$ not worth the headache of sending it back
3,8 out of 10 in my opinion.SET-UP: The initial set-up took me hours. I gave up & contacted Hp chat support. And I‚Äôm pretty tech savvy. Luckily online support was great and got me online in minutes.QUALITY: Could definitely be better but I bought it for basic document printing at home. For basic use it‚Äôs great. I printed a photo on actual 4x6 photo paper just for the heck of it & the quality wasn‚Äôt great. But again best for basic document printing. The color printing quality isn‚Äôt too bad.ID RECOMMEND IT FOR AT-HOME MINIMAL/MODERATE USE. PERFECT IF YOU DONT WANT TO SPEND A TON OR WANT SOMETHING CHEAP FOR SMALL AT HOME PRINT JOBS.
1,You need an hp account to print. You also need to download apps that are very slow
1,Oh please just buy something else this is terrible
1,It didn‚Äôt work so I called tech support and they wanted another $100 to fix it and weren‚Äôt sure they even could.
3,Software archaic. As me mentioned can be annoying to setup. Spits out a new Wifi direct code every time turn it on and need to use the code within two minutes? Come on who is going to steal your printer wifi code off the back and then use your printer from close by. Silly. Also there are confusing array of drivers available. The ones on Windows store are 200mb+ then there is a 100mb+ on HP site as well as 60mb drivers available. Drivers constantly trying to talk you into some deal or offer. Really bizarre experience for 2023. These guys are just dinosaurs and not with the times. Canon was 100x easier to setup.
1,No instructions provided with product. Two days to get connected to network. Spend the money and go through the manufacturer.
1,Terrible product.. giving me a lot of headache
1,Horrible printing quality
1,Real slow printer
1,Print quality
1,No good
3,You MUST use a USB cable to setup the printer then everything works fine. (USB cable is not included) So if you try wirelessly it will have lots of issues with unreliable WiFi connection & account required to scan.
1,This printer is wireless only and needs an app to be able to print from your computer.  Also not only does it take an extra long time to setup properly you also have to sign up for an account through HP to actually use your printer.  The app constantly crashes and the printer loses network connection frequently.  And to make matters worse the printer chews through ink rapidly and has numerous printing errors causing you to have to buy more ink.  I have an easier time having my documents sent to a library to get printed and me driving 10 minutes to go pick it up than I did using this printer.
1,HP WILL NOT ALLOW U TO DOWNLOAD THE FILES AND THEN THEY WILL HELP U ONLY TO TELL U YOUR COMPUTER IS CORRUPT AND THEY WILL WANT TO SELL U SOFTWARE PROTECTION TOTAL SCAM
1,This garbage costs money MONTHLY to use - they charge you a fee - and good luck trying to navigate HPto even pay it - TOTAL TRASH !!!!
1,This printer has a mind of its own. I constantly have to reconnect it to WiFi. When it does go offline I have to troubleshoot and that never works either. I just have to walk away from it and then later hear it in the room printing ten pages from days prior.  And that's been after canceling everything in the queue.  Unplugging it and plugging it back in works about 50% of the time. This printer has just been a nightmare for me. I do not recommend this.
1,What an overpriced piece of literal garbage. Everything about this design is completely flawed. In order to get any sort of instructions on how to simply connect your printer to a network through the useless app you must waste you paper and ink and ‚Äúprint‚Äù instructions to do absolutely anything. A scam a waste and total disappointment. an item that can‚Äôt seem to do the one function it was ‚Äúdesigned‚Äù to do. I wouldn‚Äôt waste even $10 dollars on this steaming pile of trash.Will never purchase another product by HP.
1,If you are thinking of buying this HP desk Jet 2752e you need to think again! I just spent 3 days trying by myself and 2 different HP tech support guys that couldn't help me get it to connect to the WiFi. After around 10 hours of trying to get it to connect I have up and returned it. I will not ever buy another HP product of any kind!
1,Every time I try to print just ONE page I have to keep resetting this because whether it‚Äôs locally connected through USB or Wi-Fi it will either tell me that it‚Äôs ‚Äòoffline‚Äô (it isn‚Äôt) ‚Äòout of paper‚Äô (it‚Äôs not) or just plain ‚Äòerror‚Äô. All  of this is of course communicated through hundreds of unsolicited PRINTED diagnostic pages. Seriously You‚Äôll lose a rainforest of paper and kids college fund in ink cartridges being told by a printer through printed pages that it can‚Äôt print your item. This is a bad product and whoever made it should feel bad.
1,I hate this printer.  I am so sorry I didn't return it in the allowed time.  It won't print a full page even though the preview shows all is well.  Customer service solution is to make sure that the printer setting is on borders but I can't find the setting.  Very unhappy with it.  I'd urge everyone to avoid it.
1,Ignore all the bot/shill 5 star reviews.  All the 1 star reviews you read are accurate.  Very difficult to setup no documentation to help you constantly disconnects from internet.  Also most if the features can't be used unless you install their app.  If you want to scan a document they upload your file to hp cloud then download it back to your computer.  Kiss privacy and security for sensitive documents goodbye.  Spyware anyone?  Also had problems printing basic documents  if it printed at all quality was horrid.  I ended up throwing it in the trash can after 3 uses.  I've had 5 printers since 1991 all of them were great tossed them because they got outdated so I know how to setup/use them.  I'll never buy an hp product again
2,This printer is fantastic for the money - when it works at all. Sometimes it prints right away from my phone or computer and the prints come quickly and are good quality (it‚Äôs even okay for photos to my surprise). But sometimes and there‚Äôs no way to know when it will say it‚Äôs ready but absolutely nothing happens when I send a print job. The app will say it‚Äôs ready the lights on the panel indicate it‚Äôs ready but it just sits there. And there is absolutely no way to get any real tech support. So I‚Äôm pretty much done with whole thing and will try another brand one that at least offers assistance with its products.
2,Pour quality hard to install print pages you don`t ask for.
1,This is the 1st printer giving me so many issues! I mean it says its "it connect wireless" well you'd be lucky if that really happens!!! Be preapred to spend HOURS trying to on/off reset and figuring out how to connect to the WiFi!!! Ohhh and when it finally happens guess what??? This machine doesnt "save" really the WiFi network in the settings so you'd start all over again wasting hours and getting very frustrated by the way to get it to print a piece of paper.Ohhhh thats another issue: paper. It doesnt matter if you put a one page few pages or bunch of pages this machine would tell you there is NO paper!!! So what you do??? Try to push the paper until the roll finally gets it!So do you want to be on a constant "fight" with your printer?? This is then for you.But if not move to another brand or another model!
1,Please don‚Äôt burn your money with this printer ‚Ä¶ Second one I brought and last one  for sure!!! The first one I got stop working out no where just like this one did. This time I decided to open it up and see what was the issue and it appears to be a piece that was glued and it came apart. Not sure how to explain it thoe but it‚Äôs just a MESS. The flashing part it‚Äôs another issue you don‚Äôt even know what it is flashing and takes forever to get the signal to print. You better off this cr*p!!Both of my printers stop working few months after the warranty it‚Äôs not longer active ( NOT EVEN A YEAR) which makes me wonder ‚Ä¶ Do they designed it that way to get you to buy another one ? Loool.You get what you paid for !!!! Cheap a** printer! The only good thing it‚Äôs the printing quality but like it is? I mean thts the purpose of a printer lol
1,‚ÄúYou get what you pay for‚Äù has never been more true with this printer. It is the biggest headache you will encounter. If you plan on printing regularly please avoid this printer. Don‚Äôt put yourself through the stress I‚Äôve put myself through just trying to print simple documents. You get what ya pay for!
1,DO NOT BUY!  This is the worst printer I've ever purchased.  A total waste of money.  The printer kept staying offline.  I contacted HP support and a replacement (same printer) was sent.  Still had the same issue.  Was told they would take it back and issue me a $50 HP gift card.  Not interested in a gift card that I can only use on their website.  Printers on their website is much more expensive then other sites.  So rather than send back this printer in exchange for a gift card that doesn't fit my budget for replacement I've just lost out.  Never again will I purchase anything that HP makes.  BTW I've always purchased HP computers/laptops but will not purchase another one.
1,Setup is extremely difficult with no adequate instructions tech support or usb connector cable included. The software download requires certain apps or system requirements. Not a good buy. Should be no more than $40 brand new
1,Great product Prints very well very overpriced this exact model is $35 new on eBay
1,I will never buy another HP product again. What a joke. I've loaded several apps upgrades and troubleshooting guides. I can run test prints until I'm blue in the face but to get it to be effective and actually run a document is not happening. This product is garbage.
1,Hate this printer! Always goes offline and is a pain to get it reconnected.
5,I had computer difficulties but finally got the printer hooked up. Works like a charm. Print is crystal clear. A very good product at a great price
5,It does everything I need and easy to use.
1,What an amazingly difficult printer to set up. Came with 0 instructions and no print cable. Had to watch a YouTube video on running setup and NEVER would have been able to figure it out on my own.Also note that it doesn‚Äôt print double sided. I feel that should be a minimal standard in 2020.
5,I like everything about this printer easy to use and its very convenient price how long it last working good I don't know because I only had it for 2 days I hope it works for a long time
5,Once I downloaded the app the setup was pretty easy but must admit when I saw a YouTube video because it brought mimimum instructions.
3,I actually have only every had hp laptops &  printers and this printer was a huge let down!
5,Use it for my Christmas pictures
5,Works great but WiFi a bit funky to get working. Overall good solid value.
5,Me encanta tratar en ella
4,I had read some of the reviews before my printer arrived so I knew there was a chance this whole purchase could go bad but it came on time (despite my mixing up my own address); it was set up and running in 20 minutes. I have no issues.
4,It seems easy to use but really uses the ink!
5,Easy setup and I‚Äôve wanted one that you can print from app on my phone
5,No good üòï
5,Printer is a good one for around the house. Printing quality is good but not for a business.I bought it for personal use while on a extended visit with family. Not for heavy use. And for my use it was a very good purchase.
3,This printer did not come with  hard copy set up instructions  I was disappointed  Being a senior citizen  I find it easier to follow " Paper" directions that I can file away for future use
3,Set up was going well until the ink cartridges were installed.  The message on the printer said it did not recognize the color cartridge; both color and black cartridges used were included with the printer.
5,This printer works great for me.  It was east to set up and I‚Äôm terrible at that kind of thing.  I‚Äôm happy with the the job it does
5,And I was SO excited! I‚Äôm a teacher who has been trying to function without a computer for 3 days!! It works great was easy to set up and download manuel. Thank you!
5,Everything about this little compact printer is excellent. Color beautiful smart sleek look and takes up no room. This printer wireless and includes ink??great buy!
5,It literally will do everything you need it to do. I was iffy at first because  of reviews but took a shot in the dark and I'm so glad I did! Love this product perfect  for homeschool.
5,Price was good and shipping free
5,I like  everything about the printer
5,Nice print quality -easy to use - as described
5,I actually got this for my mom but it's perfect for her needs (a few copies a month).  The black ink that came with the copier ran out pretty quick but I'm thinking it was more of a trial ink cartridge than the new one I just bought.
5,I love it. Great primter
5,Set up could be easier. After figuring out how to set up drivers it has worked flawlessly.
5,I needed to exchange will get a different printer my other one was failing and I purchased this and it's function is quicker the printing is super and I'm very happy
4,I purchased this printer as I needed a low cost printer that I could get quickly.  At least where I live this shipped next day for arrival.  I just moved and was living without most of my stuff but something came up that required me to print out some things.  So I ordered this.  It is a color printer so that is a plus.  Setup via my phone worked fine.  It did get stuck in the step where you had to align the print heads.  I finally just unplugged the printer waited a few seconds and plugged it back in and restarted the setup.  It recognized that setup had started and so I just manually did the head align process.  It has been working fine sense.  I haven't been able to figure out if this printer also can be a scanner.  I am currently access it via wifi.  I am happy with it so far.
5,It is a good printer easy to set up and prints well!
1,Pure junk.  HP normally is a pain to set up but after 3 days and using 3 different networks and devices it‚Äôs being set back.  HP could have made the panel a little bigger so you could actually use it for setup
4,Software link included with refurbished printer did not work. Poor customer support from Image Warehouse including not providing working software. Printer worked fine but was unable to connect wireless operation. I got a refund and returned the printer. All I wanted was the software to work wireless.
5,It's perfect for what I need to do super easy to get started and use definitely worth the money
5,Great value for the price. Great print works well with apple products
5,Nothing disliked.  Used for general printing.
4,En realidad la impresora muy buena y muy facil de configurar. La super recomiendo. Lo que me parecio desagradable es que viene con un Kit de Microsoft 365 pero viene utilizado porque no deja descargar dice que la llave ya fue utilizada entonces no entiendo para que envian algo que ya lo utilizo otra persona. Pero en general la impresora es buena.
5,This printer has been fabulous.  It‚Äôs all in one meets all my needs.  It was easy to hook up and I got going right away.
5,Was very easy set up. Working great for my small business
5,This printer is just what I needed for home. Easy set up prints fast and arrived on time. I would recommend the seller and printer.
5,This is an Amazon reconditioned/repackaged/returned product.  Quality of the prints is good although so far I've just done simple lettering documents.  Set-up was a bit strange in that I waited a long time for the software from HP to load.  Actually the icon never showed that it had fully loaded.  But it must have because it seems to be working just fine.
5,Works great very happy
5,Just what I ordered
4,only used twice  will update status later
