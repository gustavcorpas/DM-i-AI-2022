5,So I have a ton of cords in my house at work and in the car to charge a variety of items.  I don't have any I-devices but I do have a myriad of C and micro charges in various length.  I just stumbled upon these charges and read the reviews and was excited at the prospect of having one type of charger for everything.  So before you buy there are some things you should probably consider:First these cords are not for data transfer - they only charge.  If you are in need of data transfer I believe this company has a set of those that they sell in 1ft 3ft 3ft and 6ft lengths. I do data transfer via Bluetooth so this limitation was a moot point for me.Second if you are going to go with this type of charging it only makes sense if you plan to completely convert all your devices over to the magnetic option.  Otherwise you defeat the convenience of the charger cause you still have to have the old charges and pull the adapters out.Third the ends of these chargers are magnetic.  So if you plan to leave this charger plugged in to be ready when you need it understand that it will attach itself to anything magnetic.  So put some thought into where you are placing the cords in your house hold and ensure that you don't have anything magnetic near where the cord will be sitting.  If its unplugged it is just an inconvenience but if it is plugged in - it MIGHT be a fire hazard. I already had my "charging stations" in places where there isn't anything magnetic around so I'm fine with this but it is something you should plan for.Lastly the magnetic hold of the chargers are NOT strong enough to pick up the phone by the charging cord. I believe the picture in the advertisement is misleading because if you attempt to pick up the phone by the charging cord it will fall and disconnect.  This is not a flaw of the cord this is by design.  If the magnetic hold were really strong enough to pick up your phone you would have a very hard time of disconnecting your phone from the charger and even risk damage to your phone if it pulled the adapter out of your phone.With that in mind I calculated that I would need two packages in order to change everything in my house car and office over to magnetic charging.  So I ordered two packages and they arrived the next day.  THAT made me happy to get them so fast.Each package has a 1' 3' and two 6' cords.  One of the 6' cords has the charging on the side which allows for 360 degrees of rotation.  Each cord is packaged individually.  There are two small clear containers that contain 6 adapters (2 of each kind per container).I ordered Thursday evening received them Friday evening and I'm writing this review on Monday. The first thing I did was open both packages and set the 8 cords to the side.  I emptied the 4 clear containers of the adapters and separated them into 3 piles by type.  I gathered up all my devices and started placing the adapters inside each device. I was worried about my phone because I carry it inside a wallet case but I worried for nothing because I was able to leave my phone in its case and the adapter fit perfectly in the phone. (If I want to remove my phone from the case I will first have to remove the adapter). I had plenty of adapters to go around and when I was finished I placed the extras inside 3 of the 4 clear containers by type and used a black marker to mark on the back what type each container had so I could easily find an adapter for any future devices.  I then went through my house and started replacing the cords.  I had NO IDEA how many cords I actually owned until I started gathering them up!!!! The one 1' cords went into the cars and one of the 6' cords was set aside to take to the office.  The remaining cords were placed around the house and I actually ended up with an extra 6' cord that I didn't open (always great to have a spare).  Gathered up the old chargers and placed them in a rather large box and put them in the garage in case I needed to go back to the "old way".  (I did leave one small Micro Cable beside my bed for my wireless earbud charging.  I only have to charge the case once a week and putting an adapter in the case didn't make any sense).These things are fantastic!!!  My house is no longer cluttered with charging cables.  Where I used to have two cables per "charging station" (one in the wall ready and the other type sitting on a table/counter beside the outlet) I now only have one in the wall ready to go.  All weekend I would just pick up one device and then put another device on to charge and the charger would "click" into place.  I didn't have to exert any effort to insert the charger I just put the device close to the charger and the magnet did its job.  The time it took to charge my devices was just as good as the "old way" if not faster.  The one foot cord was a little short from what I am used to in the car but the 3 foot would have been too long.  Since my phone hooks to my car when I'm in it it wasn't too much of an issue but I think a 1 1/2 foot or 2 foot cord would have been perfect.  I would have been able to place my phone in the holder that I have instead of just laying it on the console and hoping it doesn't fall off.  BUT the ease at which it connects/disconnects is worth the short cable. If they ever have an option of a 2' cable I will buy it.Also I LOVE the blue light at the end of the cable that lets you know there is power.  One of my places to charge is when I'm sitting on the couch and the biggest problem I have had with the old way of charging is because the cord is behind the couch - it sometimes comes out of the wall and I don't know this until I plug my phone in and notice it isn't charging.  With the LED light on these chargers I KNOW before I even sit down whether the cord has power.  This was a benefit that I wasn't expecting but was huge plus for me.I have already suggested this product to two of my co-workers and I believe everyone should switch to these! Just the convenience of no longer switching cables and having them laying around everywhere was worth it.  The ease of charging is just icing on the cake. The adapters are minimal and do not detract from the aesthetic of the device but even if they were bulky I would use them.  I don't ever see myself going back to the "old way" of charging unless there is a big quality issue that comes up later.  I have only had them for a few days so if I experience any quality issues with the cables I will update my review.  As of today I would highly recommend this product.
4,Instead of this set I'd recommend this (fully compatible) TOPK set with more cables including TWO long L-shape (right-angle) cables:  https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B094V9VXTFThese work just fine but the straight non L-shape cables lose their connection briefly whenever you tug on the cable just a bit.  That's why I'd go with the above set.  Anywhere you're going to be using your phone/tablet while it's plugged-in I'd stick with L-shape cables unless you've got some extremely thick case that won't allow them to work.  I'll throw the straight cables in my travel bag and perhaps my car where little annoyances like that won't matter so much for as relatively rarely as they're used.Otherwise I love these:* Since you have tips which stay permanently in the USB (or i-device) socket your phone's charging port never gets full of pocket lint and needs cleaning.* There's less chance of damage to your charging port from exceeding the thousands of connect/disconnect cycles the port can handle to pushing/pulling at an angle and damaging it.* The L-shaped cables swivel very easily and disconnect if you pull on them preventing damage to your device.* The magnetic cables connect very easily you just get your device within an inch of the cable and it'll magnetically connect up itself.  No fumbling around in the dark trying to plug in your charging cable.* No need to swap changing cables when you want to switch between charging older micro usb devices versus newer usb-c devices.  And it's so easy to connect/disconnect devices lots of places I previously had two cables I only need one.* The charging cables are thin light and flexible including the 10ft lengths.  Typically longer USB cables get rather thick heavy and inflexible making them unpleasant to use.* However I do HATE the blinding bright blue LED shining out the rear and sides making it difficult to sleep in the same room as your phone is charging.  The LED shining out the front is fine where you can see it when nothing is connected but gets blocked when a device is plugged-in. I needed to go around the rest of the plug with a few inches of black electrical tape to block the light.  Perhaps black paint would be a better fix.  There are some compatible magnetic cables with a special swivel head which do this right but I hear they are fragile which I can certainly believe by looking at the mechanism so those are out of the question for me.
5,Used many of them and gave others away to relatives and friends.When I bought them I was using a Pixel 4a 5G phone. It did not have Qi wireless charging. These cables worked perfectly for my needs. I have several around the house and in the car. Very Happy.Just bought a Pixel 6. It has Qi wireless charging. That little dish runs in the high teen$. And I have to buy a 20 watt wall charger and would only have 1 charging station.The Pixel 6 needs a 20 watt wall charger to work with the USB-C to USB-C cord. However these cables I love and of which I have many produces 12 watts. I have not tested them yet but I am sure the 8 watt charging difference will not want to make me jump off a bridge.
5,I’ve been using the cords for a couple of weeks now and so far so good. Not fast charging (?) but they work and charge my headset phone tablets and switch just fine. But the best was the customer service one of my cords wasn’t working I contacted support and they sent out not one but two new cords right away which I received super quickly. People seem to be after magic fast super powered cables and that’s not going to happen. I haven’t found any that do that but these? I don’t have a complaint service was great cables charge and they send plenty of pieces for various inputs you might need. A+ in my book.
4,I hope you guys keep improving this product.  It's very useful!  I wish I could get them without the LED I use them in the bed room and it's too bright.  A few times my ipad would say it wasn't charging and I have to reconnect but still good.  It also becomes hot after some time of use would be great if there was something wrapping the hot parts.
5,I bought a new charging cable to use in the car and was disappointed when it was made of such cheap metal that it wouldn't stick to my magnet mount (which is where I store my charging cable when not in use).  I asked my wife to order a new cable and to make sure it would stick to a magnet. She found this product and ordered it. When it arrived I was like "You're crazy. This will be so annoying." But after using it for just a day I have to admit that it's so much better than any other charging cable I've ever owned and I made her order a bunch more.These charger cables are so excellent. I have an iPad a Pixel 2 XL and a pair of headphones all that have different charging connectors. I used to have to keep three different charging cables in all the places that I might need to charge them. Now I have one charging cable in each location and it connects to all of them.When I first got it as I said before it was annoying because I'd have to remove the little insert in places like the car where I didn't have the cable. Now I have one in the office the living room my bedroom all of my cars and in my bag for when I'm out and about.The magnet is fantastic very strong but not so strong that the device would be ripped out of your hand if someone yanked on the cord. It is self centering so you can literally connect it to your device by tossing it near your device. I do that sometimes just for fun.In the set we got one of the connectors is on it's side while the rest were straight-on connectors. I use the side connector for use in bed. I've trashed so many cables over the years because while I'm reading I crush the connector between my body and the device as I prop it up. This side connector is perfect because it kinda rotates out of the way and is flat enough that nothing has to bend.One downside is that the blue LED on the end of the cable is so bright! It will blind you to look right at it. Most of the time this is a nice feature that helps me find the cable even if it gets pushed under the sofa. But at bedtime I find myself putting something on top of it so it doesn't light up the room. (Although when I have to get up to go to the bathroom I can always find my phone in the dark.)Another downside is that the insert does create a small bulge at the base of my phone which very occasionally makes it not quite work with a particular cradle that relies on using the bottom edge of the device for support. Android phones will allow you to use the device upside down so this sometimes solves that problem. But this happens so rarely I hardly ever encounter it.With my iPad Pro (first generation) it's a bit annoying to have to remove the insert in order to insert the Apple Pencil for charging. But frankly the design of that first generation Apple Pencil was so poor it's annoying no matter what. They have fixed the problem in current iPad models as the Pencil charges on the side of the device using a magnet of its own.I know it's too much to ask for but this should be the new standard for charging for all devices. It's so elegantly beautiful in design and function. So yes my wife was right. She saw the value of this system right away. It was the first time she was right so hopefully she'll build on this success and there will be many great purchases to come.
4,I am a tech nerd and have lots of different devices.  I hate having different charging cables coming or charging adapters to accommodate different types of USB or Apple proprietary charging cables. With this set of cables and its generous amount of USB and lightning cable adapters I pretty much need just one cord to keep everything charged.  The cool thing is that I put the little metal thingee into the USB slot of the device and they can all share the same cable.  This is life-changing stuff if you have dozens of devices all thirsty for charging.The good:- Nice assortment of lengths- The cables seem pretty durable with a woven cable guard instead of the cheap plastic wrap on lesser cables.- Charging is not high speed but it is certainly fast enough for every device table phone earbud etc. that I own.- There is a cool blue light at the end of the cable that helps you locate the ends especially useful in dark places like beneath the car dash.The Bad:- The metal charging tips are slightly wider than my Pixel 6 phone so the kinda stick out a bit and take some getting used to.  I have had them on for a couple of months now and no longer notice them but it bugged me for a those first few days- If you have a lot of devices you will need more of the metal tips than are provided in this kit.  I need a lot more tips than cables (since the devices can share the cables).  But I don't see a way to buy just the tips.The ugly:- While I love the blue light glow it is can be super bright in a very dark room.  When I turn my lights out in the bedroom the blue glow seems a little too bright.  I wish there were at least one cable in the pack without the light.Overall Grade: Solid "A"
4,The system is great.The light on the connection soot is very bright blue.  I have to block it with an object on my nightstand.  Its worth it but it brings the rating down a star
4,Good product
5,This kit comes with several cord lengths and a little container full of various adapter tips. I just leave the adapter tip in place on my kindle phone speaker etc.. It lies (very nearly) flush and stays in place. The magnetic tip on the charging cord grabs easily and charging time seems about the same. It's so nice to just have a single cord that's always the right one sitting on the table.  Since it comes with 4 cords I can leave one in the living room bedroom & car. The lack of irritation alone has made this pay for itself. Also not having to replace my Kindle - again - because the plug was already getting loose after a year - again - makes me happy. Have only had this for a month so far but am 100% pleased with this purchase.
5,Works great. But magnet loses its pull after a year or so of regular use. But they're cheap enough to just buy some more. I use them to charge my headsets controllers remotes etc. That way the Micro USB on the expensive headset and stuff doesnt get wallowed out.
4,The short cord is the perfect length for my car! Since they are magnetic I can stick it to my metal lamp when I’m not using it so I don’t have to look for it on the floor or suck it up in the vacuum! The only thing I don’t like is the bright blue LED on it at night! I can’t sleep with that on! I ended up wrapping it in electrical tape and now it’s not too bad. It still shines light out of the connector part.
4,Magnet is strong enough to stay connected and won't easily fall off. Cable has nice braided feel. Handy that ends are illuminated making finding it easily in the dark.Adapter tip will eventually break or fall apart if you put on a mobile phone subjected to a lot of daily movement. Mine lasted about 4-5 months. Glue holding it together isn't that strong. Be sure to buy extra tips.
5,These are very convenient to use and a great idea the product was great at first but one of the magnets fell off of one of the cords and one of the prongs on another cord was too short to make contact with the prong/button. The other three still work great though. Just another cheaply made product but still worth the price. No quick charging either.
4,these only work for charging so they need to be removed for data. Having said that they work GREAT for charging. We ordered a second set. We are in a marine environment and it's great having the end of the unit mounted in the phone base to help it keep the salt environment out. Not sure about durability but we will certainly find out
5,Very convenient that I don't need a different cord to charge each of my devices anymore especially nowadays where it seems like everyone has some kind of outdated/proprietary port. I use it to charge my wireless headset quest 2 bt speaker tws earbuds xbox controller and switch pro controller with one single cord. I have found that the usb-c pieces sometimes don't stay in the ports though. I think it just has to do with how worn the port is on your device but I'm not sure.
3,The magnet is so strong it is difficult to disconnect without taking the whole thing out making the entire magnetic part useless (at least for USB-C)Also one of the six foot cords is really bad and instead of two hour charging time like my previous one and the rest of them bundles it becomes 19 hours charging time
4,We've had these for 2 1/2 months. I really like them but need a few more. I don't want to buy a whole package though just a few cords and I don't see that for sale.  The one foot cord is basically useless; my device is never that close to an outlet.  The magney is also not at strong as purported it detached fairly easily and always has.  I like that the connection keeps the port free of dirt and dust esp with my husband's often dirty job.
5,Had an s8 for years and the charger port went out in the final 8 months I used this product. Upgraded to the S22 Ultra that this product unfortunately does not fast charge. Still a good purchase simply because the ends can stay inside whatever you need to charge and you only need one cord to charge most things.
5,Work welldifferent lengths good charging
4,I purchased these after having purchased many standard charging cables. My preteen son would get a cable use it for a while between his controllers tablets and phone (USB charging) and wind up breaking the adapter or the charge port of the device itself. It had to do with him removing and reinserting the cables. With these he has not broken one cable. I will be purchasing more as my cats ate through one of the cables right after we bought it (hence 4/5 for durability). They have left the other cables alone. We are now running into the problem of having run out of USB adapters so I will be getting new ones of those as well. This will give me the ability to use it in my car also without having to remove the adapter. The 1-foot cord is not really useful for us and we don't have need for fast charging. It will charge my phone even while I'm using it just slower than when I'm not.
5,These are awesome.  The charge is lower than a standard cord but good enough for our purposes.They disconnect easy enough but can be tricky to fit on with some cases/protectors.Warning...they are magnetic...so when one goes missing in the couch it will likely get stuck somewhere to the metal frame! (Ours ate 3 before I figured it out).
5,Need more I phone tips
3,These looked like a good idea but there's a problem if you have a cover on your phone.  My plastic phone cover fits tightly on the phone with cut outs for the charging port and other parts of the phone.  The opening for the charging port isn't large enough for the magnetic adapter to fit fully into the port so it pulls out easily.  If you're determined to make these work you could try making the opening larger but I wasn't that determined so will return them.
4,This is a neat concept that provides a couple of useful actions.  I primarily bought it for the plug that goes into a bike computer micro USB slot that does not have a cover.  I thought the included plug would help protect the slot from collecting dirt and debris and it does. The package though offers the excellent option of having one cord that can be used to charge multiple electronic devices rather than having to have two or three cords because of the terminal connections (Micro USB Lightning and USB-C). It could/should have included a mini USB as well but doesn't however I suspect those can be purchased if needed.  The round magnetic connectors are a bit larger than the plug end so while they do help protect the slot they can also be in the way on certain devices such as an iPhone where the connector is larger than the phones thickness.  This could be a problem on deeply recessed plug slots. Once in place they are snug enough to remain in place but still relatively easy to remove. However they are small so easy to misplace if removed and not placed back in the small plastic storage case that comes with the kit.  The charging cables seem to be well made and durable.  They have a blue LED that glows while plugged in to show you the cable is getting power.  The magnet is sufficiently strong to enable charging and not easily be knocked loose. I'm not sure these allow as much charge to flow as a standard cable however.  On my bike computer when charging with a standard cable I can push a button to check the current charge level.  That feature does not work when using this cable.  Instead I have to turn the unit on to see the charge state. It obviously does charge the unit and seems to charge at a similar rate to the standard charger but this issue could be potentially problematic. All things considered I'd buy this again and do recommend it to others.
5,This is perfect for my VR controllers and a few other things - and even better the fact that it's a magnetic connection for charging allows for breaking away in case of a drop (instead of breaking the connector).  A fine way for charging your USB stuff.
3,I've enjoyed the easy charging connection for some time but there are some issues with the cable durability.Twice now I've managed to damage a cable in a way that shorts out the USB power supply. They were on different chargers and both chargers had current limiters so they didn't get damaged. But all the other devices on the charger were then not charging.First incident was closing the lid on the cabinet where the charger is hidden and the cable was pushed to 90 degrees a bit. Second incident was the cable was on the floor and got tangled in my shoe and snapped taught. Both caused the cable to short out internally.
4,I've seen a few magnetic cables on crowdsourcing sites and wanted to own some with low-cost entry. Mainly because all my cable tends to fray at the connector or even the connector comes apart due to frequent use/abuse (i.e. pulling out putting in etc...). The great thing about these is that you get multiple USB type caps to put into your device and leave them there. The cable package comes in varying lengths and types so you can have one in the office in your car or anywhere else you would need to charge your device.I was a bit worried that my QC2.0 devices will not get a quick charge but it is pretty close. I say this because if I use a standard braided non-magnetic cord on my device I may have 60 mins of fast charging but if I switch to the magnetic cord it will be 65-70 mins. The alternative would be to use a non-QC charger which will put you at up to 2hrs. For now this is just what I need so that I can easily disconnect my device switch which devices need charging or prevent nasty falls like if my pet happens to pull on the card just hard enough it would generally cause my phone to fall but now the cable will just come off.This review is using these cables for about two weeks. Assuming they last for a month or longer is yet to be seen but I would expect them to be good for a long time.Update 6/26/2020: Dropped by one star because as of 7 weeks of ownership the cords are still in great condition but at least two of my magnetic connectors have failed not charging device. The order does come with multiples across the different types but wanted to warn others that this may happen. Not planning on ordering replacement connectors yet as I have two full sets and several dupes to replace for now.
5,Update: So I use one of these to charge my Xbox controller and it's been great. The other day I went to grab it to hook to the controller and the end was scorching hot like burned my finders hot. Turns out the magnet hooked onto 'something' rounded and metal and was shorting it out for a few hours. The plastic inside the end was oozing out and the center connector moved around inside. Needles to say that cable no longer works. It's not like it's the cables fault or anything but you need to watch the end when you unplug it from your device the magnet will stick to other metal items and while the center pin is ever so slightly inset (like maybe 1/64") if it connects to something with a little curve to it it can short out.All in all I still love these cables and connectors and I just bought another set.I have had these a little over a week and they are great so far.I got these because my iPhone 7 got to where the cable was sometimes not perfect and I would wake up to a phone with 7% charge on occasion.The adapter fit into the phone very snug (not going to have any connection issues here) and I love that I can just put the cable near it (haphazardly) and it connects. I also put one on my iPad and my Xbox One controller.The only issue I have had so far is that the cable has a blue LED on the back of the connector and they are bright well my iPad and phone sit on the shelf on the headboard of my bed and it lights up the entire room (I like to sleep in a very dark room). I ended up using a black paint marker to cover this part of the cable and now it's perfect. When the cable is unplugged you can still see the LED on the end so no issues hooking it up in the dark.I am slightly concerned that over time the ends may corrode a little and prevent a perfect connection so I will come back and update this if that ever happens but for now I am very happy with them.
5,I have 2 kids ages 7 and 3. The youngest is obsessed with his “iPad” [tablet] but he somehow jacked up the charging port so anytime it gets plugged in the charger has to be sitting a certain way inside or it won’t charge. He doesn’t sit still very well (imagine that!) and he would move and it would stop charging lose battery and die. Then crying ensues and the day is ruined. I was praying this would be an answer and it totally is!!!!! Not only does the port fit in there super securely but it’s very easy for him to “plug it in” since it’s a really strong magnet that connects it to power. I cannot be happier for this remedy. Not sure how fast it charges but I don’t care honestly. I just wanted something to keep my kid from crying every time his tablet “kicked him out” and this wins.I feel like it keeps the charging port healthy too because it stays in there instead of having to take it in and out all the time. I’m ordering more cables for sure
