5,This receiver replaced a twelve year old unit from another good manufacturer and the sound quality is distinctly better than my last unit.  In order to correctly setup this unit it must be attached to a television screen so you can work your way though the menus and then there's a setup microphone which must be stationed in the locations most likely to be filled with listeners.  During the setup process a program is played through the various speakers and the speakers' performance and room's acoustics are detected.  After a few minutes the process ends and the receiver produces an excellent level of performance that's customized to your seated location speakers' output and room's acoustics.  It was a little bit of a pain in my ass and it stressed me out but the result is worth the hassle.
5,I am an audio buff and needed something low cost that would handle hdmi 4k passthru that I could trust. Denon was made for this lolThe appearance is awesome.  The handing of movie and music sounds at low volume is perfect and it handles the loud stuff with ease.The remote is almost dummy proof with it’s buttons that are labeled for the input you want to change it too. Genius.Only issue is with lower priced units you don’t get the super advanced audio features that the newest 4k discs may have. But that is not necessary for normal usage and I am running five speakers and a subwoofer just fine!Someday I will upgrade when I can afford it but for now this unit is perfectly fine for what I would hope for at this price.
1,I bought this to replace/upgrade a 17-year-old non-HDMI Dolby Digital/DTS receiver that was still going strong but couldn't decode/convert Dolby Digital Plus into Dolby Digital from some Fire Stick streaming apps. The legacy receiver also couldn't take advantage of the new high-resolution digital audio formats like Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD from Blu-Ray discs. As good as the old unit is and as good as Dolby Pro Logic II is at converting PCM stereo into "simulated" 5-channel surround sound being stuck at home all the time got me thinking it might be worth trying an upgrade to something with all that current technology. (I should note also that I don't have a 4K TV and neither need nor intend to go there anytime soon.)Did the Denon AVR-S540BT fit the bill and meet expectations? Read on.As for the streaming apps I can now get DD or DD+ from HBO Now and Movies Anywhere but Disney+ still outputs PCM Stereo only. That was a bit of a bummer but I understand it's an issue with that app on this device not with the receiver.As for the new audio formats here's where it gets a little weird: When I first set this up I could only get PCM stereo from the Blu-Ray player over HDMI; I could get DTS or Dolby Digital only through the legacy digital/coaxial connection. That was another bummer and seemed -very- strange. I futzed with the settings on both the receiver and the player initially to no avail but later upon retry was able to receive both Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD from different discs without really knowing what I'd done right in the interim. So I'm glad about that and we'll see if it continues; meanwhile I'm looking forward to re-watching some of these Blu-Ray movies with high-resolution sound for the first time.I like the fact that the unit automatically switches to "TV Audio" when I switch from an HDMI device to the antenna/tuner (and back) and ARC is something I haven't used before as my old receiver didn't have HDMI. However the TV audio over HDMI kept cutting in and out so I had to reconnect the legacy TOSLINK/optical cable as a backup which seems to work OK (and broadcast signals are in Dolby Digital so there's really no difference). As with the Blu-Ray we'll see how this shakes out but again it was a little disconcerting.Setup was fairly simple and it's going to take some time to get used to the controls and menus vs. the old receiver although there are a couple of things that stood out. I like the automatic calibration with the microphone and hope it results in superior sound. My old receiver had discrete input buttons for each source (6 total); this one doesn't but I can program the QuickSelect buttons for the ones I need. My old receiver also had the ability to program a custom name for each source to be shown on the front display which this unit conspicuously lacks and a "TEST TONE" button on the remote that was very convenient if I needed to check the speaker connections which I really wish this one had as well. The volume control response seems a little sluggish compared to the old unit. I'm also not crazy about the volume control/level and other information popping up on the TV screen but that's not a big deal and I'm sure I'll get used to it.What else? I like that it's compatible with my Harmony One universal remote that it plays well with my existing speakers and is about the same size as the old unit so it fits nicely in the cabinet. The built-in Bluetooth and USB are also nice features that my old receiver didn't have; although I don't foresee much use for them it's nice that they're there. It'll take some time before I can really fully evaluate how easy the receiver is to use how well it plays with my other equipment and of course how good it sounds. I'll come back and update this review in a couple of weeks or so.UPDATE:I've had no further issues with Blu-Ray audio formats and better still I discovered I can get DD+ from Disney+ by running my 1st-generation Chromecast through the receiver and casting from my phone. So that's good news.The receiver sounds really good and I think it was worth the upgrade but one thing about it really bugs me: the volume control response. For some reason I'm finding it really hard to get the volume set right; it always seems either too loud or too soft requiring constant adjustment (this is probably due to better resolution of the source audio and channel splits vs. the old receiver) particularly when switching between a Dolby Digital source like Netflix or Prime and a PCM stereo/ProLogic II source like YouTube TV. Because of that I'm using the volume control a lot and the unit's response is just ... well it's hard to describe. It feels kind of sluggish in that it takes a split-second longer to respond than it should; if you hold the Vol+ or Vol- button down it starts very slow and then gets very fast. The result is a lot of back-and-forth adjustment that occasionally gets frustrating. The old unit felt a lot smoother.All in all this is not a deal-breaker; I'm going to chalk it up to me being used to the old unit that lasted 17 years and needing to get used to the new one. But adjusting the volume is one of the most fundamental and often-used functions on any audio device. It shouldn't be an issue at all.UPDATE 2:Two months in the receiver's HDMI control functionality suddenly completely without warning and for no apparent reason stopped working. Meaning the receiver didn't turn on and off with the TV didn't automatically switch to TV Audio (over ARC) when the TV switched to antenna TV volume didn't control or sync the receiver volume and HDMI CEC control of connected devices was gone. All troubleshooting (on TV receiver and devices) failed and it became clear the problem was the receiver. I ultimately did a factory reset necessitating from-scratch setup (including re-calibration of the speakers) and that seems to have restored normal functions for now; however it's alarming that this receiver should have a major malfunction like this after only two months so I'm deducting a star from my prior rating. Let's hope this doesn't happen again.UPDATE 3:24 hours later it happened again; HDMI control just stopped working. I called Denon's tech support number and got a recording saying it was closed even though it was before 6pm. Had to do another factory reset. Deducting another star.UPDATE 4:Denon customer service is literally impossible to reach through its website. There is no live chat; the website mentions e-mail and provides what appear to be links to e-mail support but there is no e-mail address shown and the links to e-mail support require a login which once established lead to other places. I was clicking in circles for 20 minutes. And as mentioned above the website indicates that phone support closes at 6pm on Fridays but when I called at about 5pm I got a recording saying it was already closed. I'm deducting another star will never buy another Denon product and will pursue other recourse through state and local consumer-protection agencies since Denon is clearly not interested in supporting its products.
4,A good receiver/amp is 1 all about the sound 2 ease of use.  This is my experience after 1 week.After the problems listed below were solved the sound was pretty good not great.  I found the overall sound to be a bit bright for AV and music.  For this reason I marked it as 4 stars plus the setup settings glitch.  All AV switching worked well and supported all UHD and Dolby formats that were sent to it. The settings with the one exception were easy to find and use.  The remote has a good layout and is also easy to use.  This is  Denon's lower line receiver so I cut it a break. It would be better if they had put in a more active tone control to suit individual tastes.  The connectors on the back of the receiver are not the best so treat them with care.  I do have to turn it up quite a bit to get a good listening volume about halfway.  That's pretty far for its rated power.The physical setup of the receiver was easy and quite intuitive.  The pdf manual is pretty good.  I did not use the "Setup Assistant" so I can not speak to it's ease.  Connect and plug things in where it says to and zip tie where needed to keep things neat.  I used all medium line high speed cables and wires.  Don't waste your money on the expensive stuff.  I manually set up my speakers and components.  I plugged in a ROKU streaming stick plus a 4K blue ray PS 4 TV audio optical.  Main video out to an Optoma projector and speaker outs to 2 Large front speakers 2 med. surrounds and a center speaker.Everything worked fine but there was a definite lack of bass in the large front speakers.  I made sure the sub woofer was off in the settings.  I called support to check to see if there was something I missed but they said all my setting were correct for my setup....they did their best to help.  After playing with the settings by accident I found the the subwoofer was in the wrong mode.  But the mode was not available to change because I had the subwoofer off.  Because I was not using a subwoofer this should not be a big deal but there is a glitch in the firmware.Procedure for having large front speakers with no subwoofer.  Go to setup--"Speakers"--"Manual setup"--"speaker config".  Set the subwoofer to "on" then go back to manual setup.  Choose "Bass"  and set "subwoofer mode" to LFE.  It is in "LFE + Main" by default.  Go back to "speaker config" and set the subwoofer to off and front speakers to large.  To verify the bass is gong to the front speakers go to "crossovers" in manual settings.  The front speakers should now show "Full Band" not a Hz setting.  Your sound will be much better.  I did inform Denon support of this problem and solution.  I did try the Setup Assistant to see if it would pick up this problem and it didn't so the same problem would have existed if I had used it. (subwoofer mode was incorrect and front speakers were not set to Full Band) I did read many reviews before I purchased it.  Receivers like this can be complicated to set up if you have no experience because of the many cables and settings of not only the receiver but also the components you plug into it.  Get help if you need it.  Most of the issues I have read about were being caused by improper setup/settings.
4,What a nice receiver! Great sound for not so great investment.
4,I like the interface using the TV screen. It was easy to set up. The only issue is I couldn't get it to connect to my Samsung phone via Bluetooth. I have more investigating to do but that was my only issue. Otherwise it sounds great and looks good too.
5,Ups sucks
5,Great sound quality and performance!
4,I have purchased 2 of these a couple of years apart. Both were for our church. The first one worked so well when we needed a second I did some research again and went with the same receiver. It does what we need for events when we may have several different input devices. The output is to an HD projector. The receiver handles it well and is easily switched between inputs either via remote or directly via the front panel. For the money this is a pretty good value and good receiver. Passes through  Blu-Ray video and audio very well. Good sharp image and good sound quality.
5,Better than I thought it woild be .. I have built in wall speakers and added a klipsch sub sounds great !
3,UPDATE: I now have two DENON receivers one more powerful version in my living room and a less powerful Denon in my bedroom. The DENON is a fine home theater system for all the reasons I state below. My PROBLEM with all Denon receivers is they are a TOTAL BEAST to set up manually. You can connect all speakers to the required ports and spent hours if not literal days mining their overly complex stupid on screen interface. Making all the speakers active is a chore so complex it made me want to throw the Denon receiver away and get another many times during installation. Trust me DENON systems are built to be extremely frustrating on the verge of being torture to set up. Honestly I would avoid Denon receivers until their so called engineers make the manual set up of speakers easier. All they have to do is put a selection that says would you like to make "ALL CONNECTED SPEAKERS ACTIVE YES or NO." Then let you set up the particulars of each speaker to your own taste. Instead Denon uses a labyrinthine confused menu and sub-menu system that is pure torture to understand access and implement during any configuration. The Denon system is especially BAD when ATTEMPTING TO MAKE ALL SPEAKERS ACTIVE. The Denon receivers are a great system trapped behind a Gawd awful poorly implemented system management interface that should be scrapped. I now rate the Denon THREE STARS BECAUSE THE MANUAL SPEAKER SET UP IS PURE OVERLY COMPLEX MINDLESS TORTURE! The Denon seems to have been made by the best engineers then handed over to the worse interface programmers to ever exist on Earth! The Denon Set Up Interface developers ruining what is otherwise a first class receiver at every price point!ORIGINAL POSTI live in a smallish home and as an old man I am not interested in blasting my neighbors out of a sound sleep. I want to play my video games enjoy my DVD's have a blast watching Netflix and Amazon streaming. This Denon AVR-S540BT Home Theatre suits my basic needs well. Last Christmas I brought a Sony 85 inch 4K TV so I wanted a receiver that could fully exploit the 4K display technology of my new system as this Denon AVR-S540BT Home Theatre can.While this Denon AVR-S540BT Home Theatre can get a bit loud it is not ghetto blaster rock the M&M's in the neighbors kitchen candy dish LOUD! The sound does not easily distort even at the higher levels. I'd suggest using quality speakers speaker wire and HDMI connectors with this unit since cheaper connectors do degrade the video performance. Cheap HDMI connectors will result in a purple noise on the edges of the screen that is not present when better HDMI connectors are used.No I am NOT saying use the gold plated $99 dollar HDMI connectors as that is useless overkill. However don't use the cheapest HDMI connectors that are so thin that noise can get into the cable. Now if you are in a huge building with elevators and lots of LED and other commercial lighting sources you need HDMI cables that shield against RF Noise caused by elevator motors LED lights and other RF sources. The antenna that comes with the unit is adequate for most uses.The Denon AVR-S540BT Home Theatre is easy and straight forward to hook up. You will NOT need expensive Banana Plugs to connect speakers. Speaker connections are accomplished by straight forward button actuated speaker wire grab connectors. HDMI connections are simple. This Denon AVR-S540BT Home Theatre is intuitively laid out making connecting the correct things a breeze. Since the Denon AVR-S540BT Home Theatre is a very basic 5.2 unit there are few connection points and options.The dedicated sub woofer circuits seems a bit underpowered in this unit not bad but not the best either. Ease of use is awesome in that it is so simple and clearly laid out you hardly need to read the instructions for the basic Denon AVR-S540BT Home Theatre functions. The control interface is clean on the front of the Denon AVR-S540BT Home Theatre. For a basic entry level model the Denon AVR-S540BT Home Theatre does almost everything you expect well.
3,I had this receiver for 6 months when it failed to work. I called Denon to see what should be done they said it was still under warranty and to send it to one of the Denon Service Centers. So I downloaded the list of service centers and sent it to the only one in my state. After 5 days I was called and told it was received by someone at a Burger King at the same address listed for the service center and was told that the service center had not been in existence for 4 years. That's the last I heard of my receiver. When I E-Mailed Denon about my receiver being stolen because their service center list was inaccurate I never received a response. When I called Denon support they said they would get back to me regarding a resolution to the situation but they never called back.I think Denon makes a good product but beware if you ever need service under warranty where you send it Denon does not respond to customer needs especially in this case where their negligence resulted in a stolen receiver.
4,My old home theater setup was outdated and when the projector died it set in motion a complete update including the receiver to handle all the new HDMI inputs/outputs. My old Yamaha receiver still worked fine but didn't support HDMI. I'm no audiophile but wasn't willing to gamble on some no-name receiver brand and other old reliable brands just don't seem to offer anything comparable. Still for what you get in this receiver it is not awe inspiring and prices seem to be fixed no matter where you buy them. By comparison this receiver is much lighter than my old Yamaha. I was always told the weight of the receiver is an indicator of its quality which would also backup my rather meh opinion of it. The tuning options are OK and sound quality seems fine. The remote seems simple and not over-engineered but feels light and cheap. For the money I wish I felt better about it but paid the devil his due to get updated. I expect it will last until it's obsolete.
5,Had a Denon years ago but got stolen. This receiver is good so far has a safety volume...meaning when not used and on the volume goes down to minimize damage to receiver.
5,I love this.  I had an old Radio Shack Optimus receiver that I hauled around with me for 40 years because it had excellent sound quality.  I suspect Denon made them for RS.  The layout and construction is almost identical.  I use it for streaming TV and Music off the internet. I use my Roku remote and have it rigged to an outlet strip that turns on all the peripherals of my home theater setup when I turn on the TV.  I didn't rate the remote for that reason or tech support because I haven't needed any.  I just wish there was a way to eliminate that "standby" setting.  I have to manually turn the unit on.  All the unit does when power is applied is put it in the standby mode whatever that is.  It doesn't turn the receiver on.  The remote turns on the outlet strip but the receiver doesn't turn on.  If anyone knows how to bypass that standby mode I would appreciate knowing about it.
5,I wanted an AM/FM radio receiver with the new fangled hook ups (digital optical for example) and had center surround sound and subwoofer outputs or at least 5.1. Well I couldn't find one of those receivers because they all now have HDMI input/outputs as well. So after reading allot of Amazon reviews I took a chance on this least expensive Denon receiver and I'm glad I did. This AM/FM radio receiver actually receives and plays dozens of radio stations I couldn't receive with my old receiver which only played FM WHUD 100.7 and had RCA stereo input and clip type stereo speaker output (but it did have a built in A/B switch for 4 speaker stereo output). I have no idea why these things have 4K HDMI jacks on them because if I want a 4K TV I buy a 4K TV. I don't buy a radio receiver with 4K TV electronics to make my non 4K TV look any better. I guess that's why they can and do charge more for them. Anyways this receiver has terrific 5.2 surround sound great AM/FM pickup and playback 2 digital optical inputs and 2 RCA inputs. It also has a USB input and you can Blu Tooth connect the receiver to your phone and play your music from your phone or other Blu Tooth devices. It has a head phone jack and the spring clip type speaker connectors so I recommend you use these flex pin connectors if you plan to use 12 gauge pure copper wire like I am.>  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Z5F4287/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 <  <14 or 16 gauge wire will work without the flex pins but I'm loving these flex pins now. Overall this Denon receiver is great. Plus it has the microphone with setup program to make speaker playback and everything else attached to the receiver easier to setup. But you do need to use an HDMI cable out to your TV so you can see the setup steps on the TV screen. I have all my HDMI cables going into my 55" LG OLED C9 and I ran an Optical cable out to the Denon and the TV sounds great. And hey if I can do it you can too. Get one now you'll be glad you did.
4,So first I'm giving the unit four stars because it does work.  But not 5 stars because I hit two problems that are really the vendor's own issues and the vendor has to fix them.The first problem I hit is that the system's software got confused while I was configuring it and messing around to the point where the speakers stopped functioning entirely (even though they were turned on in the config).  I had to do the software configuration reset and set the system up again to fix that issue.The second problem I hit was that one of my devices only has composite video out (the yellow RCA connector) and I just assumed it would be able to convert that to the HDMI output for the T.V. because... who cares about composite out any more these days?  Nobody.  But in fact it could not.  That's totally inappropriate in this day and age.  If Denon is going to sell ANY RECEIVER with a composite video in it had damn well be able to upconvert that to the T.V.'s HDMI output period.  So Denon is nickel-and-diming its customers by withholding that feature from their entry level receiver and not making it perfectly clear to buyers that the composite video input just doesn't work for any regular use case.That said I was able to work around both problems.  I decomissioned the last piece of equipment that had composite video out (it was years coming anyway so... I wasn't too sore about it).  And all the other features work as expected.  They work well they switch inputs volume works audio works AM and FM works... it works as advertised (except for that one composite video in).  So I am happy.  I don't need the receiver to do HDMI-to-HDMI upconversion the T.V. will do that on its own.  I don't need fancy features.  I just need something that works and this receiver does just work.And I am also happy about the price.  So I will give it 4 stars for effort docking one star for buggy firmware and its inability to convert composite video in to HDMI out.  I just got the sucker so I will update my review if matters change.-Matt
4,Saved $100 by getting the Amazon CC. Replaced my OLD Denon AR-75 workhorse. Like it!
3,Make sure you read carefully because this is NOT a HEOS capable unit out of the box. Their pictures show it as built-in implying HEOS connectivity in marketing material with the setup menu picture showing HEOS as an option and also showing the HEOS app on a phone. Turns out you have to buy the separate $350 HEOS Link module which is compatible with ANY brand receiver... But I specifically picked this model because it was Denon and implied that HEOS was built-in so now I'm considering returning it. At the same time I don't want to shell out hundreds more just for another HEOS capable unit (if this doesn't have it) since my house is small and I was just hoping to group in my already existing HEOS 3 speaker in the bathroom once in a while. So it's not like I NEED HEOS but darn I sure am disappointed by the deceptive marketing in the product description because with HEOS this receiver would have been EXACTLY what I needed/wanted.So the rest of the receiver is all a person needs though it is very basic compared to other models from Denon. It's a 5.2 and the setup is not complicated. I'm not sure what people are expecting? Maybe I have too much experience with A/V but setting up this receiver and using the menus is trivial.3 star rating due to deceptive marketing.
5,I had a Harmon Kardon that started to break down after 8 years HDMI inputs stoped working. I have never had a Denon but always heard great things. I decided to pull the trigger for Christmas hoping this would be as advertised. here I am 6 months later and still love this receiver. I have a 5.1 sound system and I have no complaints. Easy set up which takes maybe 5-10 minutes and you are good to go. Also love the labeling of the HDMI and remote ports/buttons my HK made no sense but this is easily identified....great receiver
3,I bought this model to replace a Sony receiver that was damaged by a nearby lightning strike and created a power surge that fried it and my cable TV box. This was despite the components being "protected' by an expensive surge protector/uninterruptable power supply. (Their warranty paid for the replacement of the receiver; yes it can happen!)). This Denon product is much easier to set up and the remote is easier to use. An excellent user manual and online troubleshooting feature is user-friendly.I selected this unit carefully to ensure that it had enough power to match the requirements of my 5.1 speaker array but it appears to be under-powered. I checked all wiring and connections to ensure that everything is in-phase and correct but I think that the factory specs may be over-stated.
4,I had no need to contact the tech services. I don’t have a glue so avg points.In everything else it works great. With one exception. The reception drops out and comes back on rainy snowy heavy cloud times. I haven’t tried to adjust the ant or change it. I also live where the cell phone doesn’t work well ether.However it controls the hdmi systems well. From the cable/internet box to the receiver then to the dvd blueRay tv/monitor.The sound is handled very well. Being switched out to the 5.2 speaker system.
5,This receiver was a nice low-cost option for our vacation condo. It has almost all of the features of the high-end Denon receiver I bought years ago but at a fraction of that original price. Setup is much easier although it lacks some of the sound field adjustments. I use it with a five-speaker Polk system and powered subwoofer; the volume is more than adequate for my space.
5,I love this product so far. I did get a warranty on it.  The sound quality is excellent…
3,I’ve had the Denon avr s540 about 6 weeks now and finally was able to make all connections.  Connecting an old flat screen to a new avr can be frustrating but that is not Denon’s fault.  I paired this avr with a new set of Polk speakers so the sound quality is sublime.  Everything works well with this avr except the Bluetooth .  Here I think Denon cheaped out.  Pairing can be difficult.  I spent an average of 10 to 15 min. trying to pair devices to this unit.  Had to do the “reset” process at least twice to get connected.  I paired my iPad and a kindle fire tablet so I’m not trying to hook up poorly made devices.  The directions say this avr will pair with 8 devices and to switch from one device to another all other “paired “ devices must have Bluetooth turned off and the device you want will automatically connect when you press the Bluetooth button on the remote.  Almost every time I try to use a different device I have to “reset” the avr and maybe I can get a connection.  The devices are well within connection range of the avr.  A number of times it just would not connect at all even after a “reset”.  Another issue is that even when I do get a connection it will sometimes just disconnect without me doing anything.  I have to go through the “reset” process again to get it to connect to anything.  One of the reasons I got this avr was the convenience of Bluetooth.  Very disappointing.  I have no idea how well it would connect to a remote subwoofer especially when you are also connected to a device like an iPad.  Too late to return and I can hard wire my music sources so it’s going to stay in my cabinet.  This avr tends to overheat and shut down.  There are 2” on each side of it and at least 5” above it in my cabinet with no other devices stacked on or under it.  Going to put in an exhaust fan.
5,Thank you for making this a quality addition to my entertainment system.
5,I put the microphone that came with the receiver on a camera tripod and placed it in the room where we normally sit. I went through the step by step setup guide and the sound quality and room balance is excellent especially at this price point. My older Harmon Kardon receiver was 15+ years old and finally stopped working this was the perfect replacement and a serious upgrade in sound quality as well. Frequency response and dynamic range are of much better quality. We have built in ceiling speakers and amplified subwoofer that I installed while the house was being built. The receiver did a great job balancing the speakers (5.1) even with our vaulted ceiling.
4,The sound quality and easy setup is great on this amp. HDMI connections for the systems that use them makes it easy to connect Playstation Xbox or PC without having to mess with audio wiring. Of course since you are connecting your HDMI to the amp it has to be on even if you are using headphones so that is a little bit of a bummer but not a big deal.Using Polk fronts & sub woofer and Klipsch center and rears the sound quality is very nice with a number of different settings for Game Music Movie and so on.The only item that I wished this amp had were a second set of stereo outputs when I'm in my workshop. I have speakers in the shop and wire to the amp but not 2nd connection with this amp. More my fault probably but I just figured most amps had two speaker outputs since all of the amps I've bought did. Besides that it's a nice product. Now I need to get some wireless speakers for my shop so I can get that figured out.
5,DENON S540BTI thought I'd give this AVR a try. For the sale price of $229.00 why not. I figured if it doesn't perform to my expectations I'd reconnect my Yamaha V385 and stick the Denon inside the closet for an emergency receiver.But the S540BT surprised me. Installation was quick and easy. Now I've read other reviews where the complaint is volume or lack thereof.  I fixed that.I decided to use the Auto setup. After which I dug into the settings and this what I did:1. Open Speaker Settings.> click on LEVELS> run TEST TONE (individual speakers) set the volume output -12db - + 12db. I set my front towers @ + 4.5 db – center @ 5.5 db – surrounds @ 4.0 db. Lastly the sub @ + 2.0 db2. Volume increased by at least 30 % without any distortion.3. I set my tower crossovers @80hz – Center @120hz-surrounds @110hz4. I set sub mode @ LFE + MAIN with LARGE for the towers.5. On TONE CONTROL I set the treble @+6b -bass +1. Also I made sure NIGHT MODE is in the OFF position. \6. Last set the DISTANCE.7. Next – AUDIO- and set the rest according to your taste.The sound quality is above my expectations.I use my Roku Ultra for 4k and HDR video. However do not plug in the HDMI cable into MEDIA PLAYER otherwise you'll just have HD. Use the inputs on the right side of receiver – note it reads 4k.I plugged mine into GAME – 4k and HDR is fantastic. Looks like the Yamaha will get a well deserved rest in the closet.I definitely recommend the DENON S540BT.
5,I replaced my non-high-def receiver finally so I can make full use of 4K and other HD content.With the old one I was getting a lot of problems where the high-def copy protection would kick in and stop youtube & streaming. Now I can use all the same devices (roku blu-ray chromecast etc) and get full resolution.I have a 5.1 surround system and that works fine too. I just hooked up the speakers to the new Denon and let the automatic setup take care of it. The automatic setup did a very nice job of calibrating to my speakers and my room. I only ever adjust the volume now. I used to have to adjust center speaker and L/R front speakers after calibrating the old system.It fit my cabinet just like the last one did too -- I'm happy for standard case sizes.It can go into Bluetooth mode and play music from your portable devices but sadly it seems not to connect with Amazon Echo devices.I am using all the 4K inputs (Roku Chromecast XFinity box Blu-Ray) and they all work just fine.I've not used the USB inputs ever and might someday.After a year of use it still is an excellent home theater 5.1 system for me.
5,For the price this unit is absolutely perfect. Can do way more than I need it to. Fixed my problem of being low volume from my computer's video card that my old receiver had. Gets very loud and makes my Klipsh bookshelf speakers and Onkyo sub sound amazing! At first I was having some weird issues but it was related to the automatic room EQ... turning that feature off fixed everything. Maybe I'll play around with it more in the future but not necessary. This unit doesn't have a lot of menu options but so what it sounds great and works perfectly.
5,Easy set up with the quick start guide. Pulled my old Cerwin-Vega speakers out of my garage that had been out there since my old Pioneer receiver had died. Hooked everything up and set up the receiver and I am beyond pleased. Great value for the price.
5,Bought this because of the need for more HDMI inputs my old unit didn't works as advertised not as loud as the one replaced. Its plenty loud for the house (neighborhood) small remote not all the control I expected but learning.overall I like it
5,My old Panasonic receiver quit working after 10 years and decided to try Denon. This brand had great ratings and this model was highly rated.I am completely satisfied with this purchase. The sound quality is 10 times better than my old receiver.  This has more features than I know what to do with. After playing with the sound settings  I determined that the "Stereo" sound setting was the best for most viewing.If you need a 5 channel receiver  get this one. You won't be disappointed.
5,For this price the Denon 5.2 receiver really performs. The setup menu made calibrating the system to my room incredibly easy with very immersive sound. It uses HDCP 2.2 to transmit 4K HDR video from my Fire TV Cube to my TV allowing the receiver to handle all of the audio formatting whether it's 2 channel stereo for most Youtube videos or full 5.1 surround on our favorite movies or tv shows. The bluetooth connection works great with my phone or tablet playing 5.1 mixes from Tidal which is now my preferred way to listen to music.
4,When my ten year old Denon receiver died I needed a replacement.The sound quality and controls are excellent especially paired with a sub-woofer.My only complaint is that playing music from a USB flashdrive is nearly useless.  Anything more than a minimal number of files on the drive causes the receiver to lock up when trying to page through them.  So far nobody has provided a fix.  My solution was to connect my Linux server to the receiver with an RCA cable and play music from the flash drive connected to the computer controlled from another computer or tablet using VNC.Well worth the money unless you HAVE to use flashdrive directly connected to the receiver.
5,I use the receiver in combination with a HiDef projector and BluRay player in a homer theater application. The attached sound system is a 5.1 Bose Acoustimass 10.Setup of the system was surprisingly easy. After establishing all connections the receiver proceeds through a setup routine on first installation I strongly recommend to follow because is helps to fine-tune the sound system.The receiver utilizes the projector (or any connected other display) to prompt the user through the sound setup and calibrate the output for the intended listening location with the provided microphone.The result is indeed a very clear and distinct sound when replaying movies with 5.1 surround sound support. Quality is not affected at low volume and neither sounds distorted when cranking the volume up a notch or two. An additional equalizer is in my opinion superfluous.I did have some challenges finding the connected BluRay player initially but reviewing the setup solved that challenge rather quickly.Overall this is a very reasonably priced receiver to use in a home theater application. Multiple input assure that other analog and digital media can be attached (such as game consoles radio etc.) but I have not tried these features yet.
4,I used this A/V device to replace my A/V device that was broken.
5,I recomment Denon it good amp
4,Bought on Amazon as "Acceptable" and indicated "large scratches on top or sides of unit" cost was $159.  Surprise there were zero defects. In fact it looked brand-spanking new; the remote batteries had not been installed box was in good shape.  Installation was a BREEZE.  I'm puzzled as to how anyone who has ever owned stereo equipment in the past (or even if they didn't) could have a problem setting this unit up.  I think my 12 year old maltese could have set it up given the right amount of dog bones.  It sounds great.  I have a 20 X 20ft room and it has plenty of power especially for the price.  Yes it needs a powered sub but then most home theater receivers do nowadays.  No big deal here there are plenty out there.  I have a Yamaha 8" sub on the way.  Bottom line I'm over the moon with it for the price.  Side bonus; it has noticeably improved the picture of the 65" TCL tv connected to it.
