5,It’s for my printer and it works perfect
5,i like them
5,Great
4,I have an hour printer and this is the appropriate ink to use. It’s expensive though!
5,This is a correction to a feedback I submitted. The rating and comments were erroneous. There were no issues with my product. I though it was another item. Don't know how to make it right. My printer "accepted" it. No issues.
4,Ok standard purchase
4,The product is good. I like getting the combo package. However the color vs black never seem to run out at the same time. I do alternate between this and the 901XL Black when I don't anticipate needing color copies because it lasts longer!
4,Can't comment on anything specific.  Biggest plus was availability.
5,Received my order quickly and in great condition.
5,I've purchased the 2-ink cartridge before.  It's a great price.
5,I bought the black ink July 2021 for a home printer that I don't use very often. Theres a 1 month guarantee. By the end of August 2021  it was printing paragraphs of black smudges. I tried to take a picture to show you but Amazon isn't allowing it right now. Don't waste your money on this product. You will be disappointed.
4,These cartridges worked well for the printer I had.  Recommended for anyone needing the HP 901 ink cartridges.
4,Not sure why name brand (HP in this case) printer ink cartridges are so expensive but it does explain the knock off brands and substitutes
5,Printing pictures which came out great
5,EASY  FAST TRANSACTION SPEEDY DELIVERY ITEM AS DESCRIBED
5,It's great we can find hard to find ink online and get it right away
5,why buy one at the store when you can get 2 for the same price?  I don't print alot but when I do I want my printer to be ready for me.  This is the same thing you would pick up at the local Big Box store and for a whole heck of a lot of less money.
5,This is the size cartridges that come with printers when purchased.  After installing both of these cartridges they produce high quality color and print.  They do not have an expiration date on them as the large capacity cartridges do and contrary to other peoples posts the expiration date does matter.  If you install a cartridge after the expiration date the color will not be what you expect and I learned this the hard way.  Twin packs of large capacity at discount stores are attractively priced however if you don't do a lot of printing the color cartridge will be affected and you will end up buying a new one.  The Black large capacity didn't seem to be affected.  It is my hope that this information helps others who like myself limit the amount of color that I print and got bit by the expiration date on HP cartridges as they are put there for a specific reason.  Always get the longest expiration date as possible.
5,I feel like ink never lasts to justify the cost.
5,The ink I needed when I  needed it at a good price. 👍
5,good HP product
5,This was a steal compared to what Office Depot wanted for these same cartridges! Proud Prime memebr! Shipped very quickly!
5,The 901 ink cartridges were exactly as expected…..good quality!
5,got here quickly
5,I’m grateful that the shipment came very quickly. This ink is always good!
5,Worked very well.
2,No sirvio
4,The way it was shipped is kind of crazy.  One small box in a huge box!  What a waste.
5,I have been using the HP office jet 901 black and color for over 3 years with my Hp Office Jet-J4580 All in one- faxscanner printer . Only had to replace the color once. I think it works very well for my printing requirements.i AM NOT A College student so I'm not using it everyday but i do sell Avon and once a week or more I am printing up 16  or more orders twice each copy one for me an for them.It works great for my requirements.printing up my Christmas lists right now and ran out of Black but pre-ordered from Amazon so neatly sitting here on the shelf waiting to be used...LOVE LOVE LOVE AMAZON ****************makes me smile******cost effective ....delivery effective love Amazon PRIME my whole family have joined.....i tell them the great service i get and now we have about 35 more Gartners using Amazon because we brag....Thank Amazon and YES u may thank us>>>>
2,Cartridges seem to print normally . Made in Malaysia. Wish they were made in the USA providingAmerican jobs.Can't vouch for the longevity aswell I just installed them and started using them.Took about 2 weeks to arrive so not the best on that butthey made it and work fine. Don't know if Iwould purchase from this seller again though.
5,Used for my regular printer. Works well but haven’t had long enough to check longevity. The product came sooner than in the ad. Great!
5,I purchase this ink brand and this ink brand only to use in my printer because every other ink brand is just a knock off to the original brand. I love sticking with the brand that you are suppose to use in electronically items such as printers and phones. I have tried other brands due to a cheaper price but i got exactly what i paid for a cheaper brand that dried out or didn't work at all.I am sticking with HP always for my Hewlett Packard Office Jet 4500 4 in 1 .I will definitely be recommend that everyone stick with Hewlett Packard ink  cartridges for their Hewlett Packard products
3,Got an error msg when installed the two cartidges about the black cartridge being wrong. Cant use the printer
5,These inks work great with my HP Printer The HP Office jet J4580. These are the original inks from HP so you will pay about $40 or so dollars for them unless you can find them on sale. The quality for them is well worth it considering that they will last for quite a while.I find the print quality very good for the price I paid and I'll be buying again when I need more ink.Tip: to keep you inks from drying out print something at least once a month
4,These are the genuine cartridges from HP.  They work great and last a long time. The print quality has been consistently good.  I really like that they don't seem to mind if they're not used for a few weeks.  On another printer I had if you didn't use it almost every day you'd have to go through a cleaning cycle with the cartridge.  Not so with these.  My only complaint is that manufacturers ink cartridges are pretty pricey.  I guess they make a lot of money selling these.
5,It's a cartridge for a computer printer not much to say about it.  It works with no problems.
5,I purchased these on Amazon because it is a better price than my local office supply store.  I am very pleased with the price and quality of the product.  I was concerned it may be older stock that is being sold online but that is not the case at all.  It works great in my printer and last just as long as printer ink purchased at a brick and mortar store.  I intend to continue to purchase this printer ink online.  The quality of this printer ink and price is excellent.
5,Installs well into the printer.  Long lasting.  Everything you'd expect from an HP product.
5,The HP Product is great!  The best thing is I ordered from Amazon Monday and received it (as promised) early Tuesday morning!!!
3,The ink worked well for the printer it was designed for. Both colors printed well and the final print job was good. I was only able to print about 100 pages of the black ink before it ran out which I was very disappointed with. They were 100 pages of a regular typed document with no B&W pictures to eat up the ink. Even though it wasn't an XL ink cartridge I expected better than that. The other issue is that it is extremely overpriced compared to off-brand ink toners. In fact the off-brand ones printed more pages per ink cartridge and the ink color was more defined. I'd suggest saving your money and buying a cheaper option than the brand ink. The off-brand works even better.
1,Did not last any time.  Did not print even 100 pages more like not even 75…crazy!!!
4,Didn't last long
4,Not much product for price
5,For printer when working from home
2,The color cartridge only prints the color yellow. It is defective.
1,This was not a combo pack it was two different cartridges and expired 6 months ago! This is unacceptable.
5,….
4,Fantastically OVERPRICED - But this is usual as HP (and all others that I know of) build printer units using the "FREE RAZOR EXPENSIVE BLADES" concept. Yes they are good cartridges but I dislike their sales tactics - Cheap printer expensive ink.
5,Liked the easy out with the old in with the new.
5,It was  just as ordered  correctly for my printer
4,for my printer
4,It's HP. They don't last very long and it's probably cheaper to buy a new printer
5,Great value!
5,This product is ink used to go into my printer so I can print documents.
5,It works great it lasts for a long time
5,It is clear and lasts a long time
4,Price right didn’t print the color no clear until you print 4 to 5 page to get it the right color
5,Na
5,Got within 48 Hrs and at a good price!
5,I purchased HP  ink cartridges from other sellers and the cartridges didn't fit my printer (NOT authentic) and I wasn't able to return or exchange them. Also other sellers send dried out cartridges when I purchased in large quantities.  I'm greatly pleased with these and the quality of the print is outstanding.
5,Just short and sweet here.... I am a grown girl student...going to school online not only do I write a lot and print it out.But am currently printing my electronic textbooks because I had a boat load of paper and my Kindle fire HD isn't here yet... So my HP Printer gets used a whole lot...and I have found that if you want quality printing and dependable printing go with HP and use genuine HP ink cartridges...I have branched out lately to try a refurbished set of both the color and the B&W don't know if I will like or not but it was worth the price to check em out in meantime I am still using the real deal!!!! ...:)
5,Works great  and fast shipping.
5,I can't shop like I once did & I'm having to order many things I couldn't get to office depot all I had to do was get on my computer......This made ME A HAPPY CAMPER.....THANKS
5,This cartridge is just what my printer needed. My order came quickly and well packaged.
5,N/A
5,Quick shipping and was the product that I need for the money
5,👍
5,I always use HP products
5,Works for my printer and price is ok
5,The results are great  however I thought it would be less expensive but it wasn'tI will always shop Amazon
1,I am very disappointed in the  HP 901 2 pack ink for printer. I bought it a couple of months ago but did not open it up until recently since the expiration date was stamped Sept 2021 (there was a pen mark crossed out under it). I wouldn't be surprised if the date was falsely stamped on by the seller. After I put it in my printer my pages were not printing out clear. I opened the printer up and noticed that there was purple leaking from the color cartridge and the black cartridge was printing blurry black. Shame on the seller since the ink was probably not stored correctly and possibly damaged the cartridges.  I paid $50.00 and could not use the cartridges at all. Poor product quality.Feel free to get in touch with me. Not very happy since I lost $50 and not sure if my printer will ever be the same!!
5,Love that Amazon carries HP 901 XL printer cartridges for my old HB printer and at a good price.  Thank you Amazon
3,Short and sweet...  Not sure but I think some of the folks who are having issues with cartridge longevity might have their print jobs set to high/ultra high quality. Naturally this will use up a cartridge sooner.  I have used the 901 and 901XL.  I am a returning-adult student and write a boat-load of papers not to mention printing off huge articles and school forms etc.  I find that I get very acceptable printing jobs done on fast/economy draft and the cartridges last quite reasonably.  From a cost perspective they are about mid-range.  I shop for them online (Amazon) because they are cheaper than a box store and I have a little more faith that I won't get burned ordering from a reputable company.
5,I needed both ink cartridges to print a lot of important insurance documents. As soon as I received my ink cartridges I installed them lined them up and then proceeded to make over 75 perfect copies. Thank you HP for quality products.
5,It is good quality.
5,I had to order it from here only because I tried to go the cheaper route and order from ebay which I love but I KNOW somethings you have to order from here so I did. They work and I am still using this today for my printer but I know I will be out soon and will have to order more and I will very soon.
5,Good product. Nice to have it delivered to my home instead of making a Long trip to purchase it
5,HP makes a fine product and their ink is no exception. Dark blacks and vibrant colors. I highly recommend. I've dated the time I inserted the inks into the printer to see its lasting time. Understand from certain information that the inks are not fully loaded at the factory. We'll see.
4,They are ink cartridges and they work fine. I used to have a laser printer and was used to not buying ink and now must buy more often. They are easy to install and I normally use draft mode (black ink only) and keep away from color as much as possible.
5,More convenient than having to go to the store and look through all the ink only to find mine wasn't in stock and have to go to another store to look. Great time saver.
5,I do a lot of printing with my HP office jet 4500 printer  number HP 901 I would get my ink in town and I was forever out of ink I ordered black and color ink and in the ad on the computer it said approx. how many pages I would be able to print I am very satisfied with the quality of ink and how fast the order arrivedIt is so neat to be able to order from my office chair and  it will be delivered to my door Thanks Amazon!!!!
4,Seemed to burn through faster than my previous cartridges but the print quality is fine. I wonder if they have changed the volume of ink in the tank.
5,It works! (as long as you don't buy the wrong ink for your printer). It was also cheaper than what I saw at a nearby office supply store.
5,As expected
5,I ordered 2 each of the black and color for the HP 901 printer I have and I received them in fine shape. They were delivered on time and I put the first set in the printer right away as I was out of ink. I have used it almost every day since then and it works very good. I am very happy with my purchase and will continue to order more from Amazon in the future when I need more ink for the printer.
3,I knew I was buyin a combo pack the item title makes it sound like I was buying 2 combo packs. On Amazon it is cheaper to buy the 901 cartridges separate and not get a combo. As it is this is a few dollars cheaper than Office Depot I'm not complaining. It's just not the amazing deal I thought it was at first. Amazon should change the name of the item to combo pack like it says on the single pack it is.
3,These cartridges do not print tri-color copies as indicated on the manufacturer packaging.  The ink runs out fast for the color cartridge.  I recently used the black and color cartridges for a print job of 145 pages which  practically required little color...only purple and black on a small 4 x 6 printed greeting card with mostly white background....and the tri-color cartridge ran out !I must admit I have been buying these cartridges for years and I believe they are now putting less ink in them !
1,Just purchased the 2 pack HP 901 black and tri-color ink cartridges and the black one does not work.  Every time I load the black cartridge it comes up saying "INCAPATIBLE".  Tri-color works but the black one does nothing.  Although the box date is April 20/23 the black one is useless. In troubleshooting  put the old cartridge back in and the printer accepted it without a problem.Tearing up the packaging so disappointed that now and fifty dollars later it's just not working.  No way to ship back as I destroyed the packaging.
5,Great
4,It works well and lasts a reasonable amount of time.
5,Have tried other brands but always co.e back to this no matter the price
5,The HP 901 Retail Combo Pack Ink Cartridges is a great Printer Ink that is a cheaper price here on Amazon than on the HP store. product ships fast came without any damages and is the perfect and correct cartridge product for our printer.The Ink is not old or dried out like some other products that we have bought locally which means these cartridges stalks are rotated properly and are fresh and not just sitting around drying out.
4,not much ink for the price. i was aware of the amount of pages it yielded but didn't think i'd use it up so soon. will have to buy another black ink cartridge.
5,Works great for at home printers. The 2 pack last for a whole year.
4,ontime
5,The order arrived very quickly and they work great. It pays to get the authentic HP cartridges.
5,Sadly enough there is no cheap solutionto HP PRINTERS domain.They sell great printer affordable so they get you on the ink.I learned my lessontrying to use cheap brand refillsthey don't work well.Hp see's them as none Hp so it does not report ink staus correctlyand here we go with the low ink errors.these solved my problems.other than getting a cheap mono laser printer.we are stuck with Hp
1,I am an unhappy customer.  Received the dual pack and the color cartridge was fine but the black cartridge was defective.  Now I have to go to all the trouble to send both cartridges back.  No just replacing the black cartridge.  And it is having to be sent back through the regular mail which means I won't have the money to buy the cartridges I need now while I wait for my refund!  I would never buy from this company again!
4,The combo pack is the only way to order. I caught a good deal on these cartridges.  They are a great match for my new HP printer. I like purchasing the cartridges in pairs to make sure I'm never out of ink. The 901 combo includes one color and one black cartridge.
5,The installation was very easy and they are working pretty well. I received them as promised next day delivery!!!
5,No better or no worse then any other ink that I've gotten at staples. The only difference is the convience of home delivery.
4,The cartridges were as I expected.  The ink just does not go very far.
4,So far ink cartridges are good.  Will see how long they last.
5,The price is very good And I didn’t have to go searching in a store for it.
4,they arrived but have not been used very much yet
5,This is a good product and has really printed a lot of sheets.  Not like the refills where you print a couple of pages and have to go and buy a new cartridge. The print is even and just like it's supposed to be.I consider this a good buy.
5,Way cheaper than the store worked as they should
3,The product was received on time and seemed satisfactory. However after only several uses an error message was received that there was a problem with the color cartridge. The cartridge was removed and cleaned with a Q-tip and the message did not appear. But after 1 print the message appeared again. The cartridge was again removed and cleaned and also the print head area was also cleaned. The error message did not appear and 2 printings were made satisfactorily.  Apparently the color cartridge causes problems with the print head.
4,Item is fine.  Hard to screw up this delivery.  It's ink not an artificial heart.
5,I found the ink I needed for my hp officejet 4500 just as I had found my printer/copier/etc. on Amazon and again I am very happy.  It was exactly what I needed both new in the box (color and black ink) and at a fantastic price way better than all of the stores I had researched. There is no way to beat it even the shipping is great.  Can't go wrong!
5,Used for computer product serviced the purpose.
5,Worked well when I needed it.
5,I buy one of these about every 6 months or so. They are inexpensive and easy to get. I do wish they would last a little longer but they are priced right. I have also learned thru reading reviews that there is an economical setting on my printer. I have now set it to this and will see if it lasts a little longer. Does work flawlessly though.
1,My printer is low ink so I need to buy a new pack. This was weird when I recieved my new order of HP ink from amazon. The packing was not as descripted"retail combo pack". I received the Black color ink is in a foil packaging w/o original HP box and the Color ink is in a original HP box packaging together shipped in a clear plastic bag. Oh I was thinking should be no problem even it is not in combo package in original box and I dont like to return stuff from online so I opened to use it.  Well here u go. The Black ink in the only foil packing like the regular one after u opened from the original HP box. I tried in the printer on both colors Black and Color. The Black it doesnt work and the message"empty" is on the printer status..So I put back my old Black ink to double my printer- That is what upset me since my old ink have much more ink than a new purchased one and ink is not cheap too..I never write review on any purchase but this one make me so!
2,The black has been fuzzy since it was first installed ran all the maintenance checks no help.  The color Just died print cartridge error.  tried all HPs fixes no good.  Found a way online to reset the printer check sum which lets me get one or two pages printed.  This is the first time in years that I've bought actual new HP cartridges always filled them myself or bought refilled.  Obviously I'm not pleased two stars 'cause they worked "awhile"  "kinda".
5,I needed ink for work and so I ordered this ink instead of ordering from my usual supplier and the quality was exactly what the description said it was going to be. Very speedy delivery as well!
5,fit and finish is perfect
4,The HP brand is very dependable especially compared to the otherremanufactured generic brands.We order these all of the time and they are very dependable...It is always cheaper online than in the stores....seems like...Saves a lot of money....
5,I've used this brand for years.
5,Worked well
5,Speedy delivery!! Thanks!!  Original ink carts are the way to go! Refilled or generic carts aren’t always accepted by your printer! I learned that the hard way!!
5,WHAT A DEAL!  THANK YOU!
5,LIKED
5,These are the same cartridges you'll find at the big box stores but for a much better price. The old cartridge easily snaps out and the new cartridge snaps into place. Great product and I'll definitely buy it again.
3,Not tried yet waiting for current unit to run out of ink. Should be OK as brand manufacture.  Did have another cartridge from another source which started to give error message that the installed cartridge was not an HP.  Think something in the software is seeing that it isn't an HP and giving this message.  Have re-installed after using Brand HP and ran for a little while before message.
4,Works
3,This ink should last longer then three months (I only use it for about 5 minutes  once per week.  It's the second time I've purchased from this seller and the ink dries up fast.
5,Factory supplied OEM stock function perfectly
3,Doesn't always like to align regardless of true hp brand.
5,brand name ink always works better (IMHO) and have always used HP ink.
5,Works. .as it should. On my office jet 4500..Tried cheaper ones on here. .to save a few bucks..had to return them. .just stick with hp ink. .avoid the headaches
5,Not sure what number we use in our present printer.  However you save a little when you can get both colored and black in the same package.  HP is a must for us.
3,I guess I must do a crazy amount of printing because the black ink cartridge ran out in less that one month.
3,The cartridge works well with my printer.  I am giving this only three stars because the cartridge runs out of ink quickly despite 'economy' settings in my printer.  I had better luck buying cartridges that were of non-HP make that lasted much longer and were cheaper.
5,Love the product; however I have not opened it yet.  Waiting for the rest of the ink to run out of the old cartridge already in the printer.  Saving on this was amazing for me.  Thanks due to my points accumulated.
5,I price these cartridges everywhere. I don't  use after market
5,Its ink here too. Genuine product in a genuine HP container. No junk here
4,The printer's original cartridges didn't last very long. I think HP must have special low reservoir cartridges they put in their cheap priced new printers. Hopefully these will last as long as their price would suggest.
5,I've used some generic ink for my printer before but it's sometimes hit-n-miss if it's going to work well. There's never a doubt with the genuine HP!
5,It’s perfect for my needs
4,Exactly as advertised but should be cheaper
5,A little expensive but cheaper than HP  website
4,ink is ink
3,It works but the price is the same price as the printer all that’s inside the cartridge is sponges and ink
5,Worked great great price
4,This is a better price than most places wish I could purchase locally as I could get it right away.  A bit pricy still but better than most.I've had no trouble with the ones I've purchased.  Wish they lasted a bit longer...
5,Others mentioned they weren't what they ordered didn't last as long etc.  I can't comment on how long they will last yet.  But they were wrapped and in a box just as if I had purchased them in a store.  Just not nearly as expensive.  So far I am very satisfied.
5,Compared to box stores great price. exact cartridges for my printer
5,Great product. GREAT PRICE
5,IT IS NOT COMPATIBLE with a printer it is advertised to work with. Waste of money and time. Almost broke my printer trying to fit them in.
4,I love my HP printer and the cartridges work as they should.  don't understand why in the world they cost as much as they do!!! It's one little plastic container!  Come on!!
5,Good
5,I am so happy to have ink for my printer again! It has been quite the dry spell due to lack of funds. But once I got more funds I bought printer ink. This was exactly what I needed and I received it in a timely fashion as expected. I would order from them again in a heartbeat!
5,It always comes in fresh. Not dried up. Get a lot of use out of the ink.
5,👍🏽
5,Good price.  I wish you hard the larger longer lasting size cartridge!
5,Excellent ink!
4,I tried using an off brand tape and the printer didn't work very well.  And I was  ready to throw it out. But since I have started using this it seems to work very well.
5,They're still working!
4,Good and affordable
4,Good price
5,I ran out of black ink and decided to purchase a combo since most probably I would need a color soon.  It was the best decision I made because not only did I have the black ink I needed but before I new it I needed color and had it all for a reasonable price.
5,This works great. no problems with it so far. Genuine is the way to go. I don't know if it HP printers that stink and can't handle refurbished cartridges or if the refills we have had stink but genuine is what we do now and this is better price than getting them in the store
4,Good product - good price.
2,I bought this combo pack and have had problems with the color cartridge seating since I put it in - every 2 or 3 copies I get an error message that there is a problem with the color cartridge so I have to reseat and realign it. I finally started shutting the printer down and got the message to clear that way but inevitably the error message comes back. I put the black cartridge in on June 15 and today I got a message "very low ink" and that meant NONE! I have my print quality set to draft 90% of the time and use it 3 times a week at most. Very disappointed in both the black and color cartridges - I expected better since this is an "authentic" product.
3,Tried refilled cartridges and never work well. HP original best . However the cartridge dries up before I can finish using ink
5,LOVE this ink....use a lot of ink and have always been happy with this product.
5,If your looking for printer ink that is OEM for your HP printer than this is it.Works just like the ones you would buy anywhere else. It's a little more expensive than if you bought it from target but you don't have to waste the gas driving there.RDE
5,Good ink cartridges.  Used in a home printer that only gets sporadic use they print great each time.
4,So handy to just get on computer an order an item that you normally would have to get in car and drive to a business that sells office supplies.
5,Slightly more affordable purchasing here than running to Target or Best Buy (especially when I make the effort to drive there and they are out of stock). I will most likely be restocking my printer ink from Amazon from now on.
5,I like using this source for my print cartridges.
4,Works well no complaints
5,ink did not work om my printer hp4500
5,This seems to be working properly. It was the first replacement to the printer which I use very seldom. Colors seem vibrant and the cartridges were easy to install.
5,Personal printing
5,none
4,I purchased this pack when I bought the printer so it wasn't like I was in a rush and out of ink but for the amount spent it was a great deal -- much more reasonable then even a discount big box store.
5,great just cost to much
5,Reasonable price
5,Great
5,Perfect no drying out of package after sitting for months
4,The order came in a timely fashion.  It was packaged in the HP package.  I received the same amount of Printed pages that I got from my store bought cartridges.  This was a better buy
5,Everything worked perfectly.  Saved money and very happy with my product.  Thank you
4,Just what I was looking for.
5,Great deal on this type of ink. Yes after awhile it does seem to go faster than the packaging states however this has always been the case for me with regular HP ink. For the price I'm happy with this purchase.
5,I've tried cheap ink replacements but they always fail.  Then I order the real thing -- HP
4,It is very good product. But the product is little pricey. If HP can lower the price of these ink cartridge then it will be good
5,It is exactly what it says it is - fits my printer as it should and works as it should.
3,Good quality but ink does not last long and I do not print often or much quantity. Expensive.
5,This original pack of two is more economical and works great in the printer does not smug or run dirtying your fingers.
5,Well satisfied finding a cheaper price combo ink set. I was paying A lot on HP.COM and found it on amazon cheaper. NO problems with them and Plus when my ink runs low.. I will be ordering from here... Well satisfied...
4,so far so good
5,This was a good price for both color and black ink for my daughters printer. She said everything fit and she was so glad she didn't have to drive around not knowing what store has any in stock and with the right price. Thank you
5,This product is just as I have expected. I was having trouble with a cheep ink that people said could work instead with my HP printer. It did not and I will just stick to this because it came on time and worked perfectly the first time.
4,Completely satisfied!
5,As much as I hate paying full price for HP ink it is by far the best ink for their printers.  A good product and at least this was a good price - hope I can find good prices in the future as well.
5,Such a great price considering buying at any store basically tripled the price and I have been printing without issue!
5,Printer is about 8/9 yrs old still works good and the ink is easy to change.
4,Got what I expected. HP stuff in general is over priced.
5,The absolute best price for buying ink and if you use prime no shipping costs!! Win win
5,Great
4,Arrived early and works great.
2,This HP I k cartridge made my printer sound line is breaking apart and “unaligned” code message come on saying is not aligned. I run the alignment test but it does not work.  I would like toretuneditandgetmy money back.Is this cartridges refurbished item? Why it does not work on my printer?
5,Great purchase
4,Packaging not BRAND NEW but serves its purpose!
4,good buy
5,HP cartridges work best in an HP printer
4,This is ink and you know what it does. The blacks are black and the colors have color.  Of course it is expensive and no one likes that.
1,Unless HP is now selling their "Retail" Combo pack WITHOUT the actual retail packaging that is shown in this picture on Amazon then I am crying foul! This came in the mail as follows: 2 cartridges stuffed inside of a nondescript grey envelope and with a homemade label affixed to the front which said "HP 901 Retail Combo Pack Cartridges."If that's how HP is now selling their cartridges in an effort to be green then this should clearly listed in the description (which I did NOT see). Since what is sent is not what is shown in the picture I feared it was a fake and thus sent it back.As a result I cannot speak to the quality of the ink or how long it lasts but I have a hard time believing it is genuine HP ink.
5,These are what works with my printer so these are what I will buy! I've had re-manufactured ones before but sometimes the printer does not recognize them so I'll stick with the HP originals!
4,I gave my J 4540 to my brother and wanted to get him some original HP ink. This is original HP ink that is cheaper than most other stores.
2,Have had this in use in my HP inkjet for about a month. The red and yellow jets on the cartridge keep drying out and not printing. A swipe of rubbing alcohol on a cotton swab will fix it for as little as 10 minutes but then the 901 color either does not seat properly and is thus unavailable (requiring taking it out and reseating) or it's just flat not recognized. Not the first time this has happened with HP OEM carts either. Oy. Way to go HP. Been using your printers exclusively for almost a decade. This little mess now has me considering Brother's (lower-cost ink) options.
5,Pop it in printer and it works fine.
5,I need this cartridge for my printer so of course I like it.
4,Rated a 4 because of the price. The ink cartridge itself is a good product however the price is too high. Good product but should not be so costly.
4,Worked well!
4,Works well. Arrived quickly
4,Good
4,Works great it's just so darn expensive!
3,Good quality printer ink jet but too few print pages for the price.
4,It worked fine in my printer
5,The black anf tricolor cartridges worked great.  The printer did not recognize the tri-color cartridge other than that it still worked.
5,I received a great price for this duo set of HP 901 Black & Tri-color ink set.  Highly recommend it.
4,Higher priced but glad to have quality. Wish for a better easier recycling program.
5,This combo cartridge works great and costs less than half the price at HP direct. I do NOT use "re-fills" so this cartridge from the same company who made my printer is everything I need.
5,H.P. printers are the best just have to be carerful which one you get to meet your needs
5,MUY BUENA CALIDAD.
5,this item is so convience and i am so glad that i decided to purchase this item online i would recommend all my frienmds to do so infact i have already spoken to some of my friends about doing so
5,I only use HP cartridges for my HP printers.  I always find them on Amazon for the best price!
3,Did not look closely at the ad.  Thought I was getting 901xl which was my search request but this ad was among the xl  feel dupped
5,Did the job
5,The quality of the cartridges were as expected.  The cartridges fit into our printer and worked well with it.  Ink has lasted for at least the expected life of ink cartridges.  The cartridges looked genuine as advertised.
5,So nice to be able to get ink right away at a reduced price!
5,New not expired cartridges. Good price.
5,This is the second time I've ordered cartridges for my printer this way.  They came fast -- probably quicker than I could drive to store park find them somewhere and get back home!  I'll probably never go out for cartridges again.
5,The ink works good. I have to put the original and not remanufactured cartridges in my printer.This was a great price too!!!! :)
5,Always need this for my printer
4,good
5,The product is HP. Amazon is Excellent on delivery.
5,It’s factory ink
4,Always has and always does perform as expected
5,Quality I expected from HP
5,Easy and convenient ordering!  Perfect forMy printer
5,Just like before I am a repeat customer I am pleased with the price and the quality of the product. It beats all of these discount store specials. recommend this product and the Company to anyone that needs it quickly.
4,product is as specified
4,good
3,The right ink and size. It do not last more than 20/30 pages of plain text!!
5,What can I say when you need ink you need ink for your printer.  It it good.
5,This has always been a quality product.  Will purchase it again.
5,Works like a charm. Popped the old set out and dropped these in. I usually run my printer on Fast Draft (printer properties under general and advance preferences) to save a little on ink. So far so good!
5,What do ya say about ink cartridges? Fit my H-P printer fine. Arrived on time. Did save about 6 bucks buying here on Amazon vs picking up local. Good product. I will purchase again as needed.
4,HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCTS (SAME NUMBER) FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS. DOES A REAL GOOD JOB .  PARTICULAR LIKE THE XL FOR LASTING LONGER.
4,These were exactly what I ordered.  However it took longer to arrive than stated...therefore the 4 stars.
5,Easy loading
5,Its HP at a good price - no issues as expected.
5,They totally work like they are supposed to!I suggest not ever buying substitutes that won't work.
5,Good print cartridges
4,I haven't used it but it is exactly what I have been buying and at a much better price .
5,good product
5,You can never go wrong with an genuine HP product.  The combo pack is the real deal.  Prints like a charm and I just wish the price would come down a bit.
1,I went on a Christmas/New years cruise and took 40 pictures. Wanting to be able to print the pictures with the best possible fidelity on my HP J4680 printer. I ordered  a 2-pack of Black and Color HP ink cartridges. Before all 40 pictures had been printed the black cartridge gave up. I then ordered a 2-pack of black remanufactured cartridges by Speedyinks at a much lower price than HP cartridges and everything is now printing perfectly. Obviously I will never again order ink cartridges by HP.
5,This prints documents with the best of em :) It does it's job and is well made. Nothing extravagant or special about it and am satisfied with the purchase and the price.
5,Would recommend it to family and friends for sure! I love my HP printer but the cost of replacing the ink gets old fast. With Amazon especially the free shipping I don't have to worry much! Thanks!
5,good
5,they work they are cheaper than from staples so why not buy online. true oem ink for less money. Ive tried getting refills and even aftermarket ink but its never as good as the oem.
4,Works and prints fine good value even at HP's too high prices.Arrived on time and has behaved since day one.
5,Work like a charm and are obviously OEM since the printer does not complain about them.
4,Good product  original and arrive on time  thanks
5,Like the product but dam too expensive
5,Poduct is as described
5,Very fast shipping and lasts very well considering the amount of printing I do.
2,I am dissatisfied on the amount of the Black ink is running out twice or more faster than the Color! I don't plan on buying again!
5,the product was great work out of the box. printer picked it up as new ang started working like the one I get from office supply but the cartridge from amazon cost a lot less
5,Great Price.
5,Works as advertised.
5,I ordered these HP ink cartridges because I love the ease of ordering from Amazon.  These were a great price and I never had to leave my house.
5,I have to commute to a larger town to get my inks and it is great to have it delivered to my home. Wish the price was better or the cartridges longer lasting though.
5,product satisfactory
5,Now who would have thought you could get your printer ink on Amazon.com?  Got it at a great price it's delivered to our door and it was exactly what we needed.
5,Nk
5,Little pricey.
5,These are just what I expected from HP ink.  An easy way to get needed supplies.  I will definitely buy them at Amazon again instead of going to the local store.
4,I have had several printers and the Hewlett packards are the best. These refills are great and last a good amount of time. was a great value.
4,Haven't used it yet. Always like to keep a spare on hand.  I will use it when mine runs out of ink.
5,I always reorder the HP brand and have no complaint. Print out looks sharp and I do not have to replace the ink often.
4,It's HP ink fits HP printers what else can you say?  Would have given it 5 stars had it been a super-low price.
5,Just perfect. Thanks for your product
5,No problems
5,My printer jumped for joy when I installed the new ink. It then spat out page after page of beautiful color pages that were promptly thrown in the trash by my kids.
5,This was the perfect ink that I needed and found it so quickly on Amazon like I always do when looking for things! It works great for my needs. Highly recommend for someone working from home!
4,THE ONLY REASON IT DIDNT GET 5 STARS WAS I WAS HOPING I COULD GET IT CHEAPER. WORKS VERY WELL AND THE INK LEVELS ARE WORKING ACCURATELY.
5,I'm so happy with my purchase I would buy two more excellent AAA+++++ all the way
5,Although I do wish HP would come up with a standard ink cartridge for black and tri-color I do like the economy of these combo packs. Makes them less "painful" to buy!
5,So far So Good.. I havent used my printer in a long time. But when I put the ink in It ran like I had just stop using it yesterday.
5,Excelente
5,I was skeptical about buying ink online. I was surprised. The ink has more quality and ink than retail stores. It is even cheaper saved me a ton of money.
4,Just what my printer takes and I needed  if only it was a bit cheaper it would be perfect.
5,Hp21
4,HP901 Black & Color live up to expectations. The original ink is always a safe bet.
5,After purchasing  the ink I realized  it's  my printer . I will have to replace it. Than you. I was pleased  wit the service.
5,Not much to say about ink.  HP printers seem to be designed to use a lot of ink so you have to buy refills.  It works in the printer
2,the black cartridge is ok not sure how long it will last but the color did not work
4,Found the product very helpful and the price was good
5,Ok
5,It's Hp Ink There has never been a problem
4,Price not bad. Could be better yet not as bad as else where. Work great and color perfect. East to install.
5,Great product BUT TOO darn slow delivery Its not that I reside in Hindustan Live here in Edmonds WAnext time I'll have to order weeks in advance
5,Good product
5,The ink works good so I would buy it again.  I have bought if before.and had no complaints.
5,I have never had a problem with this ink.  I order it ever time for my replacements.
5,Thank you I have taken my time to review the quality.so far I see everything I can get at the store.
5,Muy bién
4,Always a good quality product but the cost is highway robbery.
5,Great experienceagain .  Found product easily with search function.  Ease of placing order and receiving shipment details.  Product received  as promised in good order.
5,Well I get this because using ink from HP for a HP printer is smarter than buying watered down versions so how else am I suppose to feel about it? Always works great.
5,Wish it would last longer but is performing as expected. Ink is of decent quality. I print a lot and it stays true to color and consistent
5,With free shipping I could not beat the price! I like using the HP product then I don't run the risk of it not working with my printer. This was a win-win.
5,Great product from HP.
5,Good Quality Product.  Thanks
1,There was no red ink so everything looks green in the areas that are suppose to have color. No red
5,Great for older printers like mine and will purchase again when I run low on ink.
5,What I paid for these two all I can get at Walmart was just the black.  So there it went to Wally World  to return it
4,although it took forever to get here it did arrive just like the pict works as it should in my printer
4,just right for my needs
5,Lots of ink in the cartridge!!
4,It good no problem.
5,Good replacement
5,Saved a lot and the service is number 1.
5,I bought this just in time. As soon as it arrived I replaced the old ones. Great price I just wish I bought more and I'm sure I will soon.
5,OEM.. correct product.. what can you say about ink?
4,I was a good price and fast delivery.
5,The printer cartridges work great! No problems with color or product quality.
5,Works well
4,This is a spare ink for my new printer and I will use it when the other ink runs out.
4,Good original vendor quality reasonable price and timely delivery... better than HP offered.
2,I usually buy this ink at Target for my printer but the price on Amazon was better. The ink I received must have been used already because it was almost empty. When I tried printing the ink was barely visible. The seller did resolve the problem by accepting it as a return and gave me Amazon credit. But it was still a hassle to repackage and schedule and stay home for a Fed Ex pickup.
2,I ordered the double pack in April 2019. I loaded the 2nd cartridge into my printer in November 2019. The printer would not accept it.
4,However note that the 901XL has truer richer colors - which it should because they cost more.  But for simple basic printing this one is fine.
5,I was very sadisfied with HP 901black &tri -color
5,Always running out of ink HP making a fortune
4,Did not use yet but sure they will do the job.
5,Original ink is always the best
5,No problem with cartridge works well
4,No problems with delivery.  Cartridges work well.
4,no problem installing themwaiting to see how long they last.....
5,Fast delivery they work as advertised very happy printer.
5,Not the cheapest but a decent price for genuine HP cartridges. I've had bad non-HP cartridges in the past so I won't use anything else.
4,good for printer
5,I LIKE THE PRICE FOR THE TWIN PACKAGE THAT I NEED FOR MY PRINTER.
5,Great price and great color
5,Really nothing to say about this product it's ink! Delivered on time and works as expected. Cost was ok but I am always looking to save on HP ink.
4,good but expensive
1,I have been using and buying up ink for over 10 years. This is the first time I buy a pack. And the color is faded at first print. Doesn't expire till March 2021. Yet I open the ink and my red is printing light pink my blue light blue.I think I will stick to Staples for my ink purchases.
1,I purchased this double ink product on July 25 2016 and my Black ink is now faded to a light blue. I assumed the ink was new and not re-manufactured. It said nothing about being refilled I am Very disappointed since I have hardly used my computer  to print maybe only a dozen times and now I have to replace It ?? I have never had a cartridge run our this fast even when I used to refill them my self. Maybe I need to start doing that again.
5,Have purchased before and made the mistake last time of buying knockoffs - never again. Sticking with these from now on
5,I use this original HP 901 Black and HP 901 Color combo for my HP All In One Wireless Officejet. Never lets me down!
4,CARTTRIDGE  HAS A VERY DARK PRINT TO IT THIS IS A REORDER ITME FOR ME.PLENTY OF COPIES PRINT FROM CARTRIDGE
2,I received this hoping I could use it right away but the tri color ink is showing incompatible on my printer display.The ink is the for the right model printer according to the number on the packaging and the cartridge. Unfortunately I am unable to print and will need to return this product.
2,This ink sure didn't last very long - - for the price you pay for HP ink cartriges you expect them to last a little while. This didn't. And I don't print a lot either...
5,WILL ORDER AGAIN SOON
3,I feel like Im getting a shakedown every time I buy ink from HP.  They charge so much for what seams like so little.  Regardless this product works and works well.  I still think there must be a better way!
5,Received exactly what I needed.
4,works well
5,Original parts are the best.
5,Just what I needed...
1,No color ink!
5,turned out great. Previously received refurbished and one did not work. It's best to go with original  cheaper than Costco
5,As expected
5,Timely and works great!
5,Exactly what we needed in the most convenient way! Cost is also very reasonable. I always order my ink this way. It's the name brand so easy.
5,I use these all the time for my printer. Amazon has a great price and I receive these within two days.
5,Excellent  replacement for my printer.
5,Long lasting high quality ink. Always get the HP brand.
5,What more can I say?  This is ink.  It does what ink is supposed to do.  HP tends to be a bit overpriced but their ink IS inky!
5,good product good delivery but price is the same as in stores. Does it makes sense?
5,Works great.
5,Arrived quickly and worked perfectly!
5,The real deal at a great price.
4,Works like a charm
5,I purchased the HP all in one printer and decided to order additional cartridges for later use.  They are easy  to install and they appear to be working well.
5,Just what I needed and got it same day.
5,Printer ink either works or does not.This set works.

5,Much easier than driving 15 miles to closest Office Depot!
4,Perfect for my little printer in my classroom
4,Great deal for the price!
5,As advertised.  No problems.  Reasonably priced.  Lasted a long time.  Other ink cartridges would be used up fast or dry out fast.
4,Price high
5,excellent Ink average price fast shipping I would recommend and buy again. Thanks a whole bunch.
5,A+
5,Very good product.
5,these cartridges were all that I expected-came with instructions to install-did with no problem-print is clear-black and color-I will order this product again-price was also right
5,My very first printer was an HP; of course the best buy for the best printer is the combo pack. Economical!
5,Great product!
5,Received on time and am satisfied with product.
5,Works like a charm.
5,Works as stated.
4,Good price.
2,Was very disappointed.  When the combo pack arrived the black cartridge was not in the box with the colored cartridge.  The black was in the foil packet and the color in a separate box.  The black cartridge would not work.  I purchased a new black cartridge and the new one works fine.  Would like to return if possible.  I have not tried the color cartridge yet.
5,just what I need will buy again
5,Great Deal!
4,Good what i was loooking for.
5,0.VERY GOOD
3,Get a Brother (or comparable) laser printer.  The cartridges are under $40 and last for 8000 pages!  I'm done spending my money on these ink jet printers and cartridges.
5,no problems at all  prints like it should...
5,I got one from a non brand name product. It did not work fine.It have to be HP product. That is why HP make profit.
5,I thought my Printer was busted but it only needed new ink Cartriges it works great now. Ink makes beautiful Photos...Don
5,Nice product
5,so much more convenient than running to store.  Comparably priced.  Will buy again this way.
5,Did the trick!
5,I recieved product as described.
5,Good quality product.
5,I use the 901 in cartridges and this is the second time I've ordered the combo packso I'll never run out of them
5,I really prefer HP Ink Cartridges. The regular product is acceptable but now I only buy the XL cartridges as they last much longer.
5,Quick delivery and good product.
5,best ink in the world .....
3,Did last as long as my store bought cartridges.  They should be made of clear ink therefore the customer can visualize what is in each purchase.
5,nothing better than a printer with some ink in it and using Amazon for all of my purchases makes life so much easier!!
5,Great buy.
5,Fits great and looks great. Very satisfied with these mats. I personally prefer these to the hard plastic weathertech mats.
4,works well buy it.
4,does very well.
5,Arrived before scheduled date; HP quality.
4,Just what I needed
5,Never have a problem with HP products...always buy these cartridges.

5,Works well with my computer I like it alot. Very happy with the convenient use of your site.
4,Exactly as I expected.
5,A great price and with big school kids you can never have enuff. Thanks.
5,It worked!
5,Much better than the cheap off-brands!
4,HP gets the job done right.
5,How do you rate printer cartridges.  Either they give you nice output or they don't.  These work but that's what they're supposed to do.
5,Great A+++++
1,Needed to replace both the color and the black ink on my printer. I thought I would save a couple dollars by buying this at the expense of the convenience and expediency of buying at a local store. After waiting a couple days with zero ink when it arrived I found out they shipped 2 black inks!! No color. Now I get to go through repackaging and all the fun of sending it back and I'm still at square one. Beware you may get the product you ordered from this outfit or you may not. I would not bother.
5,Good product. No complaints. Arrived quickly as advertised.
5,works great
5,Genuine working ink. This product came sealed in the manufacturers packaging and works great.
5,Yes I am happy with this product.
3,Color cartridge is still going strong. However black cartridge malfunctioned after approximately two weeks.  It apparently failed. Started off with big splotches of ink on any page that was printed. It is now unusable. Replaced it and every thing is fine.
5,Best price for this product in store or online after checking various locations. The product arrived on time according to the tracking info. and im happy with it.
4,Works well
5,Great fast service and delivery! Item just as described. Thank you.
5,Got cartridges and they worked all in new packages. I am happy they where delievered faster than I thought.I am very happy with purchase

5,Perfect. Just as advertised. Fast ship.
5,As listed
5,this ink lasts a while its larger size excellent color and clean crisp and sharp. we use to print invoice off of quickbooks daily
5,Received the product very quickly which is great. works great and is truly genuine. came in an HP package and i will surely recommend this product to anyone.
4,fit my printer
5,Excellent product. Love it
5,I ordered this set of cartridges in November and they arrived within a week. They were in the new condition as described. They will work with my printer.
4,Good for the price.
5,Great price great product great performance.
5,Cartridge works perfectly. original HP product.
1,I bought this product on June and I printed a copy of a document that I needed and it worked fine but now that I want to print something else the black ink doesn’t work. The document comes out partially printed as if I was running low on ink. This is only the second time I’m using this ink.
5,HP I can't say enough about my HP printers. Easy to change prints great. Good for what ever you want to use it for.
5,It's ink It's too expensive but what else are you going to do?
1,The black ink cartridge rand out after 10 pages (on the fast draft setting). Super disappointed. I’m a teacher and often times we rely on our personal printers and have to buy our own ink. This is the second time this has happened. Live and learn and then drive to Office Depot I guess.
5,A great savings on quality products.  Saved a lot of money vs. the office supply stores
5,Great!!!
4,Worked great!
5,Excellent product excellent service.
4,works great
4,Good
4,It works.

5,no issues
4,Great price good delivery time.

5,This product came in the mail very quickly. As describe and fast service. Thank you.
5,This was an excellent and smooth experience.  I will be making additional purchases as the need arises.  Thank you very much!
5,GREAT INK

5,Great price.Price is wonderful along with ink that is of perfect tone and color. I use this product for this reason.
1,The Tri-color Original Ink Cartridge I only printed only about 10 copies and now it's dry very disappointing.So I have to go out and purchase a replacement .  Where I can see the day of product and not old one's setting ona shelf for years.  Will no longer but ink cartridges online.
5,Product was reasonably priced and arrived promptly. Product arrived in original manufacturer packaging and worked as expected. Good quality as expected. Would buy again.
5,Only the actual 901 ink cartridges for me!  These are great and a good price.  Would never use another brand
5,What I liked is that it was at a cheaper price what I disliked is that the ink gives out quickly
5,Great price!
5,it works for my HP office jet 4500 G510 the product worked as i wanted to to do. Thank you
5,We are very much liking the mask
5,Very happy with the cartridges and they work great . good doing business with you will continue to purchase from your sight.
5,Great 5 stars Pleased with everything. Highly Recommended .  Very happy with the service in all aspects. Don't know what else to say
3,Serves the purpose.
5,used for a long time - hard to get in but son can always do it
5,Very convenient purchase.  Quality the same as when purchased at the store.  I will certainly purchase again in the future.
5,Fine
5,These are just what they say they are- replacement cartridges for an HP printer. They worked great. Glad I got them.
5,Fits and works perfectly.
5,It was Fast Nice and compatible with HP Picky Printer. Now I can Print and even Scan : )
5,Worked great!
5,I do alot of printing.This HP ink is a great find.The cost is just great.You can not find a better deal.
5,HP is the best
3,HP cartridges are expensive as they have always been. I still prefer my Dell color laser printer however the cartridges work since they are genuine HP what more do you need to say.
5,The cartridge works fine in my printer. I would order it again. I'm satisfied with the product. Its works fine
5,Great price and excellent service as always.
3,These cartridges work perfectly but the ink is more expensive than the same weight in gold. Price is the only reason they don't get a 5.
5,Item arrived as advertised & on time.
5,Great deal on ink for my printer!
4,perfect
2,I ordered two sets of these and they worked fine in my HP 4500 Office Jet. Only problem was on set was crushed and the black cartridge in that one was unusable. It looked like it had been run over and crushed. It would have been better if they were shipped in a small cardboard box rather than an envelope.
5,buy these all the time they work well.
5,have purchased several of theseand they are the best buys on the market.since i use a large quantity of inki will definately reorder.
5,fine the price was good and the combo two in one makes better I recommend this to any one. Good deal
5,This combo worked like the original cartridges and so I'll but them again.
5,Ink works well with my HP Officejet 4500 printer and was everything I expected.
5,It is an injet cartridge how much can you say.  I would buy from seller again.
5,Great combo excellent price and excellent product!!!
5,great price :)
1,I did not know that there was a 30 day return policy when an order is placed on HP ink.  I always order more when the last cartridge is put in the printer.  Since I received a defective cartridge and did not know until a few days past my 30 I have wasted my money.  Therefore I will not buy ink cartridges from this site anymore.  These cartridges are expensive to get one that doesn't work and cannot return it.
5,I bought this for my printer here because it was cheaper than driving to the store and buying it there!
5,good
5,Received on time and installed colored.  Working perfectly.
5,Came as described and was on time.
3,We've only had these cartridges about a month and the black ran out really fast.  The price seemed good for a combo pack but I couldn't believe how little ink we got.
5,Item as described works perfectly.......iv'e been using it everyday and still going strong  would definitely recommend the product to anybody
5,i was very pleased with this purchase.  it worked well and i received it quickly.
4,good condition
5,excellent product and service
3,im sure the ink is great...I just never got it. fed-ex left it outside on the stairs of my apartment building and it got taken.....that is all
5,EXACTLY AS EXPECTED.
3,Fast and easy to order and receive.  True HP product so works great in my printer.  What else can you say when it comes from Hewlett Packard.
5,for my printer at home.
2,The two cartridges arrived on time but not in the original HP cardboard packaging.  I sent it back . (Seller was Best Value Merchandise).  No way to judge expiration date etc. as pointed out by other reviewers.I will spend more to know cartridges are current stock.
5,Very good.  It does the job it is supposed to do.  I have not had one fail on me yet.
5,Love it as far as I can love ink.  It is what my printer loves.
5,Cost effective package for me since i have a colored printer. They also last and i think that's great too.
5,the real HP cartridges work great. I was glad that I did not try to buy the less expensive ones
5,Best Printer I've ever owned ink last a long while I buy two a year.
5,Cartridges work fine
5,I always use the manufacturer's recommended product for best results. Buying the combo cartridge is the most economical way to purchase.
5,Great price and delivery. Cheaper than any other supplier. Original HP in package. Great quality.
5,Best price around i'll be coming back.  I love my new used printer
5,Works fine.
5,worked great
5,Perfect!
5,Saved a lot of money and time buying the ink cartridges on amazon rather than going to the store. Best way to go when buying ink!
5,They're ink cartridges.  They do the job.  Not much else to say.
5,Much more convenient to have delivered then to go out and find. Price is competitive.
5,as expected
5,Fast Shipping and Item as Described!
5,great
5,Worked for me.
5,Works as expected and delivered in a timely manner!
5,The two-pack Combo of 901 cartridges was a good buy.  Price was right.
5,Omg... This is the cheapest I've purchased this item. Shipping wasn't long either.
5,My Copyer is old and is HARD to fine ink in stores.
5,It came quick...and was exactly as described.  I was glad I didnt have to run out to office max. Thanks!
5,HP HAS NEVER LET ME DOWN. GOOD PRICE ON AMAZON ALWAYS. THANK YOU
5,works well installed and it prints and it is still printing stuff and more stuff I like it!! prints stuff!
5,just as described. A+++
5,What can I say? Its ink it is the right size and it magically makes pictures appear on blank paper!
5,As expected works great will buy again.
5,Excellent product and fast shipping.
5,Great price great product!
5,I've looked a recharged cartridges and local stores this is the best price for brand new genuine cartridges for your HP inkjet!
5,Got it quick (needed badly). Great price and as always quality product. Thanks.
5,Great price good service
5,A HP cartridge is a HP cartridge. I have always went to a office supply but this saved me time and money!
5,I have used hp products for years and have never had a bad experience.
5,works great
1,I received the ink cartridges on Dec. 16th and I am already out of ink.  I do minimal printing and a cartridge usually last me up to 6 months but this went empty after 3 months.
5,excellent productshipping on time very good service. Thank You.
5,Great product and great price!
3,it was ok but the ink went dry sooner than expected on both.
5,All is good
5,great price & super fast delivery. thanks
5,Good ink.  Got here fast and had no problems.
5,Thanks
3,They work as expected but it could be a little cheaper. I have tried other brands but not the same. HP makes better cartridges for their printers.
3,The ink just did not last as long as the ink from the local computer specialty store.
5,these cartridges always work fine for me and I buy them here all the time.  Great buy for the money.
5,Always buy this HP9-1 cartridges for our HP printer.  No complaints here.
5,Very good value and speedy delivery.
3,When i put in the cartridges it would not print the print coming out double on the paper even after aligning the paper
5,Both cartridges worked fine and I am pleased with my order.
5,works great
5,great value would reorder from these guys.
5,Very Good
3,I put it in the printer and when I clicked Print the ink was on the paper.  So... great job.
5,Great. Came on time
5,Works great..
5,Ink you need it.
5,it is the same as in the store - the price is a little better and it is more convenient
5,Great ink works with my printer - love the 2-day shipping!
5,I put the new cartridges in and they worked well.  Unfortunately my printer quite working after printing only 5 pages!
5,No problem
5,Arrived fast & was the correct one I needed.
1,These refurbished cartridges was a waste of my money.  I thought I'd try them for the first time and I will never ever buy refurbished again.  It's just wrong to even do this to a consumer.
5,Cartridges are working excellent.
5,it works
5,easy to order and receive as I use a lot of ink!
5,Not much to say but great Price Fast shipping...works great every time I re-order it!
3,I only needed black and white so it was OK and the price was right
5,AAA

5,The fastest and easiest way to get ink for my copier.
5,This cartridge did fix my printer with no problems.
3,great price wouldnt work on my devise my fuatl
5,YES
5,So far so good....we'll see how long they last!
5,Excellent value. Cheaper than the local super store. Very pleased.
5,Just as described thank you  Dave O
5,works excellent in my All-In-One HP printer.
5,Ink prices haven't come down but lasts a long time.
1,Had continuous problems with the ink cartridges I ordered. My printer kept saying there was a problem with the color cartridge. I would go in my printer and shake it and then I could print black & white (which is all I ever print).  But today I needed to print a map from Yahoo and when it came out it was not legable. The color cartridge never worked. I only now found out. I'm very dissappointed because of the expense of the cartridges.
5,Beta Ink is a superior vendor. Timely receipt of produce and excellent quality.  Would recommend this vendor to any and all customers.
5,Price was fair
5,Great working
5,love ny ink

1,I have had the same printer for 5 years and it has used the same ink number with no problem.  I have always ordered HP ink cartridges and this set does not fit in the ink insets cartridges are too wide.  I am returning.
5,Works for my printer.
2,Yeah it works...it was made to work but the price and amount of copies it produces it not very impressive.  I know they want to make a bunch of money but why can't someone make these cheaper and last longer?
1,Did not print well and did not last long.  I did not send it back in time obviously.  My fault.

1,The color cartridge was defective and caused the printer to print with a shadow.  Also the printer would not align the color cartridge. Once I changed the color cartridge to an older one that I had not opened the printing was alright (no more shadows).
1,Box cane op n missing screws. Fed ex Driver stated box was loaded in that condition. Missing bolts can’t.build this thing. Looks like it was a return item at some point. Box of screws was opened. Had I known that I would purchased from somewhere else. Not happy!!!!

2,The ink runs out too fast. Unfortunately this isn't completely the inks fault. Ever ink I have ever used wt the HPJ4580 has run out fast. The printer does a good job rpinting copying and faxing but is an ink hog.
5,Work good!
5,love it
5,perfecto
1,I shouldn't run out of ink after only 3 months.  I only use my printer once in a while at home.
5,PERFECT
5,Excellent
3,as advertised
5,Outstanding
1,After installing the carthridges I ran into a problem.  The color is not up to standard.  It is very faded and uneven.  I have never experienced this problem before.  Also my printer is putting up an error that it is not a true HP product.  Like if you use a off brand.what can I do about this
5,Great
5,good
5,Perfect!

5,Perfect!
3,ink meh
5,fine
5,Perfect
5,Toner works great nad fast shipping Thank you!
2,Received 2 color cartridges and no black cartridge - how is this to be handled?  In a bind because I needed the black cartridge.
1,Do not purchase from this company. The black ink cartridge ran out after 15 minutes of printing (approximately 30 sheets without a lot of text on it!). Complete rip off!
5,good product
1,TAMAÑO DIFERENTE
1,Black ink began fading less than a 1/2 ream of paper
5,Price was amazing!
1,Cartridge registered low ink; re-loaded a couple times and tried turning printer off and on - still registered low ink. HP Utilities stated: 'Used Refilled or Counterfeit - Black Ink."
2,2 color cartriges.  Had to get my black and white @Walgreens.  blah blah blah do do we go yeah do you pow wow?
1,Printed 30 pages on my printer and the ink ran out.  Don’t buy from this seller.
1,this product is Defective! I bought it in October and wanted to use it today after I put them in the printer says cartridge problem. I tried to put my old ones in and it was fine. I want to return it but it's over a month. Such a waste of money
1,The black cartridge did not even come close to printing 200 pages. I will not purchase from you again.
1,I literally printed only 3 good pages then several (maybe 5) with fading ink and then nothing.  I thought maybe it was the installation so I have retried several times to no avail.  The ink levels show completely empty.  I am very disappointed.  Of course will NOT buy this from Amazon again.
1,Bought these back in February because I thought the price was great. I guess you get what you pay for because i just installed them at the end of May and the ink is already gone.  I'll stick with Staples from now on.
1,Not exaggerating. The black ink ran out of about 20 pages of printing. No images just plain text. Awful.
1,The magenta never loaded despite several cleanings. This one was a dud. Wish I’d reported it as defective sooner as the return window closed a few days ago.
1,I bought this last July 18 and now it already ran out.  I haven't printed even close to 20 text pages. I don't know if what was delivered to me was fake. I used to order this before and it lasted quite long.
1,This ink cartridge said was compatible with HP 4650 laser jet printer i purchased & they were not. I d like to return thrm.
2,Too expensive to enjoy hearing the printer follow a command ..
1,The black ink cartridge WAS DRY not a drop of ink
2,Is not a true color may as well just printed in black & white.  Would not buy used cartridges again.
1,The cartridges were empty and has been returned.
1,The ink did not last for long at all. After few prints the ink is already finished. Very disappointed!
1,Wording of the ad convinced me I was getting two I got one and paid dearly for it.  Sometimes on line purchases can spank you hard.
2,the multi pack cartridge arrive in a box that was crushed and old looking like it was 30 years old.the other cartridge was in good shape.
1,I'm sorry but for 40 bucks for a color cartridge I expect a lot of prints. Maybe I'm crazy but I'd like to print 250 sheets with color aspects. But after 40 DVD disk labels it's started to run out. Come on. I got so mad I bought a Canon printer. Bye HP.
1,Did not last 2 weeks
1,Ink ran out within a month! We don’t even print a lot!! Worst investment ever. Do not buy!
2,Only had two uses. Cartridges dry up ver fast.
1,Unless you're OK with using it to print about 73 pages of black text. I bought this a week ago and granted maybe I've printed more than most people in a week but 73 pages seems a bit low.
1,Color seems to be doing fine considering that we hardly use color....  But the black ink cartridge has literally lasted 50 pages before getting the low ink message.  Not anywhere close to 200.
2,Ink does not last at all!!!
1,My printer would not recognize the tricolor ink cartridge. It is the correct type of ink and I have bought other replacements diectly from HP that have worked without a problem. At least Amazon will refund my money.
1,Color cartridge is bad
1,I curse myself the day I buy anything from HP..Buy something take it home take it out of the box.. Three days later..the great fix is on..your products suck.  Print align cartridges.. etc..
1,Black did not work had to take a peice from our old cartridge in order to get it to work.
1,This was claimed to be compatible with the HP 4500 series. Well they aren't. Message:"Incompatible Cartridge(s)The indicated cartridges are not intended for use in this printer."Very annoying
1,Well I tried but my printer isn't recognizing it as genuine HP ink. Probably better to be more careful about buying ink online. Whoops!
1,Very expensive and you end up printing only a few times and then need to buy more.  I bought the next pack from Costco which was more expensive but lasted so much longer I think its worth it.
1,Only printed 20 copies and the black ink is already saying very low and is faded. Highly disappointed.
1,I would never have purchased the product if I knew the amount of ink was less than other vendors.  This is just to let consumers know to have other cartridges on hand when these run out of ink.
1,It was delivered 1/31/2017. This is 2/20/2017 I have printed lease that 1 pack of paper The black cartage is empty.
1,Purchased March 14th.  Installed cartridge.  Out of ink after less than 50 pages.  Total rip off.
1,ran out of ink in 2 months after very little use
1,I have had good luck with these questionable "genuine HP" double packs in the past but yesterday the 901 Black cartridge became defective and locked up my printer - it was 3/4 full and used only 2 weeks.I would appreciate a replacement.
1,The ink clogged up and the cartridge did not work!
1,I ordered black tri color ink and received a 2 pack of tri color. I returned it.
1,Wish I could give this ZERO stars. Horrible! I just installed the color cartridge and it is not working at all!
1,Color cartage did not work at all. Black was scratchy.  I paid extra to get teh HP brand but apparently it was a huge waste of money.
1,One page and dead.
1,Two black cartiages were shipped instead of a combo pack. I was offered to pay to ship the wrong ones back. i wound up with two black cartiages and had to order a color one.
1,Ink last 1 week
1,The ink is priced great and seems to work fine but ink levels are at half before I even used it.  Based on this I do not believe this was such a great deal as much as I got what I paid for which is about half.
1,This lasted for maybe 6 prints. it must have been half dried out when i got it. A huge rip off.
1,worked for a month. That was it.  I looked at the cartridges a d they had expired in 2012.
1,I only received 1 cartridge...and it was suppose to be a 2 pack.
1,each cartridge printed less than 40 pages.  the black one only about 25 pages.
1,I have used this cartridge before.  This time however the ink did not last as long and I had to replace it in about l-2 months.
1,When I went to use this ink the cartridges were empty I have not gotten to use it and I paid $33.00 for each cartridge and I bought two and was empty.
1,Previous purchase of this item the color cartridge stopped working.  That what the low rating is all about
1,Used cartridge and only lasted less than 60 prints.  Black and the color.
1,When I opened and installed..  Printer indicated that the cartridge was defective.  Please advise on how to get a replacement and return.
1,Ordered two black ones but only one worked and one doesn't fit. Not sure if the product is returned will be replaced or refunded.
1,This product does not work with my printer.  Yes it should work with my printer as I've used it previously.
1,This is the exact cartridge my printer uses but my printer says it is empty when I put it in.
1,Black ink produced only 100 pages...no more HP for me.
1,what I ordered is not what I got and when I tried to return it..it wouldn't let me..so what now??
1,The color cartridge was not recognized by my printer I need to return it had to go to Staples to get a real one : (
1,The black ink ran out in less than a week.  Didn't seem right!
1,I have not received it and I have no way to check where the heck it is....do you guys know where it is?
1,The black ink ran out too fast
1,I just bought these and already the black one is out of ink. If I printed out 60 pages that is alot.
1,Black did not work
1,I feel I am cheated....
1,Over Priced
1,It ran out of ink after only a few times.  Very disappointed.
1,Print less than100 pages and both end ran out.

5,Anyone that is looking to save some money and need ink for all your printers or just your one printer.  Amazon is for sure the place to go.  Fast Shipping and always half the price I would pay anywhere else.  Thank You AMAZON!
1,The HP 4500 I have has never worked from the day it arrived. You have to leave it unplugged overnight and then it works for awhile. But if you leave it too long you have to enter the wireless password the day date time etc. I have had it replaced several times but like the HP laptop I have it too is useful mostly as a paperweight. I would like to personally thank Carly Fiorina for doing such a fine job destroying this company.
3,Work perfectly but the price is rather high.
1,I ordered the 901 combo black and tri color but what I got was two tri color cartridges.  The scan label on the back was for the tri-color and black but it was not on the right box.  I called Amazon and they could only refund and send me a shipping ticket to have it picked up since it was from UDC and couldn't have the correct one sent.  I am going to go to HP and purchase the correct ones.  There will be a lot of people with the same problem unless UDC corrects their wrong label problem.  A lot of hassle for me though!
3,I'm not sure why but my printer will only accept the tri-color ink even though this one should work. I also bought a refurbished one in black not worth the money get a new one it's not that much more
1,The ink showed it was low after printing only 3-4 pages.  I thought it was a fluke so I tried the other package and the same thing happened.  It's not a full cartridge.
1,I put my new tri-color cartridge in printed six pages now it shows that the cartridge is empty!!!! Seems impossible since most of the six pages I printed were grayscale. Waiting on a response from seller until then one star rating for a one star product.
1,I bought the ink. Printed 2 4 page assignments.... All black & white and the printer continuously said "no more ink" BUT I JUST PUT A NEW PACK IN!!!
1,The ink ran out in less than a month. I am a college freshman only taking 3 classes so I didn't use it that much. I didn't want to write a review but the incessant e-mails about writing a review became annoying. So here's your review.
1,I. Like. It
5,Arrived on time. Very good ink! I highly recommend.
5,Works
5,great value for the money
5,Great does its job
5,I've been through 3 in the last year or two. I'm not that big on printing. More often than not the money I spend on ink is wasted by not using the printer and the design is such that whether there's ink or not times up!? Need a tank printer.
5,i have nothing to say
5,HP brand cartridge resolved the printer error associated with the previous  after market cartridge.
5,Fits my older hp printer and lasts a decent amount of pages.
5,Consistent every time- lasts a while on our hp printer
