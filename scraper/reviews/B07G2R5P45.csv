5,Have one that is filled up and needed another.  Glad to see it's louder just can't figure out all the numbers on it sometimes.  Don't like to read manuals coz can't remember
4,a poets tool
3,The recorder has 2 drawbacks.  First if you are someone who is not tech savvy this device is very complicated to use.  Second I was very disappointed when I opened the package and held the recorder in my hands.  The ad makes you think you are buying a solidly built recording device.  Far from it!  The photo makes you believe it has a solid chrome metal casing.  On the contrary!  The reality is it is encased in cheap plastic just a step away from being a toy!  Absolutely NOT worth the price of $50.  Very disappointed.
4,This item is not advertised with a model number and its ICD PX240 for a few dollars more could have gotten a much better recorder. I am learning to be careful in buying from Amazon.
4,Use it to record board meetings with 12 people around a table. 1 mic on unit 2nd external mic picks up everything. High quality recording. Great purchase.
4,A fine unit. My favorite feature is the line in that allows for mixing in a second audio track while recording.It won't take an SD Card larger than 64Gb
3,I use recorders daily to take notes while working. Later I manually input notes taken from recorder into computer. This recorderâ€™s voice quality has much to be desired. The quality was disappointing & sometimes frustrating to listen to.
4,I had forgotten what life was like when you used throw away batteries with no indication of battery level. For me the whole point of this device was that it was light so it could be used while walking. But it uses old fashioned batteries with no battery level indicator so you need to keep buying batteries and carrying them with you with zero indication of when the device will suddenly die and you'll need to replace them. The modern version of this device would have a rechargeable battery so it could start each session fully charged. Instead your audio will randomly die and if you're not watching it you'll just lose the rest. I recommend finding a rechargeable version instead or go back a generation and find rechargeable AAAs.
5,It is very easy to use and to upload to the computer. Really plug and play
5,Recording audio inside helmet on motorcycle.  Works great almost no wind noise at 100+ mph.
5,This is the second and third unit of this recorder I've purchased in the past 10 years and I've never been disappointed with it. I'm a huge Sony fan anyway. I use this unit for as a backup audio recorder when filming projects. My son uses it to record lectures at university. They are durable small fit into a loose pocket and the sound quality is amazing. This is a definite workhorse as well. I love the fact that it has an input jack for a lavalier and an output for ear monitor. It's a simple touch of a button use device that can be used for so many different applications and in a variety of settings. Two thumbs way up for this product!
5,Great gift
5,I had an old Zoom that finally broke. I needed a replacement but didn't want to spend a lot since I don't record as much as I used to. (YouTube videos etc.) I find the sound quality very good comparable to the Zoom. (Can't remember the model) (old).The buttons are very straight forward and easy to use. Comes with a lapel mic so yes you can connect an external mic.
3,I've had many digital recorders however with my last 1 which was px370 i was not able to transfer the folders to my computer any longer... so i purchased the PX 470... the quality of sound is sharp when playing it back  however you cannot move the recorder at all or even touch it qhile recording as it will pick up the swooshing sound of moving or touching it right in with the recording which is NOT A good thing! ... thus the reason i gave 3 stars.  To me it is a down grade compared to the 370. But will do in a pinch.
4,I am a journalist and use this for recording interviews. I've used it twice since it arrived and I'm very pleased. The sound quality is excellent. My only quibble is that the tiny screen is hard but that's a very minor issue. All in all I would definitely  recommend.
4,This recorder so far is great - perfect for what I need it for. Seller did a great job in completing the sale and getting the item to me quickly. So far no issues and everything is working as expected.Pros: Compact little unit that replaces another Sony recorder that I paid 5 times the amount for.Cons: Sound quality is good not superior but for the price it was what I was looking for.Seller did a great job  - everything functions as listed nd I am more than satisfied with this purchase.
3,We used 2 times in 2 months and never worked again ðŸ˜ž
4,Although it works great it is somewhat difficult to get the recording volume correct.  It would be nice to have a visual display of the recording level rather than have to set the level by trial and error.  Got a distorted interview recording because the default level was set too high for use with a lapel microphone.
1,Recorded an hour of vocal audio that sounded fine night of recording while playing back to make sure it was fine. Woke up next day to export and audio was corrupted still had the hour recording but was just a buzzing noise instead of the vocal audio.
4,Music
5,I have just started to use the recorder and find it very helpful to keep track of life particularly my ideas for creative work.  I take numerous photos using my cell phone but need a separate device to record the experience of natural beauty in a way that I can retrieve it when Iâ€™m working on a new piece of art.  I also record meetings since my adhd doesnâ€™t help me recall all that I need to remember.The recorder arrived well packaged and has a nice case and the needed cables etc.  This device was well priced and delivered very quickly.
4,It is small and discrete and I use it for taking secretaries minutes.
5,I 'm a journalist and had a similar previous Sony recorder that lasted for about 15 years. This works just as well and is equally easy to use. Highly recommended.
5,This recorder is small but mighty.  It has excellent sound quality on playback and great noise reduction.  Recorded a three hour outdoor meeting with several periods of high winds and it sounded like we were indoors. Very easy to use and to download contents.  Definitely recommend.
4,I would have given this recorder 5 stars except that it is not built like my Sony recorders at work. It feels more like plastic then like metal. It picks up the background noise more than my other recorders as well. It does do the job of recording someone who is quite a ways away. For the price this a good recorder.
5,good for any recording and birthdays and for meetings
5,I like the idea of having a separate mic for the recorder it allows me to put the  recorder in my pocket  and pin the mic to my stole for my homily.  I just wish the  holder for the mic would kiip the mic in place.  It doesn't hold the mic in place rather it slides down and off.  Will have to figure something out to make the holder tighter.  Otherwise I like the combination..Fr. Ed
5,I used to have this recorder for my studies and I found it here! Useful for my need!!
5,I liked the product it was small easy to use and download the files to the computer. I use it to record lectures and songs.
5,Very easy to use. Works just fine. Good enough for what i am Using it for.
2,I would not recommend this unit. I tried it in several situations and could not get a good sound out of it. The addition of the mic was a driving factor but it too was not of good quality.
5,use the product to record songs i will be singing
5,Easy to use basic recorder functions. The microphone clip is a bit cheap though. (The mic itself works fine and is very sensitive)  I think they could have invested in a better clip. Sony kind of dropped the ball on that one. Iâ€™ll be looking for a different mic setup but the recorder itself is a great little unit.
5,I purchased this for my niece for her birthday to help her train her signing voice with playback. Great device with quality sound to hone your craft in the beginning stages of training.
5,I purchased this digital voice recorder for my broadcast journalism class. My students utilize this model like a microphone when conducting interviews and recording voiceover. It is easy to use and to upload the mp3s to our projects. The additional microphone allows the anchors to record their copy without having to see the recorder in the shot. Excellent device!
1,I really thought that mic would help pick up sound and it didn't. This was a over priced waste of money to me.
3,Sony recorder is great and easy to use. However the mic they throw in the package is straight from China and really low quality. Which is sad you will need to buy a separate mic.
5,Compact and durable. Great value for the price
5,Slender of style
5,Muy buena calidad
5,TRIED OUR SONY dIGITAL vOICE rECORDER OUTSIDE AND IT WORKED PRETTY WELL. tHERE WAS SOME WIND NOISE BUT i WASN'T USING THE EXTERNAL MIKE THAT HAS A FOAM SOCK OVER IT. WILL TRY IT WITH THAT OUTSIDE. IT DID RECORD AND PLAYBACK VERY WELL AND I AM COMPLETELY SATISFIED WITH IT.
5,Just need to go online to learn how to use it. Works good expensive for what it does and have not been able to connect to my PC to download.
5,Works well. Good pick up. Handles ambient noise well.
5,I purchased this voice recorder to use in class.  I've had no real issues.  While it does not cancel out all background noise the instructor's voice comes through clearly.  It does what I purchased it to do.
5,I gave this as a gift and the receiver said she finds it easy to operate playback is clear and strong and its size is perfect for a lecturer. Recommends it to everyone.
4,does a good job for the price
2,Even with the microphone the sound quality is terrible. Battery life is atrocious. The hold button and other features makes it difficult to operate. I do not recommend this product.
3,Recording and plsyback not as good as the older modelHowever this model does not need device drivers to download to Windows.
4,Church
5,Easy to use. Used to record Sunday School lesson for transfer to CD to take to absentees.
2,it is okay if you just need a reminder. This is not good if you're looking for something that will have good sound quality to record to a lapel mic definitely do not recommend this for weddings interviews or anything like that..
3,Not the same quality as my previous one. I will continue to shop around
1,Bad sound quality. Stay away.
5,Sony makes the best voice recorder that I've tried.It would be better if they added a loop function.
1,I am a-bit disappointed with this. I did some recording with it. The other person was about 8 feet lecturing The playback was very soft and I had to put the speakers against my ear to hear. Now I am thinking that I have used my cell phone as it's quality is much better.
5,Perfect for work
5,Easy to use great recording quality
5,I really like the portability and quality of this product. I make commercials and this voice recorder does the job perfectly.
5,Used in clinical situations it worked fine. The interface is not intuitive so a little perseverance helps
5,Excellent quality was very pleased with this recorder. Would highly recommend if you are looking for a voice recorder.
3,Listening distance wasnâ€™t great
5,Great sound and easy to use
2,Glitchy usb with windows 10
3,The additional microphone sold with this recorder does not work at all.
3,Recorder very good but the lapel microphone does not work.
2,I bought the voicerecorder and lavalier microphone together the voice recorder works ok but the microphone came broken
1,I have owned digital voice recorders for years and they usually last about a decade without any problems. Not this one. The microphone broke in three months -- it no longer records any sound if you use an a external mic. At first I thought it was the mic that came with it so I replaced it with a new one. But it still didn't work. No sound at all.
1,I donâ€™t like this recorder and itâ€™s almost impossible to return. You have to go to a UPS store instead of printing a label. Thatâ€™s 50 miles for me. What in the world?
5,Does everything I want it to.
5,Product works like described -  Fair price
1,The user manual is inaccurate incompletely and useless that is if you can find it.  Don't waste your money!
5,I purchased this device from Best Buy a decade ago. (You can see that it is a slightly earlier model). It has been with me on four continents. I allowed others--even near strangers--to use it. I keep this next to my bed and whenever it takes me more than ten minutes to fall asleep I use this device to play something I had recorded and as a soporific to fall asleep. (An odd use yes but my point is that it has held up to this kind of treatment for a decade.) I have never found a better made electronic device than this one--ever. I don't usually write reviews for things I don't purchase on Amazon but I am indebted to Sony for this product--so unlike the manifold junk that daily arrives from China.If you need to digital voice recorder you cannot find a better product than this one.
1,Itâ€™s a real nice unit & under $50. There are well over 200 pages of instructions and once I print them up and figure the configurations and their implications relevant to doing anything other than running around in a circle I should experience some real progress.
1,The mic provided did not work with the recorder. Thats the whole reason I ordered it. Will be returning.
1,Sound is still low when turned all the way full volume
2,The audio was fine but it kept shutting off. I sent it back.
2,Poor sound quality.
1,Too difficult to use.
1,I bought this recorder specifically for the mic. But it doesn't work! I have seen someone reported this issue before too. I should have taken heed!
1,Sony DVR ICD-PS240 was sent with an external lapel mic that won't work with it.
2,Love the ercording sensitivity but this unit DEVOURS batteries.  I tried a second unit and got the same results.  Beware.
1,Cannot find model PX-333 and figured that previous models are compatible but this one is not. My office uses Sony Sound Organizer (that came with our Sony DVRs) and I can't get this one to connect. Makes it useless to me.
5,Excellent. Clear playback
5,Great product and customer service!
5,easy to use and clear sound from a distance.
5,SONY MAKES THE MOST RELIABLE ELECTRONIC. THIS DIES NOT DISAPPOINT!!!!!
5,Well it's Sony so you know the sound capture quality is good. As of 7/26/2021 the lapel microphone DOES WORK! Used to motovlog so it was a MUST that it captured my voice over background noise. Very happy!
5,Easy to use!  Very clear recording and very easy to carry in purse or pocket.
4,I have had several of this same model of voice recorders for ?7 years?  They have worked well and are easy to use.  They pick up voices very well - in fact I can often just put it in my pocket and it still captures the other person's voice.  With a mic even under clothing it works well even if you're standing 3 or 4 feet away.I just bought a new one because I thought I had lost one of mine.  The new one works very similarly to the older one as far as functions.  I have not tried it yet it yet for voice quality (wish AMZN would send these reviews a couple weeks later).It is built with a lighter case so I wonder if it will survive the drops that the older ones have.
3,Sound quality is no better than the Sony digital recorder I got 35 years ago and that was very poor. Canâ€™t they improve the sound given 35 years? Come on Sony. Get your act together.They know the sound is awful so they enclose a free mic but that didnâ€™t even help.
1,I received a faulty product. Will not buy again.
5,This is the third Sony Digital Recorder I've purchased.  I was very pleased with the one that I bought myself that I purchased two more for my boys for college.
5,Muy buen equipo recomendado
5,Excelente producto
