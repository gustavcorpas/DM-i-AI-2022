5,I was getting a rash from the default band that came with the watch (seems to be a common problem). Also I have really tiny wrists and needed more adjustability and stretch. Shopped around and similar bands can cost $20+ each! When I found these I figured if they didn’t work out I’d drop the $20 for a single watch band.Glad I did! These are just great. They are totally ajustable so I can make them good and small. They are stretchy enough to slide over my hand. Even with it fitted to my wrist which is pretty thin compared to the rest of my arm I can slide it pretty far up my forearm. I work in healthcare so I like to slide it way up or take it off easily when doing something hands on.CONS (very few):Two strands have come up from the one I wear everyday. However both came off easy (one I just snapped off with my fingers) and showed no signs of further fraying. The braided pattern seems to be solely aesthetic and not structural so when a little strand comes up you can just take it off without worry.The connection to the watch is the slightest bit wiggly but only when you fiddle with it. It has never come off or come near to coming off but I have been a little conscious when stretching it just in case. Basically I just try to avoid pulling it off really quickly or stretching it too much.TL;DR:Buy it! Don’t waste money on the more expensive ones.
5,I’ve used these watch bands for a year now and have been very happy. Actually I only used the pink one and now after a year I decided it was time to replace it. Other than being a little faded and dirty it has held up great. The bands are very comfortable and I love being able to just slip the watch on. Even though I’ve only used one color I like the combinations they offer just in case I decide to switch it up.
4,The only issue is Charging your phone or the charging stand. The wristband is too thick where it attaches to the watch to set all that correctly to charge.
5,The band that came with my Apple Watch would irritate my skin from time to time and I wanted a band that would let my skin breath more. The Swhatty band is exactly what I was looking for. It is very comfortable and I almost forget I’m wearing it. I’m very pleased with this band and will be buying it in more colors.
5,I’ve been using this for almost a year and just broke the band (my fault I accidentally pulled really really hard) and was about to order a replacement when I remembered that it came with 3 so I had 2 left! Definitely a bargain. It’s really comfortable I wear it all the time working out sleeping etc. easy to wash.
5,These are good products I love the colors they are comfortable on I could wear it all day loved it I’m gonna order more
5,Love the watch bands for Apple watch.  Easy to put on adjustable and stylish.  Thank you.
5,I like that this doesn’t pull my long hair and it’s comfortable and easy to put on..
5,I like how durable and comfortable the band is for every day wear
4,I have to tighten these every so often because they stretch. But I like them because they’re light and comfortable and a good buy. I have a white one that got dirty so I hand-washed with a little detergent and an old toothbrush rinsed well and hung to dry on a pants hanger. Looks like new. Recommend.
4,After a few uses the stitching started to fray everywhere. After a month of daily use I've noticed that the elastic is becoming looser and looser - I keep having to adjust it tighter. The bands totally start to smell bad if I forget to wash it after working out. Small amount of soap and warm water in the sink does the trick. Still totally works for now and the watch does feel securely attached. Pleased considering I bought 3 for pretty cheap.
5,If your sensitive to band that comes with the Apple Watch then this is your best friend and $80 cheaper than Apples alternatives. Best purchase ever.
5,It looks not fancy but feels very comfortable when you wear it!
5,I like how comfortable these are.
4,I would have given a 5 star but it gets dirty easily…but comfortable..
5,This watch band is a great fit for me and the cost was great also.
4,They get dirty and fuzzy the longer you have them so watch out for that. Other than that they are super comfortable and breathable. I love that they are adjustable so they they can fit on any size wrist. Worth the money.
5,i love these bands great for Hot days or going swimming very breathable.
3,I honestly love these bands. They are super comfy. The problem is when I exercise or play VR they slip around. I can't get an accurate reading for my heart rate and exercise because it loses connection with my skin just long enough to stop the timers.I know I know tighten the band right? I have. The only way to ensure that it stays in place is to make it really tight (and thus no longer comfortable).I had to start changing the band whenever I was going to be active and wanted my watch to capture it.That's kinda a pain. I mean they're not terrible to put on and take off but it's not ideal to have a band that's not usable throughout 100% of my day.Overall if you're not concerned with heart rate monitoring or exercise tracking this band is fantastic!However if you're planning on lots of arm movement or the like this maybe isn't ideal.I've owned these for 2 months now and today decided that they just aren't going to cut it for my day to day.
5,Excellent price for 3 and very durable
5,Comfortable and snug! Great band!
4,These bands are comfy and cute but they run a bit large for my small wrists. I ended up sliding the adjustable buckle almost all the way around so the band is double-layered. Not the end of the world but not what I expected.
5,Wish they made it with vinyl on the outer side and soft Cushing on the under side
5,So happy with these this is my 2nd order.
5,I find the plastic bands very uncomfortable (hot and sticky)!  These bands have solved the problem - light weight and breathable. I’ll be purchasing more in other colors!!!
5,These adjust easily are very nice looking and comfortable.  The material seems to breathe well and I can barely feel like I have a watch on.  May order some more in different colors/patterns.
4,Two of the three were exactly as I expected. The plain one was not as pink as I expected. It is more of a very faintly pink shade of beige not particularly attractive but also not ugly.  It does match my Starlight watch though which may be good if you don’t want the watch to be obvious or clash with certain colors of clothing. It is soft and comfortable.
4,Nice product  but color was a little off. I thought one was aqua but it isnt' not sure what color to call it but doesnt go well with most of my things
5,Loved the IWatch bands because they are easy to put on and extremely comfortable! The colors are very nice and soft colors. I would definitely be buying more in different colors!
5,Love the stretchy band good quality and the colors are awesome.
5,
5,I really like these bands because they’re easily adjustable they do not make my wrist sweat and they’re very pretty
5,I have sensory issues and can’t stand silicone watch bands. These are a great replacement and are super cute! Very easy to put on and take off!
5,So glad I went ahead and tried these! I am so happy with all 3 of the ones I ordered and came in the pack. I tried the light pink one first and loveeee it!
5,Colors and comfort are top notch!
5,I have small wrists and have tried all kinds of watch bands this is the best by far !!! I’d give it more stars if I could !!!!
4,The solid ones are very soft and comfortable on arm. The multi-color is cute but a little rough on wrist.
5,These are very soft although fit well and not cheaply. I highly recommend these bands they are also very affordable
5,I purchased so I could wear my Apple Watch Series 7 on my ankle when I use my treadmill desk. Cute color easy to adjust works perfectly for the purpose.
4,Smart looking.
5,My daughter and I both like these. The mauve or darker pink has a lot of orangey tones in it so it isn’t my favorite. But the light pink is very pretty.If you have to be around Velcro… beware the watch will snag constantly.Honestly it gathers pills on it a lot anyway so I’m not sure how well it will hold up long term. But for the price I paid they are just fine as far as durability.I would buy again just not the darker pink color.Btw I have chunky wrists and daughter has small wrists and these work well for both of us. It isn’t tight at all on me nor too loose on her!
5,Love them easy to put onthey don't feel loose.
5,This watch band is exactly what I wanted. Unlike the silicone bands I don’t sweatunder the band.
5,Comfortable & easy to take off and put on. Great for my athletics and everyday casual wear. Love it!
5,All good
5,Love these watch bands! Colors are great.Light weight stretchy and easy to adjust.I have the 38mm size watch face and I gave the multi color one which I really liked too to my sister with the 40mm watch face and it fit as well. Can’t go wrong. Great price!
5,I like these watch bands. I have abnormally large hands for a woman so I have to snug it up from time to time after I put it on but it’s comfy and breathable and the colors are cute!
5,I bought an Apple Watch and wore it for some time with the standard silicone-like material it comes with. I wash my hands frequently (as do many people these days) and within a few days I was sporting a small red rashy patch right where the band rests. No matter how careful I was to not trap water under the band it would occasionally get wet (which it’s supposed to be able to do anyway) and trap water against my skin causing me to get a weird rash.Cue my search for a breathable band that wouldn’t break the bank. My set came in 3 colors-the pink matches perfectly with my rose gold watch. The material is super breathable and very simple to adjust to the right size. So comfortable that you can barely feel you’re wearing a watch at all. I’ve been wearing it for many weeks and have not seen any sign of my rash returning!I will say that within the first two weeks I must have snagged against something and it tugged up part of the band material into a little snag of nylon. I could have probably deducted a star for this but honestly I wasn’t expecting perfection for the price I paid. Also I simply used scissors and cut off the snagged part-not only can I not even tell where the material was snagged but even cutting it didn’t cause anything to further unravel.Bottom line-can’t ask for better for the cost.
4,I really like the comfort of these bands and the ease that comes with adjusting them. The only thing that can be annoying is that they will loosen pretty easily which will then make the watch move around a lot on my wrist. Also the green color is nearly the same color as the black
4,Great adjustable watch bands. Comfortable and breathable. only real complaint is they tend to snag on things.
5,Comfortable and lots of complements!
5,Great fit and easy to adjust.
5,Easy to change comfortable and easy to adjust to my wrist size! Happy I got a 3 pack so I can change out the bands quickly instead of buying more!
4,I got these because living in a hot humid climate and struggles with eczema were making it difficult to wear my AppleWatch with the included silicone bands. The breathe ability of these makes a huge difference for me with my skin issues.  I’m now able to wear my AppleWatch again even in humid weather.
4,I’ve only worn it about 3 times this week and I can already see some of the fabric falling apart. I don’t consider myself rough with it or using it out of what one is supposed to and I noticed after the second day that the fibers had already been pulled out. The funny thing is I don’t  remember getting the band caught on anything. The only “rough” activity I did while wearing it was office work. I don’t consider that rough at all. Everything else is fine. I love how flexible it is and how it fits around my wrist. I have ridiculously thin wrists so the tight fit was a good surprise.
4,These are really cute and seem to be good quality.  They do feel a bit tight though so I gave it a 4 star.
5,Absolutely love these the band that came with my Apple Watch would cause irritation on my wrist and since getting these I have purchased many more with the same type of band
4,They are all cute but it sucks how dirty they get.
4,Glad to have multiples for throwing in the washing machine..love the creme and black!
4,These are GREAT. I’ve bought tons of bands and these are by far the cutest and most comfortable of all. I’m also plus size and they fit comfortably with plenty of room had I needed it. Will be purchasing other colors as well.
5,I actually prefer these over the fabric Apple Watch bans. These are so much more comfortable and breathable.
5,So comfortable and easy to adjust to your wrist. Lightweight and stylish.
3,Colors are in accurate. I ordered the black white and pink. The black was true color the white is definitely not white it is gray and pink is definitely not pink it is more of a beige with a pink undertone. I was very disappointed in it as those are the colors that I wanted and thought I was buying. I am very happy with the black one I’ve only had it a couple days so I don’t know as far as the quality of it but so far it is really nice I wished the other colors were accurate I would’ve given it a five if it had been.
5,I bought this because I have RA and my wrists swell. This is VERY soft and stretches when I swell. It is so comfortable I don’t even know it’s there! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!
5,I have been wearing the silicone band that came with my iPhone. I found it often makes my wrist sweat if I wear it the slightest bit snug. The biggest problem I had was how the band doubled over my wrist where a ligament runs up to my thumb. This was causing some serious pain. Had to research the problem to figure out the watchband was contributing to the problem. So I saw these soft stretchy bands and thought I would give them a try. They were easy to put on my phone. Sit firmly in place. The band does not need to be tucked in through a buckle as it is one solid loop that can be loosened or tightened while wearing or before putting on and stretching over hand to get on wrist. It is nice and soft and stays in place without having to be snug or suffocating to my skin. The fabric seems sturdy though I do not expect it to last for years or even a year. It will likely get dirty before I break it. As cheap as these are I'll just buy some more and add more colors to my collection. Overall good purchase. (I bought black oyster white and pink/nude color - all winners).
4,The band is comfortable. But it starts to fray easily.
5,These watch bands are stylish and can expand yet not loose it’s shape. Great for everyday wear
3,The black one started to fray after a week so had to throw it out for a new one. Had this one for about 3 weeks and still intact
4,These are great. Breathable and durable
5,I bought these originally because my wrists would get gross and sweaty during workouts with the silicone wristbands that my apple watch originally came with.These are a great option that is super comfortable and stretchy but sturdy. During water aerobics or swimming they do stay wet but it's not a deal-breaker.I've only had one start to fray a tish but I just cut the fray and move on. It doesn't seem to affect the quality.The longest I've worn one is going on 9 months and it's still going strong (I have tightened the wristband at times).
5,I love these watch bands. Very comfortable on my wrist & I don’t sweat in them like the original silicone type . I would definitely order these again.
5,I bought so many of these! They’re soft to touch and nice and stretchy given that I have quite a large wrist. I like the color options and that I can roll it up my arm when I’m washing my hands to avoid getting water on my watch or the band itself.I saw reviews that said the thread was coming off but I still haven’t had this happen and I work in a hospital and things get caught on them a lot. Durability has been great for me. 10/10 would recommend
5,super comfortable and breathable.  I bought them for the summer since the rubber one makes my wrist sweat.  yeah it's perfect!
4,These are soft on my arm and comfortable.
3,Two of mine broke in half after about a month of wearing. They also start to fray.
5,I have a small wrist but I still bought the size 45mm Apple Watch. I didn’t know it was going to be a monumental problem to find a band that was small enough. I found them! I got the pack with a Pink (more of a tan than true pink) and I love it. It matches my skin tone. I still have a white and gray to change it up. I’m very happy and I’ll buy more colors as I need them.
5,Very user friendly.
4,Nothing  wrong with the product but I had a difficult time getting it on.  To keep the band tight enough on my wrist made it difficult to get on my wrist.  It is hard to tighten the strap after it is on your arm.  I have friends who prefer these to the band that comes with the apple watch but I went back to using the band that came with the watch because I could get the tight fit on my arm.
5,Very comfortable. Good adjustable fit. I really like these.
5,I love these watchbands!  The are far more comfortable than the plastic ones the watch came with.  The electric has just enough tension to stretch to get over my hand and stil stay snuggly on my wrist so the watch doesn’t move around.  The length of the band is adjustable but I do not need to change to take the watch on and off. The colors and patterns are exactly as shown in the ad.  And they fit my series 7 41 mm watch perfectly.  Not sure about durability since these are brand new but they seem fine.  For this price even if they don’t last forever they will be fine.
4,I only wanted the blue band and could only get with the red and mauve.  Disappointed as these two colors are so much alike.  The mauve is like a faded red.  I would return but I needed the blue which is a nice color.
4,They are cute fit perfectly with the watch. however I didn’t notice after long ware meaning multiple days of use it does start to irritate the wrist; so I have to switch between them after a week or so.
5,love these bands. Am ordering more colors now
4,The material wasn’t what I was expecting. But overall the colors are nice & the bands are stretchy & soft! I haven’t worn it long enough to know how durable they are.
5,It’s extremely comfy adjustable and overall definitely worth it
4,I love these! Super comfortable and very stylish. They use a lot of plastic packaging though which I didn't like but nothing to do with the quality!
4,Very comfortable and easy to put on
4,After a while it gets stretchy and needs tightening.  Not a big problem. I like these bands.
4,Love these.  Easy to use.  Very comfortable
4,Snagged on a zipper and now there are some fibers sticking out. Sometimes it rubs uncomfortably where the band end is turned over and sewed down (where it connects to the watch). I bought it for the dusty pink colored one which isn’t as pink as I thought but I like it. Loosens to a small degree while running but not bad. Don’t love the texture on it. If it’s too tight or you rest your wrist on something the texture can press in uncomfortably. Overall decent though. Pretty cute and gets the job done.
4,I was having a reaction to my silicone band so decided to order these.  It's nice that they are adjustable.  However one of the bands slides through the adjustment piece throughout the day and it gets too loose.  I wore a different one and the fabric seems thicker and it does NOT slide.  So that's weird.  Also the creme colored band has some colored threads along the edge.  I guess it's OK but I didn't see that in the picture.  And the pink one is more of a nude color not really pink.  So overall I'm pretty happy with them.
5,Gardening is my hobby.  I can get the band dirty. I have two that I change out almost daily. The bands wash up and dry quickly.
5,True to size
5,Good fit.
5,These are great. Easy to adjust and comfortable.
5,I feel like I have a new watch now!
5,Very comfortable looks very pretty easy to put on and takeoff love the price and my wrist does not sweat.LOVE IT !!!!
5,I like how you can adjusted to fit you and you can make them tight or loose there is nothing I dislike about them
3,I wanted something breathable but wasn’t expecting this material to pick so easily…. It catches and the band has loose strings… cheap cheap quality
5,Perfect for what I wanted
3,These bands are very comfortable and easy to put on. My only complaint is that they do start to fray fairly quickly.
4,Love the bands and the colors
5,I bought these for my 44mm series 5 these are the most comfortable bands I have worn. I usually don't like wearing things like watches or bracelets because it is an annoyance to me to have something on my arm or near my hand but with these I honestly forget I'm even wearing anything they are very comfortable and never slide around or scratch my wrist. The adjustment is great especially for my small wrists and if they get dirty they are easy to clean. I have no complaints and I 100% recommend these to anyone.
4,If your thinking about getting this I have a mixed review for you the black band I received with my two printed ones was a really scratch uncomfortable material needless to say I don’t wear it I don’t like it but the cheetah and leopard print were both super soft and comfy so if u don’t mind taking the chance I say go for it
5,Easy to install. Nice to wear.
4,Love the bands except for the colored thread on the white one.
4,I like that the band is elastic and stays on but I really don’t like the feeling of the material. It’s itchy to me.
4,These are pretty comfortable but a bit of the a challenge to put on.  In order for the bands to be snug on my wrist it makes it tight going over my hand.  I found it difficult to tighten once on my wrist.  Beyond that challenge I prefer them over the standard watch band.  They work great for being active.
5,I really love all the colors. They’re so easy to put on your watch and I love how they don’t feel tight in my wrist.
5,These stretchy straps are easy to install- much easier than trying to hold both ends & insert tab into a hole. They are super comfortable & colors are true to the display
4,Very comfortable not glamorous but so soft and easy to wear
5,Like the colors
5,Very nice quality and easy to adjust for smaller wrists
4,Super cute product but beware if you work out a lot and move your arms a lot. The band doesn’t quite lock into place once it’s on the watch and I’ve noticed it slipping out a few times it’s never fully come undone before but I’m sure it could. Otherwise great for just daily routine movement.
5,I bought these for my Mother whose arthritic hands can't manage buckle straps. These have stretch but fit well. Nice looking bands for an incredible price.
5,As described Excellent Watch Bands
3,These bands are comfortable to wear. They do snag easily and doesn’t hold its new position for long once fastened though.
5,I had trouble with the band that came with my iwatch because I had a stroke a few yrs. ago and my left side is affected. So it was difficult to pull that band to the correct hole.This one just scoots up my hand to my wrist and stays in place. The fabric doesn’t make my wrist sweaty in the summer and it’s lovely to get 3 different colors!!
4,I really like how it fits easy to install and looks good.  just used the black one so far.  Just hope it does not stretch out.
5,This was easy to install and very comfortable to wear I haven’t had it very long but so far it is very durable
4,Easy to install.  Easy to wash when disconnected from the watch.  After time it stretches out a bit and becomes slightly more difficult to adjust.  I would definitely purchase it again.
4,These feel great and look ok. The issue is that they are not as pictured. The one I ordered was rose gold. I got silver. Also the white band does not have a blue and red stripe.
4,The Swhatty Stretchy Nylon Solo Loop Bands  was very easy to install. (once I got the old band off).  I chose neutral colors.  I like the fact that I can just slide my watch on and off instead of having to clasp & unclasp the band.  I gave a 4 for durability only because I have had it for about a week. The band material appears to be good quality but the adjustable slide is plastic.  I'm not sure how long it will hold but judging from the quality of the band itself I  think it will be durable.
5,Love these you wrist doesn’t get sweaty. Haven’t swam with one yet to see how fast it dries. But love for everyday wear.
5,I like them.
5,Excellent value much more comfortable than the original band that came with the Watch 7 at eliminating the sweaty wrist syndrome that I was experiening with the new 7. It was so bad that it has me reaching for my older Watch SE more often than not even though it lacked the always on feature of the newer watch that sweaty wrist thing was looming as a deal breaker… preventing the return the SE as a trade in at the time.
4,I like that this band doesn’t make my wrist sweat. The leather and metal ones do and have caused a rash. It’s also adjustable to the exact size needed.
4,These are comfy the slide stays out and they’re like pictured. My only issue is the cross texture is raised pretty high like Velcro. My white one got snagged not 20 minutes into wearing it. Ultimately not a big deal for the price and comfort
5,I LOVE these. I bought some silicone ones awhile back that didn’t last very long because they didn’t have adjustability. But these one are soft and doesn’t irritate my skin. And I love being able to adjust them so I don’t have to rip it off my wrist every time I take my watch off. Even if it didn’t have the adjustable part it’s still SUPER stretchy so I don’t have a fear of it ripping!
4,It was as expected easy to install and comfortable to wear it.
5,Great product for the price.  Easy to install on Apple watch.
4,Of the 3 bands the colors on 2 were darker than I was expecting. (I got the whitepink and purple). The pink was too dusky. I tried the white and it’s perfect. It’s very comfortable to wear. I don’t know durability but looks good for now. I liked the Apple band but it always seemed a bit too loose or tight so this one is easy to fit perfectly. It’s snug going over my hand getting on and off so that might be a problem if you have large hands. But for me it works really well. I’m very happy with the one band! I guess for the price it’s ok for just getting one that I like
4,I loved these at first then one day I realized there was a strange smell and traced it down to ME/my WRIST! The bands have to be snug to work for heart-rate monitoring and such ... but the nylon band doesn't dry well and starts to mildew. I shower in mine bathe the kids swim in the ocean and so over time the band 'spoils'. I'm OK with it based on the price point...just something to know about the material. Also the band loosens over time so I have to keep tightening it. Again to be expected just something to know. Overall I'd give this a 4.5 if I could.
4,I expected to like the gray one the most then the red then the black but found that I think the black one looks best with my silver watch. Not overly masculine looking (I’m female). The gray one (they call it seashell) is a tiny bit scratchy but the black and red are very comfortable.
5,Very soft and comfortable to wear  convenient to attach to watchVery good to adjust to wrist size
4,These bands are cute and comfortable. The only downside is the material. It has many thin threads that get caught on everything which causes popped threads in the band
5,I really like these bands they are very comfortable adjustable to fit smaller wrists and no allergic reaction as I have to the silicone bands. I get compliments all the time love to switch & coordinate them to match my scrubs or outfits;)
3,The fit of the band is perfect but after a week of wearing it I started seeing loose threads.
5,Easy to change bands and very comfortable
3,Most comfortable band I’ve ever worn. Colors were way off except the black band.
4,They were even better than the description! Perfect fit and adjustable fast shipping
4,The bands are easy to slide on and can adjust for my very small wrist. You have to hold to the adjuster slide when putting on or it will move a bit. A little hard to slide on when you have such a small wrist with normal hands. Doesn’t look like fabric either. Great price for 3 bands. Had been very durable doesn’t catch on things is comfortable and if you get it wet it drys fairly fast. I’m keeping them!
5,As usual always leery on off-product items but these bands are great. I don't like the feeling of silicone but needed something to wear to work that would "okay" if it got dirty.  So far so good. Band is comfy and the band is generous with sizing. With 3 different colors can switch out to add some pizzazz.
4,I like that you can adjust the band so easily
5,Super comfortable & pretty. I swim & was worried about wearing my watch in the pool but the color still looks great after a week in chlorine.
3,Work ok I guess but not very well made. One already broke
5,I didn’t like the band that came with the watch. Difficult for arthritic hands. These bands are adjustable and comfortable. Easy to put on and take off.  Pink color is more of a tan shade but that’s OK with me. Very happy with this product!
5,I ordered a three pack didn’t care for the other colors. but I put on the black and haven’t taken it off since! it’s really comfortable. No rash or mark under my watch band.
3,The bands are comfortable and adjust to the size of your arm. However one of my bands doesn’t click properly in place so I cannot use it. Otherwise I’d give it a 5 star. You get what you pay for .
4,I like fact that it’s stretchy so it’s easier to put on. I also like having optional bands
5,Finally!!! A band small enough to fit my small wrist.  It also stays in place where others allowed the watch face to slip to the side.  Super soft material that is comfortable to wear all day!  Buy these!
5,To put iPhone on my wrist
4,A little itchy sometimes but not enough to stop wearing them.  They’re comfortable and pretty.
5,These bands are comfortable and hold my watch in place without being too tight or pinching. They look good with the watch and fit the watch extremely well. Would recommend and buy again!
3,These bands work great for what they are. They are fairly easy to adjust. Not quite as easy as a sport loop with Velcro but not too bad. The biggest pro to any of these nylon type of bands is that they are more comfortable against the skin more breathable and they will wick away and absorb sweat. So you won’t just have trapped sweat drying and causing irritation like a lot of the silicone ones.The biggest downside I’ve found is just that near one end there is a big loop that is sewn down. This will rub your wrist raw. Granted I am a power user. I charge my watch once a day and wear it the rest of the time. About 23.5 hours a day. To bed and everything.I just have not found this to be very comfortable for a power user like me. As it rubs the wrist raw at that point. So YMMV. If you are just the type of person that charges your watch overnight you may not encounter this issue with just wearing throughout the day and giving your wrist and skin a rest overnight.
4,Not super soft but stays in place well
4,The bands are so comfortable and you can’t beat the price. I was even happier when I ordered them on a Friday night and got them Sunday morning.
3,Two of the three bands work great but the pink one won’t stay locked on the watch so it just slides off.
5,the watch band is very comfortable and easy to wear.  when working out sweat doesn't stay on the band.
5,I was not sure what to expect because of the cost i was pleasantly surprised of the quality. The colors are very nice and they don’t cause my wrist to sweat
5,My granddaughter liked different colors
3,These are just ok. They are as described and they’re cheap. But they don’t look very nice they loosen up while wearing them and I don’t get the feeling they’ll be particularly durable.
5,Very comfortable on my wrist.  Much better than the silicone ones...these seem to breathe more when it is very hot out.  Easy to put on my watch and take off. Very easy to put on/off my wrist because of stretchiness.  Love them!
3,These look exactly like the picture and were packaged well. They fit my watch perfectly but do loosen when I take my watch on and off. It's simple to tighten them again. The fabric isn't as durable as I would prefer it snags and gets dirty easily.
4,Very comfortable and fits well - also very attractive and easy to slip on.
5,They are very comfortable you can tighten or loosen the band up easily.
5,I bought these for the summer because I wanted a material that wouldn’t get sweaty and sticky on my skin. They were well made and  durable and did exactly what I wanted.
5,They are very attractive and far more comfortable then the silicone bands.Easy to change out .
4,……
5,Love being able to switch out colors to match what I’m wearing.
4,I like the feel of the band but hard to adjust the fit. The colors are pretty.
5,These bands are soft light weight durable and look good while one.  Easy to adjust to the size you need and nice that you get 3 colors!
4,These are the most comfortable bands ever for my A Watch 4! The only issue I have is that after pulling it over my hand a bunch of times; it stretches out too much- hard to adjust! I have extremely small wrists and I can dislocate my thumbs- so don’t have to stretch as much to get over my hand… so I ruined one doing that. My new idea is to dislatch one end to take it off! Other than that- pretty and extremely comfortable!
5,I have been looking for these watch bands locally but could not find them. These are just what I wanted.
3,It was nice but to big for me
5,I have very small wrist. These adjustable bands was exact what I was looking for. Fit and look great! I love these!
5,It is easy to change the band from the workout band to the nylon stretch band that closely matches clothing.  I also have a small wrist and they can be adjusted to fit perfectly.
4,Amazing and nice quality! I only got these since they are stretchy and not tight compared to the original Apple Watch bands. With a small/medium band i fit between notch 4-5 (which is either too small or large).As I was trying to take off my band the piece that clips to the watch itself had snapped in half. So I reverted back to my default AW band.
5,Apple watch
5,These bands are great alternative to leather and metal bands  Easy to swap colors.
5,I love these bands so light and comfortable!!!!! Would definitely recommend
5,I purchased this item due to the work I do that kept causing  the plastic to discolor wear and tear.
5,Love love love. This band is perfect for nurses who enjoy a comfortable band that will keep them less sweaty/red underneath the watch. The band can be adjusted to whatever works for you.
5,Wanted a new band.  The included band from Apple i had the Nike band was too tight and made me wrist sweaty.  The main trouble was my carpel tunnel caused my wrist to swell.  I woke up in the morning and my watch band was loose.  By the evening it was too tight.  So I wanted something that would stretch or at the very least have more adjustment than my previous band.  Also these bands don’t hold in heat and they breath so my wrist isn’t getting sweaty.  I actually have about 1/2 to 1 full inch of adjustment left and I have big wrists.  This band stays put too.  It’s not sliding around like my old band.  That’s nice.  I like the way it looks and feels it’s pretty comfortable.  It’s easy to adjust while wearing I don’t have to take it off.  Seems fairly durable so far.  It’s a great deal really to get 3 bands at this price.
5,I like these bands. They hold their shape well are easy to adjust and the adjustment is usually good enough for all day use. They do tend to hold on to a bit more water than I would like post-swimming/shower but it is easy to remove the watch beforehand or pay special attention to blotting with a towel. I usually don't even notice that I have my watch on.
4,
5,Love the choice of colors for a very reasonable price
4,These bands are comfortable and durable. I got them because the silicone bands kept getting caught and ripped off my wrist. These don’t come off easily and they’re stretchy and comfortable.
5,Super easy to put on and adjust. Only downside is the material is a bit rough but it hasn’t prevented me wearing them daily for the past week. Love the colors
4,
5,Love these bands. So easy to change up to match what you are wearing that day. Comfortable and fits nicely around my wrist. These are even washable so if you hit the gym no worries. I would love them in all colors. I purchased the three pack. Black n white  print solid black and the gold and black cheetah.
5,Easy to change bands to match clothes.
3,None
5,I didn’t know how to attach it to the watch so watch a YouTube video to know how to do that. After you watch the video it’s very easy to install. But I love these bands. And the colors are great and it is very comfortable to wear.
5,Lov e the different colors there are so many of them
4,I like these adjustable wrist straps. They are comfortable. I can get them to fit just the way I want them to.
5,Exactly as they are described!
4,It doesn’t fit that well with the watch so you can see gaps and it shifts a bit but for the price it’s still a good deal. Very comfortable too and will be good for
5,Love the look and the colors!
4,these bands are attractive and comfortable but kind of hard to take on and off of your wrist especially if you have it adjusted to fit securely on your wrist.
3,The quality seems to be ok.  I will return in a few weeks for a more accurate rating re quality - since I literally just received these today a few minutes ago.The look…not thrilling.  At close view they look like they’re made out of dish sponge materials.  However you can’t beat the price which is why I will be ordering more dish sponge-looking bands.  If you are wanting a perfect looking band then spend $100 on Apples’s version.  You get what you pay for and I’m ok with these $12-looking bands lol!!!
5,Wear them every day. Love them. So comfortable. Durable!
4,I like these bands and are easy to exchange one for the other. Just remember to take the watch off before getting into the shower or the pool. The only downside is that in order to have a good fit it's tight getting over your hand.
5,I needed something cloth rather than plastic band for my Apple Watch.  The plastic one was making my arm sweat and not very comfortable with being a preschool teacher.  These stretch and are so comfy!  Great value as well.
5,I was seating and very uncomfortable in my silicon bands. Read the reviews for these bands and decided to try them glad I did they are comfortable and don’t sweat or get tight on my wrist. I have been wearing it for a week now.
5,They don’t make you sweat  very breathable
4,I like it especially for the price! It has held up well to time it’s super comfortable looks nice etc. My only complaint is that when I use this band it seems my watch will randomly click or vibrate slightly which makes me think I got a notification. This is very annoying and doesn’t happen with the apple certified bands. Not sure if this happens to others but that’s the only negative I’ve got for it.
5,These are a great value and a great product.  I will be ordering more.
5,Bright colors and they fit great!
4,I don’t like my band tight so this wasn’t an issue for me but the slide will loosen after a time
4,It is comfortable but I don’t know how long it is going to last because the stitching is not on the bands but they’re elevated. Looks loose in the stitching (see close up pics)
5,Great for the price and love the colors  bought these in a three pack and three of us wear them makes the watch lightweight!!
5,I love this watch band very comfortable to wear. I have small wrists and this is perfect fit easy to adjust and it feels so nice a secure on. Great price to receive 3 bands that look great on my watch. I had a hard time putting my watch on with the band that came with it this is so easy because I can just slide it on. The elastic band is great 👍 Happy I found this on Amazon and will probably order more sets in different colors since the price is so good 🙂
5,Really easy to put on and take off and really comfortable .
5,The bands are stylish and comfortable. I also got things to change the base of the Apple Watch as while. I like being able to change the look easy.
5,I bought this set to replace my original apple watch band which is made of a plastic-type material. I hated that any time I sweat during a workout it starts sliding around. It also just sometimes irritated my wrist. These bands are great they are fabric so they don't slide around & don't bother my wrist at all. Great quality for the price I'm very happy with them.
4,At the right size for my wrist it hurt to get over my hand because these aren’t stretchy. When strap is lengthened to get over my hand it is nearly impossible to adjust to the correct size once you have it on. I ended up cutting the metal slider off easy to do. I sewed on a small piece of velcro and it made it into the same type of band as the Apple sport band. The Apple sports band is too long for me but this one is the perfect length for a small wrist.
4,Nice watch bands but picture is misleading. Bought a pack to match my rose gold watch but the adjusters on the strap were gold and silver even though they were rose gold in the photo
5,These watch bands are better than expected. They truly do hold their shape and size with daily use. They are very comfortable and don't irritate my skin.I wore one on a recent trip to Disney and after 4 days of rides and sweating in the Florida heat the bands stayed in place and didn't irritate my skin like other bands do when I sweat.They are so light weight and comfortable you can kind of forget you even have the watch on.
5,These are so comfy! Stretchy and easy to adjust. I wear these every day… buying more in other colors! I throw them in the wash with clothes and it seems to do the trick!
5,I love it just what I was looking for. Adjusts to my small wrists!
5,These are extremely comfortable compared to the band that comes with the watch.  They adjust easy and seem to be very durable.  As with all of my reviews I will update as time goes on.  For now?  This is one of my "Greatest things since sliced bread" items.
5,The comfort and quality is perfect
5,Super comfortable!!
5,I was looking for comfort and ease of putting on/off and this is it. Excellent bands! I have small wrists and wanted something adjustable and this worked for me. I actually didn’t even need to adjust but I’m glad I can. I love the colors too.
5,These bands snap right in with no problem. They fit in the slot on the watch without sticking out or catching on anything.The black one has been my go to band since I got them.I don’t feel like my arm gets as sweaty as it did with the silicone band. I have noticed that taking it in and off the band loosens a bit but I don’t find it has lost any elasticity.I was my hands several times a day and it doesn’t hold water if you blot it with a paper towel.No rashes no itching. Sometimes I forget it’s there.
4,I workout most days and need to change bands frequently. Nice to not spend so much money to do so. Only real change I'd like is a Velcro option and the watch attachment fits a 44 but the length is for a 42(the only reason for a 4 star). I do have a small wrist so it's still great to be able to make the band snug as I like. Also I would love to pick out the 3 band I want rather than having pre-selected packs. Functionally is super though and I'm very happy with my purchase.
4,Lightweight and comfortable. Easy to put on or take off.  Definitely want other colors.
5,I love the colors and fabric
5,Good value- comfortable and durable. I like the color options.
4,One of my favorite purchases that i’ve made in most recent memory. These bands were a significant upgrade to the ones I was previously wearing. However this band just broke after a few months of owning. Very upset that the connector is not as durable as I had hoped.
5,These bands are awesome! I literally forgot I was wearing my watch it’s so comfy. However I do have a 8 yo handicapped son. Getting him in and out of his car seat to his wheelchair to his bed I happened to hit his ear and head with the metal adjustment part of the band. This is nothing to do with the product and I didn’t hurt my son but if I get careless or in a hurry I don’t want to make a mistake and hurt him or my other kids while wrestling. I recommend these bands and this product line to who ever is reading this review.
5,I was pleasantly surprised. The quality is there. The band is comfortable easy to adjust has quality nylon and is easy to attach to my watch. Would absolutely buy more of the same style from this brand/seller.
5,It’s great because it’s adjustable to fit any wrist. It’s a stretch over not open band. I though I was buying a Velcro only to find a stretch band that I really like better. Soft too!
5,Easy to put on and great quality!
4,Easy to install. Material is light and textured. Not sure how well it will hold up but it has an attractive appearance.
3,The product itself is decent the quality doesn't seem to be the best and I have doubts about how long it may last the colors are slightly less vibrant than pictured (but generally expected) for the price I'd say it's a solid 3-4 star product. However the design of the product drops it down to 2-3 stars for me.This product is an elastic band where you can pre-adjust the length based on wrist size but the way to get it on is by elastically stretching it to go over your hand. It's also quite difficult to adjust the band length once it's already worn. This is highly problematic if you don't have a smaller hand and/or larger wrist.I have a thin wrist but large hand and bones (easily spans 10 notes on the piano and can reach 11th). For me to adjust the length so it rests somewhat comfortably on the wrist it gets ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE to put it on over my hands. Putting it on or taking it off every time hurts my hand a little + I feel like I'm breaking or stretching out the band where it won't last very long.
5,Easy to put on and off with stretch band. Also much cooler to wear!
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I wouldn’t say it’s the best because if you have it on a little tight it leaves a mark of the band but it’s looks great and feels nice.
5,Was surprised at how easy they were to change out.  Like that it just skips on and is easy to adjust.
5,I was born with a bone disorder in both my wrist which my bones are bigger than most people these work perfectly for me!! I’m very happy with my bands.I did have an issue charging my watch last night but that’s not a big deal could of been user error also😉I also work where I’m constantly washing my hands so sliding it on and off works really nice.
5,Ordered these bands for my new Apple Watch. Very easy to attach good quality and very attractive!  Just received a week ago so can’t judge durability but they are made so well I doubt there would be a problem!
3,The band itself was great but the plastic watch attachment broke off when I removed my watch from my wrist!.
4,Very comfortable to wear these watchbands. Only problem is that it’s difficult to slide over my hand once I have adjusted the size.
5,3 bands in the package all different colors. Presently surprised by the quality. The bands are a bit thicker than the other ones and feels more secure. Love these. Great product at a decent price. The only downside is I had to wait 3-4 days for it to arrive. Not a deal killer.
5,I love that they are elastic but don't look chintzy!  I got the Beige Black and White. Perfect to slip on in a hurry and the price is out of this world!  What a bargain!!!
5,EZ install and looks good - great price for three bands
5,I have a small wrist and this band was great. I love the colors and comfort.
3,The metal in the strap isn't very rounded eventually will dig into your skin material isn't very water friendly either.
5,They adjust to my wrist & fit perfect. Absolutely love them !!!
5,Live these when I know I’ll be doing anything active.
4,The way to install its Backwards they haven’t get loose but still it shouldn’t be that way
5,not a thin strip of elastic - integrated design which gives it strength and beauty. i can't relate durability because i just received them. very comfortable and easy to adjust for comfort. very satisfied!
4,These bands are good quality. Can be itchy when worn for a long time.
5,These bands were very comfortable and I have been able to exchange them easily. They do loosen throughout the day a little (the holder slips) but not enough that is concerning or not easy to fix.
5,One of the best bands I ever purchased so far. Super easy to put on. Slip and go! Easy to adjust and won’t come off. Super stylish and goes with just anything. Super cute. I will definitely buy again!!!
5,ETA: A friend of mine told me I ordered the wrong size. Returning these and reordered in the 40mm :)Updated to 5star because they are excellent.Super cute and comfortable; but edges stick out as pictured. They’re secured to the watch; but the corners are pretty sharp as they stick out.
3,3 bands for the price is solid value.  I've got them Oct and the first one broke about 3 months later followed by the 2nd band a month after that.  The attachment points when the bands slide into the face are plastic and after on & off enough times they break.  Your hand is wider than your wrist so there's a lot of tension applied as the band slides over your hand and expands.  I can't really complain too much due to the price.  I like the look and comfort.  I might try to find a band with a metal connector.
3,These bands were easy to attach to my watch and were very secure and easy to adjust. Overall I was very happy with them. The downsides is the string creating the design frayed and over time two of the three watch bands have broken making them unusable. They were great for a while but not a long term solution. They also hold onto moisture for a long time and do not dry quickly which for some causes irritation to the skin.
5,The silicone apple bands irritate my wrist. And I’ve bought other nylon bands in the past that close with velcro and then the velcro wears off over time. These are so much better cause they just stretch over your hand and don’t come apart after installed to the watch. They’re easy to install onto the watch.My 1 companion t is the loose thread that makes up the Diamond design. I foresee this getting snagged and pulling to make the band look old and frayed in the future.
5,well. i’ve always used the plastic bands or the longest it’s always too tight. a bit loose and they made my wrists itch and sweat since there was no breathing to be allowed! these are so stretchy comfy and immediately don’t give me the uncomfortable feeling the plastic ones do! i love these. buying more colors asap
5,Love the look and comfort of these bands.
5,I bought these due to my wrist sweating while wearing the original band that came with my Apple Watch. Not only did I get 3 bands my wrist no longer sweats from just wearing it
5,I like this band and it is comfortable.  It is a little difficult to get on and still be comfortable without  having to readjust it.
5,I would 100% buy again !
3,I thought the texture would be different but it’s quite odd. Additionally it’s hard to adjust the band to get it on and off.
5,I usually don’t like to wear plastic or heavy watch bands during warm weather these are light and fashionable
4,Considering you get three of them for not much money they are definitely worth the money. In terms of durability they definitely do their job and hold together pretty well. There's some loose threads but it's still doing its job and looks cute.
5,Very comfortable and nice looking!
5,I go to the gym a LOT and wasn’t happy with the sport loop that originally came with my Apple Watch as the Velcro seemed to irritate my skin. These were the perfect solution! Affordable comfortable flexible durable and they fit my ridiculously small wrists. They don’t look out of place with my watch at all and I like that I can change the band colors with ease. The bands also hold up to my rigorous work outs and the frequent on/off’s for charging. I will absolutely buy them again when the time comes.
3,I liked the comfort of the band however the stitching on my first band did not last very long. Bought at the end of January and broke in the middle of April and I am not very hard on my watches. I guess it’s good that it comes in a pack of 3 and the overall price isn’t terrible but wish it would’ve lasted a little longer.
5,Ordered this for my wife. She loved the look and the adjustability. I have 3 myself which is why I got these for her b
4,Used with Apple Watch. I have a very small wrist and this band works good to size down.
5,Light weight  Very comfortable.  Stretches on off easy.  Will buy more. But- not good for sweat/water. Does not dry quickly.
5,Los recomiendo a ya que son ideal diseños y colores surtidos para combinar con la ropa que uses a diario
5,
5,I was a little scared to order after reading some of the reviews. Once i opened i instant liked the quality and feel of the band i had purchased these to replace the silicone ones that came with my watch. I love how adjustable they are and it easy to adjust the band i have a wide wrist so this is a plus i would  suggest  adjusting it  before putting it on as it can be a bit tricky adjusting it while its on your wrist. The only defect i found was that the band was a little wobbly when i attached to my watch not anything too concerning and once on i didn't notice it and it still held my watch pretty secure.
5,I love all the different colors that I ordered and they are so comfortable.
5,Love these!
5,These bands are exactly what was advertised. They're comfortable and easy to install. They were inexpensive too!
5,This is a wonderful watchband for Apple watches. It's easy to put on and it's great not having to mess with buckles. I love that it's adjustable too.
4,These bands are good quality and very comfortable easy to switch on and off.  But the picture mislead me: I thought i would get off-white black and pink.  But the pink one is actually beige.
4,the ands are really nice and super chic (especially good for working out). But I've noticed that with time the bands can get to be loosened/the metal strap doesn't always stay in place. If that's not. major issue for you I still think this is a good buy.
4,Really cheap product for the money it does the job. if you want a high quality band that looks expensive dont get these. but they do the job and work just fine
4,The stretchy nylon loop adjusts easily and stays put on the wrist.  Band is comfortable and doesn’t slide around on wrist when playing golf.Colors of the bands look bright and vibrant on line but are dull and disappointing in person!!
4,They are comfortable and easy to install. I don’t know about durability yet but they seem like it will work and the price is affordable.
5,Came quickly. Comfortable doesn’t make your wrist perspire. Seems to be durable. Easy to put on…no buckles or snaps to hassle with.
5,Loves these bands. They are very comfortable and so cute. Will definitely buy more !!!
5,So comfortable and easy to adjust!  Love them!
5,Great band for price. Not itchy doesn’t overstretch
5,This band is so easy and comfy to use that I even sleep with it on. I forget it’s on and the material is very durable. This was a great price almost a steal for the quality of this product. I’m buying some for my adult kids now since they already stole the other two bands. 🤣
5,These bands are holding up very good.No worry about it coming undone and losing my watch.I’ve had to tighten it up a couple times no big deal.Lastly it doesn’t leave a smelly odor like the rubber ones do.
5,I walk with a walker 24-7. When I’m not walking my iWatch goes on my wrist if I’m walking it goes on my ankle. This eliminates  the need to constantly change bands which gets old quickly. I can slip it off my wrist and a simple adjustment it slips onto my ankle.Perfect! Great colors really comfy great quality!
4,So far they are very comfortable and easy to get off and on . Much better than a plastic band .
4,My solid plastic band was too hot for the Texas summer. This one is much cooler. Adjusting the band is easy. Very light weight. I work in the garden with it redo furniture and it’s held up fine. It does not take long to dry when it gets wet.
3,I bought lots of bands when I got my new watch. These are just okay. These can be adjusted but if you don’t keep it tight it will not keep your watch from going to “sleep”. It gets snagged a lot and leaves marks on my wrist. I still use them sometimes but like the rubber band better.
5,These are so great for the price. A much better alternative than the stock strap in my opinion. Even when they get wet they dry pretty quickly. No complaints about these
5,I wanted a stretchy loop-style band for my Apple Watch that was adjustable and this bundle was a great deal!
5,Very comfortable does not feel like I have a watch on
5,I have stupid chubby wrists and so have had a hard time finding a band that wouldn't hurt my wrist. These are easy to adjust and have lots of room to move. It looks okay not my favorite design but does what I need. I wear one daily.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Looking for starchy band for I watch highly recommend this the color looks even nicer than the photo.
2,The colors are great and it fits well into the watch but only after one week the elastic band was tremendously stretched. Not a good design because you have to take your watch off to charge. It needs better colored elastic
5,I am really happy these fit on my watch and are more secure than the band that came with it. I can also change colors as needed.
4,I have been sleeping with my watch to monitor my heart rate and with this band the watch is comfortable. I like that I have other colors to switch to if need be
3,I have a 42mm series 3 watch. The little install parts at the ends of the band that you slide into the watch are fairly loose when slid into the watch and they wiggle around while in the watch. They are too small for the watch so they don’t fit into the slide-in area correctly. Still gets the job done and I’m continuing to use the bands since I only use my watch to workout with but kinda annoying and I’m worried it’s going to fall off one day.
5,The media could not be loaded.
5,I have always preferred Apple's bands but I've recently lost weight and their bands no longer fit my wrist.  I don't normally mind a lose fitting watch but it doesn't track your sleep or exercise correctly if it isn't snug.  I came across these and I'm so thankful.  They are perfect for my tiny wrists.  I've worn it to the gym pool and shower and the band dries quickly.  I wear it 24/7 and it does leave funky marks on my wrist but whatever it's snug enough that all my trackers work now.  I would buy again if they don't last....I'm pretty hard on my watches/bands.
5,Por el precio creo que está muy bien.
5,Very comfortable and soft.?
5,All positive on this purchase. I don’t know the durability factor as i just received them
5,I like the comfort of the band and how they can be easily adjusted as well as dressed up or down by simply changing the watch face!
4,I like the fit. They are still new. I will change this if needed. I needed something other than plastic for this heat. These seem like they will be perfect.Edit. I still like them after a week. I do not like the pushy seller who didn’t read the review and sent me an email asking if I received the product and could I review if I did. One star down seller. Product is still good.
4,These work great with my Apple Watch! Did find they show dirt (lighter color) and also stretch a bit. Thankfully they can be tightened. Easy to slip on and off - great color options!
5,Perfect
5,Finally a perfectly sized arm band. I tried 2 other apple watch band brands before this one and both were on the smaller end of sizing. I also love the colors. I got army green blue and black. The material feels expensive.
3,Love them! Very comfortable and durable. I wear the white one gardening/every day wear and just wash the dirt off with dish soap and let it dry. Metal ring does get scratched up and overall will probably rust or look cheap after a while.I like that it is breathable. This is the main reason why I needed a different band for my watch other than the rubber one it comes with. It’s nice if you live in hot weather or you sweat a lot!Aesthetically I really like the white one. The black one is simple and is a nice back-up for an outfit that doesn’t match white with blue and orange stripes. As for the pink I think it’s hideous but might be someone else’s cup of tea.Overall I gave it 3 stars because as we know it is made from cheap materials probably won’t last very long and the pink one is ugly in my opinion but it was the only way to get the black and white one.Cheers!
5,The straps are breathable and comfortable to wear.  It is very convenient to quickly put on.  For its look: simple and neat.
3,The material is scratchy against my sensitive skin and I can’t wear the bands. The sand pink one came to me with a few threads snagged from the metal adjustment slider on the band itself. They look cute but not for me sadly.
4,These are much better than metal or silicone bands. I’m not in love with the look. They are obviously cheap but do the job I need them to do. They’re breathable quick drying if they get wet or sweaty and washable as well and that is the main plus. I don’t have to keep adjusting because my skin gets irritated with the bands I bought prior. It’s a great price for three bands.
5,Comfortable band and easy to adjust the size. I have small wrists and this fits great.
5,Very comfortable and color is great!!
3,The black band is fine but the cream colored one has a blue and red line running through it which I’m not happy about. Doesn’t show that in the picture and the rose colored one is very muted and more of a sand color. Wished it was more on the rose side. Disappointed.
5,I use this for changing them according to my outfit. Great
5,I love these wristbands so much I bought  the same ones for 3 of my friends who also love them.  They also cost much less than the Apple brand wristbands.  They are comfortable and easy to change out.  I made a great decision in buying them!
4,Nice colors
5,I love these bands. Simple and comfortable!
5,I am very pleased with these bands.  The silicon bands did not work for me and I am beyond pleased with the comfort of the bands.  The colors are exactly as shown.  Would highly recommend!
4,Soft and comfortable but doesn’t stay in place
2,I tried to post pictures but it’s not working for some reason. I may have them if it will let me later. The watch band is overall very comfortable and attractive but it pills easily and the plastic piece that attaches to the watch broke quite easily.
5,I like the stretch and the different colors.
5,As someone with sensory issues the span is not scratchy nor too tight. I like that it is adjustable and it doesn’t readjust every time you put it over your hand like some others I’ve tried. Overall very nice
3,I didn’t care for how they fit. The adjustable clasp hits funny it’s not exactly comfortable and doesn’t lay smooth.
5,These watch bands are great especially at the price. It’s so much easier to slip these stretchy bands on than the normal Apple Watch band. They do soak up moisture (when you’re working out) but I’ve had no trouble throwing them in the washer & air drying.
5,I like the product
3,I have trouble getting the strap tightened by myself. I have to loosen to take off and tighten to wear. I thought these were Velcro closure like my Apple bands. Just beware they are a little difficult. They are cute colors and soft.
5,So much more comfortable than the original band and with three I can change when I want a different look. Plan to get more in the future.
5,Watch bands met my expectation.
5,Fit nicely. First order was the wrong size so be sure of size!
3,I went through two watch bands in the span of 3 months because they broke. The part that connects to the watch snapped while putting my watch on even though I didn’t keep it tight around my wrist.I also prefer the ones that can be easily tightened with one hand; this one cannot.They looked good but didn’t last and not worth the purchase.
5,Great product! Comfortable and much better than the scrunchie ones.
5,I wear my watch to bed to monitor my sleep
5,It's just what I was looking for!
5,I loved this product as the other bands break my hands out. these are comfortable as they snug and fit perfectly !
5,My wrist is very small and this adjustable band is perfect for me comfortable as well.
5,Love these sport bands. I’ve found that a lot of watch bands that claim to be “breathable” aren’t at all and my arm has hives at the end of the day. But these are truly light and breathable. You can’t even tell you’re wearing it - which is important to me with working out. Safe buy!
4,Easy to change out and adjust.  Being able to slide it off/on is handy.  And the price is right!  :)
5,I just got these watch bands and they are incredible especially for the price. Super comfortable easy to adjust and great for working out!(They are also wash friendly)
5,These bands are affordable and the fit and feel of it is great.  Very easy to install and it's adjustable making it even better.  I love quality of the stretch nylon for wearing it all day long doesn't feel sweaty or sticky.
5,Lasts long time easily adjustable. Fit well. Nice colors. Great material.
5,Great bands. Fit well. Doesn’t sweat on wrist.Pink is a dirty colour not vibrant like image. White is slightly off colour also. Black is great.
4,It is hard to put the watch on when the length of the band is set so that the watch won’t slip around when it is on your wrist.  There needs to be more elasticity  in the band.  I do like the looks of the bands.
4,Me encantan para uno q tiene sus muñecas gruesas son muy cómodas !
5,These bands are soft and stretchy. I plan to order more in more colors!
5,I love the stretch bands! I don’t worry about them accidentally coming undone they’re very comfortable too! Easy to change a variety of colors.
5,By far the most comfortable watchband I have ever had for my Apple Watch! Will definitely be purchasing more.
5,These straps are a better alternative than the original plastic strap the watch comes with. Good for people with sensitive skin.
3,The bands are comfortable. But only last about a month before fraying. I wear my watch every day and use my hands a lot. See photo for the fraying.
4,Really cute.. super comfortable  maybe not for everyday wear mine is starting to thread this is after I had cut some of the tread off it keeps coming out…
5,If you are like me you probably hate the feeling of wearing a watch. Yet love the idea of wearing a watch. These bands are amazing! They are so comfortable and durable. It feels like you are not even wearing it. I also have large wrists and as you can see in the picture I have it adjusted with lots left to spare. Great product. Great price. You can't beat it
2,What I don’t like about this product is that once they get dirty it’s trash time but they are very comfortable even the black band got dingy and whitish looking so yeah it’s a no for me.
4,Fair price. So far the quality it pretty good especially for the price so no complaints. I would recommend. 👍🏼
5,Love this set !! I’ve been using one of the cheetah print ones for a bit now nice stretch so cute I get compliments all the time !! Plus u could change them depending on your outfit. Very comfortable too
5,So far I've worn all 3 bands in less than a week.  Pretty Spring colors!
5,Not the material I thought it was but still good.
5,Pop on and off your Apple Watch faster than a scrunchy. Screw feeling too tight after a long shift. The cloth is soft and will definitely catch on things but for the price for THREE…worth it.
5,I love the bold colors and adjustability of these bands. I usually purchase my nylon watch bands from Apple but their options were limited on colors/patterns and their price is $49 per band vs $13 for 3 bands with Swhatty Stretchy Nylon Solo Loop Bands.  Great price for a great product; very happy and will purchase more
5,It's easy to change between the different color bands and they are comfortable.  I like that the band doesn't have a buckle so it is smooth on the wrist and its stretchy enough to slide over my hand to put it on.  The bands are attractive and look a lot more expensive than they are.
4,I wanted a band that was easy to switch to for walking jogging etc... so my leather one wouldn't get dirty. These will be perfect.
5,Very comfortable and stylish
3,I bought the 3 pack of bands and was switching out to match outfits. With the black band  only one side stays tight. I don’t really want to return all 3 but I can’t figure out how yo get in touch with seller yo perhaps exchange just the black band.They are easy to install and are very comfortable but I’m disappointed one doesn’t work correctly.
5,Love the adjustable band i have small wrsit so is easy and comfortable
4,The plastic connection to the apple watch is a little fragile so taking the watch on and off is a bit difficult without breaking it
5,This is my second order for this particular brand. I was very impressed with the first as they fit well well made and very affordable. I’ll probably will order another set soon as the color choices are much to choose.
3,The gray one is really not gray
3,I ordered a 3 pack of bands for my Apple Watch. The band itself feel great! Most of the times I didn’t even realize I was wearing my watch. The watch never went into lock mode. However the plastic piece holding the band to the watch seems to fail every 5 weeks. This is very unfortunate since the bands have such great fit overall. Hopefully this can be improved on future products.
5,Only issue the white one doesn’t stay clean long
3,I wanted a wrist band that was easier to put on than the silicone “pin and hole” strap I got with my watch and this fit the need. But it gets too loose after a few days to read a consistent heart rate and I can’t really tighten it when it’s on my wrist. It is a good watch band except for that issue.
5,Comfortable and look nice
5,Great!
5,These are good wristbands. When it’s wet it takes time to get dry which is the only problem I see. But otherwise good ones.
5,Very comfortable.  Easy to install.
4,These are pretty and work really well! Only downside is that they tend to get stretched out over time. Still great value and I’d definitely buy again
5,The only thing I’m thinking is that they might turn out to not be as durable as I would like - but I haven’t had it for too long so I’m it sure.
4,I really like these bands. I would have given it 5 stars if not for the white band. The other two are definitely 5 stars.
5,Fits nicely. More comfortable than the apple band that came with watch
5,Easy to install
5,I have only used these wristbands a few days but am very happy with them. They comfortably and securely. The original band that came with my apple watch came undone all the time. This new band fits well and seems like it will keep the watch on your wrist and off the ground.  I think they are a great deal!
5,Theses bands are super comfortable and easy to put on. I don’t have to worry about my watch falling off.
5,Not as easy to put on as the plastic one that came with the watch but it fits well enough I forget I have it on.  Good buy as you get three you can change in and out.
5,So far they are great bands for the Apple Watch. I don’t know about the durability because I just got them. They are comfortable and easy to put on.
5,Tried to get a good picture of how raised the stitching on the band is. It’s very raised. I didn’t expect the stitching so raised. Not sure if mine is a mess up or what. BUT that being said. It is the most comfortable band over.  I hated the sport band that came with the watch. This is so comfy I hardly know it’s there. I remember someone told me I could sleep with the watch on and I wasn’t sure how that’s even possible with how uncomfortable the original band is but I can totally see sleeping with this band. I would say it’s totally worth it.
5,I have big wrists but all the bands for larger wrists are for men. This ended up being perfect!
5,Easy to attach and adjust
5,Really comfortable looks gray. Happy with purchase.
3,I love the feel and that I don’t have to worry about the clasp coming loose. What I am not so happy with is the color of the bands they look dingy and not clean.
5,These are so comfy. I work in the OR and I’m not allowed to have watches or jewelry on during surgery. So these bracelets are nice because it’s an easy slip off and on rather than trying to knock the pin into the hole. Not itchy or anything. Loved the colors
5,
5,I want one in every color. Very adjustable stretchy but not too stretchy. Super soft and comfortable!
4,The Watch Strap is light and comfortable. It is adjustable which makes it even more convenient to adjust based on your preference. I also noticed that the strap is very light and feels good on the wrist.
5,Really comfortable durable and matches my Apple Watch perfectly
5,Nice watch bands.  They fit my Apple watch perfectly.  Tried them they seem very comfortable.  I can't comment on durability as I just received them.
4,Not very adjustable once it’s on your wrist.
5,These are super cute! Definitely would recommend.
4,These are comfortable but snag on almost everything. The black one came with some pieces of the band fringing out. For the price they are worth it if you like this style of band and you get 3 of them.
3,Maybe it's because my watch is 41 mm but the band has come off a couple of times while putting on my coat or pushing up my shirtsleeves. It is easy to adjust and very comfortable. I don't know about the longevity of it I won't keep using it if it continues to slide off so easily.
3,These are not comfortable I had to take them off after a few days. The metal all the loop area irritated and scratched my skin
5,These are very comfortable. I love the colors. Easy to take on and off.
5,I didn't care for the plastic band on my Apple watch.  I ordered these and am very happy with them.  They fit perfectly and are adjustable.  Interchanging the bands is very easy.
3,Don’t like the colors or looks when wearing.
5,Nice bands! I have small wrist and these bands are great! Very comfortable.
5,Beautiful bands nice colors and they feel wonderful. Only thing is the material gets very easily caught on Velcro or a rough material and it rips the band.
5,Thank you it’s exactly what the wife wanted !!!
5,I love that they are soft they don’t get wet I thought they might be damp bc I wash my hands a million times at work but they held up
4,The watch bands were easy to install. The colors pictured are what I received. They arrived on time.
5,Very good quality
5,Love the comfort and the colors and how I can adjust them as well
5,They are so soft that I’ll forget I even have my Apple Watch on.
5,I love these bands I’ve been wearing them a week and they are super comfortable and soft. I was tired of the rubber ones and I’m glad I went with these. The colors are also really nice! Highly recommended
3,I bought these three bands for my AW 45mm. One band the black one is perfect. The other two printed bands are actually larger and are too large for my small wrist. The printed bands are unusable. They otherwise feel nice and seem fine quality-wise. I just thought I was paying for 3 bands but I only have one usable band.
5,
5,I love the colors! So vibrant and perfect for spring! It’s very comfortable to wear all day
5,Not sure on durability but so far so good
5,Getting 3 watch bands at this price is a real deal! I can switch off depending on my outfit. Nice look. Easy to attach and adjust. Just enough elasticity to be able to remove your watch from your wrist without adjusting the band. Happy with this purchase.
3,I got the black/red & black/white & black combo abs they are nice bands. One big problem though… I only just today tried to change to the red & black one and discovered that the little button in the middle of one of the ends that slides into the watch is missing so it can’t be used. Of course I find this out after I’ve worn the others many times and the return window is closed.
5,
4,Good price for what you get
5,The wristband is stretchy and easily adjustable.  Because of the flexibility I do not have to unfasten the band to charge the watch — I can comfortably slip it off my wrist — and back on when charge is completed.  AND the bank looks nice!
5,These watch bands are great! They are light weight and very comfortable. So far  they seem to be holding up very well with daily use.
5,Comfortable easy to change and get on and off
3,Band loosens up after a few minutes of wear.
5,Absolutely love that they are so comfortable and so easy to put on my wrist. At first I couldn’t figure out how to tighten the strap on my arm. But watched the video and had to try it a few times before it felt natural. Now I would never use any other style watchband. Snagless durable and good looking and the will never accidentally fall off.
5,Product was fine. Just as advertised
5,Perfect fit since they are adjustable.  Easy to install.  Love them.
5,I really like these watchbands. I got a new Apple watch and bought one of the super expensive Apple bands. I love it but can't pay those prices. These bands feel just as good. And look good too.
4,Nice for use simple to use
5,I bought this as gift and had to come back and buy some for myself! The material is amazing it feels as if you don’t even have anything on your wrist. It’s adjustable light weight and great quality.
3,These are so comfortable and I was so exciting thinking that I’d found my new every day watch band. After two weeks of wearing the pink band the “metal” adjuster is turning my hand green. I’ve switched to the black to see what happens next.
5,Convenience for Daily use
5,I have trouble securing the bands with the little holes. This one slips on and is cooler to wear than the plastic ones
5,Fits well.
5,Great quality
5,Easy to wear easy to adjust.
4,The only problem I had was getting it on my wrist after adjusting it. Hard to adjust when on my wrist.
5,Product value was excellent!
5,Just got these and I love them so far. Like the feel on my wrist and how I can adjust. They are light weight. Will update review if something changes as far as wear and tear. Great find for the price.
5,Nice to be able to just slip the band on over my hand instead of fumbling to fasten a two-part band
4,I wear bracelets and the snag they’re constantly getting caught in the watch band. Pink is cute black looks kinda manly.
3,It probably is fine for most people but for me I need to make it really tight because I have a small wrist however it also needs to go over my hand and between the two issues I have not been using them.
4,Comodidad
5,These bands are easy to install and are comfortable. I have only had them for one week so I can’t comment on durability
5,I had ordered these on FB thru BoldBands. Not the adjustable but just regular stretch ones but way to big. Asked company for a replacement they sent me same. Mind you they came from China each one 18.95. Amazon great price easy to return if needed. Fit is perfect. The BoldBands only refunded my money when after 8 weeks trying to get them to respond I wrote a comment on their FB account and within 20 minutes I received an email my money would be refunded. Amazon great deal and great purchase for me
4,Much more comfortable than the plastic band that comes with the watch and easy to slip on and off.  The colors depicted online are not the same in person as usual.  They appear dirty compared to the images online.  But they are a good buy for the price.
5,Love this watch band for my Apple Watch.  It is very easy to adjust and looks quite smart. The rose gold color goes very well with my watch too.
5,I was looking for a watch band that wouldn't loosen over time. In the past I've had issues with watch bands that eventually became so loose that it would no longer track my exercise. These bands are soft comfortable they can be adjusted to fit as loose or as tight as you want and they appear to also be hypoallergenic. I don't think it was advertised as hypo but my skin is handling them just fine when normally my skin is very finicky about what my watch bands are made of. 10/10 would buy again
4,Good band. Like that they are elastic  and I can wear them without having a allergic reaction.
3,I wore this band for 1 day and the strings in the design had already been loosened! I didn’t do anything strenuous whatsoever while wearing the watch so it’s not like it was caught on things. The band also doesn’t fit in the slots on mine or my husbands watch very well.
5,They are so comfortable! More comfortable than the original plastic bands.Not to snug but easy enough to adjust if need be. Keeps its shape dosnt come undone. Very very comfortable
5,Me encantan! Son muy buenas y a un súper precio!
3,It bands are soft and comfortable. However when you install them to the watch the part you attached to the watch fits loosely. The Rose Gold is more loose than the Cream and Black Band. The Black Band attaches the best.
5,Love it.I have a small wrist and this one fits!!!!
5,I love these bands! They are very comfortable and I really like the colors. The green and black are solid. The blue has a thread on the edges that makes it resemble blue Jean material. Easily adjustable.
4,Easy to install
5,I’ve had these for about 2 weeks. These bands are so comfortable they have survived my toddler and my everyday life. They fit just right and don’t squeeze. They are also very easy to adjust.
4,If I could get the black one I’d appreciate it & will return the green one. I wear a black one daily & would just use the gray & navy upon occasion. Thanks
5,Easy to take and put on
5,I bought these elastic bands because the standard Apple Watch bands were starting to hurt my wrist. These are comfy cute and easy to adjust. If you have a skinnier wrist expect to have to re-tighten it after every time you put on which is a little challenging one handed but not impossible.
5,I love how easy it is to change them and I love how comfy they are!
5,I like how easy they are to put on compared to the original band.
5,I love these bands! They are so comfortable I forget I have my watch on. The colors are fun and they are easy to get on and off the watch!
5,Used for my new Apple Watch. I am very happy with the price and appearance of the 3 watch bands.
5,This is so much better than the bands that come with the watch more comfortable less sweating.
3,I would give it a higher review but I was sent the wrong size I asked for 45mm and got 42/44mm but other than that it’s comfortable
5,I like all three colors and the watch band is very comfortable
4,They’re really cute but they are the tiniest bit scratchy.
5,Very comfortable to wear. Stays put without having to feel tight. Soft material that seams durable. Pretty colors with a great unusual puffy pattern.  Excellent purchase for price!
5,Pretty colors and like the fit.
5,I have a very small wrist and this band is fully adjustable and can be made to fit perfectly.  The  colors are great to mix and match whatever you are wearing.
5,Comfortable.. easy to install.. colors are great can pair with anything. Band moves with you.
3,The band digs into my skin and irritates it. The fabric also started fraying within the first week of wear and got dirty quickly.
5,They are cute and comfortable
5,Very comfortable
5,Works great on my Apple Watch. Make sure you match your watch up to correct size band. Colors are true to pics. Love being able to slip off easily when working in sink.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I like this band way more than the band it came with. It’s not itchy it doesn’t stuck to my skin in this sweaty summer heat and it’s the perfect amount of stretch. It was cheaper to buy the 3-pack than a single band so I just have my adult child the black one and he likes it. He said his o lay co cern was charging which I’m willing to sacrifice for not having a plastic band still to me.
5,it takes a little while to get used to the little clip. but otherwise i love it
5,I purchased this band to replace the strap that came with my watch because one day I was reaching into my bag and the strap came loose which cause the watch to fall off my wrist and break. I no longer have to worry about the band coming loose because this strap is secure and stretchy so no more complicated hand movements to put the watch on either.
5,I’ve gotten compliments on how cute these are. Versatile too. Definitely recommend.
4,You just need to get used to the metal clip that expands the loop. Easy to install and remove. Nice comfortable snug fit
5,I absolutely love these Apple Watch bands. They are super comfortable and I love that it doesn’t irritate my skin like the silicone ones do.
3,These are comfortable and easy to use.  The main complaint I have is that the threading starts to break down after a few weeks.
5,Super comfortable! Skin doesn’t sweat or get irritated by the band.
5,Received it sooner than promised. Really easy to install and adjust. The band is super comfortable and holds my watch snug but not too snug if you know what I mean. It feels just right. The material is soft and it looks really good on my wrist. I’ve just had it for one day so I can’t speak to the durability but it SEEMS like it going to be fine.I’d definitely buy it again.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Very comfortable even to work out in. The pink one just now started getting dingy after wearing it over a month. Would buy again!
5,I really like how comfortable these bands are and easy to put on and take off. Once you adjust the size they are easy to slip on and off because they stretch.
5,I like this a lot.  Most of the plastic/rubber ones eventually causes a skin irritation on me.  You can adjust this to fit.  Its stretchy lets you slip it on and off while the adjuster stays perfectly in place.  It's soft on the wrist and looks better in person.  The sliders are plastic but they seem sturdy so far.  I haven't had to clean it so far but it looks like a little soap and water will do.  The photo is the pink one.
3,I like the band but it is starting to fray & I haven’t had it a week
5,Usually I don’t rate products but I’m really really happy with this one!!If you’re looking for a watch band that’s going to make you forget your wearing a watch this is the band for you. I had tried all sorts of bands and they were all too sweaty or too pokey whatever the case was they didn’t do what I needed them to do. These bands however are weightless and so so so soft and comfortable. The color options are great and once you adjust them to your wrist you won’t have to do it again. Overall amazing!
5,Colors matched the description. Easy to install and comfortable to wear all day and night
5,I like this product very much.
3,They were cute but I like to wear my watch in the water and these were not waterproof. If you take your watch off when showering you would be fine with these watchbands! Definitely nice looking!
3,These are very cute and comfortable but not durable for everyday use. Mine began getting pulls and fuzzies after a few weeks of wear. If you want it to look like new I’d use these to match an outfit for light use. They just don’t hold up well with everyday use.
5,Very comfy and the colors go with everything.  Definitely recommend!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Super cute I didn’t expect the material to be what it is but it’s very comfy. They fit great for my series 4 Apple Watch and I got the 40mm one for the price I think these are awesome. The only thing I would say is that they’re a little difficult to get off but it’s not a big issue unless you have super delicate skin and wearing them honestly feels like wearing a lightweight scrunchie it’s so comfy.
5,Very nice! I wanted something that would secure better than the bands that come with the Apple watches and this does it. Stretchy and durable and lots of designs!!
5,Worth the money had a little hard time adjusting it and putting it on. Does get a little loose after wearing.
3,Reasonably priced for 3 bands but disappointed that 1 broke within only 1 week of wearing
5,These bands are super thin comfortable and stretchy! The material is nice for working out as they don’t slip down my wrists like most silicone bands and for wearing while doing everyday things. I have a larger wrist and these are adjustable so there’s plenty of room to loosen and tighten the fit as needed. I’ve been hand washing them with some dawn and air drying them after workouts and they’ve held up great. I’d recommend these and will absolutely be buying more soon!
5,Great for easy off/on band
5,The Apple Watch band is very comfortable and was easy to put together. My wrist never gets sweaty wearing it unlike the rubber watch bands. I like that I can switch out the colors so easy based on my outfit.
4,Love the bands.  The only 'issue' I have is adjusting the strap once you have it on.  It's not easy to do one handed.  Other than that it's great!
5,I purchased this pack specifically for the blue and pink print that looks like it came from a set of chacos sandals. Definitely not disappointed my Apple Watch now looks outdoorsy and is also mad comfortable. I like the stretchy bands that I can push up my arm to wash my hands and this ones great because it’s adjustable.
5,Used on my Apple Watch. Like it much better than the plastic band that comes on the watch
5,Cloth elastic doesn’t irritate my skin. My wrist was getting all rashes from the silicone bands. These are much better.
3,These bands do not stay tight.  Where I had to adjust the threads have worn off.  I wore it for 2 weeks and it looks very used.
5,These are my favorite watch bands. I will buy more.
3,I loved these bands when I received them but they just didn’t fit my wrists. I have the 44” Apple Watch so I can see the screen and had originally purchased with the pink braided loop band in a size 4. On the tightest settings of these bands they’re still too big and the buckle looked bulky and awkward. If you have bigger wrists they would work better! Super bummed I had to return!
5,I wasn’t sure about fabric but I really like these!
5,These are really comfy and durable and the colors are so nice!
3,The colors of the bands were not as pictured. The pink was more a salmon. The white was grey. I’ll keep them because the price was good but would not purchase from this vendor again.
4,
5,these are so comfortable and they are easy to size.  Love the colors. I recommend them to anyone
3,This was my favorite band! Only wore my watch durning the day after a couple months it broke :( Wish it was more durable.
5,Like the feel and how easy it slides on
4,More comfortable than an apple band.  Easy to adjust to perfect fit.
3,Putting them on is kinda weird not in a bad way just either fit it to your wrist size and stretch it over your hand everyday which will probably wear it’s elasticity faster or keep elongating and shortening and that’s hard to do with one hand. Also charging it’s kinda weird since it doesn’t easily rest on the charger like it regularly would. I don’t hate it though super comfy on the wrist. Plus looooove that it’s washable.The colors that I ordered aren’t EXACTLY what came but that’s fine too.
5,I went to the Apple store and their bands were 100 dollars for one and the girl who took care of me said “go to Amazon and you will get them at a better price”. I am very impressed with my bands. They are very comfortable and durable as well. Not to mention the price is right. Never going to the Apple store but to this company that makes this product legit!!! My daughter now wants me to order the same for her.
5,I bought another brand and they smelled terrible when they got wet. These don’t. I’m constantly Washing my hands because I work with food and every time these get wet they don’t smell at all. I love these I will be buying more in different colors soon.
5,I love these bands for my Apple watch! I'm not a fan of the silicone/rubber bands - I just find them uncomfortable and they make my wrist sweaty. I purchased these as an alternative (cream/rose pink/black) and they are great! They are comfortable easy to slide on and off (no more fussing with a buckle) and the blush color is a close match to my rose gold watch - the cream and black are also nice complements! The weave pattern and gold strap buckles give them a classier look too.
5,I really like these a lot. Took some getting used to but once I found the best length that wasn't too tight but also stayed in one place I absolutely love it. Way more comfortable than the silicone bands that I've always had.
3,Very cheap looking. Didn’t like.
4,Like that the bands are adjustable and never seem to stretch out of shape
5,Very comfortable.
3,They are really cute but one of them the pink one came with a defect :( I will probably have to return it.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Love it I needed it because I recently lost weight and needing an adjusting strap without feeling to snug! Wonderful
5,These are very comfortable. Easy to add to watch. Stretches onto wrist.
5,Love these bands. Super easy to install to the watch and can make them super teeny if need be if you have small wrists like myself and have trouble finding bands small enough. Super pretty in person!
3,Love the actual band but the connectors have play where it connects to the watch. You can feel the play and feel it click as well as see a gap open and close. On all 3 bands I have. Just doesn’t bring confidence when your hand is out the window of your car or above a toilet
3,I was disappointed that the slide part on the bands was gold on the white and rose colored bands. I have a silver watch so it doesn’t go together. The black one is nice though.
5,The bands are exactly as advertised and super comfortable.
5,I got this just for the purple color but fell in love with the other colors. The band is easy to put on and super comfortable
5,Really like these bands. They’re comfortable and sturdy. Best of all there’s no more smell on my wrist from the rubber bands!
5,Perfect for my Apple watch and comfortable. Flexible fitting.
5,I just received them today and put it on right away in a snap. It was easy to attach and very comfortable to wear. It adjusts like I was hoping and is sooo comfortable. Thank you for a great product I will be looking for more for sure.
5,These are very comfortable and don’t irritate your skin when wet!  Love how they fit too!
3,It's hard to get it on your wrist very tense band. And once you get it on it's hard to adjust it with one hand so you kinda need to adjust it before you get it on and the biggest drawback is it WON'T stay that way and just gets loose which affects your heart monitor...I wouldn't return too much hassle but won't recommend either.
5,I love this product i will buy again in lthers colors
5,For someone who is allergic to metal these bands are the perfect choice.  Durable comfortable and long lasting.
5,Just got my first Apple Watch and had a hard time with the band it came with.  Mostly because of the arthritis in my hands. Found these and read the reviews and thought I’d give them a try. Absolutely love them. So easy to take off and put on.  I just slip it over my hand. In fact my sister and best friend just got them too.  Great band at a great price.
2,Material and colors are nice but the adjustment does not stay in place as you wear it it loosens up.
4,theyre comfortable and really stretchy i gave it 4 stars because the product was great but i received one with a different design than the others ..
3,Good product
4,These bands are a wonderful comfortable option. I found it difficult to tighten the band while it was on.
3,Not the best but they will do a lot thicker than I thought the material is coming apart as in the quilted as in if you rub it it’s tears.
3,The colors are nice however the fabric is a bit fluffier than depicted in the picture. But for the price I think they’re fine.
5,These bands are really comfortable. I recommend this product!
5,this is almost like the Apple bands only much cheaper. Fits well and looks great
3,The mesh is loopy and cheap looking
5,This are great bands!  I switch from the original that came with the watch and wish I would have done it soonerbb
3,The description says cream black and rose. Don’t be fooled it’s not rose… not even close. It’s brown. Also the stitching is raised up significantly not just a sewn in design on the band. It sticks out.
5,I wear these bands with my watch now instead of the Apple bands. I find these to be much more comfortable and easy to adjust. I will say that because I wear one band almost every day I have noticed it has some threads coming out but it still functions great just a minor issue. I would still say they’re definitely worth it!
5,Got them for my wife for Christmas and she loves them more than the leather bands will be ordering more for sure.
5,I love the durability and the ease of use with this. The price is hard to beat when you get three bands!
3,There is nothing great or bad about these bands. I don’t like the material on my skin so returned them. They are cute but I wanted something that fit more snug and felt more secure.
3,The only reason why I give it 3 stars is the cream colored has orange and blue stitching. I really really wanted this for the pink and cream colored bands. Other than that love the feel Easy to adjust and love the color selection
5,They fit really nice and stay at their adjusted size.
5,Comfortable casual bands. Much more breathable and comfortable during summer heat outdoors than the rubber or metal. I like the adjustable band and that it can stretch over your hand like a hair tie would on your wrist. You get 3 different colors so the price is great. I didn’t realize from the photo thought that the white one has red and blue stitching along the sides but it is subtle so not bad.
3,They feel light weight and adjustable. I’ve snapped two of them within a month just taking them off. Disappointed because they are comfortable.
5,Love them!
3,Nice and stretchy but attaches very loosely to the 40mm Apple Watch SE. does not really inspire confidence in that it is securely attached. Would not buy again and would not recommend it.
5,I wasn’t sure I was going to be happy with an off brand band but I have to say these are as nice as the Apple band. The stretch is just right and they seem super durable.  I love that they’re adjustable and the colors are vivid. I’ll be getting the rest of the colors for sure! I’m picky so if I say it’s good it’s good! ;)
5,These stretchy bands fit well for all size wrists. They are cute and comfortable. Love them!
5,You can make the band loose or tight.Sometimes I don’t take my watch off th wash dishes I just push it up my arm and it stay.  Love these bands.
5,Love these bands. They are so comfortable and high quality
4,The color of the bands are were close in color all are darker than they looked when I ordered them. Still they are a very nice fit and lightweight.
5,Easy to swap out.  Very comfortable.
5,I like the quality of this product. They are very comfortable. I have very small wrist and I am able to easily adjust to the fit I want.  The price was great. Getting three watch bands for the price that I usually pay for one is a win win.
5,I've only had them a week but so far it's been great. It stretches enough to get on my wrist but is tight enough to not wiggle around once on without me having to adjust it every time. I would recommend!
5,Great quality for the price. i’ll be ordering more colors
5,I like the fit it’s nice and stretchy.  I like most of all that I feel very secure wearing it.  Meaning that it's not going to come off of my wrist.  The band fits like a nice snug hair scrungy.  It doesn't make you feel like your blood circulation is getting cut off.  This seems to be a very good product at a very inexpensive price and you get 3 different colored bands.
3,Fabric frayed after first use.
4,Fits and works as it should
5,Very comfortable and has held up really well.
5,I got these bands because  the Apple watch plastic bands made my wrist sweat during summer. These bands are light weight and stretchy enough to pull band on and off over hand.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I wore the band for about 3 hours and took it off because it was itching. Woke up to blisters on my wrist.
5,I liked the variety
5,This was real easy to install/replace leaves no marks and  adjust to fit real comfortable thin and smooth enough to avoid getting caught on things.
3,Gonna try to find something else. It’s been too long to return these but these just aren’t that great. Too loose and it slips around Normal tightness and it hurts and leaves marks.I might just have sensitive skin but I wanted to post this in case it helps someone else.
5,Very comfortable and cute colors. Came exactly as pictured and fit very well.
5,I found out two years ago that I’m allergic to the rubber bands with the little metal buttons. Since then I’ve been searching for an alternative. I’ve had some fabric ones but they never really fit well. I have SUPER tiny wrists child sized hands and I’m able to get this band small enough I’m not afraid of it flopping around. Super happy with my purchase
5,I like that the watch bands are of good quality for being so cheap in price. I am very happy with them. They stretch to fit over my wrists where I don't have to readjust them every time I put them on and they are tight enough that I don't have to worry about my watch falling off either. I can change them along with my watch faces and tempered glass covers for great fashion with my outfits. Awesome buy to add to my collection. Love them.
5,Easy to adjust the size.
3,I have worn two of the bands so far the first one was ok comfortable to wear no complaints. The second one I wore for a day and it broke the plastic broke and the pin fell out and it can be fixed. Disappointed.
5,Exactly what I was looking for !
5,Very confy easily to slip on the wrist with no hassle and super cute.
5,Glad I purchased!
5,Comfortable.
5,The bands fit perfectly on Series 5 watch. Seems to be durable & very fashionable.
5,I love these watch bands.  Easy to adjust. They fit great for my wrist.
4,Love these bands but I did receive the wrong color for one of them… other than that through they are great for the price.
3,I really like the look and fit of these watchbands until you look closer and realize the iwatch connectors are made from cheap plastic.  They do connect securely to the watch. Give them a quick wash with soap when you get them bc they smell vinegary  (if that's a word) when first received.  They do dry fast though and do lose that smell. Overall a good deal for the price I guess.  I am curious how long they will last.
5,I love this product it is very comfortable easy to put on and off perfect match with the iPhone watch love it
5,I have a larger wrist and usually struggle with watch bands these are super comfortable and easy to use and wear They were affordable also
4,Worth the money. I’m not sure if I like the nude color but the black and pink are my fav
5,Nice band
5,The product is great! Its comfortable and stylish as well!
2,Threads come undone on all bands.
5,I ordered a similar stretch band from another seller which I was very satisfied with.  I searched for more and found these.  The price for 3 is great.  The watch bands are very good quality.  They are so comfortable fit the iWatch perfectly and I really do love them!  No issues with the seller product was just as described and arrived on time!
5,I bought these for my father who had a stroke and struggled with his original band. This one is perfect for him he easily slides it on and off and adjusts it Its comfortable on his skin. I would 100% recommend for anyone.
5,This was a gift for a teenager he said it more comfortable than the original band . Adjustable to any wrist size.
5,I love these watch bands to wear during the week. They are easy to put on and I like that you can easily adjust the size to fit your wrist.
5,Great fit easy to adjust size and very comfortable. Absolutely would recommend.
4,Very happy with color selection price and compatibility with my Apple watch.  Would recommend purchasing.
5,They're easy to put on and are very comfortable
5,I love this band  very comfortable and fast shipping
5,The watch band is super comfortable and they look great!
5,These are very comfortable! Works well for me because I have big wrist!
3,Scratches your wrist and isn’t the most comfortable loop out there
4,Stretches after while then becomes loose on my wrist.
3,The elastic becomes loose after just a few days wear.
5,Easy to put on and work great
4,Shipped quickly.  Product is the same as pictures and description
3,The bands look great and fit well on my watch. The price was most reasonable for three bands. I do have trouble keeping them at the same tightness since they seem to loosen throughout the day.
4,I like the colors price and adjustablity. I'm not sure about durability yet.
5,I received my order so quick and I love the bands they are so comfortable I will order again …
5,I had been told the stretchy bands were more comfortable and less sweaty and it's true - so glad I ordered.  Now I have 6 colors to choose from and I'm not taking it on and off throughout the day to let my skin breathe.  Easy to adjust comfortable - great purchase.
5,Great value for the costPretty colorsInstalls easilyStretch band is convenient and comfortableHave to get this kind because silicone breaks my wrist out and was so happy I found these. Love love love them. And easy to switch out
5,I ordered these because I like the idea of having different colored bands and I love that they don't have an actual size limit. I have super small wrists and being able to wear my watch comfortably is so nice. They're also super durable and soft! I'll be getting a new watch soon that is a 40mm watch face instead of 38mm so I'm incredibly excited to use these!
5,Was looking for a comfortable band that was not silicone.  Really like these.  They stretch to go on but stay put.  Looks good on and colors are as shown.
5,I have small wrists and these are just perfect for someone who does. You can adjust the band to the size that best works for you and it’s super cute but simple! Would definitely recommend
5,I hated the band that came with the apple watch so I found myself not wearing it.  These make me feel like I am wearing nothing and I got compliments on how cute it is!
5,I purchased these watch bands because my wrist always seems to fall between two sizes on a typical watch band. I have also struggled with rashes from the plastic Apple Watch bands. These bands are comfortable stretchy durable and come in great colors. I bought a second package for my teenage daughter.
3,Hard to adjust
5,Just what I was looking for
4,Very nice for the price!
5,I don’t like that it can’t get wet.
5,Comfortable & easy to install. Love the colors i chose. Hopefully it’s durable like it says.
4,I love there bands I don’t eve feel like I’m wearing my watch
5,I ordered two Apple Watch band styles for my husband to try.The price was great quality seemed fine and the colors are as pictured. (Can’t evaluate comfort or durability since he didn’t try them…)I don’t have anything negative to say - they just weren’t to his liking and he decided to keep the silicone sport bands instead.
5,They even fit better than the one that came with my Apple Watch.
5,I really like these bands I plan to order more colors.
5,Me and my best friend both love the quality it’s great. Very adjustable.
5,Fits great. Stretch is enough to pull on without having to adjust.The metal adjustment band ended up sitting against the inside of my wrist and sometimes irritates it but overall very much prefer over the standard band which came with my watch.
5,They fit perfectly and the colors are nice. High quality!
3,Ok
5,These bands were easy to install and fit great. Can't beat the price.
5,
5,I didn't realize how much I would honestly like these.  I would highly recommend.
3,Not meant for heavy wear. Thin plastic broke easily  Not durable
5,Loves these super cute and comfortable!
5,So perfect! Love the colors. Fit well. Super easy to put on watch and your wrist. Lighter colors can show dirt. A little soap and water and like new again. Would definitely recommend.  Perfect for active wear. Less sweaty than the plastic bands. ☺️
5,I hated the watch band for my Apple watch always afraid it would come off these easily slip over your wrist and are very soft.  They are adjustable for larger wrist but fit my smaller wrist size just great.  I do have to push down on the face to get an accurate 02 reading because I don't like the band super tight.
5,As a nurse I wash my hands MANY times throughout the day. These bands make it easy to pull my watch up my arm and out of the way of the water. If a wet band stays on my arm my skin become irritated and breaks down. These bands have been the answer to the problem.
4,The watch bands are good quality and fit well.
5,Loved the bands. Best for everyday wear for any occasion 👍🏻
5,Great band. Comfortable & inexpensive.
5,Quedan perfectas son cómodas y son bellas!! Encantada!!! Súper recomendado!!!
4,Love the fit of the band and the material
5,Easy to put on and remove prefer this to the stock watch band as it stays much closer to the skin.  It
5,
4,Its Nice
5,These watch bands are very comfortable. I wo
5,I have no dis likes with anything I order
5,They are very comfortable. Easy to adjust. Although they all fit a little loosely in the watch. They don’t click in that tightly. So I’ll have to keep an eye on that. But so far so good. We’ll see how it is in a few weeks after wearing.
4,Just received the product yesterday and so far I am satisfied it fits my series 6 watch 44mm just fine
3,I really like how these bans feel on however only 2 of the 3 locked into place. I was looking forward to the rose gold color which was the color that doesn’t lock on one end. It appears that the little plastic bump that locks the band in place is sunken in on one side which lets the band slip out.
5,Was looking for a cloth band due to the rubber ones making me sweaty and irritated. These are easy to adjust breathable stretchy and super cute.
5,Comfortable and soft you forget that you’re even wearing them don’t have to worry about it coming undone and falling off very nice
2,Product is very comfortable and I love the color! Unfortunately the material arrived unraveled in places due to the raised pattern.
5,
3,Not as dressy as I had hoped.
4,Pretty good!
5,The media could not be loaded.
5,Came as described and fit perfectly
5,I loved the cute colors that these watch bands came in!  It was very easy to put together.  You simply place the straps into their connections located on the watch and slip your hand through!
5,
5,I love these bands.  They are stylish. The sparkle in the bands makes it look more like metal and it gives the whole watch a comfortable upgrade.
2,This product was exactly what I was looking for able to find a comfortable fit and looked good. The plastic part that attaches to the watch itself is made of cheap plastic though that doesn’t last very long. Already broke two of the three bands after 2-3 months of wearing it
5,These bands were super easy to install and super comfortable too!!
3,The bracket that holds the pin at the end of the band broke & I only wore twice.  But I really liked the style.
5,I would recommend these stretchy adjustable watch bands to anyone. With the ability to adjust the straps there is no wrist too small or large that this band won’t fit.  Its an added plus that it not only is very comfortable looks good but the price was right.
5,Easy to get on and off. Comfortable to wear
5,So far I really like this watch band. It’s very comfortable and I like the color options to choose from. I’m always nervous wearing the original watch bands and feel they’ll easily fall off. But with this band I’m not worried at all and love it easily slips over my hand. Also it really is a one size fits all.
5,Comfortable durability and most of all easy to install.
5,These are much better quality than I expected. The price is so good and quality is great. What a great way to change up your style.
5,Finally found a wrist band I really like. Fits just the way I like and very comfortable.
5,Comfortable & cute!
5,The colors are great and material is soft. I love that they are adjustable. My new favorite watch band.
3,I’m not really happy with these bands. They are very bulky & loosen while wearing.
5,I don’t like the The iron part that is on top of the band
5,The bands are just as pictured and can easily be adjusted making this the most comfortable watch band ever!  I love the gray and the blues.  But the 2 blues are very similar in color the background elastic band is just a little lighter shade on one than the other.  I am ordering more colors now!
5,It arrived on time. Immediately switched out of my old watch band. I like how it stretches and can adjust the wrist size. Nylon texture is nice. Love the deep plum color as well. Might consider buying other colors. Thank you.
5,Easy to change comfortable and cute
5,Nice product
5,These are nice bands. Fits the watch well and easy to install. Just stretchy enough. Easy to adjust for size. I have been wearing one for several days and it is comfortable and it holds its shape. I may get another set in different colors.
5,I love these bands! They are comfortable and easily slip onto your wrist. You just adjust them and you’re good to go. They do stretch out a tiny bit but I just tighten the band a bit more.
5,These are my all time favorite bands for my Apple Watch - Very Comfortable!
3,Came snagged out the bag. The plastic connection to the Watch is very loose and flimsy. It feels very comfortable but it’s very cheaply made.
5,I bought these because my wrist is too small for some bands and too big for the other that are made for the Apple Watch these bands adjust for my wrist perfectly I would recommend these bands to anyone
5,Stays put and is easy to adjust. Very comfortable and stylish and affordable compared to the "brand".
5,Comfy great price looks great with my watch face
5,Love these watch bands! Pretty colors comfortable and love that they’re adjustable. My wrists are small and I feel like watch bands are always too tight or loose until I found these. You can adjust so it’s the perfect size! Super happy with this purchase!
5,I love the different color options easy to change. The only think is at the beginning the bands were causing itchiness which i almost returned back because of it but then it eventually went away .
5,I have been only wearing black so far. Easy and comfortable. No complains.
5,Very happy that I chose to purchase these bands. They fit so well and are so comfortable. The stretch on the band is perfect. I tightened the band to fit my wrist and every time I put on the band stretches with ease and doesn’t feel like it’s losing its elasticity. Great quality! Definitely recommend!
5,I love these colors more then the last ones I ordered this is the second set I’ve ordered and they are great
5,Very comfortable easy to switch great value.
5,My bands are so comfortable and breathable!!! Love everything about it!
5,Perfect
5,I LOVE these Apple Watch bands. Once you adjust the strap you should be good to go with slipping it on and off. Way more comfortable than the sport band. You have more flexibility to bend your wrist and whatnot. 10/10 recommend.
5,I love the flexibility it has and secure around the wrist
5,I really liked that this stretchy band allowed my skin to breathe and not cause sweaty buildup underneath. Easy to install and easy to take off and put on.
5,Easy to connect very comfortable!
5,Love these watchbands.  They are easy to install and adjust to size and the price is so reasonable that even should they wear or get soiled overtime they could be replaced.
3,Elasticity color Fitbit very good.
5,Fast seamless order...came as advertised.  perfect fit
5,Great product. Super comfy bands.
5,Nice and comfortable. The best thing it’s breathable.
3,Bands get looser during the day. I have to tighten it a lot.
5,My watch came with the silicone band and it was hot and uncomfortable. These are so much better! The are attractive as well as comfortable.I will probably buy more just for the different colors. The price makes them very affordable.
5,the item is perfect?
5,I wanted a comfortable band that didn’t hold sweat or move around.  This is it!  To new for a durability review but it’s stylish too!
5,These have stayed clean and in good shape for a long time and I am pretty tough on my watch bands!
3,The off white was not what was pictured. You could see the colored thread (red and blue) on the stitching. Not what was pictured.
5,These watch bands are in expensive and you get three. They are comfortable to wear all day yet stylish enough that people asked me where I got them.
5,These bands are amazing. They’re so comfortable it’s almost like I’m not wearing it most days. It stays in place for workouts and adjusts easily. They look really nice also! VERY pleased with them! And you can’t beat the price for 3!
5,A must buy!
5,So comfortable and brilliant adjustable design . Forget a few times I had my watch on . Best Apple Watch band ever .
5,Love these wristbands they’re casual but more comfortable than the rubber apple watch bands. Only recommendation is to tighten or loosen the wristband BEFORE putting on your wrist.
5,These bands are super comfortable and lightweight compared to the rubber ones. They are perfect for the summer and very stylish with their various colors. Only complaint is that it occasionally tugs on my arm hairs but other than that I would definitely buy again.
5,They are so pretty soft and comfortable. I will definitely be ordering more of these!
5,Looks nice on my wrist. Doesn’t even look stretchy or like fabric. Comfortable enough to sleep with it on my wrist.
5,Nice bands comfortable and adjustable for my small wrist.
3,This is by far the best fitting band I have found so far. All of them have broken already though. It is plastic that holds the band and just by putting it on or taking it off they have broken.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Really pleased with these bands. Nice colours. Quality very good and they fit well exactly as the branded apple bands but a fraction of the price. These bands have 3 different colours and can swap and change when I want a change. Would certainly recommend!
5,Great bands at a great price. Fit my SE perfectly and I like being able to adjust it to fit just right.
5,Very cute & comfortable but one of the 3 did snag a little on something.
3,Honestly the bands are really great and exactly what I was looking for. However I was sent the wiring pack of colors I reached out to the seller several times and got no response that’s why the lower rating.
5,I wanted a stretchy nylon band for my Apple Watch and couldn’t beat the price of this 3 pack. Very comfortable. I will buy more.
5,Colors were perfect. Adjustable to many sizes. Great quality and stylish.
5,This was a good price and very durable.  Very stylish.
5,Fits perfect and adjustable !!
3,Might wear it a few times looks a little cheap
5,I like the idea of a band that is easier to put on my wrist  because the snap style band is difficult for me sometimes. The only drawback is that  the band pretty much has to be adjusted to size before you put it on.
5,These are very stretchy and fit my Apple Series 6 so well! I hated the band that came with my watch bc it wasn’t breathable and felt like a handcuff. I immediately felt comfortable as soon as I changed it out for these. Also they are a really value.
5,Product is great just as advertised
5,Lovee how comfortable these bands are
5,Very affordable easy to put on comfortable.  Seems pretty good quality.
5,Perfect for me. use it to go to work it’s flexible when I have to wash my hands and that’s constantly at work. And it’s comfortable and sturdy. Change the strap to a different color and then you have different look  ready  to go out.
5,I love that this watch band is easy to fit over your hand and fits nicely to your wrist
5,Perfect bands!! Make the watch feel weightless and I love that nothing digs into skin like the regular bands Apple Watch comes with! Definitely worth it. Cute colors too!
3,They’re not very good looking tbh.
5,I love these bands. They’re so comfortable and I love that you can adjust it to any size. Especially in the hot weather it’s so much more comfortable than the rubber ones. The order came so quickly just as promised. Would highly recommend these bands
5,I loved them I used them for my watch
5,This is perfect for me. Easy to put on. Looks great and super comfortable.
5,Easy to adjust breathable and stretchy.  Very comfortable for working out or working with. I recommend it
5,Confortable
5,Fit well
5,Muy buenos son cómodos. El blanco es el único que casi no me gustó pero cumplen muy bien su función.
5,First and foremost is comfort. Second is color. I have choices depending on what I am wearing.  The price was definitely right!I don’t know about durability yet as I have had them less than a week!
5,I purchased a three pack for around $10. They’re way more durable than the leather band I purchased. The light one got dirty very quickly. No shock there. I’ve been using the black one and it’s perfect for daily use
1,This cloth band is much more comfortable original rubber band and it held up well and washed up easily when needed. But the part that attaches to the watch broke after 4 months. While the price is low I expect a longer life span than that.Update: Revising rating to 1 star because second band broke in similar way after even shorter time of use. I think it is fair to expect these to last for a longer period of time.
3,Comfy and decent price point but they do snag very easily
5,100% prefer these bands over the band that comes with the Apple Watch 6. I get a more comfortable fit with these than the original watch band. The material is breathable and lightweight. I have small wrists but these are adjustable. Great quality!
5,These are fantastic. My daughter and I are both finding them to be much more comfortable than any bands we have had previously. I like that you don’t have to worry about them becoming unclasped. And they are affordable. I’m already contemplating more colors.
2,My pink one broke my first day using it at work while taking off gloves (maybe an hour into my 12 hr shift). The green one is made different so it has lasted for me. They fit is okay. The comfort is just okay. Probably won’t purchase again when my other ones eventually break. (I haven’t used the white one yet so no opinions on it).
5,easy to put on apple watch. These bands are cute and comfortable. They have the right about of stretch to put on comfortable but also not too much so it doesn't slide around.
5,Love love love.  I have very small wrists and have a hard time finding bracelets and watch bands that fit me.  These are perfect and very comfortable.  Great deal for the money spent.
5,Very good item and great price
5,The band fits nice and snug on my wrist and I have very small wrists already! It’s easy to adjust and it doesn’t dig into my skin at all
5,Really like the design and comfort of the band.
5,I love these new I watch bands. They are so comfortable and seem to be very durable. I like the way they connect to the watch and feel on my arm. Much cooler than the plastic bands.
5,Product was as described and very nice.

3,It’s almost as if the band is fluffy. The nylon loops stick out to where it’s a puffy feeling. Not what I thought.
5,There isn't anything I don't like about the apple watch band.  Its very comfortable and well-made. I love changing the colored bands.
5,
5,I love these watch bands.  They are comfortable and I like the convenience of the elastic band to push up on my arm for hand washing.  I have already recommended these to two friends!
5,Love these bands. The blue is my favorite they are super comfortable and soft. Would definitely recommend!
5,love everything about these watch bands
2,I was happy to receive the bands. Easy to put on and relatively comfortable. However after only using the black band for the third time as I removed it from my wrist…the plastic end snapped right off! Contacted Amazon and they’re resending another set…so will see if what I had was defective or the product itself has an issue with durability.  Just be aware. Will update again later…
5,This is an adjustable watch band for my apple watch I love it!  It was easy to put on tighten loosen and it has a comfortable feeling.
5,Great product and was fast to ship!
5,I couldn't be happier with these straps!! The white one looks old (color wise) but no one would notice they fit my super petite wrist perfectly and so easy to adjust the width.
5,Had this band for about four days.  So far so good.  It really dresses up the watch and fits nicely.  At first I was concerned about the elastic being tight enough but it seems ok.  It has nice soft texture.
5,Works great and love that it’s one solid piece.
3,It’s good to have a change. Easier than fastening original band. Needs frequent adjustment.
3,I bought this set a few weeks ago the black one already broke. Which is my favorite color. So now I can’t wear it. Little disappointed they didn’t last longer.
5,Great bands what more can I say.
5,Very comfortable and pretty
5,It’s a great watch band for the last few weeks it’s held up and kept its promise of being comfortable and durable. definitely a great investment with a great price!
5,LOVE these. Super easy to change out. They look nice and they are very comfortable.
5,Great product. Super comfortable and love the colors. Shipping was quick literally I have zero complaints!
5,I was looking for a loop type band for my apple watch.  these bands are comfortable easy to adjust and the colors match with most anything.  I recommend these if looking for a loop band.
5,My mom loved them.
2,Way too itchy to wear. Super uncomfortable
3,UPDATE: These really are comfortable but all 3 bands broke within a few months. SUPER disappointing.Love these bands but one broke within the first week of wearing it. Otherwise they are super comfortable and I love the way they look!
5,These watch bands are very comfortable simple to attach and adjust easily. I love the stretchiness of them and the colors! I got the gray cream and army green trio and love how the colors are subdued and go with everything I wear!
3,I ordered the rose pink/cream/summit white combination. The summit white has silver hardware not rose gold as pictured. I picked this particular set to match my rose gold watch. Please update your photos.
3,I got this watch band for my Apple Watch series 5 and I love it! It’s super comfy and trustworthy. I just wish there was an easier way to get it on and off because that’s a struggle. But for the value of the money it’s worth it!
5,I was shocked when these bands came in and they were so cute and functional they're also adjustable which is great and makes them even more comfortable to wear.
5,Very happy with the comfort of these bands.  Easy to adjust to size and in the summer they are much more comfortable than the “rubber/plastic” ones that leave you feeling all sweaty.
5,very easy to install
5,Love them will be ordering more!!
5,Comfortable and look cute my favorite ones so far❤️
5,I love these watch bands. They are so comfortable and look nice too! A step up from the plastic watch bands. The bands are easy to adjust and slip on and off easily too.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 These are super comfortable and hold up really well for daily use definitely recommend buying
3,I had never tried stretchy Apple Watch bands. Bought these and they felt too loose even after I tightened them. Maybe my wrists are small. Either was sent them back and got a prompt refund.
2,Las correas están bien lo que estoy reclamando es que de 3 colores que pedí negro azul y plomo. Solo me llego 1 negro y 2 azules. No es fiel a los colores que ofrecen.
3,They were nice at first and I guess as time went by they got less durable. And when I took off the band that holds it together it would snap.
3,My mother ordered for a smart watch was too loose a fit
5,The material used is soft and comfortable. I love that it can be adjusted easily.
5,Love these bands. They keep their shape unlike some of the other stretchy bands I’ve tried in the past. I highly recommend. If you’re like me though you’ll have to get a cover to match your band 😂
5,Love these perfect for my small wrists and for the gym!
5,Ok
5,I’ve tried the metal magnetic bands and the plastic bands but hey always pulled or made me sweat like crazy. These are great
5,I’m not lying when I tell y’all these are the best watch bands I have ever purchased. They’re cute comfortable and easy to put on. 10/10 recommended
3,These are way too “fluffy” for my taste. Not terrible
5,The watch bands fit my 38 mm watch perfectly. The fit is snug without needing to be adjusted each time I take it off and on. Great value and great fashion!
5,Happy with them.
5,During the summer months when it's so hot I tend to retain fluid and my wrists will retain fluid.  So to have a band that is stretchy and allows for this is great!!
5,Love these bands. They snapped onto my apple watch nicely. They have a good bit of room for adjustment tighter or larger. They offer a snug non-floppy fit. I feel like the watch is secure. Love the color!
5,Comodidad
5,Love these bands! So comfortable and still classy.
5,This band is very comfortable and does not cause irritation like silicone bands do on me. The only draw back is I’m not able to tighten it on my own but I still really like it.
5,I like that it doesn’t have the Velcro which grabs onto everything and I tried the magnet bands but they didn’t work well either. The stretchy band is comfy and never fails me… especially at work.
5,Actually really like these super comfortable and cute.
5,Love them!
5,Perfect
5,My coworker had them and I was tired of the rubbery ones making my wrist sweaty.They are comfortable and stretchy and easy to take on and off.
5,I love how breathable this material is. I dont have to worry about getting a heat rash under my band. Highly recommend them.
5,They are made of nice quality materials and are super soft! I don’t like a tight watch band so these work great!
5,I love these!! So cheap and they feel way more comfortable than the silicon apple ones. They are also washable so that's a plus!I love the different colors.
5,They are a great fit. I don’t like the band when wet. Easy to put on and take off. Great Comfort I don’t even realize it on sometimes.
5,Like them a lot
3,I bought a pack of 3 and one of them does not lock into place on the watch. I’ve tried it several times. The other two lock in just fine. I’m thinking it’s defective. I like the two that work.
5,Product is as described and as expected.
5,These are seriously a great option they are so comfortable throughout the day unlike the Apple provided ones and are more adjustable. Really awesome for the gym or just everyday!
5,I have had them for not quite a week. The bands were super easy to change and adjust. The are very comfortable and have a attractive look/design to them.
5,My husband always swears with the rubber bands and the metal gets caught on everything when he works on cars since he’s a mechanic. So this is the best all the way around. Perfect fit since it is adjustable
5,The bands are great! Easy to take off or tighten on a fly. I recommended it to my gf and a few friends and some already received it. I’ll be buying more in different colors for sure
5,The bands are very easy to put on and maneuver to change the tightness around my wrist. They are really comfortable definitely buying in different colors!!
5,Watch band
2,I was so excited to get them it said they would fit my watch. When I got them they don’t fit at all. I’m out money because I live in Fillmore ut. I can’t drive so I can never send it back.
5,Very confortable and Looks good
5,nice
5,Love how easy to install. Great fit and so comfortable. Will repurchase !
5,The colors are as pictured they are super cute. I have pretty small wrists and was able to get them tight enough to fit well. The material is comfortable and breathable.
5,Comfortable
5,Comfortable & zero sweaty feeling. Almost feels like wearing nothing.
5,Very nice easy to switch out multiple colors to choose from. Easy to take off. Love to color coordinate my outfits even My watch band's
5,These bands are great. They are comfortable and very affordable. I have a small wrist and most bands don’t fit properly because I’m in-between sizes on the holes of the bands. I like these better than the magnetized metal bands.
2,The bands seemed nice for the price but when I put them on my watch the plastic piece that slides into the watch was very loose. I was concerned the band would come off my watch while wearing so I returned. My husband got the green blue and black pack though and didn’t have that problem so maybe mine was a fluke thing?
3,The bands are nice and very comfortable. The problem the end of band that slides into the watch is made of very cheap plastic. It will never last.
5,I love these bands because for some reason the silicone ones make my wrist break out in very painful blisters.  These bands are cool dry quickly after being cleaned and look great.
5,Amazing comfort. It’s way better than the band that comes with the Apple Watch. Definitely recommend.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This watch band is so comfortable I love it I like how you can adjust the band i can’t wait to order more colors
5,Is exactly as described in add. Super comfortable and easy to adjust for proper fit. Very happy with purchase
5,Soft and easy to put on. Looking forward to see durability. Very cute colors. Will maybe purchase different colors in future.
5,Like that it stretches and comfortable

5,Just perfect in every single color!!
5,I received my swhatty  stretchy watch bands and love them!  The colors and design are great.  They are very comfortable to wear in this hot July New England weather.

5,I purchased the fabric/mesh Apple watch bands and love them! Such a great value for the price. I highly recommend.

5,Really nice band. I like it better than my other stretchy bands because I can adjust the fit!  Highly recommend.
5,I bought these for my daughter as a little surprise gift…. I thought the band looked Teal her favorite color.  No it’s green in her words olive green.
3,It is hard one me to customize the size when it’s already on my hand
5,wife loved the white and pink. soft as can be and very easy to change out - great for the hot weather
5,Love all of the colors
5,I haven’t tried yet but i like the bands are soft with good stretch and the metal wont touch skin as I’m allergic to most..
5,These are Great - Need more perfect stocking stuffers!
3,The bands are elastic. Mostly comfortable. I bought this set for the pink and was disappointed. It’s a dirty pink beige
5,Love these. They are very comfortable!
5,Cute and fun colors
5,These bands not only look great - they fit perfectly are lightweight and comfortable.  The best part is they make putting your watch on so easy.
3,Slips of during exercise
3,Band is great but the pet that attaches to the watch is made out of plastic not very durable. Had one break while on vacation

5,Purchased these watch bands online received them in a timely manner and I love how they feel they fit my watch perfectly I will recommend to everyone
3,I ordered a pack of 3 for the 38mm Apple Watch and two of the bands were correct size but the white band was for the larger Apple Watch. Not worth it to return all three of them.
5,Really soft.
5,These are comfortable easy to adjust and I just love the colors! Great bands
5,I like the color choices ease of use & comfort. Cooler than iWatch band that came with watch.
5,They are perfect. Adjustable size washable and inexpensive enough to buy several colors and textures. A great find!
5,This band is so much better than the one I had before. It’s adjustable and breathable which is so much better for my sensitive skin.
5,Love the watch bands in fact going to order more in different colors. They are very comfortable. Fast delivery.
2,I love how comfortable they are but I don’t think they’re that durable I’m already on the 2nd band the first one snapped when putting it on and it’s already starting to get fuzzy been two days wearing an already fuzzy…
5,Nice to have a clean wrist band to change out.
5,Great product very adjustable and a bit of elasticity. Design are nice.

5,They are super comfortable
5,no problems with it
5,Love these bands!! Very comfortable and breathable against my wrist. I don’t even notice I’m wearing it.
5,Love these! Easy to put on stylish and comfortable!
5,Soft fit good…have ordered more and sent some as a gift.  What else can I say?
2,First these look very cheap in person.  They also look like they would stretch out  and that the finish of the clasp/ buckle would wear off quickly.  All in all a mistake on my part.  Back to my search...
2,Wish I could return but it’s not worth it. The pink one is still good; the white one broke and I gave away the black one. Bought a set from a different seller and so far so good. Disappointed. But I got what I paid for.
5,These are my favorite type of Apple Watch band.  They are very comfortable.  I highly recommend.

5,Fits and looks good.
5,fit and comfort
5,Love these bands! My favorite... Comfortable to wear... Holds up nice and love the different colors!!
5,This band is comfortable to wear and easy to adjust. At first I thought it was a little bulky (38-40mm) but I quickly became used to it.

5,So comfy and easy to take on and off and very stylish !!!
5,Great option instead of the silicone band that comes with the Apple Watch. Breathable and comfortable. Love the colors as well.
5,this arrived quickly. the bands are super lightweight and comfortable. I cannot feel the metal part at all. it dries quickly after getting wet too.
5,Perfect size comfortable and worth the money.
5,Bands are very comfortable they fit pretty well.  I like the ability to adjust the length.

5,It is comfortable and easy to adjust.
5,The band is very comfortable and is easy to install.
5,Super cute!  Good quality and very comfortable.  I am going to buy more.
1,You'd have to adjust EVERY TIME YOU WEAR THEM and EVERY TIME YOU TAKE THEM OFF. WHO HAS TIME FOR THAT? They also look flimsy and nowhere nearly what they  appear to look like on the pictures.
2,Material was cheap and itchy.  Should have known better given the price but figured why not.  Didn’t bother sending back for the $12 not worth the trip to the UPS store.
5,Love the bands. Comfy and great quality. Perfect for casual summer wear.
5,I love the colors and the elastic band. So much easier to put on and off.
5,As pictured. Pink is a tad darker but looks great and wears well.
5,These are very comfortable and easy to adjust.
5,Very comfortable. Feels like nice quality. Just received and used and loved it.
2,The nylon comes out of the holder and you will constantly have to tighten the straps.  I wish I could get my money refunded but it’s too late
5,I really like these bands. Great price and they are very comfortable. I would recommend them.
5,I love these watch bands! They’re soft and super comfortable. Easy to put on and take off.
5,
2,The first thing I notice was that the colors were off. The pink was more beige. I did like the cream one with the blue edging. I also didn’t like that you put it on like rubber band. So I had the make it bigger to get over my hand and then adjust the size to fit my wrist. A little too much work for my liking. Once it was on you had to have it snug so it didn’t slid around. I returned them because of these reasons.
5,Comfortable breathable and easy to adjust
5,The wrist bands are good quality and are very stylish. I’m glad I chose them! Well worth the money!
5,These are really comfortable and nice looking bands. I’m glad I gave them a try.
2,I know you get what you pay for. While these are cute they do not hold up. They get snagged on this and I feel like I am constantly cutting off strings.
5,I like the darker colors. Lighter colors get dirty and it’s visible
5,Love the way they look and fit.
3,Comfortable
5,These are great!!! Perfect!
5,It’s a comfortable band. Easy to adjust the fit.

5,Super comfortable and great colors to choose from. Will definitely be buying more
5,Love the colors very comfortable! Would buy again!
2,I must admit I haven't switched to this watch band yet (I'm now using sporty bands with holes for the summer) but since you want a review here it is ---- I'm a little displeased with it since I'm not a fan of the clasp. It's not that easy to adjust to the perfect wrist size that I like. I'm hoping that when I do finally switch to it I'll like it more. But as of now I'm not a fan and actually regret buying it.
5,Looks good with rose gold
1,The band did not fit the Apple Watch. The side of the connecting piece of the band stuck out on either end of the watch. It looked terrible.
5,Fits beautifully and looks great!
5,Elastic band is very comfortable
2,The reason I gave a bad review is because the first day I wore one of these bands I had 2 snags on it. It has little loops on the outside so it easily snags. Would not recommend.
5,Nice quality and very comfortable.
1,Got these during Amazon prime day deals cause they were cheaperBut I wouldn’t buy againThe material on the band has become undone after a few days of wear
5,Exactly what I was looking for. Very nice quality.
5,Size is good quality is great! Would buy again!
5,Apple Watch
2,These bands are indeed very comfortable. I've been rotating between two of them (amongst other bands) and after less than three months one of them snapped. They're inexpensive so I guess you get what you paid for. Thankfully my watch didn't fall when it broke.
5,The bands are great and easy to adjust.
5,Love the stretchy-ness and the light weight feel!
5,These are great fit is great colors are great price is great
2,My gps kept rerouting and i got this notification letting me know that my navigation was compromised…they were cute though. The black one was the prettiest but thats the one i had the most issues with.. i did like how they were stretchy and stayed in place. Usually my bands will slip during my workouts but these did really well at holding still. Unfortunately though because of the material my workout wasnt recorded correctly. No big deal but still..
5,Comfortable and convenient
5,Good quality stretchy comfortable soft and the colors are as shown.
5,These bands are so cute and comfortable I was so happy with them!
5,My wife loved them and actually ordered 3 different color ones as well

5,perfect resplacement from the previous rubber band.
5,Easy to adjust to fit my wrist. Soft material
5,Very nice and comfortable bands
2,The buckle connection is loose and wiggles and I was surprised at the loft of the diamond knit pattern which can catch easily on things and is unnecessary. Not sure why the white band has the blue and red edges.  Returning product
5,Super comfy and love the color selections
5,Love it
5,Love these bands they are so cute and comfy!!
5,Was what I wanted
5,Easy transaction great price nice bands!

5,Comfortable and cute!
5,My wife loves them. Breathable drys quick comfortable.
1,First impressions were that these bands are super cheap and will not hold up well over time. I'll never know because I sent them right back. They install very easily like most all of these type bands. The problem was that once I adjusted it small enough for my wrist it was very difficult to get on. I tried adjusting it back out putting it on and then tightening it but that just didn't work. It's too hard to adjust with one hand after you have it on.

2,This band is really light and comfortable but the loose threaded mesh snags on everything and you get stray threads sticking up from the band. I’ve had it 2 months and probably after the first couple of weeks I was having to cut off loose threads.
5,Nice bands. Comfortable durable and easy to adjust
5,Very comfortable band and I love the colors!
5,Excellent Product I’m very satisfied and want more colors!
2,Band has very little stretch and can be difficult to get on and off. Returned for that reason.
5,Love it !!!
1,The listing says compatible with Versa 2. These are way too big and will never work with a Versa 2.
5,I love them so much!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Great buy! Cute comfy and adjustable!
5,Buy them
5,Very comfortable to wear and workout in.
1,All of the bands were defective except for one (silver). I bought the correct size and they still would not latch in. Very disappointing.
5,Thanks they’re better than I expected!
2,Red one has faulty bar to attach to watch. Just falls off. That’s the one I most wanted to wear😥
5,I love everything about these watch bands!!
5,:)
5,Very comfortable to wear
5,These bands are very comfortable and cute.
5,Good
5,Perfect
5,Great comfort and fit
2,This band is stretch on and off only slides around on wrist.  Returning
5,Better than expected
2,While the bands look nice they do not stay snugged on the wrist.  They stretch out and are difficult to adjust. Would not buy again.
5,Like
5,😁
2,These had such great reviews.. and I ordered specifically for the green band...I received grey navy blue and black.Tempted to return.Have enough black bands.. this does nothing for what I was looking for.
5,Very nice quality
5,They fit very nice!
5,Comfortable
5,I like them
2,These look nothing like the picture they look woven but are actually a Velcro material. They also snag really easily.
2,The band itself is great and doesn’t feel bulky at all. Just the attachment part doesn’t fit the watch and stabs my hand every time I bend it.Edit: literally just realized I bought the wrong size. So anyways for all my series 3 friends go with the smaller one.
1,Great concept with one exception:  you absolutely  cannot adjust the size on these once on your wrist. Not without help anyway.  You have to adjust them larger to get them over your hand but then you’re  left with a large floppy band and your watch ends up on the bottom of your wrist.
1,For the price it’s only ok… the fabric is poor quality and it causes itchiness I also have a really small wrist so they didn’t fit… I’ll rather pay full price for 1 original item than a cheaper version that will not be functional for me.
1,These bands are not durable elastic picks easily and the plastic that attaches to the watch breaks easily.
2,Wasn’t exactly what I thought are needed
2,The color fades and gets dirty so easily! Texture snags with in the first wear. I wouldn’t buy again .
2,The sliding buckle always on side of wrist right where it sits on hard surface. Too bulky at buckle location. Not comfortable.
2,To hard to get on and I did not like the feel of it. and it went on my Apple Watch
2,I want to really like these bands. The price was right but when I took them out of the packaging I realized what made the attractive pattern in the band was actually raised material take seems easily snagged. Also a bit itchy.
2,These are pretty great but I didn’t get the colors I thought I ordered. I specifically wanted a black band so that stinks.
1,Not a good quality
1,This is a one-size fits all but not good. It looks tiny on the 44mm watch and you can see there is part of the bezel that looks hollow as the strip clip is smaller and the watch Can get full of dust or dirt. Buy a product that is built for the correct size instead of this.
1,The colors are not as advertised. The black is black but the light pink is peach and the mid toned rose kinda color is actually orange and blue stripes with a dark beige. I’m really disappointed in that.They fit the watch fine and seem to hold an adjustment. I suspect they will snag since it’s covered in loops of thread. I really wanted to like these as an alternative to my solo band. Guess I should keep looking
1,These are cute and seem like they'd be comfortable but I have one problem.  How in the world do you adjust them with one hand once you get it on?  Obviously the hand is larger than the wrist so once I got it past my hand it's way too loose for my wrist!!  Tried for a long time.  These are going back!  Too bad because I thought I finally found a band that is small enough for my small wrist. :(
2,These are very cute but the threads are pulling after literally one wear. Very disappointed.
1,I really wanted to like these bands.  However I almost lost my watch because the band doesn’t stay “clicked in” to your watch.  It just slides right off. Returning these.
1,No good. Make my hand so itch. I used one day than thought way. Don’t buy.
1,Ordered this product for a 41 mm watch.  Only the black is 41 mm the two cheetah prints are 38-40 compatible.
1,The texture is more raised that it looks in the e picture. I was hoping this would be more comfortable than the rubber watch bands but they’re itchy. I would not recommend!
1,These bands are soft and comfortable. BUT! The piece that slides into the watch face does not fit accurately. It sort of locks in like it should but it is way too thin and loose to stay put.I tried each one that came in my order to make sure that it wasn't just a one off thing. But every single one was too loose and wiggled around in the watch face.I am returning them and will not be buying from this company again.
2,These will absolutely not last longer than a month. Still not terrible for the price and look okay.
1,The bands fit except the black one. It was broken and couldn’t clip into the watch. They’re uncomfortable and they dont stay where you put them. It slips out. Itchy and they snag on everything and now they’re unraveling. One of the bands that actually worked snap and broke when I was taking it off and I had it really loose. Save your money.
1,The strap I wore for about a week stretched and was too big for my wrist. Also not good with working out. The material is too thick and uncomfortable.
1,Two of the bands have already broken at the hinge where it connects to the Apple Watch. Not quality product at all
1,I requested 45mm because that is the watch that I have and I received 42mm/44mm bands. The middle button clicks but it's visibly a tiny bit off.
1,Love the style and color but at first it was itchy and within 5 mins I got  a rash. Immediately took it off and washed but took hours to leave. I do not have sensitive skin and have never before had this experience (or any like it) with clothes or skin products.
2,After wearing for one day there is already fraying. Disappointing experience. Buyer beware!
2,The durability not happy not satisfied
1,I got these for my sons Apple Watch they're comfortable-but break really easily just sliding the watch on your arm. All three have broken each band lasted about a month.
1,I never write reviews but this is such a cheap band super loose doesn’t fit correctly into the watch I will never buy it again I returned it within an hour looking at it
2,The thread design is not durable at all. Good for fashion but not function.
1,I ordered this item which lists that it includes 3 watch bands along with a helpful photo which show the various color combinations that can be chosen...each including 3 bands.  I received 1 watch band.
1,The band that I received is not even close to what I ordered or what was described. It’s a single band that is fake leather and not a stretchy woven material.
1,Las bandas muy bonitas pero de muy baja calidad se dañaron súper rápido apenas si tengo un mes con ellas.
1,I know these were cheap but they also are really cheap looking.
1,The fabric is not super friendly.
2,They are not bad just not to my liking. I like my bands snug
1,They sent wrong size and it was too late to return when I finally had time to install.  Poor quality and appearance also!
1,I wore this type of brand fir less than 30 minutes and had to remove immediately as my wrist was broken out in hives. I don’t know what is in the materials nickel latex???? It was AWFUL
2,They are cute but still fit me loose.  One of them starting threading out in one week.
1,The bands look lovely. But they are difficult to get on and off my wrist. If I move the slider clasp so it will fit on my wrist it’s difficult to get it over my hand. If I move the slider so it will get over my hand with ease it’s too big for my wrist and I am unable to adjust it once it’s on my wrist.
1,It also pills- gets snags easily. I have only had them for a few weeks. I’m already looking for a more durable band.
2,Colors aren’t as vibrant but they work
1,The plastic that attaches to the band is weak.  Watch broke off after taking off a light weight sweater.  Luckily the watch fell on carpet.
1,Not happy package was received opened then sealed with masking tape also inside package was cut open not sure why
2,Plastic bars. Very poorly made and not what I was expecting given the description
1,be
1,packaging is terrible no product label. Broke when i put it on. Colors are way faded! I hate these they also don’t adjust well at all!
1,I work in retail so I thought these would be perfect. I was wrong. I wore one to work it was broken within a couple of hours. An because they were only $6 I didn’t want to fight for a refund.
1,Cheap made product will not purchase again.
1,I used this product for my watch
1,This does not fit my 40mm Apple Watch and I did order the right size. Also the parts you slide into the ends of the watch make the band twisted!! The grey and gold band was actually grey and silver. These where not made to properly attach to a 40mm Apple Watch. Complete waste of money.
2,Not a great band
1,Esperaba mejor calidad la verdad si es fácil poner pero por calidad no me gusto
1,These bands are not as good as I’d hoped. Itchy and causes a mark on your wrist even when it’s not on tight. When it gets wet from sweat or washing hands it becomes really irritating to wear. The white one is more cream in color so overall not happy with purchase.
1,Didn’t like the texture of the material but the worst is it does let the watch to change
1,I only received one band I thought it came with three bands
1,It fell apart the first time I wore it. It picked big time the first time I wore it. The surface is raised which you can’t really tell for the pictures but they catch and end up picking
1,I read reviews product description and the FAQs so I figured it would fit my Apple Watch which is a series 4. The sides of it stick out and does not look right like my other bands. So annoying
1,The watch would ding every few seconds as it stopped charging thens started then stopped. Super annoying when trying to sleep. Ding..ding..ding..ding..
2,Colors are nothing like shown.
1,The product is very cheaply made
1,The bands already snagged. The material has lifted little threads and came already snagged. Would not recommend
1,These are rough to the point where they are very scratchy and itchy on the skin. No way. These are going back
1,I wore one band about 5 times before it broke.  The part that attaches to the watch face is plastic.  Did not last.
1,Material on on the band is a bit rough on the skin
1,the band began to fray and have strings within a few days of wearing it. After just over 2 straight weeks of wearing it one of the plastic ends broke. Slightly itchy as well.
1,Band is not stretchy at all.
1,And we all know how sturdy plastic is when stressed. Luckily I was at home with this junk failed and broke.Tossed the other two not risking my watch.
1,It’s durability detached in less then 24 hours!!
1,was not what it looked like in the picture!
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 30 days and it broke see pictures
1,The bands are not at all as advertised. They are flimsy do not stay in place and strange in appearance. Returned to amazon
1,2 out of the 3 bands came broken and didn’t even work for the watch very disappointed. Don’t buy waste of money
1,I don’t like that when I put it  back on my risk it’s not easy to make it to my sizes.
1,Muy bien
1,Fabric is super itchy and prone to snagging. Had a snag after one day and made my skin super itchy the next day. Definitely better elastic bands out there.
1,In readjusting the band the plastic piece broke. It is disappointing because I like the feeling of the band and the coloring.
1,Did not fit the size stated
1,Very comfortable but when I would take it off it broke. 2/3 of them broke within 3 weeks. Spend you money elsewhere
1,Looks cheap and feels scratchy on wrist
1,These bands were not very good. They wouldn’t snap into my Apple Watch correctly and they were very itchy. I was very disappointed.
1,They feel scratchy when being worn and two of them have already broke after a few weeks of use.
1,Bought a 3 pack but only came with 1 band? And there was 2 zip bags but 1 is empty…
1,White is not white
1,No me gusto no se ven nada delicado
1,Durability not good
1,Didn’t like the quality
1,Garbage . Junk
1,Had to constantly adjust. Would loosen up constantly
1,I do not care for them… I prefer the Velcro ones.  These are too hard to adjust the size by yourself.
1,One came in defective!
1,Not true to color the pink is brown
1,You can see the elastics coming off already only used it for two days. Don’t recommend!
1,I don’t like them they make me itch and hold a lot of moisture
1,Unravels and fabric starts to stick out around band
1,They look great but they’re incredibly uncomfortable & itchy regardless of slack on band.
1,Is it still possible to return the they will not go on
1,The quality and after wearing for only 1 day it was loose stretchy.
1,Should have figured that these would be junk when you get 3 bands for under $15.
1,Ugly and cheap looking. I hate how they looked. Would return but not worth the hassle.
1,Difficult to adjustFrays with adjustments
1,Colors are good . Fit is ok. Strap itself is way too bulky!!
1,No
5,I give this all the stars! Most comfortable Apple Watch band I have owned so far. The sport band always got sweaty in hot weather or moisture would get trapped when washing hands. Not anymore this band is amazing and I got 3 different colors for the price. Love it!
1,Did not fit my watch. Wrong size delivered.
1,not durable
5,The watch bands fit great.
4,No sweating caused by the band so far as the band that came with watch.  Easy on any off since it is elasticized. Easy to attach to watch face.
5,These Watch bands fit great and is very comfortable.
4,This band is very comfortable but I have a hard time keeping it tight it keeps on losing up
5,Parecen duraderos y de buena calidad
5,Color and fit are nice.  Time will tell if any part is not waterproof.
5,Fast delivery. Quality product.  Fit my Apple Watch perfectly and look great. I recommend these.
5,All of the other bands never stayed in place on my wrist. These stay in place they are not hot so your wrist doesn’t sweat. I really like the pattern makes them look more expensive. It’s a really great deal for three bands!
5,Love it!
1,Was real excited to get these until I put it on the 41mm….sure it fits but edges hang outside of the watch face; you know they will catch on anything.
5,Bought this band to replace the metal/magnetic one that I had.  Not a fan of the rubber ones that come with the Apple watch and wanted something more comfortable.  This one is so comfortable I forget that I have the watch on until it goes off.  Easy to install on the watch.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 on easy to install is because it's difficult to adjust the fit if you are doing it by yourself.  If you have someone helping you that can adjust the strap while you are wearing it then your good.  Doing it on your own is a little more challenging.
5,I just started wearing my Apple Watch again and decided I wanted a new band. I looked and looked for a band that had good reviews and found this one and fast deliver (same day I live near a distribution center). It’s so comfortable easy to put on and adjustable. No more bulky hard to put in original band. I love this and it came in 3 colors. Well worth the cost which is so affordable. You can’t go wrong with this one.
5,I really like these bands and I have the Apple ones also. These are almost as good but a fraction of the cost. Buy these and I doubt you will regret it.
5,I have arthritis in my wrists so I struggle to find a watch that I can wear comfortably for longer spells. These bands have been wonderful. They are soft comfortable and easily adjustable. They even fit my small wrists which is another challenge I face. In short I highly recommend these bands.
4,These bands are super cute and VERY easy to switch in or out. Overall pretty comfy but my wrist has felt a bit itchy at times since I started using them. Overall not a big deal. Great price for 3 bands!
5,I’m pleasantly surprised with this product. I like the stretchy feature. It is much lighter on my wrist than the original Apple Watch band. It feels like my wrist can breath. The band allows air flow.  My wrist isn’t damp from activity or when I wash my hands.  The bands appear durable but I’ve only hand them a week.  In my opinion this was a good purchase for the money.
5,Exactly what I wanted
5,Great for exercising. Extremely comfortable. Not restricting.
5,(EDIT: Reached out to the company about the orange/blue band that wasn’t as listed and we found a solution for it. Super fast and good costumer service. I still love these bands and they are holding up well so far)These bands are good for the price! Very comfortable and soft. Easy to change :) The clasp sits a bit weird of you use m/l bands but it’s not really a deal breaker imo. The pink sand one is a bit misleading compared to the pictures shown though which is a shame because that was the one I really wanted :(
5,This product is well priced and extremely comfortable. I was having trouble with swelling from carpal tunnel so I bought this band because the original was exacerbating the swelling. It worked out fine. Not only that but I think it is nicer looking and I like having extra colors. The only downside is that you have to enlarge it to get it on and then figure out how to get the band to go smaller once you have it on. You might need help! I do it by myself but it's kind of annoying.
5,I bought this set (gray dark blue & black) in 44mm for my roommate. He has large wrist and has a hard time finding comfortable well fitting watch bands. These bands fit the bill and will accommodate up to a 9.5” wrist. They have a nice diamond pattern and adjust easily with dark color adjusters and connectors. They are soft stretchy and breathable. They are easy to clean with warm water mild soap and air dried.
5,I battled for 4 years the sport band on my AW.  I even tried other bands and none worked for me.  I saw this one and decided to give it a try.  Now I have a new watch well so to speak.  It's comfortable it doesn't pinch or pull at the hairs on my arm it adjusts to any size I feel like wearing and the price is right especially because of three lads in the kit.
5,These watch bands are very comfortable and great to wear.  I have ordered 2 sets of 3 bands.  One for my mom who can't wear anything too tight. The other set for my daughter who has sensitive skin and can't wear a lot of metals.  These are great for both of them and they are both happy with them.
5,Got the 3 pack and shared with my granddaughters. Everyone likes them. Easy to put on the iwatch and easy to put on your wrist and take off. Very reasonably priced and adjustable. Much better price than the ones at the Apple store for $99/band. Not quite the same but more in my spending range.
5,Fit my watch perfect! This was exactly what I needed. My job is a hot place and the band would make my wrist sweat so much. All that is gone now!! They’re also better looking than I was expecting
5,These bands are really light and look great too. I can’t stand having anything tight or “sticky” on my wrist and I am really happy with these. I couldn’t beat the price either. Super satisfied customer and would buy again!
5,Comfortable easy to switch and the colors are bright.
5,These stretch a bit but not too much (I don't have to adjust them often).  The colors are nice they look nice and they are comfortable.  I would definitely recommend them.
5,I am in love so far. So soft and comfortable on wrist. Will find out this weekend how durable it is in the heat. So far the product is great.
5,I really like these bands more than any other ones I’ve purchased. I will definitely be getting more colors highly recommend!
5,I hated the silicone bands - didn’t fit right and were constantly irritating my skin. I love these bands! So comfortable never get sweaty and can be adjusted easily to fit my wrist. Plus they are much easier to put on (you don’t have anything to fasten everyday.) I recommend!
5,Really great watch band. Looks good very comfy easy to adjust. Well worth it.
4,Nice fit and easy to adjust the strap
5,Love the stretchy band. Easy to put on and take off.
5,The band is very comfortable.  It’s a little difficult for me to tighten after it’s on my arm.  So to make it fit my arm it’s a little tight to stretch over my hand.  But I get it on.  Feels good. I really like it
5,These are so cute! Love the colors and so easy to get on and off your wrist. Seems very secure and priced so great.
5,I ordered these for my wife and children’s Apple watches. They are easy to adjust to the right size They are good looking and comfortable.
5,My title says it all. These are great.
3,Once I set it to the size I needed it would stretch back and didn’t hold the position well.  But it is soft and comfortable enough.
5,Cute colors and really comfortable and love how easily it adjust!
5,Good value
5,These bands are great!  Soft stretchy easy to put on and pull off.  NO more buckles and sweaty watch bands!
3,Stretches out easy and quickly
5,adjustable
5,
5,I barely notice that I have my watch on. I’ve only had the product a few days but so far it’s held up well.
5,These bands are easy to adjust to your wrist size and better yet easy to take off and on.
5,I like that these are adjustable to the perfect fit! Great colors too! I’m ordering more!
4,Just got my Apple Watch and I’m glad I found this product! It’s comfortable!
5,
5,Great bands for the price. Super comfortable and love how adjustable they are. The colors are exactly as pictured.
5,Installs just as easily as the bands that come with the iWatch. Comfortable and lightweight- it’s perfect for the outdoors!
5,I like that they are comfortable and don’t make your wrist sweat.
5,Very comfortable sometimes I don’t even know I have it on.
5,I like it because it’s super easy to put on in the morning hassle free
5,This product is easy to use. I wanted a watch band to wear during walking and exercising as well as at work. The material is comfortable and does not get sweaty. The band is adjustable to adjust to size. Would buy this product again.
5,My Apple Watch heart functions would not work because the standard bands would not pull the watch back close enough to my wrist for it to measure. These bands are tight without being constrictive. Plus they are pretty!
5,Love these watch bands.  So comfortable and adjustable.
5,Fit both my wrist & my husband’s much larger wrist.
2,I love these. They are stretchy. But I hate the adjustable part and at work I wear Velcro for my radiology protection and it kept catching on to it and literally ruining the band. I switched to the rubber loop from Apple and never had a problem since. Waste of a purchase but only because the band got caught on to the Velcro so many times at work.
4,They feel very cheap but they are so I guess that’s to be expected. They look alright at least.
5,As a plus size person these bands are great for every day use. They adjust but still have stretch so you can just slip on and off once you find your comfort zone.
5,These bands are made with Great quality. They fit well and are nicely made. Definitely recommend these watch bands. Also delivery was quick.
4,Easy to install and very convenient when washing hands just simply push and stretch watch back. Don’t have to worry about it getting wet. And if it gets out stretch you can simple tighten it up again.
5,Good quality and value
5,These are so cute love that they adjust
5,easy to puton
5,Good
5,Love it!
5,Easy to use and very comfortable
5,Good price easy to install(once you google about how to remove the old one) nice quality
5,These fit small or big wrist stylish comfortable and seem durable
5,This watch bands are so cute and stylish. I love that I received three bands for the price of one as well. This is a must have especially what I needed it for and that was working out.
5,I love these bands.  They are adjustable soft  and comfortable.  They seem to hold up very well too.
5,Comfortable easy to wear. More sporty than I expected but nice to be able to change color of strap to match outfits. Package of 3 very affordable.
5,Good purchase
5,Good transaction. Product as described. Easy to adjust. Looks great on.
5,These bands are so comfortable. My cousin gave me one and had it for a very long time. I broke it when it got caught on something. Went back to old band and had to order more of these. Love them.
4,Pink want the pink I expected from picture was more of a dusty roses.  Band seems comfortable
5,These watch bands are unique compared to others that have been available and I like that once adjusted can be slipped off and on easily for charging and sleep.  I really like them for those characteristics.
5,Snug enough to make sure all the sensors connect but soft enough not to be irritating. Stretches easily without losing shape. Very nice!
5,Light weight great adjustable Fit and dries quickly after swimming
3,These are very hard to adjust. I adjusted before I put on my wrist but it was too tight. I had to have my husband help adjust it as it was difficult to do it myself. I was going to return these but decided to work through it.
4,These were a great buy for the price!!! One of the three was slightly snagged but overall you can not beat the value. Comfy cute and easy to install.
5,I’m a commercial cleaner and constantly washing my hands and this band gets wet a lot and it has held up great ! It’s so comfortable and sometimes I forget it’s on my wrist. I’m picky about what I wear because I have sensitive skin but this band isn’t even scratchy in fact I’m going to order more in different colors!
5,Love the bands so far. Nice to have a variety of colors at a great cost. They're comfortable to wear regularly while working out and sleeping. I like the snug feeling and not slipping up and done. Love that I don't have to adjust throughout the day. Highly recommend. Only 4 stars for durability because I haven't had them that long but feel they will hold up well.
5,Love all 3 colors. Got pink black and white. Extremely comfortable. The bands that originally came with the watch was painful and causing me to have wrist problems hard to sleep with. But these are just amazing.
5,I really like these. They are comfortable and fit into the watch nicely. Will probably order some additional colors
5,👍🏻
5,When I first got it - I didn’t think I would like it. But I do.  They’re nice and light.
5,These are very comfortable and the stay in place. I dont have to keep adjusting the band
5,Very comfortable and fit was good!!
4,Band are comfortable and easy to to in and off.
5,I really like these bands! They are so comfortable and easy to change out. The colors are great and the pattern on the band is very pretty. Will purchase again.
5,Awesome bands but broke within three weeks
5,Comfortable. Fast shipping. Kid friendly.
4,Nice kids thick not a really great for work but as. A daily or gym very nice
5,
5,These are the best Apple Watch bands. If you have a small wrist like I do these are for you! Great quality super comfy and of course cute!
5,the fit and overall apperance
5,I’ve only had this new wrist band for a week but I’ve had an Apple Watch for several years and I’ve tried a few wristbands. I’m using the multi colored one and I really like it. Its very lightweight and breathable. Especially in the hot weather. I love that it’s stretchy and fits snugly to my tiny wrist. I’ve ordered Apple Watch bands before that I could not adjust small enough for me. This one has about 1/2 inch left on my wrist or on my size 0 daughters wrist - so it works well for small wrists.
5,the fit and overall apperance
5,Wife is happy with the item product is great
4,I was looking for some new watch bands and found these ones! Prior to buying these I was using the standard pink that comes with the watch which I love but I was tired of. So I got these and I absolutely love how simple they are to use they are light weight very flexible and just overall a breeze to use and looks chic!
5,The bands are of great material and we’re packaged nicely. They’re super stylish. I’ll be ordering more from this seller for sure.
5,comfortable & durable
5,I like putting my watch on my ankle when walking because it tracks steps more accurately. These bands make it easy to switch between my wrist and ankle easily. Would purchase again! They also dry quickly when wet.
5,Fits great
5,I got the rose gold pink and black for my 42 mm Apple Watch. I have wide wrists and it is perfect. I had issues with the apple bands breaking my skin out if I slept in them and these are so easy to slid on and off and leave your watch on and it doesn’t even feel like your wearing one.
5,I love the quality of these watch bands.  The ease of putting my watch on and off.  They fit perfectly and holds in place would definitely buy more colors and recommend them to others.
5,These bands were easy to install and they are very comfortable.
5,Comfortable to wear and beautiful
5,Love the comfort and easy install of bands. Will buy more colors
5,I love how comfortable these bands are!
5,Color
5,Very comfy.
5,These are great. They don’t bother my wrist. No itch.  Colors are good and super easy to use.
5,Ease of use
5,I love these bands. They are very comfortable to wear while working.
5,They are perfect for my Apple Watch 7 easy to put on my watch fit perfect and very comfortable. Highly recommend I will look for more colors in these. I ordered black white and pink the pink is more of a mauve color. Great price also buy them!
5,Love these bands! So comfortable and easy!
5,This is my first Apple Watch and I purchased these bands before the watch itself actually arrived and I’m really glad I did. Easy to change out and the bands are stretchy so also easy to slip over your hand. Adjusting is simple and so breathable! After wearing the original band for a couple days I started to see why people don’t like them. This one feels good on my skin and I’m not the kind of person who likes to feel a watch on their wrist with this I forget it’s there. Time will tell about durability. I’m an avid gym goer so it will certainly be tested. Will edit review in future if it doesn’t hold up.
5,Really happy with this purchase. It is significantly more comfortable than the original band. Used to get annoying watch marks on my hand with the original and this one no longer does that. I will say mine came with a really sharp piece of plastic glue or something holding down the threading but after cutting it off it feels great.Its not the most stylish looking band but comfort wise its a 10/10. Will probably substitute for a more stylish band if I need to go somewhere nice.
5,Bought one for myself and my sister! We both like them a lot! Easy to adjust and put on and off quickly! Very comfortable. Totally recommend them!
5,very cost effective
5,I love these bands they are so comfortable. I will have to go back and order other colors.
5,I love these straps. Soft comfortable hardly know it’s there.
5,I honestly have just kept the pink one on since it’s my favorite color I get compliments all the time!I’m in nursing school and when I wash my hands or do procedures I move my watch up higher a bit over the gloves and this makes it easy to make the strap a bit bigger to do so and then easily tightens again when I’m done with class
5,Very comfortable don’t even notice it’s there. Durable and very simple and easy to install. Love these and the colors. 😍👌
5,Fits great! The bands have great stretch and can be adjusted. So far I’m loving these bands
5,I have small wrists and wanted a new stretch band for my new Apple Watch 7 41 mmThese are very comfortable stretchy so pull on and off without any clasps. We’ll see how they hold up but good so far I do love them color availability is good
5,Super duper comfortable they made getting used to wearing my watch so much easier. The band that came with my watch just wasn’t it.I love the adjustability although it does loosen with use. Not awfully though.I did play with a puppy wearing this a very teething puppy. Only reason it gets 4 stars in durability is the threading that sticks out of the band although cute can definitely get pulled or torn and looks a little messy when that does happen. Luckily the cutie only pulled one thread so I lightly burnt it off with a lighter and it hides under the buckle. It just seems with regular use they can get a little frayed.But overall such an amazing product and you don’t only get the one for the price. Getting 3 is a plus. Will definitely buy other colors in the future.
1,This watch band snapped within 5 minutes of me putting it on. Do not recommend
5,Tbh I thought it wasn’t going to be good quality because of the price but I was pleasantly surprised
5,All other watch bands have caused rashes on my wrist. These don't! They dry super quickly too after being wet.
5,These bands are very comfy. However they snag a lot and pull the thread. They also loosen almost every time you slip them on and it is difficult to tighten with one hand.
5,I love these bands! They are super comfortable!
5,It’s nice comfortable and you can adjust it to your liking!
5,Very comfortable and chic
5,The elastic band Makes for a great and comfortable Fit
5,Product was as described and good quality!  Easy to attach to watch.
5,They feel very comfortable and definitely keeps it in place.
5,Very soft fabric fit my Apple Watch perfectly very durable highly recommended.
5,I loved these! They fit so snugged too!
5,Perfect fit
5,I love them!! ComfortableThe only bad thing is that when you wash your hands if it gets wet it would take a lot o time to dry
5,These are great for the price. I washed mine after daily use due to my job. Comfortable and the elastic fit was practical.
5,Very comfortablelove them
5,I wanted some options for my new watch. These bands easily adjustable solid fit on the watch and well worth the price. Why pay Apple prices?
5,These bands are comfortable but a tad bulky for my taste. Also the consistency slip on and off I feel like the band would stretch. I haven’t used much but the colors are very nice
5,Comfy
5,Very comfortable. Great price and I love the colors.
4,These securely fit into the slots on the Apple Watch. The adjustable stretch band is nice. The material for the band is interesting:  it’s like the fuzzy soft side of Velcro. So far the material is holding up well. I wish it had a little more stretch so it would easily get around my hand then be snug on my wrist.The metal buckle is very cheap and has worn/tarnished within a week of having it but it’s not that noticeable and since it doesn’t have direct contact with my skin I think it’s okay.
5,Love the feeling awesome perfect size.
5,This bands are very comfortable. No problem attaching to Apple Watch. And for 3 bands great price!! The stitching was a little lose but can’t even see it
4,I would have preferred a band stretchy enough that it doesn't need to have a slide on it but couldn't find that. These serve the purpose very well though and the fabric is much more comfortable than the original silicon band that is so awkward to put on.
5,I like these because I like the stretchy aspect. Not used to wearing a watch and I hate the hard plastic the Apple Watch comes  with. These are super Comfortable I haven’t had any issues with Tearing or anything with the watch band
5,Really cute styles and the price can’t be beat!
4,Great value. Very comfortable
5,I like these bands they look much more expensive than what they are. Great quality!
5,Easy to install and adjust.  I switched to this style of Apple Watch band after several tries with the braided version; the braided version stretches out over time and my watch would become too loose on my wrist.  Problem solved with these new nylon bands.  Glad I bought them.
5,I have purchased several watch bands for my Apple Watch but since I have received these they are the only ones I wear. Comfy and stylish. I can wear to work or just around the house. I love the color options.
5,I like these bands a lot! They’re so super comfy!
5,Really comfortable
5,Product quality is very good
5,This is the best band ever I love the fact that it’s elastic super comfy on my wrist and when it’s on your wrist it doesn’t feel like the watch is on.  My wrist is really small so the regular plastic bands always bothered me because they were too big even when I would use the last 3 clasps it was uncomfortable.  So take it from me if you want comfort this will be the perfect band for you as well.
5,These apple watch bands are very comfortable easy to install and stay put on arm because of the elastic. I would recommend.
5,These are so easy to switch out and beyond comfortable!!! I love these compared to the “plastic” bands that get all sweaty underneath!!! I’m so glad I found these!!!
5,Love the ease of slipping onComfortable fitLooks stylish
5,Bought these bands for my wife she loves them. They are very comfortable and easy to put on she says.
5,Absolutely love these!!!!!!!
5,These bands are even nicer in person.  I just love the colors.  They are very well made and super comfortable on my wrist.  I am very pleased with this purchase!
5,I love these bands! I work in the Dental field and these are very comfortable and so easy to put on in the mornings. I wouldn’t recommend for working out since they are fabric material.
5,Looking for something to fit my small wrist. These weren’t exactly what I wanted they don’t quite go small enough for comfort.
5,The watch bands are so cute and comfortable as well as easy to get off and on
4,Once I put my watch on its hard for me to tighten the band other than that I love the watch bands.  I love the colors I chose.
5,Happy I purchased.
5,Súper cómoda y buena calidad.
5,I love these bands.  They are so soft and comfortable and quick to slip on and off.  Love them!!!
5,It is very comfortable and easy to put on and take off.  THanks.
5,Good quality bands look nice and easy to adjust. So far so good.
5,My Apple WatchVery comfortabledon’t pinch my wrist
5,Really nice touch on your skin and easily adjustable. Bought as Christmas stocking stuffers
5,Everyday
5,Great bands
4,Very comfortable and easy to slide on and off without loosening it.Only bummer was that if it gets wet whatsoever it takes a long time to dry.
5,Durable
5,Very comfortable and adjustable. I will be buying more of these.
5,Really enjoy the fashionable straps. Live them
5,Nothing really to complain about. Adjusted for comfort will wear overtime which is normal.
5,Love the colors and the feel of the wrist strap.
5,Very nice colors and very durable and comfortable but the bands get itchy after a while.
5,I like the colors. How they look and fit on my wrist.
5,These have a great design soft on the skin lightweight and comfortable.
4,Attempted to side the watch off my wrist tonight only to have the bracket snap in half. Luckily these are cheap and affordable and there’s a three pack so there’s two more to use.
4,I love this item it’s more comfortable on my wrist and I like the colors. Not having to mess with their rubber one and trying to get it on is great. Would recommend!
4,These watch bands are good for people who have a metal allergy as there is no metal touching the skin. The colors are good except the white has pink in it so it looks more pink than white. The loops do catch on anything like Velcro so it makes them look fuzzy. I took a scissors and kind of cut the fuzzies off after sewing new Velcro straps to my dog’s jacket. All in all I say a good value for the money.
3,I thought this was more of a leather type material but it’s like a foam mesh. Not a fan…
5,Fast delivery! Just as described! Comfortable!
5,very easy to install and very light-weight.  stretchy and easy to take watch on and off for charging.  I also wear for sleep and it's very comfy.  Very happy with purchase!
5,I really love the comfort of the band.
5,Mom loved it not bad quality at all and good price for 3.
5,Love these so far!!  Great value!  Stretchy and super comfortable!
4,This plastic part has broken after having this band for 4 months and have worn it daily besides in the shower. I read some reviews where they said the band stretches out but the photo I have the white one that was never used next to the rose colored one I wore for 4 months and I don’t think there is very much stretching at all. It’s comfortable and versatile. I will be buying again.
5,I love these bands! They are cute but also so comfortable. They are soft and don’t rub on my wrist and they are also thin enough that when I’m typing on my computer it’s not bulky underneath so that one wrist feels awkwardly higher than the other. Love these! I’ve only have mine for a couple weeks so that why I gave durability 4 stars cause I don’t know  but they do seem to be good quality. Don’t feel cheap at all
5,These bands are so soft & comfortable and stay in place SO WELL! I am highly impressed. The olive green black and navy set is lovely for the neutral loving folks!
5,Just be aware is not water proof. But still I love it
5,Great watch bands comfortable easy to put on.
5,These bands are easy to install and very comfortable.  I like the color choices and it arrived on time.
5,This is what I’ve been looking for. What I like most about the band is it makes taking my watch on and The band is so comfortable sometimes I forget I’m wearing my watch! I also love how easy it is to take my watch on and off.
5,Comfortable love the price!  I’ve tried other bands that irritated my skin. This band is a keeper!
5,I just got my first Apple Watch ever the series 7. I loved it but wasn’t a huge fan of the silicone/rubber watch band that comes with it. I wanted something with a little stretch that was easier to take off and put on and something softer and more breathable and comfortable. I couldn’t fathom nor justify spending the kind of money Apple charges for a watch band. So I took to Amazon and found several options. I chose these because overall they had great reviews they looked like they were just what I wanted and you get 3 bands for a very small price. They arrived in 2 short days and they’re awesome! First they’re soft and comfortable. My wrist no longer feels sweaty and weighed down like it did with the original band. Second they fit perfectly to the watch. They don’t feel loose and honestly to remove the band you have to press the buttons anyway so the band isn’t gonna just slip off or go anywhere. And most important it fits my need of having the ability to easily take my watch off and on and personally I found them to have just the right amount of stretch to fit it over my hand while maintaining its snug fit on my wrist. Overall I’m very pleased with my purchase. I don’t know how durable they are yet as I just started using one of them but will update after I’ve had them longer. But they seem durable as of now.
5,My wife purchased these for some Apple Watch Band options and she loves them. Certainly not flashy but they are not supposed to be. They are very flexible and the material is nice against her skin.After wearing them for a full day they do not irritate her skin and she doesn't even feel they are on.
4,beautiful colors
5,Great
5,I’ve had a hard time finding a band that was comfortable until I found these
5,The fit is great!  Very comfortable
5,Comfortable and dries quickly if is accidentally wet. Because it’s cloth.
5,I love the Watch bands They are so comfortable and the only bands I will buy.
5,Love these bands. The elasticity of them make them very comfortable and easily put on and taken off.
4,I have super small wrists (5 in) and this band fits snugly. It’s a little hard to slip over the hand but it stays in place once on.
5,I love them
5,Item was as described and shipped as promised
5,Love the stretchy fabric and color choices.
5,It’s exactly what I expected and it adjusts very nicely!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I bought these for my series 4 watch. These bands all fit my wrist well and slot in to my watch just like my original Apple Watch band.I feel these are a great alternative they feel more secure than the iwatch orginal band; and I love the choice of colours so I can switch them outfit dependent. Easy of switch secure comfortable and a reasonable price. I’ll definitely be ordering more!!!
3,The feeling of the band is great! but the material criss cross pattern sticks out and is knitted and can easily get caught on stuff so that is why I am returning it
5,These bands are great! So comfortable easy to install and no worries about it coming unhooked.
5,Okay
5,Easy to swap out bands & comfortable to wear
5,Very easy to put band on watch adjust and comfortable to wear. Light weight. Looks like weave of band is delicate but I have found it to be very durable. Would purchase again.
5,Great quality very comfortable and stylish
5,I bought these watch straps for my wife for her Apple watch 5. This is a well designed elegant looking watch strap. It is made of a stretchy material which is comfortable to wear. She loves it and it come with three different colors giving her the opportunity to change watch straps to match her outfits. Happy wife happy husband.
5,I’m glad I bought these! Although the pink colored one was a little off I still like all of them. The pink one looks almost as a rose-gold color. Other than that they’re so easy to install and the stretchy part is very comfortable. I think I’m gonna purchase more with different colors this time.
5,The media could not be loaded.
4,I love how comfortable these bands are but when becoming wet like doing dishes or showering it’s pretty uncomfortable because they do not dry very fast.
4,Very comfortable and soft. A little awkward trying to adjust the band while it’s on your wrist but overall I like it.
5,
5,Love them
5,Like the colors and the comfort but they started to unravel
5,Love these bands! Great fit and easy to change
5,Easy to fit to my wrist. I like it snug for workouts but looser when not tracking my heart rate. Easy to adjust with one hand. Looks great with casual outfits.
5,Comfy and breathable
5,Love these
5,Fix perfect 😍
5,These bands are beautiful comfy and breathable!!! I have had many compliments on them!!! I love the stretch and adjustability as well!!!
5,Comfortable and easy to put on
5,I love themreally stretch any size
5,wanted something different because original band made my wrist itch.  these fill the bill.  they stay snug Happy with my purchase
5,
5,I really am pleased with these bands. They fit great and the elastic stays where it’s supposed to. They look great and are super easy to put on the watch.
5,This band is very comfortable and easy to put on. I didn’t even have to adjust it I just slipped it right on my wrist.
5,This is exactly what I was looking for. Snug fit but not tight. Classic but sporty look and super comfortable to wear all day.Very easy to change the band to coordinate with my outfits!I have very small wrists so the Velcro watch bands never hold up due to the length. I would buy more colors!
5,Very comfortable
5,allows a perfect fit to my writs.  adjusts pretty easily and the dark blue matches the watch perfectly
5,
2,I purchased these watch bands because I thought they were cute.  I thought the adjustable strap would come in handy.  Unless you have a larger wrist skip these bands.  It’s entirely too big even adjusted to the smallest possible size.  Of course it’s next to impossible to actually get it on the hand adjusted that way.  I had to take the watch off to adjust it then undo one side to get it on.  It was still rolling around my wrist.  I can’t speak on how durable they are.  I returned them the same day.
5,I was over wearing the usual style Apple Watch bands. They made my skin sweat and caused irritations. Tried this one and I love it!! It feels lighter and more mobile.
5,I really like all 3 of them and they’re really easy to take off and on. It’s not as bulky as the apple band
5,Even better than I expected I would definitely buy it again and again.
5,I have 6 of these and change them out frequently. They’re easy to install and seem to hold up well. After a bit of wear they will stretch out some but they’re adjustable so just tighten them up and you’re good to go.
5,Just enough give to slide over your hand and stay snug on your wrist. Soft and comfy doesn’t get hot or sweaty underneath and the buckle stays put and doesn’t slide and loosen like some do.
5,I love the great quality
5,Really nice fitting bands
2,Would not do this one or this firm again.  Really cheap poorly made and worse yet........MADE OF NICKEL and who knows what else.  My wife's are broke out in A RASH!!!!!
5,Fits tighter to my wrist than original band. Tracks heart rate better and does not move around - which can sometimes pause the outdoor walk mode.
5,I love how easy these bands make putting on and taking off my Apple Watch.  Great value! I don’t love the blue line on the white band.
5,Love the variety in colors. Wear daily and look great.
2,Really textured and everything pops out.  Just strange looking.
5,They are very comfortable
5,I like everything so far but it’s only been a couple weeks.
5,Nice fit!
5,I love these bands! They are adjustable great colors great fit and price! Easy to install. Going to purchase more. Highly recommend!
5,If you have small wrists get these!
4,Very comfortable and cute
5,Stretchy and comfortable
5,I rarely write reviews but yet rely heavily on them. These bands are super comfortable!! I wish I switched earlier!I wear my watch every moment other than when sleeping. These are MUCH better than the rubber like ones.
5,These bands are very comfortable for small wrists.
5,i hate the rubbery feeling of the apple watches on my wrist but these have made wearing my watch so much better! it’s comfortable and i can match them to almost any outfit!!
5,Love that you don’t sweat! They breathe! I was breaking out in a rash from the metal on the band that come with the Apple Watch but not with this! The metal does not come in contact with my skin! Yay! Bought a pack for my granddaughter and she loves these also!!
2,Update:  The mounting bracket broke this morning while putting the watch on.  I’ve only had the band for one month.  It was fine up to that point but the primary function of a band is to keep your watch on your wrist and it just failed at that.
5,I haven’t had these long enough to know how durable they are but they are comfortable easy to adjust and install. I think they are attractive.
5,I just loved how elastic and soft the material is. I bought the bands for my teenage niece and she loves them!  Very easy to assemble and adjust!
1,I absolutely didn't notice this had only 12 reviews.  I liked the colors as I searched multiple options.  They arrived today.  They are cheap as can be.  And "stretchy" in this case is not a good thing.  The band must be adjusted each and every time you put it on sometimes a few times.  For example I adjust it to what seems like the right size but the process of "stretching" it to fit over my hand onto my wrist loosens it.  So you have to futz around with it to get a right fit.  I can't find the right fit.  It's too loose.  You can pull the clasp as you wear it to tighten it but....  Not a good product.  Better to pay more for a better fit and a higher-quality look.  The fabric looks like of "grandma-furnture-upholstery."  I think I'm going to have to return these.
5,I love them
5,They work great with my watch! Easy to change out and are very comfortable!
5,Bands are easy to change and super comfy. Glad the package had 3 different colored bands—I can choose which color I want to wear certain times!
5,So comfortable it doesn’t even feel like I have it on! Very impressed with the quality for the price. Will purchase additional colors/patterns in the future.
5,I was concerned the adjustment buckle would be bulky or uncomfortable- but it’s been neither.  I’ve been wearing the gray with prink for about 2 weeks now and I’m very happy with them and glad I bought them.  I didn’t rate durability because I feel two weeks isn’t long enough to gage.  However after two weeks of working/playing life it still looks new.
5,I like the watch band because it is easy to get on and off and is comfortable on the arm. I bought the $50 one from apple and it made me sweaty and I constantly got sweat under the protection cover.  This hasn't happened with this one it is cool and comfortable
5,Super light band no clasp.  Just slides over my hand.  Love it!
5,I like the ease of adjusting the watch band. I don’t have to take it off to loosen or tighten it. It is soft and comfortable and is great for working out because it stays in place and doesn’t get sweaty. Nice variety of colors to change up with outfits.
4,I’m using the black one and it started to release some of the fabric … but it looks great on my wrist
5,Fits Great
5,Best watch band I’ve ever bought! It’s made of a nice fabric and is soft on my skin!
5,I bought these watch bands because the silicone bands always irritated my skin. I’m so glad I found these ones they’re perfect with no irritation!They’re quality material I wear mine everyday with no issues.Only thing that’s kinda annoying is how hard it is to tighten with one hand!🤣 can’t complain much though.
5,Nice stretch but holds shape to fit securely around your wrist. Colors are nice and the band is comfortable. Can’t beat the price for 3 bands !
5,I like these stretchy bands for every day wear.  Comfortable and lots of colors
5,I had to switch from my original silicon wristband because it was giving me a rash and was uncomfortable. These wristbands are super comfortable and do not irritate my skin! I have a couple of friends who wear them as well and love them. Great price for what you get. I love them!
5,but great
5,Just received these and they are very comfortable and adjustable.  They are fairly new so I don’t know about the durability.  Fabric seems to be great quality soft to the touch and it’s a prefect fit for the 6series 44mm.
5,Best watch strap that I’ve tried doesn’t stretch
5,Good value for the money and very durable product
3,Works as described. Product does stretcher out after a week of wear and then slides around. If you don’t wear these bands everyday.. they might last longer
5,Comfortable pretty & easy
5,I love it! Super easy to put on and comfortable. If you lead an active lifestyle I would recommend them.
5,Very comfortable. Easy to take off and put on without having to fumble with clasps.
5,This is the best Apple Watch band I’ve bought so far. The plastic and silicone ones dig in and this one is so comfortable. It feels like wearing a scrunchie or sweatband. Also super reasonable price for 3 bands.
5,Love how it fits all but it already got a snag in it. Not sure how that would happen. Still happy about the purchase.
5,So comfortable I have very sensitive skin and am this does not irritate my skin at all. Love the color selection as well
5,Easy to put on and adjust. Very comfortable.
5,Perfect for sensitive skin! Haven’t had any problems at all for the past month. I have worn working out gotten it wet and still I’m very satisfied!
4,I received my items and haven’t worn them yet but I expect them to be fine. One thing I didn’t care for was the red and blue accent stitching on the white/cream band. That was an error on me as the consumer though because it was displayed to be on the items. So if you don’t mind that but it for sure!!!
5,These are stretchy bands that are adjustable. Very easy to attach. Very comfortable on my wrist. Breathable
5,Love it
5,Have loved the elastic I watch bands for awhile but with time they would always stress ch out and bee too loose. Love these adjustable ones and they seem to be more durable and more comfortable too!
5,Easy to install and comfortable my daughter loves them
5,I have a small wrist so when looking for watch bands I have trouble.  I got the Apple 3 38mm for that reason.  These are comfortable and easily loosen and tighten as need.  I like that I have three different colors as well.
5,This watch band was very comfortable not to hot and made with breathable material. It was easy to install with minor flaw of the attachment being a little shaky but overall awesome product. Also the seller is very nice asking how the product was.
5,Muy lindos y muy prácticos
5,these are great and easy to install and change also
5,Bought these for my mom. She said they are very comfortable. Pretty colors. Look nice.
5,Love these I’m so glad I found them They are super soft and comfortable easy to take off and put on I have large wrists so the the adjustable band is perfect for me. Came as described.
5,I got these for my watch and i love them. I hate having tight things on my wrist so the adjustable band is great!!
5,I have very small wrists and was looking for a band that I could wear tightly and comfortably. This is perfect for both!
4,Comfortable and stylish
5,I would highly recommended those bands. Beautiful colors easy to use...….Love it
5,Just right. Good fit and comfortable to wear.
5,easy to use and wear
5,I bought these to work out in. I really like the bands and pretty much use it daily.
5,Para los que hablan español.Este el paquete blanco rosado y verde lo compré para regalárselo a mi esposa está encantada con este producto. Está interesada en otros colores también.Además compre el paquete azul blanco y negro para mi de igual forma encantado.Muy lindos diseños son bastante cómodos y elásticos.Love this product 5/5 💯🙌🏾
5,I love these Apple Watch bands! The only thing that I do not is that they can snag if you have a crazy puppy like I do! But other than that I love them because they are stylish and super comfy to wear all day!
5,I tried multiple bands and this one is by far is the best. Easy to attach doesn’t get loose over time and is super comfy. Would definitely recommend.
5,3 in a pack is a great deal for there. They are easy to change and great quality. Very comfortable.
5,Very easy to change out fit nice and are adjustable looks great
5,The band is very easy to put on your watch and just as easy to adjust the size!
5,The fabric is soft and super comfy!  Does not pinch or irritate your wrist!
5,Love the band sporty and stylish. Adjustable for a comfortable fit
5,Easy to attach.  Comfortable/Breathable to wear.
4,I have really small wrists and in order to get this on I either need to roughly pull my watch onto my wrist or loosen the band and somehow tighten it on my wrist which isn’t easy. Also the band is already starting to wear out after a week of me having to adjust it. Probably better if you have bigger wrists than me. Also probably for better who don’t use their watch to workout much.
5,Other colors get dirty way to fast and are hard to clean.
5,Comfortable and don’t make you itch and you can easily adjust the size I def recommend
5,These bands fit the Apple Watch just as well as the Apple brand but for much cheaper.  Unlike the Apple brand you can adjust the length as it stretches out with use.  And they are comfortable.
5,It fits very comfortable. Love it
5,These bands are very comfortable easy to adjust attractive and reasonably priced. I would highly recommend them.
2,I bought this product to replace the silicone band that came with my watch as I was experiencing a lot of irritation. I thought that a nylon band would help reduce that.This product is an excellent price and came in a range of colors. I thought that the criss cross design was a cute idea however what the product page didn't say is that the criss cross pattern is made up of raised fiber loops. This is a turn off for me for two reasons 1 It makes the product sort of itchy and 2 the texture reminds me off poor quality basement carpeting.
5,It’s perfect!
5,Great band.  Easy to tighten for small wrists.  Fast to dry when wet.
5,These are very comfortable.  I like that they are adjustable and the watch is so easy to put on and take off.
5,These are great bands for an Apple Watch.  They fit really nice and comfortable great for working out or just daily casual wear.  They are a breeze to attach and have held up so well!  Highly recommend.
5,Great bands
5,Very nice breathable material love the colors and it’s very easy to take on and off
5,LOVE these bands.  Totally reasonably priced.  The 38mm fits my small wrist is easy to adjust and put on.  I will absolutely buy again in more colors!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Super simple and great for daily use. I switch me the bands out in the morning depending on my outfit.  They are stretchy and comfy and not itchy at all. I will probably buy different colors.
5,After wearing my Apple Watch for a few weeks my wrist became irritated by the silicone band. On the advice of my DIL I decided to try the stretchy band. So glad I did. So comfortable and easy to take off and on. Easily adjustable too. Have only worn it for a few weeks. Anxious to see how it holds up to daily wear and tear. But for now I’m very satisfied with the product and the price.
5,I’ve bought multiple packs of these because I love them so much. I don’t get itchy from them. So easy to change so I love having so many colors to match my outfits. Great purchase! My daughter loves them too and I get compliments on them.
5,Comfortable and comes in pretty colors !
5,Can't even tell you have it on. Love the look

5,These are by far my most favorite Apple watch bands.I have the scented apple braided bands I have the rubber bands I have all kinds of different bands and these are the most comfortable and easily adjustable ones that I purchased.

5,These bands are stretchy and comfortable. No complaints.
5,These watch bands pretty much make your Apple Watch disappear the band is so comfortable that wearing the Apple Watch goes unnoticed as you cannot feel the band and or the watch on your wrist..  wearing this to the gym is no longer a real issue with sweat or build up and is more comfortable than ever before
5,I was not sure so I bought one set LOVED IT SO MUCH I had to buy another. EASY to swap out and my watch  feels better on my wrist snug. THESE are great for the price and quality you get!
5,Love the feeling of the band
5,So comfortable. Easy to put on. Stretchy soft looks nice. Just love it!!
3,The bands are pretty but if it is tight enough to not slip it feels to tight.  They do give a great look to the watch and match the rose gold
5,This is my second purchase for these watch bands. I love the feel and quality. They don't make your wrist sweaty which is why I do not like the silicone watch bands. These are easily adjustable for comfort. Colors are great.
5,Love these!  Easy to switch out and comfortable. Easy on and off.
