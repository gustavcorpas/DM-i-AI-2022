5,I really did not like the Fitbit charger that came with my Fitbit Charge 5.  After looking at various options I purchased this one.  I use it in my office and usually charge my Fitbit Mondays after the weekend and Thursday or Friday.  It works perfectly. My Fitbit charges quickly without flopping loose on my desk.  The charger is small enough it doesn't take up much room on my desk.
5,I bought a new Fitbit Charge 5 and wanted a second charger for it. 1 for my office and 1 for the house.I keep the small OEM charger at my office plugged into my computer and I use this stand at home.It works great so farThe stand is sturdyCharges very quicklyHolds my fitbit securely while chargingLooks good on the countertop and doesn't take up much roomJust as an FYI it comes with the USB cable but not the actual charger itself. I knew this before ordering and we always have a bunch of chargers laying around from our other devices so it wasn't an issue for me.For the price it was a great addition for my Fitbit.
5,I like that you slip the watch over the end and it slides right onto the charger spot. I took it camping while camping with my son and daughter in law.  My son said he wants like that. He loves his gadgets so that's also a 5 star review.
5,It came quickly and it is useful. The charging cord that comes with the Charge 5 is only about 2 feet long this is twice as long. It helps when using it to put it at the very edge of a table that way the band can dangle over the edge and does not interfere with the charging cord.
4,This is my regular charger for my Fitbit works pretty well but there's a couple things that make it a bit frustrating.- The cable it uses is short (4.2ft).  It's not unbearable but it prevents me from using it on a stand-up/sit-down desk.- The stand works but you *MUST* make sure it's connected solidly.  if the wristband gets bumped a little bit. it can and usually will be put at an angle and prevent it from charging.  This is a problem because:- It isn't stable.  can easily get bumped and move with little effort.  If there isn't anything charging  on it it's actually even WORSE when it comes to stability.It works and I like it a little better than the one that it comes with and so far has handled the plethora of times it's fallen off the stand its on.  I've found a spot for it that doesn't get bumped as much except when cats decide to fly through the room so it doesn't happen a lot.  Plus I don't need to charge my fitbit but once a week or so so it's not earth shattering but there are limitations of this product.
5,Works so much better than the charger provided with the watch.  Connects easily and stays connected.
5,I used to forget to recharge my Fitbit Charge 5 until it was too late.  The old charging cord was lost on my desk amongst the sea of other cords. This charging station is ideal as I stand it next to my keyboard and put it on top of my iPhone so there is no way I can leave without my Fitbit.  It charges as quickly as the cord and the docking connection holds my Fitbit in place.  Clever product at a great price.
5,This charger works well for my fitbit charge 5.  Watch latches on well and gets charged quickly.
5,Love this for my Fitbit luxe would recommend
5,This charger is easy to use and a great replacement for the charger received with the Fitbit Chage 5. Great price and convenient to use. Would order again.
