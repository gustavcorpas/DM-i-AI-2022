5,very nice item.
5,I'M GLAD TO HAVE THE CHIP INCLUDED. THEY ARE HARD TO REMOVE FROM OLD CARTRIDGE WITHOUT DAMAGING
5,This is my primary printer and the cartridges can really cost a lot but after using this brand I’ve noticed that they last longer and cost last to use which is a win for me all the way around! Highly recommend it!
5,We buy these cartridges because of the chip mechanism that comes with each.  The price is good as well.
5,These toner cartridges work just like the HP Brand but at a fraction of the cost.
5,I purchased this for my daily printing needs and worked perfectly no issues to install. I highly recommend this product
5,Good quality & easy to replace. Lasts a long time and the 2 pack is a good value.
5,We have not used the ink cartridges yet but we were paying the same amount for one cartridge.
5,Great price and arrived quickly!
5,The product came just in time and works great.
5,Has worked very well for us. Will buy again
5,I have had much difficulty in procuring "chip-compatible" replacement toner cartridges for my printers on-line until now. I own a business that employs eight (8) laser printers and to finally find a company that fulfills my constant need for replacement toner is very gratifying and simplifies my ordering cartridges.I will continue to order exclusively from AMSTECH.
5,These are a few dollars more than the ones without the chip but they eliminate the annoying “toner low” notice with the non-chip type. I dealt for years with the toner low notice each time I printed. I ordered these cartridges and pulled out one of the other types before it as empty and replaced it with this 58A cartridge. It’s been working fine with no annoying low toner notices
5,Works as it should. cheaper then buying HP branded toner and works just as good
5,Great customer service with this product.  Great value super easy to install and received super fast.  The quality of the ink was so much more than I anticipated.  Will definitely buy from this seller again.
5,I order regularly and the quality is good.I'll be ordering from here until I'm not using the printer.
5,This product shipped quick and I have really enjoyed the quality and longevity.
5,Great quality Ink
1,Beware. This is not an authentic HP cartridge. I blame myself for not looking closely enough at the description but do not make my mistake! These didn't last long at all and the print quality was poor. I can't believe the high cost for this inferior product. Do not buy.
5,Super easy to replace and GREAT quality!
5,We have an afterschool business. We have to print a lot of class worksheet for our students. This product works perfectly for us. It can print a pretty good amount of worksheets clearly. We are a very small business and the price is reasonable. We enjoy the cutting-edge quality and the price fits our budget.
5,It has chip installed. This is very important. Otherwise HP printer won't recognize the toner.
