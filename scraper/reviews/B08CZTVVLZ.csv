5,Pros: The design is nice. It's very sturdy and secured. Attaching the TV is very easy. Height is just right. Easy to move not too heavy.Cons: While the height is just right for me it is a bit short for other uses. The instructions are a bit confusing at first. The glass bottom is pretty but I'm afraid me or my dogs will break it lol. Trying to screw the glass bottom and pole together was difficult since you have to screw them in from the bottom but I used the box it came in to lean the pole on and keep it steady.Notes: My TV is a 32 inch. The stand does come with things to hold the TV wires in place I just didn't use those because my wire is short and I'm lazy.
4,I like that this stand swivels and it’s fairly easy to put together although the instructions are a bit vague at times. I was able to assemble the stand mostly on my own. The only part I needed help with was to put the TV on the stand since it was too heavy to do that alone. Your miles may vary depending on how big your TV is. I bought the stand knowing the dimensions for it particularly its height but it didn’t register to me until I put it together and thought it may be too short for my use. I decided to still give the stand a shot and I’ve grown to really like the height! It’s perfect for watching TV in bed while I’m at my makeup vanity and even when I’m doing floor exercises. It’s almost always eye level.
5,It works great for my situation!
5,Better to stand it up then put it on the wall
5,I didn't want to go with a wall mount for my FireTV and just happen to see this in one of the list. I love it! Very sturdy and doesn't take up much room. I made a good choice.
4,Like it used in living room alternative to wall mounting
5,We got a new cabinet to house our entertainment equipment and that necessitated we get a new mount to hold our flat screen TV. This unit was just perfect for our needs our TV sets maybe 1 inch lower than the old mount (at the highest adjustment) but the combination is so well harmonized that it just doesn't matter. I recommend you look at this unit for your equipment needs.
3,Purchased this stand to help make our patio tv more portable (carrying it in and out of the garage when not in use). It went together quickly and def makes setting the tv up easier but this was the only stand on Amazon that would hold our tv (60” LG which is allegedly 76.5 lbs) and I didn’t see that it had a glass base.  Needless to say we are kind of concerned about this. The locking clips that hold the tv on are plastic. We ended up zip tying the tv on to the stand so we could lift it all in one piece.Rating 3 stars for now due to initial impressions and will update soon.
5,Easy installation. Made of steel. Very stylish. Look great in my back yard gazebo. Highly recommended
5,The unit is not hard to put together  and it is awesome to look at. Good buy.
4,This product is great. It was easy to setup and very stable. The parts are good quality too. My only issue is that I wish it extended to be a little taller. If it extended another up to another 12 inches then this product would be perfect. Otherwise it’s great.
4,It was fairly easy to assemble but would be easier with two people for some pieces. Doesn’t take up much space and it’s super high quality. You can also turn it so that the tv is facing certain areas in the room.
5,Looks stylish. Easy to install does the job.
5,We lost our legs for TV and this was perfect.  We did not want to wall Mount and put holes in wall
5,i like it alot it is definitely sturdier than i expected. i was really skeptical considering i haven't seen this stand before and didn't know what to expect. and attaching the tv to the stand was simpler than i expected also i still didn't put it up to the highest setting like i wanted to cuz i was scared it would fall turns out its perfect anyway i got it for the bed room and it doesn't really have to be as high. putting it together was pretty simple also. the art work on the instructions could of been better but i made it. also was able to do it all without help maybe wasn't the smartest thing to attempt with the chances of dropping the tv but it wasn't difficult
4,Its a good tv stand just wish it had a higher height setting
5,Is beautiful
5,I love this stand. I bought it to use in our Park Model camper to create more space. I placed it on an additional wood box to hoist it up another 7 inches. I pushed the small kitchen table up tight to the stand which now is high enough to view the TV above the backs of the chairs and napkin holder on the table.  Worked out great to gain real estate in a small space to be able to add another small chair. Also put a small shelf above the TV to hold the DVR and VHS players!
5,Didn't have high hopes  just needed something simple to put my TV close to my bed and Didn't have any wall bracket skill or patience.  This is super sturdy and surpassed my expectations!
5,This is a solid well-built stand. I eventually returned this stand for Mount-It! stand which I could adjust vertically.
5,We were looking for a stand for our tv but didn’t have the space to put a large one and didn’t want to mount. This is it!!!!!
3,Instructions are mostly in the form of a diagram that takes a good deal of study and thought to use..but even then.....and the finished height is much too low for any size TV. I need to either come up with a way to raise the whole thing about 7 or 8 inches or send it back.
4,Left the stuff in the background so you can see how tall. I wish it was slightly taller. But a great value. Easy to put together
5,This is perfect for our TV. I put it together myself (46yo female) and it was not difficult at all. Did need a little help mounting the TV but could of done it alone. Since there are no holes in the wall I can move it anywhere easily; re-decorate upstairs ect. Currently I have it in front of a brick wall which was not my original plan but because of this stand I could! Highly recommend!
5,It’s perfect!  We can’t hang a mount in the wall so this is the perfect solution plus it swivels!  Excellent but very happy!!
5,It did not adjust high enough. It would’ve been better if I could’ve raise the TV up six more inches.
5,This item was easy to assemble and it fits perfectly in my small room
4,Overall I like the tv stand. It's easy to put together sturdy looks great.However I think the way the tv attaches to the bracket is a poor design. And the sticky-back wire retainers don't stick very well and come off after a few days.  I plan on keeping the stand.
1,We wanted to place the stand behind a piece of furniture so the height for the TV was important. Amazon could not answer my questions and referred me to manufacturer.  I wrote to the manufacturer with 2 specific questions.  The response received was NOT useful answering 1 question but providing the same information available in the on-line product description to ANSWER the 2nd question.  I rewrote again to the manufacturer and again asked the SAME question but NEVER received a reply.  I foolishly ordered the stand and spend wasted time assembling it only to learn that the TV a was NOT able to hang height enough on the stand to clear my piece of furniture.I returned the item - this could have been avoided IF a better product description was initially provided OR if the manufacturer actually answers my second question properly initially or had not decided to IGNORE My second request for information.  I will NOT buy anything from this manufacturer.
4,Not as high as you'd think. I'd have liked if my TV was 6"-10" higher.It's easy to assemble and looks good after assembly. The wire management sticker clips came off the day after so you'd have to get a stronger adhesive foam tape.
5,Took me 20 minutes to assemble and it's been up every since
5,Let me start off by saying that it is easy to build if you are familiar building ikea products then this is no different. I wanted a tv stand for my balcony and gave this one a shot it is extremely sturdy and well worth every penny.
5,It was really easy to build set up and move around. TV can Pivot side to side. Allows me to move TV around the bed room wish I would've gotten sooner.
5,I really liked this one and the assembly was easy. Low profile does not dominate the space. Unfortunately it was not as high as I needed so I had to return it. But I do highly recommend.
3,Good quality it’s just not high enough!
5,Easy to assemble.
5,Wanted something affordable for my home gym in my garage. It’s the perfect height for standing or floor workouts such as yoga. I was able to assemble on my own.  Recommend for sure great value for the money.
5,Very elegant in its simplicity. A buddy of mine swung by who had just purchased a large complex base for his own TV and was thoroughly envious.
4,Good quality product
5,The stand is good material just a little complicated to put together for a women wish it was about 2 or 3 inches higher for the beds that have the high  boards checked again and it it high enough. Thanks
5,Perfect for my tiny pace that I can't make holes in
5,Everything works perfect. Dimension installation functioning and esthetic.All good
5,Easy to install
5,Great buy. Quick shipment exactly want I was looking for.
2,I wanted something easy inexpensive to place my tv. The instructions are worst than ikea. So complicated to put together I gave up with in 3 min and returned it.
5,Easy to assemble and great holder for our tv.
5,Easy to Assemble. Instruction manual was very detailed!
5,Perfect for what I needed.
5,Excellent tv stand very easy to assemble
5,like it wish it had some internal wire routing
3,I like it super convenient
5,It was so easy to assemble!
1,Conceptually this is what I was looking for.  Unfortunately it is so short that I am looking down at the TV.  Beware the extendable height is the top of the TV bracket.  I was not mislead as pictures show proper measurements in small print. For me a waste of time to assemble.
2,Just got item today and just opened it it looks Iike its been used. Definitely not new may return
1,Horrible product. The instructions were not clear. Return immediately
1,Glass base shattered while fixing the screws . Screws were not even tight and there are no clear instructions. They said no full right but how to understand in real world?Shattered glass fell on me . Luckily eye were protected .It is as dangerous as any weapon . This product may kill you if you are not careful while you assemble .
1,Way smaller than described. Flimsy. Would not recommend.  Seller unreachable for returns.
1,Too short to put behind electric fireplace that I own. Disappointed and want to returning it but I didn't save the box.
1,The stand is good but it is not tall enough. This is way too short. I have a high kitchen table and the TV is below it. Since our TV fell off the wall we taught this would be a good alternative but it really isn't.
1,Easy to assemple but not sturdy and wobbling.
4,I like how adjustable this stand is super easy to assemble.Con.... the safety pins for holding the Tv are made out of plastic with a screw that comes up. I would never use these i took my safety pins off of my other stand to use on this one. The stand also swivels so i dont see how plastic tv mount screws are safe. But other then that works perfectly.
3,Way too short- it’sLike every one of these hides the max height. It should be prominently displayed in the ad not hidden deep in brush. I think this one mazes at 50 inches or soMething and because the movers broke my dresser it’s not sturdy enough to hold The tv like it used to so I wanted a stand to put behind the dresser andHave the tv look like it was a bolted to the wall because I can’t put holes in the wall. Who knew that the picture of the dresser that’s included in this ad is way too short like 20 inches too short like the stand is basically worthless for my purposes. The tv doesn’t even come up to the top of my dresser . How tall could a dresser possibly be right? So annoyingSo moral is measure the dresser and find where it’s buried how tall the damn stand maxes out at before purchasing . Picture say it all - see where the tv comes up to on the dresser ? FML
5,This thing was easy assembly and is easy operation. Swivels great to cover whatever piece of furniture you decide to sit on.
5,I like it.
5,Easy to Moderate to put together even extra screws when finished. Nice look and cool that it swivels. To me it saves from having to mount on a wall and I can put it a corner.
5,Highly recommend. One year in and it works perfectly.
5,Easy to assemble.  Nice and sturdy.
5,Great for bedroom. Holds a 55" 📺 TV. I assembled it with a Phillips screwdriver within 30 mins.
5,Very nice I no longer have to raise my head to watch tv
5,Excellent
5,The stand is sturdy and well made. My only complaint is the foot pieces under the stand only stick on. This makes them pop off if the stand is slid around on carpet and probably  on other surfaces. Other than that it looks great and is well designed. The instructions were simple and well layed out.
5,Purchased to use in my basemet. Works perfectly!
5,Can't beat the price I paid. TV stand is sturdy. Holds our 55in no problem.
5,
5,Very impressed with this Mount. We moved into a townhome and didn’t want to Mount any bring permanent so used this to stick behind a small stand. I wish it went a little higher- pay attention to measurements; but overall it is sturdy easy to assemble and a reasonable price. Our TV feels secure and out of the way.
5,We were after something to place a tv on a table and this is perfect it is sturdy and doesn’t move as well as being high because it’s in a table too gives it full viewing in the room.
5,Took about 30 minutes if that to put it together. Sturdier than I anticipated and seems to be well made. Exactly what I needed to save some space. Good buy.
4,It works great easy to assemble. I just wished I would of measured the height before purchasing by the picture I thought it would be taller.
5,I like the item it does what it say.  Am not good with measuring items I need. I would like the stand to be able  to be extend taller than 4 feet. Maybe 6 or 8 would have been perfect
