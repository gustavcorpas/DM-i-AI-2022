5,I purchased one of the new magic band plus for disney and read reviews that they didn't always stay fastened. These tiny pieces of plastic did the trick!
5,I used these on mine and my kids' magic bands.  They did a good job if keeping them from falling off.
4,Not quite the right size for the magic band I have
5,Have not gotten to use my Magic Band+ at the parks yet but thought I’d share a picture of the fit on a Magic Band+.  Looks fine to me.
4,These arrive exactly as expected & seem to be good quality. We will use them for Disney trip in a few weeks to secure our magic bands.
5,These were recommended in our Disney travel group. There’s a great mix of colors for everyone I highly recommend. Don’t go to Disney without it.Pro tip: they fit the new ones too that just came out!
5,Goes on great and keeps band on
5,We have used Bitbelts for YEARS now and I swear by them. They are extremely durable...have *never* had one break on us). They do their job 100%...have never had a Bitbelt slip down. We use them for our smart/fitness watches as well as our Magicbands. So many people have told me their woeful stories about lost watches and Magicbands especially in the theme parks or at pools/events/etc and I tell everyone about these because they are the best thing ever made. You won't regret buying them! Just make sure that you get the correct size that you need. =)
5,Bought these for trip to Disney for magic bands.  Worked great bands never fell off with these on and they were super comfortable.Didn’t feel it on the band at all.
5,Used this at disney to secure our magic bands. I nearly lost my magic band because it came un-attached this was the only thing that held it together and on my wrist. Recently a person. Lost there magic band and a person who found the band was able to charge thousands of dollars within a couple hours.
5,THESE WERE ORDERED TO USE WITH OUR DISNEY MAGIC BANDS. THEY WORKED PERFECTLY WITH NO ISSUES.
5,These held our Magic Bands on very well. I kept catching the band on things and it would come loose. The Bitbelt kept the band securely on my wrist. I highly recommend getting them.
4,These were perfect for our Disney magicbands. Both grownup and kids utilized! Deducted a star because if not placed at the right location the bitbelt would not work. However 9/10 times it would. A great purchase for added reassurance.
3,The material stretches. I did ask if it'll fit the apple watch and the response was a yes but not comfortably. It's a lot of pulling and reworking the elastic band to get them on the smaller apple watch and on a magic band slap bracelet. Hopefully it'll hold during the trip. Missing 2 bands. Only received 10/12 and description says 12 pack.
5,This product did exactly what I purchased it to do. It held our magic bands to our arms throughout the week. The one complaint I have is that it could be a little slimmer and the edges a little rounded.
5,Worked perfectly  So many times found my magic ban unhooked and this kept it from falling off
5,This was the absolute perfect fit for our magic bands at Disney. So glad we bought them. It definitely keeps the bands from accidentally falling off.
5,Worked on our Disney magic bands. My 6 and 3 year old didn't lose them! Win
5,Perfect for the magic bands
5,Awesome for securing the magic bands on small wristsSave us numerous times at Disney World
5,After a Walt Disney World visit that saw one MagicBand disappear and another threaten to do so we decided we needed to find something that would help prevent that happening again. These simple little rubber sliders definitely fit the bill. They fit snugly on an adult-sized MagicBand 2 and keep the clasp closed and secure. The bundled colors coordinated with all the MagicBands we had so they'll look like they're part of the magic themselves!
5,Absolute must for magic bands. Saved my band multiple times.
5,The item was lost in mail but the company immediately replaced and received quickly. Happy with product as well. Fit Magic Band perfectly.
5,My grandsons band was too  big even after making it smaller.These worked great on our Disney Magic bands
5,These were great to keep my Magic band from popping off!
5,I was doing homework before our trip to Disney and saw on several blogs to buy these. I did and they are LIFE SAVING! They work perfectly to hold your magic band on and several times my band had come unsnapped and was being held together with the bitbelt. Buy this!! It will give you peace of mind with your magic band!!
5,At first I wasn't going to purchase these but after seeing exactly how the Magic Bands connect together I decided to go ahead and buy a set for my own piece of mind. I am so glad that I did! Our family of four just came back from a week long trip. My son my daughter and myself all ended up using these bit belts. (My husband said he was fine.) I probably didn't really need one my daughter had one just to be on the safe side but for whatever reason no one could get my son's Magic Bands to stay snapped together. We ended up needing to use two belts one at each end of his Band to keep it secure on his arm. Once we were able to get the two belts positioned he didn't have any trouble at all. Without these tiny helpers his Band would have been falling off all the time! I am so glad we had these on hand and will be recommending them to anyone I know who will be visiting Disney.
5,I got these for my family trip to Disney.  These worked great for keeping the magic band from coming off.  They were great for my family!
5,These fit so well. Highly recommend!
4,Works great unless one of them was molded poorly....then started to tear. However 11 of the 12 work great!
5,Work very well at securing bands so they don't come off unexpectedly
5,Kept bands on wrist all day even the littles kept them on.
5,The idea behind these is great but they don't fit my Fitbit Charge.  I love the colors especially the glow in the dark ones.  But I think they may have sent me the junior set because these are so tiny that I cannot use them on my Charge.  I also ordered a set from Digihero and they are perfect.  They go on and off easily and are exactly what I needed.Update 2/5/2016:  The seller contacted me and together we determined that the Bitbelts they originally sent me were the Jr. variety not the regular size ones.  They immediately sent out a new order and also included additional glow in the dark Bitbelts (my favorite ones) to make up for their error.  I am so happy about this because I love the Bitbelt colors (especially glow in the dark) and the quality of these is better than Digihero's.  Also I love the neat "Bitbelt" logo on them!  Bitbelt's customer service is fantastic!!
3,Actually only 2 really glow in the dark. Colors variety is nice.
5,Used this for our extended family trip. It was our first time using magic bands and we wanted to make sure the no one lost their bands. No ones bands fell off! The bands did fall off before we put these on though. I kept pulling my backpack on and off and never lost my band. The kids in the group never lost theirs. And it was easy enough my elderly parents were able to figure out how to put it on. They did get aLittle sweaty but it was August in Florida and everything gets sweaty.
5,Bought these to solve the issue of Magic Bands at Disney World occasionally coming off (or worrying constantly that they will). These little bands work wonders! They slip on and fit the Magic Bands perfectly. They are comfortable (wore them all day for multiple days). The assortment included a color that matched or complimented every Magic Band in our group. Bitbelts stayed in place so we never worried about our Magic Bands falling off.
5,We used these on our Disney trip to help keep our magic bands on and in place. If it weren’t for these we would have lost our magic bands! Highly recommend!
5,I've lost my fitbit a few times (always found it with the help of darling hubby's eye's) and was very nervous wearing it. Always afraid that I would lose it for good. I did a search online and found this product. Bitbelt. It's exactly what I needed to feel more secure. It fits my Fitbit Force securely and I can easily maneuver it on and off as needed. I highly recommend this product if you have ever lost your fitbit or feel like you might because the strap/connector just doesn't give you the warm fuzzy that it's going to stay put on it's own. You need this product. Trust me...trust Bitbelt!Pictures are glow in the dark Bitbelt. 1st image shows where I place it until I strap on my Fitbit and 2nd image shows it clasped over the strap to hold both ends together. It slides up with a tight secure fit.
5,Wore these on our magic bands and they work like a charm. It was nice to have that little bit of security.
5,Initially had an issue with my order but Bitbelt responded quickly and positively.  Fit is great!
5,We got these because a blog suggested them before going to Disney World. We are so thankful that we got them!!! While we were there we saw two different people loose their magic bands and ours never even moved! I would recommend getting these if you are going to Disney World or Disneyland. The park is crazy and you have to worry about a million things and this takes one less thing off your plate to worry about especially with kiddos!!
5,Bit belt held all or magic bands at Disney World on. Even the young kids didn't lose theirs over a four/five day trek around the parks. We definitely put in the miles and belts held wonderfully. Probably would work for kid wristwatches as well.
5,A MUST HAVE ON ALL DISNEY BANDS. This was a great addition to our magic bands we did band checks every few hrs there was 13 of us total and 6 were kids under 11 not a single problems noones bands came loose and we Herd alot of horror stories. I had my credit card liked to mine and so did a few other family members so this was a great security addition to our bands
4,This was our first family trip to Disney World and I was paranoid about my kids losing their MagicBands. These worked great! I took off 1 star because they are REALLY tight...the kids couldn't get them slid on themselves. On the plus side though because they are so tight I really didn't have to worry about them coming off.
5,Love these for Disney magic bands. My kids bands have actually gotten unhooked when they’d bump into something but they stayed in place thanks to the bitbelt. A necessary product for magic bands.
5,These worked great for our Magic Bands. We used these for both adult and kids size band. The kids needed a little bit of help sliding them down due to their ages  not the product. Really liked not feeling like I needed to worry about our Magic Bands not falling off.  Have also used them on our other fitness tracker watches even though they aren't specifically sized for the watches.  The  Bitbelts are flexible enough that they work fine and I didn't have to buy mutiple sizes. Prior to using these on my GearFit it would occasionally get caught and fall off. Now I don't have to worry about it.
5,These safety bands really worked on my Disney Bands.  They did not rip or tear and let me go around the park and use my band without fear of losing it.
5,THE best safety clasp you can get! I've been using them for years and they're better than all the others I've seen my friends using. I show them Bitbelts and they're sold. Higher quality more secure and a great price. I use them for my Disney MagicBands and they're awesome for preventing the band from coming off if they hit up against something of get snagged don't have to pay $20-$30 for a new band and go thru the trouble of canceling the old one etc. They are a tight fit as mentioned by a reviewer that gave 1 star but that's what you want; to protect your investment from coming off! They do last even when stretched out.
5,I wear a Fitbit which has a similar band to lock on the extra length of strap and it works great. I am planning a Disney trip with grandchildren and have read stories where families lost their children's "Magic Bands" when they came off during their park day. The extra hassle of getting those bands replaced would really take away from your fun day at the park. I saw these Bitbelt bands as a perfect and inexpensive way to help secure the grandkids "Magic Bands" and prevent the possible hassle and disappointment that would ensue.They are even a good idea for the adult bands as well. These bands are cheap insurance for your magical vacation.
3,Bought these for our trip to Disney just a few weeks ago. We figured if people can lose their Magic Bands our kids would be the ones. Well I will say they do fit a regular Magic Band (very very tightly) and even a Magic Band that has been converted to the Jr. size (very tightly). Of course on our 3rd day of travels my son manages to lose his Magic Band and Bitbelt. He lost it in playground/play area with slides rope ladders and webs. I'm convinced that he must have lost it by sticking his hand through the ropes as thankfully later that night we recovered said Magic Band and still attached Bitbelt (pushed further up the band) at guest services. He never lost it again on his trip. Clearly the concept of the Bitbelt is to prevent you from losing bands attached to your wrist but just be aware it is still possible to lose your band. We (and subsequently he) watched his wrist more carefully from then on during our trip. The rest of us including my daughter who also played in the same areas he did never once had an issue.
5,Such a simple idea but works very well!  I lost my Fitbit charge outside a very busy store and was lucky to find it. My Fitbit strap was getting a little loose so I went looking for something to keep it secure. The bit belt does the trick! It holds the strap firmly together and doesn't slide around. The 12 pack is nice in case I lose my bit belt - which is unlikely since it stays nicely on the strap. . I keep two belts on my band at all times and slide one or the other into place when I put on my Fitbit. The belts are colorful and I've shared a few with friends. Great product!
5,I had read that Magicbands can come undone quite easily so I bought these for my whole family to use on a trip to Disney as a precaution. I am so glad I did because Magicbands do come undone so so easily. Had we not had these Bitbelts a few of us would definitely would have lost our bands. These work well for the adult sized Magicbands. You could probably use them on the child sized bands if needed but I found them just slightly too big for that.
5,This is a must need for anyone with a fitness band thing.  I have the iFitness band so i wasn't sure how well it would work but it's been a lifesaver. Before  my band kept coming undone and falling off and i was concerned that i might lose it. However  since using it the band has yet to fall off  even though the clasp has come undone.  Plus the ability to choose different colors it's really nice. Either way  investing the $6 is sooo much better than investing way more on a new fitness watch.
5,I’ve bought this product before and thought they worked very well. On a trip to Disney we used them for the magic bands. All ten of us had great success NOT losing our bands so thumbs up!
5,I'd read somewhere that these would be good to use with my Disney Magic Band.  I'd never had a problem with previous trips but got these anyway since I was taking my grandson this time.  I'm so thankful I was wearing mine!  Shortly after entering one of the parks I looked down at my wrist and my band had come unsnapped. The Bitbelt was the only thing that had kept it from falling off.  The 12 pack will take me through several more trips with other family members.  Amazing how such a small thing can give such a benefit.  Thanks!
5,Got more than we needed but that have everybody multiple options. Definitely glad we had these to keep from accidentally losing bracelets. Definitely recommended!
5,I would absolutely recommend getting these for Magic Bands from Disney. While all eight of us wore these from the moment we put on our bands my oldest son did lose his when he was getting ready one day and his band ended up coming off. Luckily we had extras. I think it's hit and miss whether or not the Disney bands come loose but I think it is worth the small price to ensure that your bands are not lost since they allow access to your room any dining plan you may have and any credit account attached to your room. As a plus shipping is super fast if you have Prime.
5,Be mindful though that it will likely fall out every time you take Disney magic band off. It is flimsy/flexible compared to ones that come with fitness watches. With that said it did what it was supposed to and for the price I would get it versus risk losing a Magic Band or a fitness band.
5,These worked perfect on my sons magic band on our trip to disney.  Kept him from playing with end and band from falling off
5,These saved us from loosing our magic bands (after i already lost mine when i wasnt wearing the bitbelt). I purchased these originally for my son to wear because he fidgets with his magic band in disney but I ended up needing one. They helped keep our magic bands secure and in place.
5,They seem like they will be great for our upcoming trip. I have heard good things and will update more after we get back
5,I bought these before our Disney trip for our Magic bands and they were great in keeping our bands on!  The Magic Bands seem to slip off easy without having these belts on them so it gave us extra peace of mind having them on.  I love the variety of colors in the pack and they matched great with our Magic Bands.  Will buy again for future trips!
5,These band keepers worked great.  Wore the whole week we were on vacation very comfortable.  Didn't worry about losing my magicband while swimming or going on the rides.
5,We recently used these for our magic bands at Disney World - they are definitely useful for the littles or parents being pulled at by said littles (definitely almost lost my band more than once the bit belt kept it on my wrist so I could put it back together!)
5,I bought these to use with MagicBands at Disney and they worked perfectly!  I my husband my in-laws and two kids (6 and 9) all used them with no issues.  Throughout the trip my band kept popping open and this thing saved me from losing it several times.  As a bonus the kids enjoyed mixing and matching the colors with their bands.  Such a simple yet useful little item.  Money well spent!
4,I picked these up to use with our MagicBand2s for our trip to Disney World.  We basically used them on our younger kids bands.  They worked pretty well for most of the trip.  You just have to make sure that you make sure it is in the correct spot to secure the bands.  I am sure that they saved us more than once from losing one of them.
5,They keep your Magic Band from coming open and I just love them
3,These worked well for my husband but my kids and I have smaller wrists and tear away the dark grey portion of the magic bands to make the smaller. Once that was done these were way to loose. So just beware. I had to go back and purchase the kids sized bit belts as well and those worked great.
5,Very simple product. Saved our Disney Magic bands multiple times throughout the week while moving through the parks managing strollers and small children.Definitely recommend if traveling to Disney with small children that like to pull at the band while its on their arm...may keep it from getting lost!
5,Love these! I was nervous about the MagicBands at Disney World so I got these as added protection. It's a very small price to pay to prevent the headache of having to take away vacation time to deal with a replacement! They fit well on the band and keep it in place (I also purchased the JUNIOR size for my kids). Plus it's a fun way to decorate your band! We use more than one just for a fun pop of color. Slight mix-up in my order but Bitbelt was SUPER QUICK to make it right and then some! Great service great product! A+
5,Bought these for the our WDW Magic Bands.  We lost a Magic Band during our last trip so I had everyone wrap whatever ponytail holders and rubber bands that I could find around the bands to secure them for the remainder of the trip.  It worked however I ordered these while in line on our trip to use for our NEXT trip.  They fit PERFECTLY around the current bands and will be soooo much easier to use than the ponytail holders. ;)
5,I purchased these to use with Disney Magic Bands. It definitely provides more security especially for my children. It prevented our magic bands from flying off which is all I wanted them to do!
4,Worked well with our Disney Magicbands. They dont fit 100% right but they work for what they are for.
5,I had concerns about the size/fit on a Magic Band and these were a perfect fit.  Also I didn’t think I needed 12 ... wouldn’t I just need one bitbelt and move it from band to band (I wore three different magic bands on this trip) NO it was faster and easier to have one bitbelt on each magic band. Glad I got the 12 pack.
5,We just returned from Disneyworld (11 of us) and these bands were amazing! They saved loosing our magic bands on more then one of us. After the jostling rides you would look band was unhooked and this band kept it from falling off. Everyone loved them! A very good investment if your going to use the magic bands!
5,Love these.  Keeps my Disney Magic Bands safe and secure. Reduces the chances of losing your magic band on vacation. You can change out the colors and have some fun with them.  They have a really good stretch to fit over the magic bands with no problem.
5,These are a necessity for Disney magic bands. My band's fastening popped undone a few times over the course of a week. My band would have come off possibly lost had I not had the bitbelt.
5,I purchased these to use with Disney World magic bands and they were great! They definitely helped keep the bands on if the regular closure came undone. Since we got several different colors for our family's magic bands we were able to choose bitbelts that (kind of) matched our bands. Not a perfect color match on each one but close enough!
5,Youngest kiddo kept playing with his band and even once lost it on Peter Pan we get the custom bands so they are not cheap. This helps "lock" the band straps together so they can't lose them if the small ball in hole clip comes undone!
5,My wife has a Garmin Vivosmart. When she replaced the manufacturer band she found the replacement band was a bit longer and frequently hung loose. These Bitbelts worked very well in holding the excess band in place. We also have found that these are great for Disney Magic bands. A little extra security to keep them from popping off at the park.
5,Excellent product. Bought these for a recent Disney World trip and worked great for our magic bands!Highly recommend these since the magic bands can pop off if they are caught on clothing backpack etc. I didn't have these for my last 2 Disney trips but got them for this trip. Saved my son's band from completely falling off!
4,Great for magicbands!  On recommendations from several Disney world bloggers got these bands to prevent accidental loss.  Variety of colors allowed for each of the 4 of us to choose several. These bands are "just big enough" for the magic bands.  We are able to easily fit 2 bitbelts per band.  The glow in the dark ones are cool!
5,Very cheap insurance policy for lost magic bands.  I had to go to guest services (for a different lost item) and trust me you don’t want to have to wait in that line.
5,Worked like a dream on our Disney magic band 2s that we used on our family vacation.Sturdy they stay put and are easy to use.
5,After losing magic bands more than once on our last trip we decided to provide everyone in the family with a bit belt and  they were totally worth it! No one had a magic band fall off including the little ones. They're already packed away with the Disney stuff for next time!
5,Highly recommend.  My family used on Disney bands and I never had to worry about losing the bands.  We all wore 3 bitbelts each just to add color and it gave extra protection.
5,I use these for our Disney bands and they work great.  I even gave one to a co worker for her Garmin
5,Live savers!
5,Love them
5,If you are headed to the most Magical place on earth make sure to get some of these. They will give you the peace of mind that your magic bands wont fall off your wrist. After reading that many people had them fall off I decided to give these a try and they worked perfectly!
3,We’ve never used these with our magic bands before but I thought it would be good for our peace of mind to have these. They make the band more uncomfortable and it’s hard to slide it into place. All four of us ended up taking them off by day 2.  If it makes you stress less about losing them or you just want the extra pop of color get some but don’t think of it as a necessary item.
5,Bought these for my 3 year old twins so that their magic bands won’t fall off. We are annual pass holders at Disney world so we go a lot and I don’t want them losing their bands. These are perfect. They fit great and are cute. My kids won’t take them off! 😂
5,This little gem keeps my FitBit secured to my wrist.  I was on a zipline course when my FitBit got caught on something and came loose. I never noticed but thankfully I was wearing my Bitbelt and my Fitbit stayed on my wrist.  Definitely worth every penny I've spent on them.  I bought extras because they do wear down over time which I think is understandable for their size and how much I wear mine.
4,I bought these to use for my family's Magic Bands on our recent trip to Disney World. They worked fine. However if you do decide to make the Magic Band smaller to fit a child's wrist these Bitbelts won't fit quite as snug as you would prefer.
5,I purchased these (and the junior size) for a recent trip to Disney World. The Bitbelts performed as advertised. They went on the Magic Bands easily (make sure to add them to the side without the prongs) and slid into place. The color selection was decent. All of our Magic Bands stayed in place so we had no issues with the product. I highly recommend these for peace of mind and they should last a long time!
4,Received product and tried on great fit. Look forward to using them at Disney in a couple of weeks. I was disappointed in package as it was ran over and torn. Luckily only 1 bit belt received some damage but still usable.
5,We recently went to Disney World and bought Magic Bands for the kids to avoid having to keep track of the ticket (cards) that you need to swipe for entrance into the park and when using Fast Pass.  I bought these bitbelts for additional security to avoid the bands from unsnapping and getting lost.  they worked great i also use them for the colored replacement bands that i bought for my Garmin Vivofit.
5,My family always takes these with us to Disney. IT's especially great for the kids because they add a bit of "security" to the band so they don't lose them. The bitbelts are easy to use and so far we have found them very durable.
5,The family and I went to Disneyworld a couple of weeks ago and these were definitely a must. We bought some in the kids size and some in the adult size. Used them on my 2 and 5 year old bands and our two adult bands. They worked like a charm fit nice and snug. We never worried about them coming off. This is a definite must on your travel list when going to Disney World.
4,Helped keep our magic bands on at Disney
5,Works great for Disney bracelet.
5,I wish I could have ordered 4 instead of 12 but they are great and did the job at Disney! I did need someone to help me put it on everyday because its tight but it was never uncomfortable.
5,These worked fantastic on our Disney Magic Bands we got in the mail with our Disney resort stay. Fit on both the adult and child size. It saved the day when my child band came unhooked but stayed on her wrist thanks to this little device.
5,Would have definitely list our youngest child’s magic band one day had this not been on there!  Whew!  Easy to use.
5,These were awesome during our trip to Disney World.  My twins are 5 and their band came undone several times but these held the band on great.
4,The Bitbelts worked perfectly to keep our Disney Magic Bands in place. The only issue which wasn't really important is that the colors didn't really match the colors of the bands.
5,Great way to protect my Disney Magic band. Easy to put on easy to use licked my band on me.Comfortable !!!
5,These worked on our magic bands even the ones that we made smaller for the kids. They didn’t fit as well on the kid bands but they worked.We never lost a band during our trip and mine saved my band from falling off multiple times.
5,Highly recommend for your Magic Disney Bands!  My kids and I had ours on and no issues. My husband didn’t “need” one and lost his Magic Band on a ride. They come in different colors so you can have options!
5,Bought these as going to Disney World and read a review that suggested good to secure the magic bands as it could be possible to catch them and loose them especially as the new bands are larger. For this purpose it took the worry for potential loss away and worked well.
3,Used it to hold on disney armbands. Worked ok but one was lost and another didn't stay on. Didn't bother taking more than 4 with use because I didn't expect them to fall off.Held really well on a fitbit charge but I would not rely on them for your disney bands. Be warned.I guess it depends on the width of the strap you affix it to.
5,Used at Disney for my 7 year old to help her keep her magic band in place. Work well. Hold up nicely.
5,Definitely a HUGE help for our Disney magic bands these definitely helped keep them on so they didn't fall off
4,I own a Fitbit Flex in the large band.  The bit belts are a little larger and slide it does not stay in place too well.  I am hoping they will fit our Disney magic bands better.
5,Used on a recent trip to Disney with Magic Bands and worked great! Was a little tight sliding them on the first time but kept our bands secure all week. And the glow in the dark ones were great for the kids on darker rides and a night.
5,Everyone needs these for their magic bands at Disney! We should have lost our kid's bands if it weren't for these. The glow in the dark ones glow nice and bright!
5,Bought these for our magicbands 2.0 for disney. They work perfect for the adult size but a little loose on the child size. They do make a jr size. Going to order the jr size to see how it works.
5,The pack came with 12 pieces and they fit my Magic Bands for Disney perfectly. I have a FitBit too and they fit that as well. They stretch a little bit but I think that's just reassurance that it's holding everything in place! I liked how it came in a variety of colors so I could match them to the Magic Bands. Good product and a really great price
5,These are great for Disney Magic Bands...just a little added security to be sure you don’t lose your band!!!
5,This gave us extra security for our magic bands. A must for this active family.
3,This is the second pack that I've bought for my wife. They work and do exactly what they are suppose to do. I only gave 3 stars for the reason that they break so easily. They are a snug fit and the constant stretching to slide them up to take the Fitbit off wears the rubber out and they break. It's not a bad product and if you have issues with your Fitbit Charge or Flex popping off its a good buy. Just be sure to buy the large pack.
5,We used 4 of these for 2 adults and 2 kids Disney Magicbands. I'm so glad we had them because my daughters band wouldn't stay snapped and we would have lost it if we hadn't of used the Bitbelt.
4,It really does the trick for keeping my Fitbit Charge from coming unclasped and falling off. It is a tight fit around the band though  so it makes taking it off a bit difficult. But the alternative was losing my Fitbit.
5,These bands fit perfect on our Magic Bands. I’ll let you know how they work when we are at Disney. We have ppl in our party ranging from 70-3.
5,I bought these for our Disney Magic bands and I am so glad I did! After seeing so many lost bands in the pool in the parks etc. we never had a problem. The bands were very tight to work at first but loosened just enough to slip easily but I am glad they weren't too lose to start. So glad I bought them!
5,I bought these for our Disney Magic. Worked great to help keep band secure. I was carrying my granddaughter multiple time around the park and caught my band on her outfit. If I didn't have this on with my magic band I'm sure I would have lost it.
4,These are great! A little snug for my Fitbit Charge but I would rather it be too snug than too loose.
5,Ordered these for our Magic Bands on our trip to Disney World.  They worked great!  Not once did our bands become loose or did we fear them falling off and Bitbelt was fabulous to work with when our first order did not arrive.  They immediately sent a second package with a tracking number.
5,Must have for Disney magic bands. Saved me more than a couple times.
5,Perfect for Disney Magic Bands while in the parks!
5,These are a must have for your Disney trip
5,These worked great for our MagicBands at Disney - for the large ones specifically.  If your wrist is more than 6" you will use this larger size - if smaller you want to get the junior ones.
4,These work but they are a smidge small.
4,We purchased to keep our Disney bands on the kiddos.  They worked perfectly and were certainly worth the price for peace of mind.  I would purchase these again if needed.
5,Saved me from losing my magic band at Disney World several times. I can't recommend these enough if you're going to be wearing a magic band.
5,These bit belts worked incredibly well on our Disney Magic Bands especially on little kids’ bands that tend to pop open!  They saved the loss of the bands more than once! Highly recommended.
5,Absolutely loved the Bitbelts. We bought them for our Disney Magic bands and so glad we did. We were able to wear our bands without worry and even while at the water parks. Much more durable than I originally thought.  Will continue to use these for my Fitbit and other watches and  jewelry as well.
5,Last time at Disney World we lost two MagicBands.  This year we used Bitbelts and did not lose any.  We even wore our MagicBands into the wave pool at Typhoon Lagoon.  The kids liked having different colors that they could switch each day.
5,when I pick up  my dog sometimes the fitbit snaps come loose....SO MANY times!  the Bitbelt  kept the fitbit on my wrist even with the snaps unclicked.....I lost my first fitbit because I didn't have the Bitbelt.....I like the color choices  and I will not do not wear my fitbit without the Bitbelt!
5,Can't wait to try these on my Disney Magic band and to give these out to kids at the park.
5,Very thankful I bought these for my whole family for our Disney trip. It was a saver for the magic band when they came undone. We didn’t lose our magic bands
5,No more concerns over losing the Fitbit if I bump it the wrong way.  Works great!My only complaint is their website where I wish it was easy to find a way to choose the colors you want and order them in bulk instead of having to by a pack that may have colors you did not want like cammo.
5,Received the wrong product initially however the company was quick to send a replacement with a personal note!Overall these have been really handy in keeping my fit bit on. I work as an EMT and it has yet to fall off with these on it. They are also sturdy and seem to handle quite a bit of use.
5,These worked to keep the Disney bands in place for the little ones in our group. Easy to use.
5,These are a must have if you are going to Disney!
5,If you are going to Disney and bought the fast pass wrist bands to wear these bitbelts are a MUST! We saw 3 kids wrist bands fall right off without the bitbelts.
5,They work great on Magic bands and lots of fun colors to choose from.
5,These are amazing!! We used them for our magic bands for Disney world! It was so nice to know our bands wouldn’t fall off!! Definitely recommend!
5,Worked perfectly to keep our magic bands on! Kids loved getting to pick their own color. Never had any problems... never lost a magic band!
5,Work great to add extra hold on your Magic Bands at Disney.
5,Worked great! We didn’t have to worry about loosing our magic bands.
5,These worked great for Disney! I saw recommendations on the disboards to add a little protection to the Disney bands so the kids wouldn't lose them and they were perfect.
4,This is a great idea and product - works great on my Fitbit. Also giving some to relatives to use in Disney later in the year for the Magic Bands.
5,These were perfect to help secure our magic bands at Disney
5,These worked perfectly to help keep my kids bands on in Disney World! Would definitely recommend them to parents with smaller kids!
5,These are great.  We bought them before going on our week long vacation to Disney World.  We planned on doing all the thrill rides due to having older kids and did not want to loose our Magic Bands.  They worked all week  Best purchase must have.
5,Used these for our Disney magic bands. Helped keep them securely on our wrists. Nice selection of colors and they held up perfectly.
5,Worked amazing kept our Disney bands on
5,These saved us from losing our son's Magic Band the first day of Disney World and it saved us from losing our daughter's Magic Band our last day at Disney World.  I would definitely recommend these fro anyone who will be wearing a Magic Band! Very worth it!
3,They're okay but it can still slip off of where it needs to be on the band which then renders it useless. But it's the best I can think of to solve the potential issue of losing my Fitbit Charge.Fitbit honestly needs to come up with a better band. I think it's ridiculous that we have to buy an accessory just to keep the darn thing on!
5,Sturdier than a cheaper but similar product I purchased a few months back.  I like all the colors so I can mix it up!  A snug fit but it needs to be and I feel secure that my fitbit won't come unclasped with this holding it together!
2,A bit difficult to get on tbh. And it doesn’t stretch enough to be able to fasten the magic band and then slide it over to keep it in place.
5,I wasn’t sure about getting them but after our Disney world vacation with a 2 year old and 6 year old I’m so thankful we did.
4,Great for the price. Kept our Magic Bands on!
5,I read a recommendation on Pinterest to use these bitbelts on our Disney  Magic Bands to insure they stayed on.  Great price and they work perfectly!
5,The last time we were at disney I lost my magic band on a bus. This time we used bit belts and they all stayed on. The belts were easy to use and held up great. Definitely worth the price for a little extra security!
5,Just used these on our magic bands at Disney.  All of our bands popped off at some point but never fell off thanks to the bitbelts. Spare yourself the aggravation and buy these.
5,Product was shipped on time and is exactly as described.  Will not be using for a couple of weeks yet so I can not review how the product works.
5,These were wonderful for our Disney bands.  Comfortable easy to put on and staying in place.
5,Loved it. Worked like a charm to keep our Magog bands in place for the entire Disney trip. My son loves the one that glows.
4,Worked well in Disney
5,Used with our Disney magic bands.  Bands stayed on during whole trip!!
5,Used with Disney magic bands..worked great..people were asking where we got them..
5,Works great. I originally had a single belt as a gift from a friend.  It worked for several months and eventually began to tear.  I liked it so much I decided to buy the multi-pack.  My husband and I split them up between us.
5,Used them for Disney magic bands! Highly recommend! Great for my 5 year old!
5,Pre disney buy that worked amazing. We saw several magic bands laying on the ground while we were there but even my 4 year olds stayed on her with these
5,Easy to slide on felt more comfortable knowing kids wouldn't lose their magic bands.
5,Purchased these for our Disney Magic bands. They saved our bands on at least 4 occasions. Definitely plan to use these again in the future!
2,We lost 2 bands at the parks. These didn’t secure them.
5,Work great!! Glad I have them!! Will be using them when we go to Disney World next month!!
5,I purchased these for our Magicbands for Disney.  They worked perfectly!  I had them on the bands for the adults and children.  We loved that we could match the colors to our bands.
5,So far so good only 2 of them glow
5,Came fast and just as described!
5,A must have for Disney magic bands.  They have saved us a number of times.  Just needed some new ones.
5,This were very handy on our Disney vacation especially for the little ones
5,Great way to keep magic bands on little ones. They also add a little splash of color!!
5,We bought both sizes...the small for my new Alta and the larger one for my husbands Charge.  They definitely keep your fitbit from flying off your wrist if for some reason the pronged clasp should come loose.  Very happy with the product.
5,They are snug but I like that so it won't fall off! They are the regular ones and fit the adult and the kids bands. Thank you I'm confident we won't lose our magic bands!
5,It did it’s job of keeping our magig bands on while at Disney world
5,Worked well for Disney. My 6 year old didn’t lose her band this time!
5,Used these for MagicBands at Disney World. They lasted the week-long trip on all 4 of us with no issues!
5,I can't recommend these enough! If you go to Disney and have a Magic Band...you need these! They keep your Band from popping off. Plus the kids love adding the colored pieces onto it. Great product!!!!
5,These are great! I have no more worries of loosing my Fitbit Charge! They are easy to put on the wrist band and stay in place keeping my Fitbit secure on my wrist. Love all the colors too.
3,Shifts up and down the band easily I constantly have to shift it back to where I want it on the band to keep the watch band from shifting. But it does keep the watch from coming unhooked which is a common problem with the fitness watches
5,Life saver for our Magicbands! Would order time and time again. Bright colors. Durable. Worth every penny!
5,I purchased this for my mother who owns a Fitbit. After loosing it twice I did research and discovered beltbit. My mom had been using it and it does great. Don't have to worry about losing that expensive item again.
5,I bought these for our magic bands when we went to Disney and our bands stayed perfectly in place. We even gave some to strangers as we didn't need replacements while at the park :)
5,Worked perfectly on our bands during our recent trip (MagicBand 2).  Very strong and held super tight! Loved the color variety.
5,Looks like it’s gonna work great for Disney bans kids size to
5,These were great for our magic bands.  Worked great and never broke.
5,Excelente for Disney MagicBand
5,I recently bought these for our family trip to Disney. They worked perfectly. Nobody lost their magic band which happened on my last trip. Worth the couple of dollars for security of knowing they worked.
5,Keeps my fitbit secure. I don't have to worry about losing my band. These are inexpensive simple and save me the potential loss of my fitbit flex. I give them away to friends and they last a long time.
5,Works so nicely for magic bands for Disney it’s a must have
5,Must have for the park special with kids!!!!
5,We used these to keep our Magic bands from falling off. They worked great!
5,Unfortunately someone stole the package from my front porch so I cannot review this product :(
5,These were perfect for our Magic Bands for both kids and adults. Life-saver for the little ones.
5,These were great! We used them on our trip to Disney.  They kept our Magic Bands in place :)
3,The concept is good and the product attempts to do what is advertised.  But for me the bands are too narrow and tend to slip off the clasp of my Vivofit. If they were wider I'd give them a 5.
5,These bands secured the Magic bands so they wouldn’t fall off and get lost.
5,We had 11 people in our Disney party and everyone got one. No lost bands and none popped off either.
5,These things are a life saver.  I've used them on my magic band as well as my fit bit.  Definately worth it.
5,all our magic bands stayed in place for Disney thanks to these!!
4,Helped keep little kid Magic Band secure.
5,Just what we needed before our Disney trip.
5,Used these on our magic bands at Disney and it saved losing them more than once.
5,Don’t even notice there on there
5,Excited to use them on my magic bands so my son and sister won't loose theirs. Not to mention a worry free experience thank you so much for the awesome deal.
5,Exactly what I needed for my Disney magic bands. As an added bonus I used one of bitbelts to fix the watch band of an old watch. Nice.
5,Great fit for Disney Magic Bands and the wife has used them for different bands for Fitbit and similar items.
5,Worked easily and as expected to keep our Disney magic bands in place.  It was nice knowing they were more secure with these on and my kids liked choosing their own colors.
5,love them! They're very easy to put on and on the 'soft' side so they aren't uncomfortable to wear. what a great invention to keep your expensive limited edition magic bands secure
5,Great product...used to secure magic bands at Disney World..
5,My friend suggested using these when my fitbit fell off. I love them and would recommend everyone get one since the fit bits are expensive and would be an awful thing to lose.
5,Worked great for my kids!
5,We used these with our Disney Magic Bands. The fit wasn't perfect but of course they weren't designed for Magic Bands. They helped keep our bands on us though even when child sized.
5,These were great for securing our Disney Magic Bands. So happy we had them.
5,We didn't lose any magic bands at WDW and the kids liked these to spice up their bands each day.  I liked that they wern't expensive.
5,This fits ADULT magic bands perfectly!
5,Worked great and had no issues.  Easy to use did not slip colors were good. Would buy again but no reason to as they should last a long time.  Would recommend.
5,Kept our disney bands on and had no issues
5,My family used these on our trip to Disney with 4 children. They did a wonderful job of keeping everyone's  magic bands in place.
5,Perfect fits and keeps our magic bands secure.
5,Kept our Magic bands from falling off. Works like a charm.
5,We're here in Disneyworld and use our Bitbelt safety bands all the time. Really fit well also works fine with a Garmin Vivofit. Great that you can have contrasting colours too.
5,Perfect
4,Came quickly product was as advertised and worked.
4,As described. Wish I had bought before I lost 2 FitBits!
5,The bit belt saved us a few times from the kids losing their magic bands at Disney.  Was very happy with them.
5,Bitbelts are a colorful and fun way to secure the Magic Bands. Love the 3 Glow-n-Dark ones. Hold them to a light and they have a great glow to them!
5,Used these on our magic bands at Disney World.  The first time we had magic bands one almost came off.  This time the bitbelts did the trick!  I had no worries.  Thanks!
3,These didn’t work quite as well as I hoped.
5,Worked great!!! I have been buying these for friends and telling everyone about them.
5,Bought these to hold the Disney Magic bands securely on our wrists. All the tests runs have been excellent.
3,Not a necessity and it felt bulky on my wrist.  I ended up giving them away as I am not rough on the clasp/buckle part of my Fitbit.  Nothing wrong with the item or its description.
3,Bands are ok. The colors are nice. I thought to use them to decorate my Fitbit Charge HR band but it needs to be placed on the double thick part. I will try them on my next Disney magic band.
5,Still in package forgot to use when we were in Disney
5,Bought for disney magic bands. Great buy!
5,Kids loved them for their magicbands.
5,Great product! Did there job for our magicbands and didn't have any issue with them.
4,They do there job.
5,Couldn't be happier with my bitbelts. They have saved me losing my FitBit several times. And I quite like the idea that I can change them to match my outfit.
5,These are highly recommended for Disney Magic Bands. Wonderful
4,Good product
5,Saved all of our magic bands at disney from falling off!
5,Loved the colors and such a great price.  Would definitely order again.  Haven't had my Fitbit come off by accident even once.  Very much recommend.
5,Works great so far!
5,Great price for the multipack.  These are great for keeping my Fitbit secure and I also plan to use them on an upcoming trip to Disney for the MagicBands.
5,Worked very well for magic bands
5,Fixed my band on fitbit
5,Bought for Disney world magic bands. Worked fine.
5,It is easy for the Disney MagicBands to come off when bumped. The Bitbelt held onto our MagicBand and gave us piece of mind.
5,Works perfectly! I shared them with my family who have Fitbits. Now it does not fall off during my very busy and active days. Thanks!
5,This was great at keeping my Fitbit charge secure. I revelry upgraded to the HR and it has a watch clasp but these definitively work.
5,A must have for our magic bands!!
5,Perfect for Disney Magic Bands
5,Yes this product performed as advertised.  We used them on our disney world magic bands. It kept out children from loosing their bands.
5,These worked really well with our magic bands.  They kept them secure on our wrists and fit the bands perfectly.
5,We used these on our Disney bands on our recent trip to Disney world. Fit perfectly and added a sense of security. Great purchase.
5,This was a huge asset for our Disney vacation.  Did a great job keeping our Magic Bands intact.
5,Recommend if you are going to Florida.
5,Perfect safety item for our Walt Disney World trip.  No chance of the magic band unclicking with the bitbelt on!
5,More confident the Fitbit won't fall off again. Dropped the Fitbit into the couch and was only able to find by a free download app.
5,These are great! My niece and I started using these after our Fitbit Charges fell off multiple times. Bitbelt has fixed this problem!
5,my kids loved them
5,Bought for our Disney Magic bands

5,Used on Magic Bands at Disney World - was helpful and comfortable
5,Love the bit belts. I don't have to worry about my fit bit falling off.  It's well worth the price
5,Works well with the Magic Band 2.
5,Good price for a dozen bitbelts. Love the bitbelt because now I don't worry that i will lose my fitbit!
4,Perfect
5,So glad we got these used with our magic bands for Disney.
5,great helpful products
5,Great fit for Disneys MagicBand 2.
5,These saved our bands in Disney World!!
5,Perfect for our magic bands!!
3,used these for my Disney trip last year. they work. our magic bands stayed in place.
1,Unless you like a firm rubber point digging into your skin do not buy these for Magic Band 2.0. You can see clearly from my pictures this item will “wrap” around the magic band but it obviously forces the bitbelt our of shape. This causes the corners to dig into your skin. No way around it. Think they shouldn’t advertise it as a product for Magic Band 2.0.
3,Bought these for Disney bands really hard to use.
5,Had my Fitbit charge fall off five times before I bought these. Nice inexpensive way to save my investment.
5,My friend was very surprised happy excited and pleased with the product.
5,Exactly what I expected
5,These worked perfectly for the Disney Magic Bands.
5,worked great on our disney magic bands-never moved around and we all kept them on 24/7
1,I bought these to use on Magic Bands for Disney World.  I was disappointed in that they weren’t effective to secure the band because they weren’t a tight fit with the Magic Band.  I used a rubber band last year and felt that worked much better.  Several times on the trip the band fell off even with these on.
3,Quarter inch too small to fit on the FitBit charge.Seems like they are made well and a great idea but I can't use them.
3,Nice Product but slow delivery.
5,Worked great and nobody lost their magic bands!
5,Great product.After losing my magic band  on a ride I needed something like this.Works well!
5,Product did just what it was meant to great product at a great price- you won't be disappointed!
5,Product works great! Haven't lost my Fitbit once since using it. Still have 11 left.
5,This Bitbelts were perfect in securing our Disney Magic Bands!  Loved the colors!
5,Very happy with this product works great and good quality for the price love the colors
5,It held our Disney magic band's with no problems.
5,Came early and did the job well on our disney magic bands. No problems.
5,works on adult Disney bands  need to make smaller for children's Disney bands
5,These are really helpful. Last thing you want to do is lose your Disney Magic Band!
5,Perfect for Walt Disney World Magic Bands
5,love this product now I'm back to wearing my FitBit and not afraid of loosing it!!
2,These don't match the colors on the the Magic Bands and they are really a bit too small for them. Also very thin.
3,Larger than I thought not sure it will do the job that it is designed to do.
3,Pretty colors. This set was supposed to fit my Charge fitbit but really are somewhat small on it.
5,Great Quality
2,Received product in a timely manner however there were not 3 glow in the dark pieces only one glow in the dark was included. Purchased for the glow in the dark prices and disappointed that there was only one included. Other than that arrived as expected.
5,Exactly what was needed and in so many colors! I never worry about my Fitbit coming off anymore!
5,Worked great - no one lost a Magic Band during five days at Disney :)
5,Fantastic product!  Keeps my Fitbit Charge on without fear of it falling off randomly somewhere!
5,My fitbit Alta stays in place thanks to these little belts! :)
5,These wired perfectly for the Disney majic bands.
5,Great product I lost 3 Fitbit's before I got Bitbelt the keep your Fitbit secure!!
5,This is a great way to differentiate from different peoples fitbits in the house.
5,These worked great.
5,Great Item works really well and east to use.  Lot's of color choices.
5,worked great never moved
5,Loved it didn't have to worry about losing my band
5,Been using these for months and haven't broken one yet.
5,These work great on the Garmin Connect. Very cute. Love all the colors.
5,Just what I wanted work great!
5,Used for our Disney Magic bands and worked great
5,They fit our magic bands perfectly to secure them without worrying about them snapping open.
2,I found these didn't fit the adult bands well. For the kids though they were great. A little piece of mind that the kiddos wouldn't lose their Magic Bands.
5,Perfect for the fast pass bands at Disney.
5,Great.. just as subscribed.. can't wait to use them on. Our magicbands
5,Product works great; it's fun to change colors to match outfits!
5,These work great.  Love the glow in the dark ones.
5,It kept my magic band on tight. No complaints here!
5,Easy to use and keeps my Fitbit from catching on things.
5,They work!
5,I lost my Fitbit twice before I start using the Bitbelt.
5,Love them. They have saved me from losing my Fitbit.
5,These worked perfectly for adult MagicBands at Disney!
3,Wrong size inside too small for charge bands are for the flex I believe
5,It's bizarre that Fitbit doesn't sell their Charge without one of these included.
5,Great colors and does he job well!
3,didn't really fit.  they were so tight I couldn't get it on.
5,Great product! Really holds my Fitbit Charge band well!

5,Fantastic. Just what we needed for our Disney trip.
5,Worked on magic bands perfectly
5,Worked great. Kids loved them.
5,SUPER FAST>>GREAT PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!
5,Just what I needed.
5,Great!
2,Just didn’t work for my kids
5,These kept our magic bands in place!
5,Kept our bracelets secure!
1,This item was great the first time I purchased it. Recently when I purchased it it arrived very late and we were already gone on our trip and did not get to use it!
5,Fits magic bands perfectly.
5,good product
5,Fits Vivofit3!
5,Fit great.
5,Using on Disney World bands.
5,As described.
5,Very nice
2,Not very easy to use and didn't really do what was needed.
5,Good product
2,Do not fit FitBit are useless to me. Too loose.
5,Great!
1,Don't be fooled! Not sure why but it wasn't a tight fit on our magic bands(regular sized too). This is the kind of purchase that will probably be thrown in my junk drawer bc it's useless but I'm too lazy/busy to mail it back. I'm going to have to use electrical tape to keep the magic bands on.
5,Work as intended
5,Great value!
1,I’m not sure what kind of magic band  these were intended for but they do not fit on the magic band we got from Disney world.
3,They rock
1,They are not as pictured and do not fit the Disney magic bands. They are far too small. Contacted seller they did nothing about it. Don't buy these find another brand. Look at the rest of the recent reviews- seems its a common problem. Skip this seller.
1,The size that was sent does not even almost fit a Disney Magic band. There are two sizes and either the wrong size was sent or this posting does not indicate it is for the smaller size. Will have to find a new purpose for these. Will order the proper size from the original website.
1,Quite a few split as soon as they went on... These were for children's writs too so the bands weren't large at all...
1,DOES NOT FIT DISNEY BAND!!!!!  DO NOT PURCHASE.  TOO SMALL AND HARD TO USE.
1,these did not work and 2 out of my 3 kids lost their arm band
1,The absolutely don't fit magic bands for Disney they don't fit at all way too small they need to take that comment off the website again they do not fit Magic bands
1,Very unhappy with these bought them and they arrived two days before we leave for our trip to Disney and there is no way they will fit on the magic bands
1,They are too loose on my Garmin Vivofit band so I am constantly after to move and asjust them.
1,So much smaller even than the bit belt jr.Bit belt jr will not fit Disney bands this one is 2 times smaller.
1,Too small for Disney magic bands
5,I do not understand the negative review. I am a travel agent and specialize in Disney vacations and I swear by BitBelts. They are the only product I will give to my clients or use myself for my Magic Bands 2.0.  My clients rave about how much they love them and I have peace of mind knowing that no one will lose any of their bands during their stay. I have never had issues with them digging in or bending out of shape. They are very comfortable you dont even feel them.  A matter of fact I think they actually make the magic band better since the BitBelts cover the little nubs that poke through to fasten the bands.  Thank you for such a awesome product!
5,I purchased these for our Walt Disney World trip. We like the variety in colors.  We haven't used them in the park yet but my little one has gotten plenty of wear out of these at home. He has "tried" a few of these out for about a week or so until I finally had to take them away in fear of him loosing them.  These fit our adult magicband2s perfectly snug and tight just as expected. They are a little hard to get them slid down after you close your band but its suppose to be so that it will hold and secure. They are very comfortable on our wrist also. No loosing a magicband this trip :)
5,So I was a little concerned after seeing some of the pictures posted of the bitbelt. I took a shot and bought them for our upcoming trip. I purchased both the bitbelt and the bitbelt jr from the actual website.There was a little confusion at first as to if it would work. I took pictures of my magicband 2 package along with the magicband and bitbelt.See for yourself they work perfectly!! Such a sweet surprise.I have heard great things about them keeping magicbands safe now I am positive they will!
5,I gave this item to my daughter for her family's upcoming Disney vacation.  As a frequent visitor to the park my daughter has used this item before and was glad to get a new set! The variety of colors is really nice and the kids enjoy picking which one they want.
5,We bought these for our trip to Disney World for our Magic bands. They fit perfectly and saved my magic band from coming off a few times. If you make the magic band into a child size magic band this product does not fit.
5,Worked great for my magic band 2.0 the kids loved the different colors. Very affordable and quick service.
5,This sounds amazing! I wish i would've heard about these BEFORE i lost mine!
5,I would highly recommend purchasing these if you're taking a trip to a theme park that uses a removable wristband (such as the MagicBand system). There were several times during my Disney World trip that I looked down and noticed that my MagicBand had come loose but it was still on my arm because the Bitbelt kept it secured.
5,I bought these for our yearly Disney trip and I love having the peace of mind none of my kids are ninjaing out of their bands while running amuck in the magic kingdom! They’re super easy to use coordination is easy color wise and the glow in the dark ones are fun on rides ! Thank youFor peace of mind no lost magic bands!
5,These stay in place if you get the right size. Noone out of the 6 in our group lost their magic bands with these. We even left the extras for others.
5,We use these to secure our Disney Magicbands. No more lost bands!
5,We bought these for our trip to Disney.  The bands helped our Magic bands stay in tact.  This is recommended for children and adults wearing Magic bands.
5,I recommend them to everyone that's going to Disney for their Magic Band.
5,I didn’t have any that glow in the dark it said 2 were in package. Anyways they worked for what i needed it for- for disney magic bands for my family.
5,Amazing product! It saved out magic bands from falling off. Your can’t even tell your wearing it with your band. Do yourself a favor ( and save yourself from replacing your magic band) and don’t go to Disney without these!
5,Bought for a Disney trip next year to use on Magic Bands but broke my Fitbit band adjuster right after they arrived so I used one for it. Fits perfectly and saved me from having to buy a new band.
