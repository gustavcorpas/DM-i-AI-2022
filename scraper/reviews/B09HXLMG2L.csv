5,You can run every single game in 1080p with ultra settings at 60+ fps. The only game i've had some issues with is warzone but it's very likely to be a processor problem because it hits 100% processor usage. If you are thinking on this graphics card to play warzone check some processor configuration on youtube to be sure it's gonna work just fine because with my i7 7700 it runs +60 fps but has a lot of stuttering issues.
5,I honestly think its a lil more powerful than i need! But i was shopping for a new graphics card bc i thought mine was wearing down(it turned out to be an hdmi issue instead. Embarrassing.) Figured if i was gonna need a new one i mind as well upgrade it.
4,Resulta que el precio es uno de los m√°s accesibles en cuanto a rendimiento en juegos se refiere. El chip gr√°fico es excelente para 1080 e incluso para 1440. La presentaci√≥n que hace MSI en cambio deja una impresi√≥n algo ambigua. Si bien la gr√°fica luce muy bien cuando est√° montada en el gabinete la sensaci√≥n de los materiales hace entender el por qu√© del precio. Esto no es culpa de AMD sino de las ensambladoras (MSI PowerColor Gigabyte). Por el rendimiento es un buen precio pero la parte est√©tica deja mucho que desear. Barato no puede significar feo. Otra cosa puede hacer algo de ruido cuando los ventiladores empiezan a funcionar.
4,I use this for my gaming pc. As a college student money is a bit tight but I spent a bit of my college relief fund on one of these. Overall I definitely don't regret it. My only issue is during install windows did not detect it so we had to go into the bios of the computer inform it was there and that allowed us to upload the drivers necessary.
5,I have had it for a month and it has handled everything I have thrown at it. No problems running Saints Row. Drivers were a little troublesome when I was first setting up but now it is stable and running well.
4,This card will run 1080p Maxed settings well over 100 fps in most games and keep power consumption below 100w. 1440p is somewhat do-able in lower demanding titles but I wouldn't expect more than 100fps in most cases unless you turn down a bunch of settings. The card is somewhat noisy in general once the fans go around 50 percent so adjust the fan curve to your liking in the radeon software. I use the RSR/FSR 2.0 to really get the most out of this card and personally it's working out pretty well.However the Rx 6600 line of cards should have only been $250 MSRP at most; with the 6600XT being $280-300 like the previous 5600XT was. The performance improvements are not worth another $50 from what the 5600XT was offering and that card was already a disaster at launch from how AMD scrambled to get that one released. No such case here luckily for someone like me who is not the most proficient pc enthusiast.
5,Bought it a month ago and works perfectly. Very happy with the purchase :)
5,Great Card for the money.  Yes it's not an XT but for the price I have no complaints. Do yourself a favor and look at this you won't be disappointed.
4,Got a free pocket knife with it
4,EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE I HAVE TO RESET BUT OTHERWISE GREAT HARDWARE ANBD SOFTWARE AND PRGRAMS TO DOWNLOAD FROM MSI TO MAKE TUNING EASY. PLAYING GTA 5 OVER 60FPD 4K AND OTHER GREAT TITLES
4,Cumple con lo indicado pero para su segmento esperaba un poco m√°s del ray tracing.Sin embargo para el precio vale la pena completamente.
5,Pros: It was readily available when I wanted to upgrade my 1050ti. It doubles performance on every game I have (except GTA IV it does worse for some reason). Fans are off most of the time unless I‚Äôm playing a newer game maxed out.Cons: It‚Äôs kind of loud when under heavy load and the fans kick into high gear.I paired this with a Ryzen 5 5600g and 32gb 3200mhz ram. Overall I just decided to build my first pc at a time when the graphics card market is in shambles so I can‚Äôt complain too much about price because idk how prices used to be. But for the $60 above msrp I paid it‚Äôs an amazing 1080p60 max settings card. I came from only having consoles for almost 20 years and I play mostly rpgs or racing games so a locked 60fps isn‚Äôt a deal breaker. DOOM BL3 Sekiro Far Cry 4 MGSV Forza Horizon 4 and 5 all run max graphics with no stutters or lag.
5,Cheap low power gpu with great value for performance with a healthy amount of Vram. Get further performance by pairing with a ryzen 3000/5000 series cpu and 500 series AM4 motherboard with gen4 pciex16 gpu slot then enabling Smart access memory üòÄ
5,Ejecuta fluidamente los juegos que tengo instalados (Warzone Prey Far Cry Primal Warframe) a una tasa de FPS superior a la promedio.
5,It's a damn good card for the price when you think about the times we are coming out of.I was tired of gaming on an iGPU and for 320 bucks I just bit the bullet. It serves the 1080p purpose real well and even 1440p 60fps is achievable if you pull those ultra settings down a notch.IMPORTANT: If you're an overclocker don't get this MSI model. It's wattage is limited to the stock 100 watts unlike most other 6600s in the market. I don't mind and if you aren't an overclocking kinda guy you really shouldn't care too much either. It will still let you undervolt and overclock it you just won't be able to make it pull more power which will limit how much you can push it.
5,I was actually really happy with the spike buy caught it on sale make sure you buy a mounting bracket or a stand for it it‚Äôs very heavy.
3,One of my all time favorite games Doom has run on every Nvidia graphics Bd for years. I had just bought the latest version on Steam and has worked great. Since I installed the AMD 6600 Bd every time I launch the game it's starts loading and stops. My computer is locked up and must do a cold reset.  This problem has happened three times. I plugged my HDMI cable into the built in graphics port on my motherboard and it played just fine.
4,Handles modern games well (60 fps from Elden Ring on High setting. 1080p as an example) Can go up to 2k resolution without serious performance issues. Really good card with low power consumption.Fan can be noisy
5,Cumple con lo que dice la grafica llego en buenas condiciones excelente servicio
5,Promedio 100fps en la mayoria de los juegos AAA a 1440p con Ray Tracing y 200fps a 1080p (Ryzen 5600 usando Smart Access Memory con un motherboard B550 y 32 gb de RAM DDR4 3600mhz (4x8)). Permite hacer streaming y grabaciones hasta a 4k fps sin ningun tipo de lag o sobrecarga en el renderizado los ventiladores son configurables via software de Radeon Adrenalin (AMD) en mi caso los uso a un m√°ximo de 70% de velocidad y funciona muy silencioso y a una temperatura promedio de 60¬∞c. Recomendar√≠a? si.
3,I need a better cpu tryna buy me one ?
3,It‚Äôs very good for the buck. I bought it when it was around 279. It performs well. The noise that it produces is not even noticeable. One thing I can critique about this gpu is that that cooling is not that great
4,I got this card because I couldn‚Äôt get any other card and it has worked great. Only downside is that it isn‚Äôt the greatest. In my opinion this is probably one that would be a lot better with a second one in the other PCI express slot. Other than that it has worked for everything I wanted.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                              ¬†Buen√≠simo rendimiento de esta tarjeta he podido jugar varios t√≠tulos en ultra sin ning√∫n problema potencia cercana a una 3050 por si tienen alguna duda con un puerto Pci4.0x16 se puede conectar sin problemas.
5,I can finally play halo infinite on decent settings and not have my gpu roasting. Ez install and going from a radeon to radeon made updates super easy
5,Added performance to my setupLow noise so farWorks well no disappointments
5,MSI DID A AWESOME JOIN WITH THIS AMD CARD & IT RUNS COOL & SILENT.
4,It Destroys what i had in my pc .... but that was a 1050ti lol all jokes aside pricey but i do like it and looks good and stays cool
5,This card rocks! I had a gtx 1650. And boy huge upgrade can finally play most games at 1080p high. One tip though I would definitely get a freesync monitor to pair up with this guy as v sync on amds drivers don't work on most games and in game v sync is not always the best compared to driver level.
5,Excelente grafica el disipador es muy bueno los ventiladores hacen un poco de ruido pero nada grave esteticamente se ve muy bien en el case he corrido estos juegos en 1080p 60fps en su maxima calidad: Elden Ring  God of war Doom Eternal Fifa 22. Su maxima temperatura fue de 62 grados centigrados.
5,For the price it's pretty good got one almost at MSRP (cheaper than a RTX 3050 and with better performance); it's nice and cool so it doesn't make much noise.
5,Excelente producto me encant√≥ esta 10 de 10.
5,Me ha sorprendido el bajo consumo y temperatura... Rinde pr√°cticamente el doble que mi anterior rx570 consumiendo menos...
5,Para quienes quieran comprar desde chile. Dec√≠a que se iba a demorar 14 d√≠as y lleg√≥ al d√≠a 8. Todo impeque
5,Best cooling / performance. I'm between asus gigabyte and msi but performances on the internet showed that msi was better
5,Llego en buen estado y funciona muy bien! Solo falta un tornillo para anclarlo a la parte posterior de la torre.
5,Easy to install graphics are just like what you paid for been having fun with it and not a single problem since installing thank you.
2,The box was not sealed and the sealed sticker of the plastic bag has been removed I took a look at the slot contact and it seems that it has been used or tested before.I already installed it and it seems it works just fine.
5,Gaming awesome graphics very happy
5,
5,Well worth the buy I have no issues playing farcry 6 at high levels with no lag.
2,This product does not work normally with gigabyte motherboards. Know this and get it. This is talked about all over the internet. Pc not shutting down normally. It starts after 3 sec when shutting down
1,It does play games OK BUT it does not do HDR on my TV which is why I bought it over Nvidia (that and the cost of NVidia) now I am now spending 200 more dollars for a similar slightly better video card from Nvidia and returning this card. (you would think ATI would fix this major defect or oversight) even my old Nvidia 1050 did HDR so I know it is not my new 2000$ TV set from Sony shame on you ATI. I do not think I will ever buy ATI again.
2,I have MSI MAG B550 TOMAHAWK and After using adrenaline to install(factory reset) it completely stops work cant even go into bios just says Input not supported.
1,I received a used and battered looking product. Open box degraded packaging poorly taped. The internal anti-static packaging was crumpled as if having been taken out of the box and then hastily packed back in. There is nothing about the product description that discloses that this product is supposed to used but the appearance of the product gives every indication that it was.
1,the rx6600 is excellent to play games at 1920x1080 unfortunately this video card stopped working after 1 week of use. ill look for the same chip (rx6600) just a different brand on my next purchase.
1,Bad drivers
4,The RX 6600 provides great value for gaming but this MSI Mech is locked at only 100W whereas most others allow +20% for a total PPT of 120W. I was very disappointed when I discovered this. Thankfully there is More Power Tool which allowed me to raise the power level. I was able to go from ~8300 in Timespy to ~9200 GPU score. Overall I'm very satisfied with this GPU and deducted a star for the low power level.
5,Si rendimiento es incre√≠ble muy buenas prestaciones para el precio que tiene y pr√°cticamente nunca sube de los 60 grados en consumo de 100%
5,espectacular corre sin problemas todos los juegos que tengo una verdadera maquina
5,Bought this card and paired with an AMD 5600X.  Getting well over 60FPS in 1080p on titles like Elden Ring.  Will run older games with zero issues.Great value for the money; card does seem to have some coil whine at times which is a little annoying in my Corsair case that has a lot of openings and the fans are mostly silent.
5,Very like
5,Excelente tarjeta de video perfecta para personas Gamer
5,La use con un Ryzen 5 5600G me habilit√≥ modos que antes no podia usar y en cuanto a los juegos queda perfecta para jugar a m√°s resoluci√≥n y calidad visual por encima de los 1080p

5,La √∫nica observaci√≥n es que la caja llego con un golpe pero nada grave. Hasta el momento la tarjeta ha trabajado como es debido no tuve ning√∫n problema con ella. Tiene un buen desempe√±o y es muy fresca justo lo que esperaba.
5,El rendimiento es muy bueno. Lo uso junto a un ryzen 5600x a resoluci√≥n 1080p y siempre est√° arriba de 60 fps. Solo hay que tener precauci√≥n al momento de instalar los drivers hay que desinstalar completamente los drivers anteriores para que no afecte su funcionamiento correcto.
5,La compr√© inicialmente para gaming ahora edito y en apoya en algunos plugings
5,Para m√≠ era lo que buscaba te da un rendimiento bueno en gr√°ficos altos para 1080p y en ultra depende del juego
4,Sirve para lo que la ocupo aun que me hubiera gustado que se hubiera mandado en caja me llego enbolsada.
5,Corre witcher mejor que cualquiera y se ve muy bien
5,La instale junto con un procesador Core i5 12400F y 16GB de RAM y todo va a la perfecci√≥n la he probado con Forza Horizon 5 y lo ejecuta con total suavidad a mas de 100 FPS sin ning√∫n tipo de lag o retraso con la calidad en Alta. Es una tarjeta de gama media pero puede ejecutar cualquier juego a 1080 sin ning√∫n problema incluso con cierto grado de ray tracing para 4K es necesario subir en el escalon de los modelos de estas tarjetas pero para mi que solo quiero jugar lo que sea sin problemas de requisitos es una excelente eleccion.
5,Tengo un procesador 4650g desde el 2020 la gr√°fica complementa muy bien a mi procesador y me corre pr√°cticamente cualquier juego sin problema alguno.
4,Good performance for 1080p efficient somewhat decently priced no real ray traycing possibilities a bit loud
5,Es excelente el desempe√±o mejora mucho los gr√°ficos y no se sobrecalienta.
5,This is the most card come with all these futures its very stable on 1080p ultra even 2k and 4k will be playable because of the 8gb VRAM and the good mass and value with this qulty glad that I found this card in good price people trying hard to find like this one I am lucky that I got the card in good price I am still sad for graphics card prices goes crazy last 2 years even today the prices are crazy as I know companys and some fewer people use them to make btc and more to do for hash rate HTs  I think its more and more powerful than rtx 3050 this is true go check techpowerup gpus score you will see and check compares in youtube but its not the rx 6600 XT version its just the RX 6600 AMD did realy well in this card but could have bad driver hope AMD will keep optimzing it in the drivers some games have drop frame sometimes and even fewer bugs but what I can say that is that is very normal because of the look and its new Card so propley clear that will happen every thing in performance is great for gaming and smooth performance I wish all graphices card go to normal price it worked just great on my system with the B450 pro wifi gigbyte and ryzen 7 2700x I reccomend to buy this card and do not worry about driver side AMD have more to fix to make it more stable card but even its new its the stone card!
5,Tiene una buena estetica es una compra recomendada si lo que buscas es algo que rinda y a un menor precio que la RTX 3060 si bien el trazado de rayos no es su fuerte la esperiencia estandar que da es grandiosa en 1080p
1,Para un cliente pero sali√≥ defectuosa
5,El desempe√±o de esta tarjeta de video junto con el procesador Ryzen 5 es una maravilla
5,Es una buena tarjeta para cualquier juego en 1080
3,It does an ok job.  The GPU crisis meant that i had to buy this at 1100 dollars as my old GPU died.  The graphics are marginally better than a 2060ti.  But in all honesty wait until prices come down as this GPU really should only cost 500 dollars.
5,I purchased this to replace a five-year-old GTX 1060 and honestly AMD wasn't my first choice but with current pricing the RX6600 seemed like the best available value for something that offered a significant performance uplift from my prior card.It handily outperforms a RTX3050 and for less money.This MSI card has been very good so far gives 60+ fps at 1080p in most of the titles I've tried at max settings (barring MS Flight Simulator). A bit less plastic (i.e: in the backplate) might be nice but overall the build quality seems good.With utilization at 100% the fans kick up to about 2000 RPM and become audible but I haven't found it to be intrusive (and it's not noticeable when I have AC on). I think this is probably something that could be addressed by tweaking the fan curves a little something I haven't done. But the hottest I've seen the card get is 61C and GPU hotspot temps tend to run about 10-12 degrees higher so there's some headroom to let it run warmer probably.
5,Le minage de cryptos
5,muy buena grafica para una pcerda
