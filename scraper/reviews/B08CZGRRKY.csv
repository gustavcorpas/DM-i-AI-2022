4,This bag was definitely designed for photographers in mind.  There are plenty of little pouches and zippered compartments to carry all the extras like batteries chargers cards lens wipes etc and there is good space for taking a fair amount of lenses with you.  The section for the camera body will fit a mirrorless much better than a larger DSLR.I carry around the 14-24 24-70 and maybe a prime in the main section and put the 70-200 in the lower section as it won't really fit on the camera.  And that brings me to the one downside.  The adjustable sections which are held with velcro don't really hold.  It doesn't take long for the velcro to give way when you're putting your camera in the bag and it's just not the secure fit I'd want.  I don't need expensive lenses banging into each other.  So that's the downside.  I also notice the zipper catches sometimes and leads me to think that's going to be an issue one day.It's built well for the money it's a good bag but if you need "The best" bag this isn't it.  But for what it is this looks good it's easy to carry it carries a lot there's a good amount of space and room for the extras.
5,I really like this camera backpack! It has plenty of features that work well for me (a novice photographer). I use it casually when I go on hikes and want to have my camera with for a quick picture. I like that it can hold my tripod water bottles on the sides and all my lenses. I also got it so I can bring it on a flight with me as a carry on backpack. I unfortunately broke one of the clips in the car door. However I asked if they can get the clips to me separately and the company sent me a box with like 6 or 7 of them. I wish the clips were easier to replace but overall I was able to do it. Great durable product and great customer service! Oh I also like that it has a whistle in case I want to say hi to nature. And the extra fanny pack camera bag is very useful.
5,I needed a larger Camera Pack than most backpacks made for this purpose. They are fine for short trips but I'm often way out in the woods filming expeditions and I need more than just my camera gear with me; Trail gear like bear spray emergency medical kit including allergy meds for sudden hay fever and wasp stings emergency preparedness tools and equipment water bottle and rain cover gear for me and my camera equipment. And since the weather changes suddenly in the mountains - a light weight jacket. This pack has lots of room for all I need to take with me.It even has options for attaching a small tent and tightly rolled sleeping bag but I'm not sure I would use it for long overnight hiking camping and filming trips. If you do use it for that - let me know how it works.I like that it comes with a smaller "Fanny Pack" that I can use for short trips not too far away from camp. The fanny pack fits nicely into the lower compartment but I removed it to make room for my hiking gear night vision camera and lights. Personally fanny packs don't work for me as they bounce as I walk and restrict my movement when kneeling for the low shots.The Tarion Pro 2 is sturdy and well made. When I take it off to access another camera - it stands up on it's base without falling over like regular backpacks - love it. It also has the ability to strap two tripods - one on each side although I just take one and use the other side pocket for my water bottle. The interior dividers use velcro and work well making it completely customizable. It comes set up for a DSLR and lenses but I use camcorders mostly and was able to customize it for my needs.It is definitely heavier than a regular backpack that you would use for school but it is well padded to help protect your gear from damage and it is comfortable to wear; has strap support over stomach and chest for support.I really like this pack.Artist & Filmmaker: Marshall White
4,The bag itself is pretty roomy.  I was able to get my Canon EOS  and Canon GH50  in the backpack plus the gear that goes with it.  The improvement could be on the side of the back for securing an external Lens Bag.  I bought a new bag for my 600mm Sigma lens that had better options to attach to a backpack.I did get it awkwardly attached.  Overall I would recommend this bag.
4,It's got compartments for your compartments! Took it on a hike recently and had everything easily accessible when it was time to take photos. Good stuff!Update: took the bag as my personal item for a trip and upon arriving to the hotel the entire zipped compartment for the laptop zipped open and my laptop fell and broke.The zipper part for the laptop goes all the way down one side so the weight from the bag will naturally pull it open if not zipped perfectly. Poor design in that aspectSolution: stick a pin on the otherside where the zipper would slide down.
5,Nice bag but I had to return it because it wouldn't work for my needs.
5,Is a great bag wow perfect love every aspect  lots of room nice padding gear is secure  great balance with load  built extremely well  zippers very nice
5,I needed more for my cameras but I think I may have to get the next size up if I add more to my bag but I do love it the size now works with what I have.
5,This was a great purchase for all my camera stuff...the camera side pocket is nice for easy access and there is plenty of storage space for lenses and other stuff...and everything is adjustable to fit different sized lenses
4,I've been using this backpack for a few weeks now as a replacement to my camera bag. I travel and make videos for YouTube and so I need a backpack that can hold a lot of equipment without getting messy. You're going to need to take out all the velcro dividers and really make it your own but I love that you can.I carry a Panasonic G7 hooked up to a Ronin SC gimbal Osmo 4 Phone Gimbal 3 Apurture LED lights with small tripods a couple of microphones two extra lenses a DJI Mini 2 drone and a monopod for the main gimbal or anything else that needs it. Oh and a full size Manfrotto tripod. And a 14" ultrabook. And chargers cleaning supplies extra batteries and a dozen cables.All of that fits in there. If I unbalance the main gimbal and collapse it down as much as possible I can put the tripod in the side pocket and use the strap to hold it in place. If I don't need the tripod I put the gimbal in that position to avoid having to balance it every time.It's also quite comfy! So if it holds everything and is easy to customize and feels great why 4 stars?I'm worried about build quality and how long it'll last. The orange pull tabs on the zippers for example. You would THINK they're just rubber sleeves over a cord because that sure is what it looks like but nope. They seem to just be glued on to the ends of the cords. I would have rather just had a cord that loops around. I yanked a little too hard the other day and the orange part popped right off.Out of the box the main zipper was not properly installed. It's got a little hitch which means it doesn't completely close (a hole about the size of your pinky stays there) and I can't slide both pulls to the other side since neither one can clear that gap. It's not a big deal but it's a little inconvenient since the pull tab ends up stuck under the gimbal a lot.I hope it holds up because I genuinely love this backpack and I think it's a great deal. I can be fully set up in less than 5 minutes thanks to this bag and I can have my hands free at all times. I just hope they improve QC going forward and put in that little extra effort to make things last longer.
5,I do wish it had some additional smaller pockets but so far it’s been great. Lots of room!
5,Solidly built bag and I am really happy with the amount of space it has. I am able to use it for short trips as well as bringing my photography gear.
4,Just received mine yesterday began placing the dividers and positioning my equipment last night. Seems a bit more compact(which isn't bad for my 40R frame) then I'd expected. Great looking bag I'll take it out for a test later this afternoon!
5,The bag is well made and is of great quality. I do suggest to improve the main handle. It is very thin for all the capability of weight it handles. It has held up to this day and I can’t conclude without testing on the long run. What I do know is that this is the main grip to put on your backpack and it will be under stress every single time you use it. All in all very happy with the quality and build of the product.PS. I submitted 2 pics to show the difference of another brand comparing the handles. My old backpack never broke and with the quality of this one I’m hoping it never does. I’m just suggesting because this backpack is bigger with way more pockets and storage than my old one.
4,UPDATE Aug. 2022: The laptop zipper ripped out after 2 years' use which may have been my fault for not using enough care when closing it when the compartment was pretty full. Unable to get it repaired I was shopping for a new pack and found the Endurax Extra Large Camera Backpack here on Amazon which is nearly identical to the Tarion with a pocket switched around and different colors. They are the EXACT SAME SIZE despite Endurax measurements' being stated as larger. Looks like it came from the same factory down to the shoulder straps and plastic connectors and zipper hardware. Check that one if you're shopping these. Unfortunately it has the same crappy water bottle holders only with elastic vs. a draw string on the Tarion. No better at holding water bottles. (End update). There are many reviews here explaining how great this pack is and overall I agree. It goes in a completely different direction than a Lowe Pro pack I own and the design is very interesting. I needed a bit more space for extra clothing/food/emergency gear in addition to a camera three lenses tripod iPad + accessories and this pack pretty well fits the bill. I especially like the top hatch for quick camera access with the lower section for less-often-needed items. There may be TOO many pockets on this pack but I can live with that!Where it could be improved: The water bottle pockets are too short and limited in diameter by a non-stretchy top string enclosure. As a reference a 1-quart standard Nalgene bottle will just BARELY fit into the pocket and sticks out more than halfway as the base of the pocket is not as large as the top due to the tapered bottom part. The bottle will probably stay in there but just barely. There would have been room for the pockets to be taller along the side (and wider too) so this oversight is puzzling. If the pockets were larger diameter and "stretchy" they could optionally accommodate tripod legs as on other backpacks I've owned.Another issue: This pack has a tripod "foot" on one side which is a great feature but when in use the foot extends below the bottom of the pack meaning the pack will may no longer sit squarely upright on the ground. The ability of a pack to sit securely upright on the ground is nice and not all camera packs will do so.I do intend to use this pack going forward and will report any breakdowns or issues if I encounter them.
4,This camera bag is spacious and adjustable. The exterior is made with quality material the interior is very soft and will not damage the camera. It is large enough to carry 2 cameras flash (x2) 5-6 lenses and other accessories.
5,It’s big enough to fit all my equipment! I like the waterproof cover too!
5,I had been in need of a good "large" camera backpack for some time. My wife has used a Tarion M-02 Canvas Camera Backpack for some time and had encouraged me to get one. After trying to pack my gear into hers I realized it just wouldn't work for me. The one thing I had admired about her backpack was the quality of the backpack. Based on this I looked at the other Tarion camera backpacks and the PB-01 caught my eye. It looked large enough to carry multiple camera bodies and lenses along with other accessories. I also wanted a bag large enough to keep my gear all in one place even when stored at home. The item was as described and exceeded my expectations.  Not only will it go into the field with me but it meets my desire to keep all my gear together in one spot at all times. So you can get an idea of how large this backpack is I will list what I have in it.Top compartment: Nikon D500 and D7200 bodies with grips  Signma 150-500mm lens  Strike Finder - lightning trigger  Battery charger  Inside pouch:  3 - 72mm filters in case  3 - 86mm filters in caseTop Outside compartment: Cleaning suppliesOutside hardshell compartment: Pen  1.4 Teleconverter  2 Wireless shutter remotes  Spare battery (Camera)  Spare battery (trigger)  Spare batteries (flash unit)  2 - spare SD Cards  Tripod wrenchesBottom Compartment: 30mm 1.8 lens  50mm 1.8 lens  18-140mm 3.5-5.6 lens  70-200mm 2.8 lens  70-300mm 4.4-5.6 lens  Flash unit  Backpack rain cover  Two square filter mounts  Four lens adaptors for Filter mounts  Six square ND filters in case  Two spare SD CardsThere's tripod storage capability on the outside on either side large holders on each side perfect for a water bottle and two compartments on the "belt" suitable for extra batteries and SD cards.The bag is very well made and adjustable to help you find the best position for wearing when out and about.In addition it comes with a smaller camera bag with a belt and shoulder strap suitable to carry a camera or a few lenses in for a quick out and about where you don't want to carry the bigger backpack.
5,I cannot believe how functional well-made and large this camera backpack is. It fits my mirrorless camera with attached zoom lens 4 other lenses all my astrophotography equipment large off camera flash Anker power bank camera battery charger a spare Anker wall charger two Litra cube lights with accessories a flashlight and my GoPro. On each side I can attach my tripod and on the other I can attach my monopod. However it looks like there is enough room to store my monopod on the same side as my tripod and have the other side just to carry a water bottle. The only thing I couldn't fit into the bag was my Kase 100mm x 150mm filter bag but I can attach it to the outside of the backpack. I also like that I can carry a jacket on the outside of the backpack and that it comes with a full rain cover.Granted the backpack probably weighs a ton at the moment but it can store all my camera equipment until I go out into the field and just carry what is essential for that day in my f backpack. As for the smaller bag I am storing all my vlogging equipment such as wireless Lavalier mics and a spare LED panel light and accessories. Previously I had to have 3 separate camera bags . . . One to store my mirrorless with spare lenses and flash one for vlogging equipment and another for my star tracking equipment. This is a great bag if I go to a field photography workshop with just the lenses and equipment I need and the smaller bag I could use for a quick weekend trip away. By far this is the best camera backpack I own and I have tested out a number of backpacks over the past 20+ years being an amateur photographer.
5,a huge upgrade for me! I recently purchased a couple more lens for my collection and yeah... this bag does the trick. it hold all my lens including the Sigma 105mm 1.4 DN Art lens. Anyone who knows what I'm talking about knows how difficult it is to find a bag that can fit this lens and more. It even holds my Ipad 12.9 pro. Great bag and totally worth the price!
5,There are two camera storage compartments with a divider. I took out the divider to acomidate my 150-600mm lens and it works great and hold all my other lenses as well. Tried a few bags decided on the one and I like it alot.. go for it.
5,This bag holds both my cameras and essentials in one bag.  I love it!  I also love the easy access side pocket so i can get my main camera in and out easily witout opening the entire bag.
4,Muy buen producto buena calidad y suficiente espacio talvez un par de bolsas mas en los laterales no estarian de más por lo demas muy bonito y buen producto
5,I found this photo backpack just what I needed and wanted. Plenty of room for most items you need to take on a photo outing.  Room for two cameras and six lenes and accessories.  A side door is available for fast access to your camera whether it be a full frame or a Point & Shoot.  It rides well depending on how much weight you have loaded.  Quality built and I think you will like it.
4,This backpack has allowed me to now carry all of my camera gear without shoulder strain. Highly recommend it.
5,Sturdy backpack well padded and easy to customize for two cameras and several lenses.
5,I’ve damaged gear from not having a gear bag. Trust me it’s worth the buy. Has great amount of space. I have my film and photo camera with lenses and still room and pockets free! It’s sturdy and no worries about anything flying out. Feels amazing having a great gear bag
4,One concern I had was will this fit under the seat in a small plane which we have to use from our small city.  I did not want to have it gate checked with all my camera equipment so I took this backpack on a trip with no camera equipment as a test.  The backpack DOES fit under the seat in a small plane.  Will have to tuck it  width wise so that nothing extends beyond the back of the seat.  If tucked under length wise it does extend out a few inches but still should be okay (cannot tuck your feet under the chair).  The backpack is well made and has a lot of storage locations.  My only recommendation would be to have more pockets in the included small bag as there are only 2 slots for memory cards.Backpack:  Tarion Pro Large Back PackPlane:  CRJ900 CanadianAir Regional Jet
5,I've been using my bag for a couple of months and have taken it on a few trips.  No complaints at all about the quality of the bag.  It has a ton of space and the adjustable configuration makes it easy to tailor the bag to your needs.  My only complaint is in the general design.  You can use either the top or bottom compartment as your primary camera compartment but it's obvious the top is intended to hold most of your gear.  If you have your gear in the top the bag tends to be very top heavy.  The bottom has the easy access side compartment but has much less space.  My recommendation to the manufacturer is to switch them...move the divider up and enlarge the front access and storage space in the bottom compartment.
5,This camera bag comes with 2 dividers a strap and a belt to tie onto the waist. It can be used in 3 different ways like waist bag messenger bag or hand bag. The belt helps to keep the camera bag on the waist so that it doesn't need to be set down on the floor to get to the camera. It is adjustable and the bag opens away from me so it is facing me. It has tiny velcro pockets inside on the flap of the bag for SD cards and such. The dividers stick to the walls inside of the camera bag. This will most likely damage the walls over time. The dividers give each camera items their own slots. The camera bag is very very thick. The outside is more like water resistant material than water proof. If wet too much and for too long it starts to soak into the bag. The anti-dust is good. It can't be protected from all types and sizes of dust particles. I see lint on it sometimes. The anti scratch is definitely ANTI scratch so far. The handle on the outside is cushioned that makes holding the bag comfortable. The strap is very long and adjustable. The bottom is non slip. Not sure how long the zippers with the string attached to it will last. The camera bag is great but I would've liked there to be pockets on the outside for other items considering the thickness of the bag at least. The 2 tiny pockets on the inside didn't do much for me... But the bag overall is good for smaller camera items to be carried along with a smaller camera. Thank you.
2,Looks good on the outside but you will quickly discover that this is a bunch of half thought out features made to it look like you got your money's worth. In reality you end up using half of them because the other half are poorly designed and are not practical. But first the good stuff I guess.THE GOOD:The materials used on the outside of the bag seem to be of higher quality. The nylons are thick and durable and seem like they would be able to hold up over time. The inside materials? Eh. More on that laterThe back pads and shoulder pads have excellent cushion and this bag has a chest strap for connecting the two shoulder straps. This was a must-have for me as this strap takes the weight of the bag off the front of your shoulders. Not having this strap pulls your shoulders back and becomes very painful and uncomfortable when hiking.THE BAD:The zippered flap in the top compartment that's meant to store an iPad (according to the product pictures) is just an annoyance and here's why. This particular pocket has no way of securing its contents. There is no zipper to enclose the contents. There isn't even elastic. It's just open all the time. So this means when you unzip the side zippers and flip the pocket forward to access your camera gear which is an issue all on its own whatever is in there will fall out. Stupid.The tripod straps are maddening. They use the old fashioned ladder lock buckles instead of pinch buckles that are much easier to use. The ladder lock buckles force you to feed the tripod legs down through the loop where the tripod leg clamps ALWAYS get hung up on the strap. Then once it's in place you then have to grab onto the tiny plastic buckle and fight to tighten it. Then repeat this process over and over each time you use your tripod. These buckles should be banished from earth. What's maddening is they use pinch buckles on other parts of the bag anyway! Why not just use this clip for the tripod?! I don't get it.The hard shell compartment is almost useless. It's too low profile to practically store anything in it. They added it because it looks cool.The dividers are cheap and flimsy. The weight of your gear will likely cause them to bend and collapse especially my camera which his big and heavy. Secondly the velcro is weak and doesn't hold up against weight. The velcro dividers can be pulled apart quite easily. The dividers should be more rigid and the velcro needs to be stronger.Unfortunately I am going to return this. The cons outweigh the pros
3,I was hopeful spending a little more money would yeild a better bag for the most part I am right the outside is rugged and durable there is a good amount of storage (I managed to max it out with 3 bodies 5 lenes two being longer zoom lenes filters cards etc) the negatives are the inner fabric is less durable I have a 6in rip after my third outing (last photo) one minor issue I have is for some reason the added the battery storage to the quick access flap witch sits right against my lcd really afraid a minor bump could smash my lcd it's still a decent bag I'm not going to go spend twice the price to get a lowepro bag (I initially wanted)
5,I was worried about this bag initially after reading several reviews but after taking a chance on it it's great. Lots of good storage space and useful dividers. Some of the smaller pockets could be better divided but it's fine for how I use it.
4,A very good buy for fpv drone flyers!Heres a breakdown of what it holds-1 fatshark attitude v6 (with shark byte)-2 goggle batteries-bolt kit-speedy bee flasher-8 pairs of props- 5 antennas-RDQ tool kit-full soldering set up. Rossin solder solder iron brass sponge-10 spare arms-1 ev800d (removed lens only screen)-1 ev800d chargerAnd theres still a little bit more space for a few more things.The only reason i have this a 4/5 is because i only just received the bag today and time will tell how durable the bag is.
5,Super fantastic bag!! It is durable under hard daily use for a month with zero issues. Plenty of space and fantastic price. I use the bottom compartment for an a6000 body 18-55 lens 55-210 A mount 100-300  lens A to E mount lens adapter 55mm FE - G a water filter camp stove and fuel. The upper compartment holds clothes food mess/cooking kit. The outer top compartment holds cables batteries lens filter and other quick access small stuff. The lower pocket holds pens a small notebook hard drive various paperwork SD cards a sport thingy and a pocket knife. On the right side is a Manfrotto tripod and 18" machete w/ sheath on the left is a tent (if needed) both strapped down and in a mesh pouch. The laptop pocket holds a Microsoft Surface pro tablet with case. A sleeping bag (if needed) is strapped to the bottom or hung from the top. The small bag that comes with this kit is filled with a first aid kit toiletries/hygiene items. I still have room in both bags but not much. It's a great bag!!!
2,So this is going to be one of those I really wanted to like this reviews.  aaannnnd I really wanted to like this I just can't.  It feels way cheap the Velcro dividers have very little holding power; I can't see how they will stand the weight of quality gear internally the stitching and finish work is subpar the zippers are not great the fit leaves something to be desired; when the torso length is properly adjusted with the load lifters at a 45 degree angle the waist belt rides around your stomach.  This is definitely a BUDGET backpack but the thing is....it's only $45.00 cheaper than a same size in liter Lowepro so for what you get it's not a budget price.  If you have the gear to fill this then it's probably an expensive combination of gear I wouldn't put it in this...get something quality to put quality gear in.  I'm shocked at so many reviews touting this as a quality build because its just not.  If you have ever handled a quality backpack then you'll know that this is just not and you'll notice the minute you pick it up.  If this thing were $50.00 then I would say there's a market for it a budget backpack at a budget price.  But it's almost as expensive as a quality Lowepro Tactic 450 save another $45.00 and get something that won't fail you. If this thing were the same quality and price as the LowePro then I would probably choose it as I really like the layout of this.  Step up the quality even if it means a price increase and I would be a buyer or lower the price drastically and I would still return it because I have no use for a pack that will fail....but I think a lower price point is deserved.
5,I just love this bag.  It looks great...but more importantly its capacity is outstanding.  I was able to get my camera extra lenses various peripheral equipment like extra batteries charger cables filters etc.  Including my 15 inch laptp my ipad and my Ronin RS 2 Gimbal with all its assorted parts.  Took it across country on airline fit perfectly in the overhead.  Was just exactly what I was looking for.
5,Arrived quickly and undamaged. First off it's new and I haven't had a chance to put it through any trips or excursions so at best this write up is only on first glance of the Tarion Pro bag.  It's a big bag and about the largest you can get to carry-on an airline in fact it may be too big for some of the smaller aircraft to put in the overhead.  The amount of flexibility on first look is overwhelming lots of compartments pockets and zippered areas to become familiar.  If that's all you are looking for it gets better.  Many of the compartments are sectioned off with Velcro dividers so you can tailor them to your equipment.  So on first look it's big has many compartments and many of them are adjustable for your needs.  The quality looks good and I would expect it to last a good long while but will have to reserve statements on longevity until I've used it a bit.  I give it 5 stars on room and flexibility only actual quality TBD but looks good.
4,It's not the fault of the bag but it's almost too big for how I use it.  I like to carry my dslr with me everywhere on vacation and I wanted a bag with a little extra room to carry some added daily essentials.  This us just so big the that I found myself making excuses not to bring it.  As a carry on bag it will fit in the overhead but not under the seat.It is sturdy well made bag with lots of storage....just like it's says so I won't hammer the bag on my decision to get it.  Just wish I went with the smaller version.
4,So this bag is actually smaller than I thought. I had purchased the TARION XH prior and really liked the bag but There were no outside bags meaning i had to open up them main compartment for everything wether an sd card cable or gimbal. Now the comfortability for the XH is amazing the straps feel great on shoulders. Received this one a few days ago and was able to fit everything and a little more than the XH. I love the way you have outside pockets for small storage. BUT the shoulder straps do not feel as comfortable not enough padding on them and while with the other bag I could walk around with it without issues with this TARION PRO the quicker i can get it off the better. Im thinking of returning it for that same reason. Other than that its not a bad back. But at the end of the day and backpack that you cant stand on your back is not ideal.
5,Let me begin by saying this bag is more than I expected but in a great way! I'd researched videos pictures and reviews on many bags before finally settling on this one. Let's just say there's no "settling" involved. It's exactly what I needed!WHAT I HAVE INSIDE:- Canon 6D Mk II w/ battery grip- Canon 70D- Canon 10-18mm lens- Canon 17-40mm lens- Canon 18-55mm lens- Canon 55-250mm lens- Canon 50mm lens- Tamron 150-600 G2 lens- External flash- Multiple filters- Multiple SD cards- Multiple batteries- Battery charger- Rainfly- Lens cleaning kit- Remote shutter- Business cards- Pens- Full size tripod- Small tripod- 15.6" screen full size laptopPROS:- Very large spaces in each compartment- Sturdy build- Strong back hip and shoulder support- Included rain fly- Extra travel bag includedCONS:- It might be a bit large on shorter people- Even with the tellest setting (on the shoulder strap height adjuster) the hip pads are at my bellybutton. I'm 6'3" and it's a tad too short for me. Better than nothing but not quite the correct placement for hip support for someone my height.
5,I'm a full time working editorial photographer and this bag surprised me in every possible way. The build quality is excellent but what really stands out is the innovative design when compared to offerings from your typical brands. The size appears much smaller but it can easily hold an ungripped A7iii 70-200GM Tamron 28-75 and even squeeze in the large 16-35gm or a series of primes such as the 55 35 50 85 or 90 easily while still having room to spare for smaller devices such as Gopros a zv-1 or even a Fuji X100V. The other pockets can safely hold memory cards an Ipad pro 12"  batteries and the pocket easily holds a befree tripod securely. What's great about this backpack is while I can pack it to the brim for more involved shoots I can also easily pack down and make it an everyday carry due to the looks fit and size. Overall I highly recommend this backpack if you're looking for an everyday driver that could also convert itself into a full gear bag when needed.
5,Best bag ever! I’d been looking for years and nothing worked for me. I travel a lot and don’t like unpacking and packing what I can fit. This bag lets me pack everything I could ever want. When fully loaded the bag is heavy and can carry the weight well with all the reinforcement they have carefully added. Easily accessible to all pockets with the unique zipper handles. All zipper work very nice as well. One of the best things about this bag is that it stands up!!! I’m tired of constantly wrestling my bag and leaning it up against something. This bag will stand straight up while accessing equipment and changing lenses…etc. also I can easily fit my 14”x9.5” laptop in the laptop pocket without having to cram it in and struggle to take it out. I’d buy it again when I need to replace this one but it is holding up very well.
4,Well built resistant but smaller than it looks in picture. Not for videographers willing to carry Instruments like lights batteries chargers wireless microphone systems lenses drone and cables all together. Perfect to carry basic tools. If you can put in another bag extension cords drone etc it’s a good choice. If you think to use it to carry all your equipment at once this has not enough room.
5,Nicely made I put a small cooler on top to put a few water bottles and ice packs. Love it…
5,Almost perfect all around photo pack!I was able to fit my DSLR with jet lens attached and had 5 more slots to lenses. There is space to fit a 9.7 iPad on the top modular compartment but wouldn’t trust it for travel. It was also a bit tight and might risk a broken tablet. That same space would work perfect for an iPad mini.Those smaller compartments on the outer shell were a fair size just wish for a bit more space on those areas as well.The bottom modular compartment came packed with the shoulder bad. I took out the shoulder bag and am using it for another camera set. The space in that compartment fit a Mavic 2 Pro carrying case perfectly.My 13 inch MacBook Pro fit a littler snug wish it had a littler more slack but the Mac is an older (fatter) modelThere is a really tight compartment at the base of The bag with a small pouch the slides out. I used that space to store the rain cover.Overall I think the bag is the Swiss Army Knife of camera bags that will let you carry all you need and have a bit more space for a little more.
5,This is not just a "camera bag." Whenever I travel I have to carry a separate laptop bag a bag for my cpap plus other stuff (e.g. jacket medicine). Now I can carry one bag as a carryon that holds all my important items. It will also slip over the handle of my rolling suitcase. Hiking staffs will attach to the pack (tripod carriers work well for that too). I can fit my laptop iPad Kindle cpap machine (each of these in their own padded area - and reach any of them without tearing my whole pack open) medicine hiking staffs jacket/sweater pens powerbank iPhone cables with pockets for all sorts of other stuff with configurable dividers and - oh yeah - a camera. It's so well thought out. Even if using it just for regular hiking and camping it allows you to configure and segregate your gear in a myriad of ways using the padded dividers so that you can really organize yourself anyway you want. Don't need the dividers leave them home. The way this is organized you can open just the area for the equipment you need. No having to unpack everything to get what's at the bottom. It's amazing! This is the cleverest pack I've ever owned. Five stars +++.
5,This is a medium to large size bag!I was looking at a small to medium size bag originally.  But after weight out all the features and my need I decided to choose this bag as my final unit to purchase.Pros:1) Top load for quick camera access2) Plenty of spaces for either lens accessories flash or personal belongings on short to mid-range trips.3) If needs to the bag has space to load enough gears on field studio work.4) For #3 that means it has the space for a lap top plus a pad.  Which is a plus.5) I like the slave bag.  In case I need to part from the main bag.  I could leave the big bag in the hotel room and carry the small one for short excursion.6) 'Quality is really good.  Stitch line is firm and the shape is better formed than most of the ones out there.Cons:1) Still bigger than what I am truly hoping to purchase.  But I have not found it yet!I would suggest my friend to purchase this bag if they need one.
2,I got this for my series x Xbox which measures just under 6"x6"x12" (LxWxH) and it is super tight in the bag. And there's no room for much else (one controller and cables). It may say it's 16 inches tall but it's not square - at the top it narrows when it's zipped to about 4 inches. And I can't even use it as a back-up camera bag. With the padded inserts it only fits one body a med-long lens and then only a couple short primes wedged into the corners.
5,It fits everything and then some.  I love all the pockets it holds all my extra lenses camera body remotes flash...I like that everything is right there. The shoulder pads are padded and the shoulder harness is adjustable to get the right fit.  I have gone day hiking with it fully loaded (about 30lbs) with camera equipment water and snacks and it never hurt my shoulders or back.  It also comes with a mini shoulder bag which comes in handy when I don't need everything in the bag.  Worth every penny.
3,The pack looks nice but it was too small to hold my gear comfortably. It also needs a waist strap/belt to keep it from bouncing around while hiking and the chest strap is far too high - even after adjusting to its lowest point it kept riding up and hitting my neck  - not acceptable. The pack is smaller than you'd think - looks big in the picture and the dimensions make it seem like it's roomy but it isn't - the design is such that a lot of space is wasted. A lot of potential here but not realized. I had to return it.
5,Fits everything I needed for 1/10 TC and 2wd/4wd buggy. It has enough padding to protect your electronics without the bulk. My previous transmitter case is literally as big as this but can only fit a sole M12RS.1.) Has a huge compartment at the bottom for my power needs: x4 port 100W ac/dc charger x4 brick 2s lipo and x2 shorty packs (but can fit another pair).2.) Main too compartment fits a Sanwa M12... which means you can basically fit any other transmitter. Also squished in there is my electric air can.3.) Front hardshell compartment fits smaller electronics like programmer cards alkaline batteries etc.4.) Too soft shell has all the power cable balancer boards and charging cables for the charger.5.) Side water bottle compartment big enough to fit a canister of Simple Green foam.6.) Has a laptop compartment which I use to store manuals and a custom cut lexan pit board.
5,I'll start off by saying I've used a variety of camera bags and this one has been one of my favorite. I am a content producer and can be very hard on my gear when trying to get "the shot". This bag is built to handle life outside the studio. It's sturdy shell has protected my gear on long hikes tough falls and harsh weather. Also there is plenty of room in the bag to fit any piece of equipment I need. There dividers allow me to customize how I pack my bag and can be removed in case i need to take more travel gear and less camera gear. The hip straps and back support are also really nice when carrying around a heavy set up and on long hikes. I've had uncomfortable bags in the past and this one is definitely not one of them.So basically I give this bag an easy 10/10 and recommend it for anyone looking for something that goes beyond the simple photo studio. The only time I would not recommend this bag is if you have a small set up and only use lets say one lens.
4,I recently purchased this backpack for a trip. I do landscape photography so I needed a new pack that can carry several lenses and other accessories. I found this pack to be a little heavy(without my gear) but I could fit all my gear in it easily. It was comfortable for long hikes and seems to be durable. So far this is a great pack for hiking but a little too big for a quick day shoot. I took out the small bag that came with it to better fit my gear I don't see me using it as it is too small for my gear. My only con is that it has a squeaky noise when walking. I have not been able to figure out what the cause of this but I hope to. If I could chang anything about this pack it would be the waist straps I wish they were removable or retractable. I just don't like waist straps. All in all this is a good pack for a fair price.
4,I am pretty happy with this bag. With all my stuff packed it probably weighs 30 pounds. After making adjustments to the straps it stays snug to my back and is comfortable to carry.I do have a problem with how it is layed out. There are basically 2 main compartments to store your camera 📸 stuff but no way to combine any of those dividers. There is absolutely not a chance I can get my 600mm lens into this bag.  The only other issue I see is that there are no tie downs on the top of the pack for tripods. Yes you can carry a tripod on each side of the bag but nothing on top.The bag physically looks phenomenal I will admit though so for now I will have to carry my 600 separately.
5,I am very satisfied with the camera backpack so far. It feels really nice and seems to be made of high quality materials. There are so many ways that you can customize the setup to hold all of your gear exactly how you want it. It's got a bit of weight to it on its own but this is because it is made of good materials and there is lots of padding to keep your camera gear safe. I especially love the small shoulder bag that comes with it. I bought this bag so that I can take all of my camera gear with me on a trip to Iceland but so I also have a small bag for just the camera when I am out and about and don't need all of my gear. I can't wait to bring it on my trip! And while the bag is plenty big to hold everything you need it should also satisfy many international airline carry-on size requirements which is great because I would not want to check my camera gear.
5,Just great I really like it. Enough space for the camera and all the gears.
4,The flaps over the zippers and straps near the openings slow down the packing and unpacking process.Too much of a good thing can me Bad.  4/5The bag offers many options for your gear. I have two systems: Canon 5DMK III and Sony a7iii with L series Sigma 85 - 1.4 and Tamron 28-75 - 2.8 glass and the compartments allow for all of it as well as my 15” MacBook Pro light meter color checker tethering cords batteries and memory cards. 5/5The removable bag is a plus for traveling light and can be configured as needed. You can use it to carry speed lights and other accessories. 5/5The shoulder straps have a three point adjustment system where you can raise or lower the height as well as the opening to fit your arms and shoulders. 5/5A small functional tripod or mono pod may add weight so be ready. 3/5Once it’s on your back it lightens the load and burden of carrying it during your outdoor experience. 4/5Overall rating 4.5kdmorriskdmorris photographyPhiladelphia
5,Awesome camera backpack especially if you have a lot of gear to carry. It’s comfortable pretty sturdy and has an insane amount of storage and pockets. Only downside is when packed full of gear backpack can’t stand up without falling backwards. So you’ll have to set it down against a wall or something solid so it doesn’t just roll backwards. For the price tag I’d definitely recommend.
4,I needed a bigger bag for my photography business. The bag is very comfortable to wear and holds a TON of equipment. It feels like quality material. The zippers feel a little cheap so I use them gently. None have broken. I do wish the strap for tripod didn't have to be undone to get into the top of the bag but it's not a big deal. Still pretty fast to get in and out of.
5,Traveling with this was great. Comfortable and sturdy. Rain cover came in handy.
4,PROS: Great material lots of compartments easy working zippers lots of storage ample room for many lenses camera drone and all accessories water repellent additional rain cover for better rain protection.CONS: Velcro dividers seem a bit flimsy and velcro attachment points seem a bit weak. Shoulder and waist straps are not made for husky people. I will need to modify mine by adding straps.
5,I was super skeptical of buying another camera bag for my events but when i hit the bullet on this I was not disappointed. Comes with all the dividers you need even a diagram to make a basic setup.Top section : 2 D750 35 50 85 and two chargersBottom section : 1 DSLR flash 35 24-70 charger cleaning kit.Zipper pouches: spare batteries SD card pouch camera straps. All fit!!For $100 I say worth it because I like to only take 2 lenses to gigs but when I go on a trip I never know what to use! Get it guys it seriously is worth it. Weight distribution is phenomenal easy to access equipment
5,Where I live has some rough terrain and sometimes Ill be running around or climbing up steep terrain/rocks so being able to put all my gear in the bag lets me move around much easier. I can also carry water food and more gear than without a bag which helps a lot for longer hikes. The side pocket is also nice for quickly grabbing the camera.
2,While this backpack seems well built the color choice is misleading. Bordering on false advertisement. Take note that the majority of these reviews are for the “black” color. That “color” is in fact an entirely different backpack. The other “color” is much smaller. I thought that Amazon was cracking down on these bait and switch tactics but this one snuck by their radar. Like I said the backpack I received is well built and designed and is actually very nice. But it is not what I thought what I was getting.
5,At first I was concerned that I would not be able to pack my lenses camera and Gimbal plus all related accessories into the bag. I was wrong. Yes it is a tight fit but considering there is nothing loose or banging around I consider that a plus. The included fanny pack is perfect for my go pro and its accessories and as soon as I get my laptop i’m all set. Just wish I had a pocket for a change of clothes... but where I’ll be going I won’t need clothes. ;-)  Zipper rings makes securing the pack painless and the included rain cover makes it ideal for camping and long hikes. I’m sure there a bigger roomier packs out there but for the price point this is ideal
5,Lots of room for lenses flash and charging cables. Fits my 15 inch laptop quite well.It's great to fit most all of my camera gear in one place and easy access to my camera from the top of the bag. Easily holds my tripod with straps on side of backpack.
5,This is a pretty solidly built bag. Feels very sturdy and well padded. It holds all my current gear including my mirrorless camera the two lenses I have for it currently and has room for one more I plan to get. And the few other compartments it has are fine for batteries and small stuff. I’m going to need a separate bag for my flash and associated equipment though. About the only thing I wish was different is the addition of some D-rings on the shoulder straps.
5,Buen diseño y materiales
5,I was never a big fan of camera backpacks. I prefer shoulder bags but these days I carry several big lenses on many shoots and I need to have my gear with me in a way that doesn't hamper movement. This backpack beats all the competition for durability function and price point. I have to admit that I have been a fan of another company's bags for years but when I compare all the features quality of materials and the price I really believe that Tarion bags are the best of category. This pack impressed my wife so much that she is buying one for all her gear. Once you see one of these in use you'll want one too.
5,Absolutely love this bag and  I fit in two DSLR Cameras lenses 200-500 70-200 18-300 11-16 SD cards Batteries and Laptop sure that is only when I travel and its heavy than.The only thing I do not like is the squeaking noise that is right on top on the shoulders and therefor close to my ear and I have TN disease so it can trigger horrible pain for me. But I sure would recommend this bag its well made and I would sure buy it again and the extras that comes with it is awesome too
4,Bag is well made with thick material and heavy stitching has survived several trips already with no signs of wear. I'm quite concerned with the middle 'pick up' strap used to lift the bag from the floor from a standing position though compared to all my bags before it seems like this is severally under sized and expect it to be the first part to rip. Note this bag is too large to fit in the overhead compartments of region jets like a CRJ700 but it does still just barely fit under the seat.
4,I needed  a camera backpack with more room I have outgrown my last one. This camera backpack has a lot of room and the compartments are set up nicely. Your equipment is not jammed into it either everything slides in and out nicely. I was even able to fit a 400mm Sigma telephoto the camera body with lens attached a few more lenses and some sound equipment wow.  When needed I'll be able to fit my DJI Osmo with the camera mounted.  I loaded it up and put it on and it felt good not heavy but the real test comes when I take it into the field. I also like the look style and colors it hard to find a bag that actually looks good.  One concern is the main handle for lifting it just does not feel sturdy enough. Otherwise a great camera backpack.
5,Love the zipper pulls. Plenty of room and easy to configue. Very good quality.
4,Only complaint I have is with the straps. First wish the height of the upper strap was adjustable as i find it to be too high. Also the shoulder straps loosen over time. Had to tie a knot in them to prevent the pack from riding too low.  Wish it had loops to clip on gear such as a GPS. Other than that it is great for securely holding all my gear. Have to fear is any of it being damaged.
5,This bag has been amazing! I do weddings for a living so I’m constantly jumping in and out of cars at parks on streets and fields. For a photographer this will carry everything you need plus some.3 mirrorless5 primesDrone gearBatteries16inch Laptop and more.
4,Very nice bag. Its a decent size and carries a decent amount of equipment.I wish the bag pockets were set up opposite. I pack my lenses in the top of the bag and camera with a lens attached in the bottom. When I use my camera the weight shifts and is too top heavy.When I take off the bag to access my lens to change the bag tends to fall over due to the top heavy weight.Also the bag should have hard shells for all 3 compartments not just the battery accessory pocket in the middle.
5,I can fit everything I need plus diaper wipes and a couple pull ups inside this thing.  My tripod is secure on the side via snaps and buckles and everything can be adjusted to fit.  I have done many hiking trips with this since I bought it 4 months ago and it holds up and holds more than you need.
2,The good: There are no bags out there [far as I can tell] that allow you to carry TWO sets of camera/lenses and retain the compact size which allows you potentially stow it under an airline seat.The bad: The designers either took the month off or got lazy when they put the finishing touches.- Had a lockable zipper pair [which I absolutely love] but any benefit is negated by the fact that you can access the side pocket which has no such zipper to steal the very things you are trying to protect.What was the thinking here? Put one on the SIDE pocket!- The hardshell pocket is WAY underutilized. Seriously you dedicate a pocket for some stitched on mini pockets for SIM cards? Is this a joke?  No stretch pocket instead? A zipper pocket?Compare this to your larger version of this same bag - the hard shell pocket is much more practical. C'mon guys! Seriously!- Top zipper pouch - Again it's like you are getting a VERY stripped down version of a decently-equipped car.Remember people like to organize things better - brushes spare caps lens cleaner lens cloth.- Bottom side pocket for quick camera access. Why can't the inner flap have a pocket like its bigger versionBOTTOM LINE: Tarion you would have an EXCELLENT bag in a class by itself were you to just make some minor changes to this bag.Is this far too much to ask?
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I've had this bag for awhile now and have used it extensively. I am very happy with this bag. I found myself in a situation where I needed to carry my larger video editing laptop and I was having trouble finding a bag that could fit it and my camera gear. I just got back from vegas covering shot show and was able to fit everything including clothes in this one bag and it fit as a carry on.  It is durable and I like the way I can easily reconfigure when adding gear or in my case making room for clothes.  I don't think there is another bag I have seen that can match this one for my needs especially at the price. Well done.
4,Great amount of space and storage.
5,I bought this for my husband who had 2 camera cases and many other storage boxes/bags for his two cameras two big lenses unipod and loads of miscellaneous must haves. I think he was skeptical of how much it would accommodate and was really excited about it holding everything he needed. He’s not a hiker but he said it’s nice to be able transport the bag like a backpack.
5,I've been carrying one of those over the shoulder bags for ever and it has worked until I started carrying extra lenses and cleaning supplies.  Of course I'd have to carry my tripod separately.  This bag holds all my gear and I'm able to carry other things that I would really like to have with me for shoots. .... wipes towels lens shrouds charger portable charger.  I love it.Also I was worried that he bag would get top heavy with most of my gear in the top and collapse - it really doesn't.  It has enough structural integrity to hold itself up.  Double plus in my book.
2,I purchased this for my new Nikon Z9 only to find out it was not big enough for the Z9 with the 24-120 attached. Much smaller than I thought is was going to be. Not deep enough as well made for something like the nikon Z7 or 6
4,I love this bag was initially  going to return it  dealing with the ups store in brunswick maine store#3338 was a nightmare . Its super big bag and heavy but great protection  for gear. Im going to use it to pack all my gear in and use little bag to only carry what i need :)
3,I was anticipating a little roomier bag as it boasts that it can hold two cameras. I cannot fit my Nikon D6 In the bottom without having to force it and open both zips to get it out. It only fits on the top backwards which leaves very little room for other accessories. It’s also very uncomfortable to cart around. Needs a waste and support strap... that would make it a nice bag for hiking but I probably won’t use it for that.It’s ok and I made it work but I’ll be upgrading before too long.
5,Picking the box up to bring it into the house raised an eyebrow... It's not super heavy but enough to right off let you know this is not an ordinary camera bag. Very impressive. It appears to be ready for the long haul and lots of use and abuse. I have a lot of equipment and sadly its not going to be big enough for much more than a couple of cameras and lenses. I haven't spent enough time on it yet but that is my first impression. I will come back to that after a trip or two.. I do and will recommend this bag...I have a lot of experience with bags and this one is first rate..
5,This bag is ideal for the person going on extended day hikes.  There is enough room to hold camera gear as well as personal items needed for a long hike.  There is enough room that I can even take my backpacking stove to have some coffee or hot soup.  The shoulder straps are quite comfortable and the waist strap is substantial enough to be useful. You can wear this pack comfortably for the entire day.  The camera gear storage area is well padded.  Comes with a separate bag that can be used by itself when you don't need the backpack  Also comes with a rain cover.  If you want a bag for extended day hikes you won't find one better than this.
4,Holy cow this thing is big. I fit ALL of my camera gear inside and then added my second camera and lenses too plus the tripod. In the event I get a smart car (not likely) it'll fit too.
3,It fine. certainly not a premium product but also was a fraction of the cost. If I were a pro I would not be happy with this. But it will serve me just fine.
5,Completely what I wanted.  It has space for my camera and gear and plenty of space for water bottles too!  It held up well to hiking in the desert and didn’t become uncomfortable like my previous backpacks would.  It packs a tripod very well and despite climbing and scrambling over and under rocks my tripod was not pulled out.Unfortunately mine didn’t come with the Velcro strap and I will leave that for my review of the seller.
5,I went for a camera bag that could hold (almost) all my equipment for traveling and adventure photography - and this is the one to have!It is sturdy well-built comfortable and most of all - large. I can easily fit my larger Pentax DSLR my mirrorless Sony and lenses for each in the compartments. Theres ample room for accessories and cables notebooks harddrives... you name it. It is worth the investment just to know you have all your stuff available wherever you are shooting. I personally don't use the removable shoulder bag but rather use the space for the second camera to live.Overall very happy with my purchase.
4,I am a full-time professional photographer and needed a bag that would hold a lot of gear be well made have good padding to protect from stuff have several pockets and dividers for organization and be comfortable to carry. This backpack covers all the bases. The only gripe I have about it is the fact that the top of the bag angles inward and when it is laying flat what I have in the top outside pocket tends to want to fall out. But that is a small gripe other than that I like the bag and it appears to be made to years of daily use. I would buy it again.
5,I'm (hopefully) going to be going to Europe for a month this summer and I needed a bag that could transport all my camera equipment plus my CPAP machine since I can't pack it in my regular luggage. This pack can support both my CPAP my camera equipment and my laptop all in one. Even if this is the only time I use this pack it will be worth the money.
3,I have a small frame and this relatively large bag has innovative and simple methods for fitting fairly comfortably.However there are a number of quality issues Multiple zipper pulls broke after 2 weeks’ use small storage pockets ripped at the seams after the second use and the Velcro on the divider between the top and bottom of the bag is not very strong resulting in items from the top being compacted in the bottom of the bag.I would return the bag if I had had an opportunity to use it in the field prior to the return cutoff. Alas….
5,What a great design. So much quality and innovation. This thing far exceeded my expectations. Large body with a grip and a lens attached 4 other lenses 2 flashes. Lots of odd and ends. And room to spare. Laptop and iPad storage.  Amazing padding in the straps and the back. This thing is very large but doesn’t feel it at all. I’ve gotten other backpacks from amazon and this one blows them away. Have been a lowpro guys for years and this is my choice by a long shot.
5,Most of my camera equipment fits well.  Another happy customer sold me on this bag when he pictured the same camera and long lens that I have fitting in the bag.  I took it on a plane with me - tripod attached (head packed in a suitcase).  To make it easier to handle in the airport I attached it to a small wheeled dolly that could be put under the seat in front of me.  I'm very pleased with the way it protects my gear and just how much fits in the bag.  I don't/haven't hiked with it yet so I can't answer questions regarding that however I did carry  the backpack onto the plane and it is evenly balanced.  Worth what I paid.  I am pleased
5,I was very impressed with the quality of this backpack. I was running out of room in my old backpack and knew it was time to get one with more storage space. Well I found it. It is built well and gives you options in regards to storage within it. I would most definitely encourage anyone to take a closer look at this product. It is a good product at a great price.
5,I have another much more expensive pack that does not have all the features and versatility of this one. Great quality and very well thought out. Holds my DSLR and underwater camera gear in one ready to travel set. Love it. I would make one suggestion. I like a heavier tripod for stability with larger lenses and like to carry it slung on the bottom of the pack for better balance. I had to modify a bit to make this happen but that's not a very big deal. Highly recommended.
5,Absolutely love this product so far. It is extremely comfortable and holds my camera the 4 lenses that go everywhere with me my laptop and the cleaning kit I carry for my camera and lenses. Plus there is still additional room. It is very handy how it is adjustable to height in more than one way. You can personalize it to fit you best. I am very anxious to use the around the waist pouch when I go hiking in the mountains for quick access as carrying a camera around my neck is very uncomfortable. Very pleased with my purchase!!! Have already passed the name on and showed this product off to numerous people.
3,This is not a bad backpack. You can actually fit a ton in there. However if you put too much gear on it it will look bulky and I felt like it was going to fall apart over time.
5,This is a nice camera bag.  It was actually bought to store other equipment (GPD MicroPC Netgear Cell Router and some other accessories).  It preforms this function quite well and reduced the number of separate bags into a single one.It has the ability to adjust the dividers which is great.  This way one can customize the storage arrangement to fit the items being carried.  The product seems good quality but I can't speak of longevity at this point.  I also like the different carrying options via the shoulder or hand.  This way it fits life quite well.This bag met the needs it was bought for and I would buy it again for its purpose.
5,Ton of spaces and compartments to carry all of your digital/camera needs. I have a DJI Mav 2 drone DSLR goPro DJI Mimmo along with lighting and tripods all in one place!!
5,I travel a lot and have used this bag frequently.  It’s a sturdy hefty bag but fits as carry on.It carries very comfortably and I am not at all concerned about my equipment inside.  I am very happy with this bag.I did more or less discard the hip bag that can fit in the lower compartment.  I found it to be a bit of a pain.  Not that it was bad just not as easy as I wanted.  I now use that space to carry my electronic accessories for quick removal in airport security lines etc.
5,What I like about this is the compartments have Velcro dividers so you can rearrange them to be however works for you. I rearranged mine to fit several old iPhones and batteries for live-streaming my kids’ volleyball practices. Then I like that the camera has its own compartment that is easily accessible. And the backpack actually will stand up when you set it down - and will still stand up when you remove the camera. It seems to be quality made. I like it very much.
5,This backpack is amazing for it's price!!!!!!!The quality is just great and there is so much space for my camera equipment. I used to have multiple bags with me but now I can put all my equipment in one. I am a content creator so I’m so grateful to have found this bag. I definitely recommend this bag to anyone that loves to travel and make great content.  10/10!!@deivideugenioo
5,I enjoy having most of my equipment in one bag.  I no longer get to my shoot and wonder if I have the correct filters lenses and extra body with me.  You get the idea.  It is well padded but that comes with a cost.  Weight but  I am willing to make that trade off.  The bag is easy to haul and I love the extra bag within a bag if I want to dump one of my bodies in the trunk for a quick few shots.
4,A ton of compartments
4,I can't give it all 5 stars as I've only had it a short time but I love the space it holds all my equipment and more plus it's comfortable to wear! On the negative side I get lost in all the zippers and do not like the buckles. So far it's a great bag. Oh and my back doesn't sweat like my old one did! Try one!
5,I personally use mine as a range bag and for my spotting scope.
5,Producto amplio y fácil de organizar para guardar los elementos de trabajo de fotografía
5,Many of us are in search of the best camera bag for our needs and this one checks all of my requirements. It has tons of space for all of my gear holds a laptop securely plenty of pockets for storage of accessories good padding for gear easy to carry and durable. The extra bag is also a bonus which is easy to take out and downsize your gear when needed. This bag seems to have it all at least for me it does. This bag is very easy to customize for your camera gear too. Very happy with this purchase!
4,It is really nice but for meI'm 5'8" and it's just a bit big. That's my only issue.
5,My recent trip to St. Louis was made easier with this bag I was able to pack a large laptop RadioMaster TX16S transmitter Viper FPV goggles my Squirt V2 Cinewhoop quad large 8 inch quad (externally) and two 3 inch micro cinewhoops along with several batteries charge cables and tools. the bag is pretty light I came in under 35 pounds. The zips are all very well constructed and held flawlessly.
5,The bag has great overall storage volume and the compartments make it hold lenses and cameras as well as other smaller items such as SD cards filters and battery chargers.  The tripod holder on the outside is especially nice!  Very comfortable to wear making carrying a large load wonderful.  Quality materials and good overall construction.
5,TOTALMENTE SATISFECHO CON ESTA MOCHILA AUNQUE ES MUY GRANDE EN REALIDAD YA EN LA ESPALDA SE SIENTE MUY COMODA Y LOS GANCHOS DE SEGURIDAD LA HACEN AUN MAS LIGERA ES UNA MOCHILA MUY BUENA PARA QUIENES NECESITAMOS USAR 2 CAMARAS; 4 LENTES FLASHES TRIPODE Y TODOS LOS PEQUEÑOS ACCESORIOS. 100% RECOMENDADA.
5,This is an extremely well-built camera bag with the capacity to hold a lot of gear.  I use the bag to transport all of the attachments for my Canon camcorder as well as my Nikon DSLR.  I really appreciate having a separate pack for excursions so that I can leave the larger bag in a more secure location.  I also love the visibility of the zipper holds and the overall durability of the product.  Well done!
5,I just got this and haven't used it much but I will be.  I was wondering if it would be big enough for my Nikon camera with a telescoping lens and I am glad I picked this one.  I am going on a trip and wanted something smaller to take than my backpack camera case.  It feels sturdy and I like the waist strap for walking around.  The handle on the top of the bag seems very sturdy too.  This size will fit great in my carry on luggage and still be protective of the camera with the padding that is in the bag
5,Fabulous camera bag for all your lenses; cards; spare gear and the camera witch has it’s own removable on the go bag built in! The removal of the dividers allows you to customize the compartment needed. All items are well protected!
5,I got this bag to supplement my normal pack that has everything. This bag is big enough for my Panasonic G85 and a extra lens and a few batteries. Beyond that I wouldn't try to fit much more than that. I prefer the shoulder strap mostly because I don't like the look of it on the waist. The padding is good and I feel like it would keep the contents safe if I ever dropped it. This bag has a very sturdy well built feel to it. I think Tarion made a nice bag here.
5,I love how much I can fit in this bag and how well organized and protected everything feels.  My favorite part is that detachable bag that I currently use to store all my audio gear.  It's great that when I'm trying to set up audio when filming an event that I can just carry around that tiny bag that has all my solutions in it.  Sometimes that saves me quite a bit of walking!
5,Great bag only downside is you may need to have your larger lenses in a separate bag. It may fit a single camera with a 200mm lens but that’s all. However I usually carry a dslr (Nikon d5600) and an slr (Minolta 370). Surprisingly they both fit in this without straining the bag (pictures). I also keep a 135mm prime lens for the slr in the bag. It would be possible to remove the lenses and have more room for the cameras and lenses but I’m lazy and like to just take them out and shoot.
5,I bought this to put my New Lumix S5 in and use it while hiking and also to strap it to the top of the side bags of thr motorcycle. It seems to be well built and is affordable.
5,My equipment outgrew my old backpack. This one is perfect and I love that it has compartments on the outside. It's also more sturdy than my old backback. I look forward to lugging it through Florida's state parks all summer.
4,I haven 't actually utilized it yet but a good examination of the product made me happy. Good quality.
5,This is a great bag. Do many camera bags have one area with dividers and a second area that is undivided space. This bag has two divided storage areas to hold all of my gear. And it’s not overly big and bulky. I love it.
2,Not big enough for Canon 70-200 F2.8L
5,You can hardly buy something better than this bag. I have used camera bags for many years this is the best I have bought and for a really low price.
5,Works great.  I'm a bigger guy the middle strap is pointless.  With everything inside it it's not the easiest to sling around.  When I'm using it it feels light holds everything carefully.
5,very nicely made was please with the useable room. best configurement I have seen in a backpack form. truly a design that is also veritable with moveable dividers in the top and bottom compartments.  truly well-engineered for utility in mind along with generous padding in the shoulder straps.loaded with 21 pounds of gear 2 bodies 7 lenses.tripod/monopod and 2 flash heads still had room for a jacket and snacks for a day outing in what mother nature has to offer.
5,Very adjustable with a spot for a 15" laptop as well. I am very pleased.
4,Great bag with good sections. My only issue is with the part where you adjust the shoulder strap high for comfort in the middle of the bag. I picked the bag up and that part tore. Luckily it is not the part which bares the load so i can still use it I just wish ot would not have beoken for a perfect score.
5,Buy this bag! Just got it in. I’m obsessed. Very thick/sturdy material. Very spacious easily fits all of my camera gear plus I can fit my 15 in laptop. The upper compartment I can use the top for clothes.  The Zippers are all very sturdy tested and made with quality material. Overall the space is perfect to fit in a backpack. It included a smaller carrying bag. Love the padding on the straps and back. This will be the perfect traveling camera bag. Very versatile and lots of storage.
5,I absolutely love it. Very nice!
5,All I can say about this bag is WOW! Its perfect for my needs. Has a ton of space and is very big overall so if you are looking for small and compact this isnt for you. It does come with a smaller pull out bag that fits inside the larger one...so honestly you get the best of both worlds. Very customizable for your needs whether you have a ton of gear to haul or very little. Built very well and with nice zippers pockets padding and coloring. I can tell one will last me a long time! Awesome camera / gear bag.
5,I love the WAIST BELT so much I want a waist level camera bag to carry my camera and extra lens. The strap is long enough to adjust as either a crossbody bag or a shoulder bag. It looks great and the zippers work very smoothly. Well though out and easy to use and carry. Quality is wonderful. I truly believe you get what you pay for.  "bigger" enough than other waist pouch type setup while "smaller" enough to make carrying stuff comfortable. Highly recommend!
5,I bought this for my wife but now I am tempted to get one for myself and I don't even have a camera. This bag is sturdy keeps its shape and has so many pockets. It would be a great bag for anyone for any purpose. You can get to any packed item without having to rustle through a big compartment full of things. This bag is worth every penny paid.
4,It looks and feels great buuut!! It's more like for small equipment camera/lens otherwise it's awesome. I did not keep it because I have a 600MM and with camera and 4 other lenses this pack is too small. If your gear is small I definitely suggest it
5,Wanted something big enough to take to Utah for a shoot and carry 2 cameras filters and a couple lenses for each. Just barely enough room but did work. Good quality materials and build.
5,Great backpack it’s heavy but so is a canon with 2 f2.8 lens flash with 2 magmods and 15” laptop and all the batters and gear. All areas are pass and well sized to put it all on one bag. It’s. Hiking pack so watch when you turn around. Straps and padding handle the weight well. Your sacrificing breathability for protection and padding and I’m ok with that with the cost of the gear.
5,Bag is large and held all my gear with a grab and go bag which works out great 2 cameras 5 lens tri pod mics and misc items all fit. well worth the investment
4,I recommend storing the camera without the lens attached (especially for larger lenses). Roomy but not bulky and the compartments adjust easily. I fit everything into this bag that a larger but decomposing bag held but again if you want to pull out your SLR and fire away maybe this is more a bag for portability.
5,Bought it for my trip. Wanted a backpack with side access. this one works perfectly. The laptop compartment i've used for soft water container.Zippers work well do not seem wick.The only think I'd prefer a bit more attachment points on the shoulder straps.
5,My Camera 2 lenses Tascam recorder rode videomic pro on camera light all fits in the bottom compartment and on the top (after a little bit of ingenuity) I was even able to fit my DJI Ronin S gimbal with small rig attachments.  There are enough compartments to fit all of my cables chargers and extra batteries memory cards pens and even a laptop.  It's legit.
4,Very nice case for a large Nikon DSLR and lens.  My daughter got my old camera and wanted a case that she could wear on her waist or carry over the shoulder.  Works perfect and padding was soft.  Very sturdy material.
5,The amount of space this bags offers is great i was able to load up three cameras multiple lens tripod and 2 gimbals with a macbook pro. I had everything I needed to get the job done with out having to carry several bags.
5,I use this pack for my long hikes and camping. I really enjoy the two storage areas. One for my camera and lenses and the other I actually use for my clothes and what not for my trip. The straps adjust really well and can have different sizes so if you are like me you can adjust the shoulders to a medium large setting. The side pockets and securing points are awesome for those misc things you want to bring with.
5,Love carry everything I need
3,This is a well constructed and very nice bag. It has the options of using as a  shoulder or belly bag.  It is padded in the inside. However this is one of the first camera bags that does not have any pockets on the outside to put in extra batteries sd cards filter charger remote  control  etc. You must open the bag and on the top of the flap are two inadequate and small pockets. You may have to fish through the inside of the case for these items. I always find it easier  faster and safer for example  to replace a card or battery without opening the case and risk dropping something.  If this is not important add a 1 1/2 stars.
5,This is a really good backpack!!
5,One of the best product ever it took more than I expected and also as heavy the bad with all my product it felt so light when on back. The material is so nice and with detailed work in making the bad. I will always recommend it
5,This bag is Huge! And I like it. I have purchased 5 bags in the past month trying to find something that would fit all of my camera gear and i have found it with this bag. I have a Nikon D7500: Tamron 18-400 mm Nikon 18-140 Nikon 35 mm and 50 mm all of which fit great in my bag along with a pair of Nikon ProStaff binoculars Rode microphone and various accessories.
5,This is a big pack. OK for me it's big (I'm 5'2") which isn't a bad thing; I use it to carry a full astrophotography setup including a tracking mount and up to three lenses (including a 135mm). It's comfortable to hike with over fairly long distances (sub 10 miles) and comes with an array of pockets for anything you can think of. Overall would definitely buy again.
5,Backpack is solid and well built. Wish it had more smaller pockets instead of SD holders. Not sure how many SD cards one will need but if you have a lot this backpack will have plenty of storage for them.
4,Bag is ok but observed tear patch not sure it from before or happened on 1st day use...
5,Excellent
5,So far I absolutely love this  bag. I have not tested it in bad weather but it has  so far  been very comfortable  and  sturdy for shooting  events. I am really short and it fits me fine with the height  adjustment.  This bag is made for every body.
5,I was very pleasantly surprised with the high quality of this camera bag. All the straps are of high quality and strength the bag is very high quality and there is more storage space than I expected. There is plenty of adjustment space with the straps for me as I have extra girth to worry about.
4,So far I am enjoying this back pack. it fills up fast and is a bit heavy due to the padding for the cameras.That said it is very comfortable to wear has many adjustments which make it feel much lighter and comfortable. many storage compartments in which to store and forget stuff
5,I truely love this bag. It has tons of space and many adjustments.. Many i am not sure of. I guess if i could say anything negative is that all the adjustments do not have how to's. other than that I recommend it.
5,Plenty of room in this bag! Camera lens drone iPad and all the accessories I need fit nicely and has its own place. Straps are comfortable and padded. Although it has an adjustment for the straps it could better for a lil bit bigger person like myself but all around great bag very helpful and useful.
5,This was a very nice bag--I feel the padding would protect our camera well and there is space for extra batteries and lenses. west strap looks amazing & keeps camera in easy to access while clicking photos as well feels light weight for carrying during hiking.nice bag with cushioning and this also has waterproof cover to protect from rain I would like to recommend this for good value for money product.
5,Very well constructed. Fit all my 7 lenses and accessories including tripod. Like all the compartments including a place for my iPad that I use to download pictures. Exactly what I was looking for.
5,I like the quality of the bag and the helpful suggested layout of the dividers for your equipment.
5,It was a present for my daughter she was absolutely thrilled. All of her equipment fit perfectly. We were extremely happy with this purchase.
5,Loved everything about this backpack lots of space and pockets every where.Excellent materials quality absolutely 100% satisfied
5,Backpack performs much better than I expected. Three cameras and six lenses were able to fix in no problem.
5,This bag is insane! Space for everything. I have a GoPro osmo action osmo pocket Nikon d3300 3 lenses a Mavic Air a full tripod 2 mini tripods a laptop an assortment of mount adapters batteries storage cards and more... It all fits comfortably...
5,Exactly what I was looking for! More dividers than I will ever need holds both Cameras and all my extra lens charging cords manuals etc.
5,Good size for carrying a decent amount of equipment. Strong sturdy with numerous compartments. Great value
5,I can fit all of my gear I would need on a shoot into one package. It is a sturdy design that will protect your gear when traveling.  It even comes with a rain cover. I am concerned about the top handle design and longevity but we shall see in time.
5,I've used it every day since I got it roomy well constructed and lightweight
5,I use this backpack for outdoor photography shooting.  The design has all things considered including the very durable and good quality of construction material handy pockets with plenty of spaces for camera and camera accessories.  It's big like a camping backpack but comfortable to carry it on your back.
5,Lots of space! My only concern is for longer lenses hard to make space for them as bag is divided into two main compartments. I think that the orange pullers in the zippers of the main upper compartment should be different color as I keep grabbing the wrong one. Great bag!
5,Amazing travel backpack. I can carry my Canon T7i nifty fifty 75-300mm and 18-55 lenses with room for more lenses. My MacBook my tablet my GoPro and my DJI Spark with controller. And I’m only about half full! Add that all up and it is completely comfortable. Highly recommend!
5,It is very good but I hope you have a better design and a beautiful exterior
5,I have taken this bag filled to the max to South America and Asia and his yet to fail me or fall apart. It holds my full frame A mount Sony 2 flashes a fanny pack Go Pro stick batteries chargers and 5 lenses. Love it!
3,This bag is great however when you take anything out of the bottom compartment of the bag it becomes unstable and collapses.  The bag no longer stands up on its own.  You need to keep things in the bottom for it to operate like a normal bag.  This is disappointing.  Also when putting a camera with a lense in it in the top compartment the camera does not sit in there firmly.  It's very loose and when you unzip the top pouch the camera will fall out on the ground.  Be extremely careful.  Not very bad bag just not very good either.
3,We bought this for our son for Christmas who is a nature photographer. The zippers are breaking and there is absolutely no airflow.  I really thought this would be the perfect backpack unfortunately my son is not happy with it.
5,This is a great bag with many options! Very durable and configurable. More than enough room for my gear. I have about 20 pounds of stuff in it plus my tripod hanging on it
3,Bag is very bulky and oversized  could be good if you’re a wilderness photographer. But for everyday in city type shooting wouldn’t recommend
5,I was in need of a new camera bag. I got it a few days ago and I love it! It fits everything I no longer need to carry 2 bags. It’s so nice
5,This pack has it ALL. Highly configurable/customizable compartments quality zippers/straps/clips. It distributes the weight well and has extremely nice and ergonomically placed padding. This pack holds a ton of gear and has several lashing points for adding on more gear. This is a full sized backpack.
5,I bought this bag for my upcoming trip to Brazil because I needed a better bag. I used to use a manfrotto bag but I was never a fan of it. This bag is better quality and cheaper than what I paid for my manfrotto bag. It has tons of compartments for all my random camera gear. I would recommend to everyone if they need a good bag
5,Clips are in the way of the zipper
3,Lots of room. But rather obnoxious zippers and cheap pull staps that are forever coming out of the buckle. I'd say it's built for someone that is very small bodied. Just not the bag I expected it to be.
5,This backpack was absolutely perfect. I usually do three camera shoots and this has revolutionized my workflow on the shoot. It is so much more convenient to walk around without heavy bags in my hands or slung over my shoulders. The removable compartments really help for different lens lengths and I love all of the little hidden pockets for batteries and extra cables. I highly recommend this.
5,This is the one stop shop bag for multi cam operators. I have managed to get 2 Nikon 360 cameras a DJI osmo plus a Sony A7iii & Nikon d5600 both with 2 lens wide angle and zoom. All the batteries & chargers for all the cameras and my laptop!!!!
5,This is a very good  backpack very good quality suitable for long-distance travel very convenient to install the camera and can hold many things I love it very much!
5,Super nice! I was amazed at the quality this offers. I would recommend it to everyone. You can fit everything in and still have room. It’s very comfortable to wear.
5,Very good quality backpack. Shipped fast and arrived as promised.
5,It is a great camera bag if you are needing several different applications. There is an inner smaller bag that you can take with you iff you don't need the rest of your gear. Very handy!
5,My boyfriend got this backpack and he seriously LOOOOVES it. He uses it for multiple lenses to go hiking or when second shooting with me for weddings. The support in it is actually great for back pain and he doesn't complain about discomfort at all. Took it on a plane today.
5,Very great product!
5,Great bag. Tons of pockets. Plenty of room for 2 full frame canon bodies long lenses short lenses laptop hard drives filters tripod and anything else you might need for shooting. Rugged zippers and bonus rain cover.
5,Excellent bag!
5,Bigger than most camera bags. Very roomy
5,Awesome backpack.  I was worried as there were no reviews for the product but I'm glad I went ahead anyway.  I use it for both work and recreation.  For work it carries my laptop safely and the customizable compartments I'm not using for camera gear work great for other needed equipment.  For fun it's super comfortable and durable.  No regrets whatsoever.
5,I got all my camera equipment in and I am loving this bag. It is actually bigger than I thought. Very cool!
2,In my opinion this is just an ok camera backpack.  Over all it's cheaply constructed and feels like it's not going to hold up well over time. It also has a few design flaws in that you have to undo straps to fully access compartments. I can see that I'll be cutting those off soon. And there's not much in the way for organizing compartments for cables charger batteries cleaning supplies and so one.I have a small Lowepro backpack as well and it's certainly higher quality and more logically designed.
5,This is a fantastic backpack. More than enough room for my brother’s camera gear plus space for hiking and travel supplies. Lots of places to hook on carabiners too! Plan to get many years out of this.
5,One of the best products I bought  It still have space after kept my all stuff so I am not worried about future that if I buy more stuff it would enough or not.
5,I love this bag. I was looking for something to hold my FPV drones and this actually works really well for a cheaper price compared to bags that are designated for drones. Lots of space!!!
5,Very happy with the purchase
4,I love how much I can put in this bag.
5,Worked perfect for camera lenses and other accessories.
5,Fit what I need perfect very good quality.
5,It Carry's everything I need for a photo shoot and more.
5,this bag is perfect for film makers that travels and for run and gun productions. you can easily access your camera and you have an extra lens bag. Has a lot of compartments to store different kind of things like ballpens sdcards etc.. so far im lovin it.. been using it for a month now and still sturdy and durable.
5,Great bag
4,overall I like it. the only draw back is the weight. a little over weighted but still comfortable to carry. safe for gears. enough amount of space..
5,Bought this for my photographer boyfriend and it works wonderfully. There’s so much storage and he is able to comfortably carry all of his gear on any trail. Well worth the purchase.
5,Just what I was looking for it is a large backpack very durable with tons of space to carry all of your camera needs. I love it!
5,Well made pack - Just what I needed.
5,Can't really judge durability nor Comfort yet as I've only used this a few times but overall I am impressed and expect the product to prove highly durable based on first impressions.
4,Not quite enough dividers!!!!
5,Great bag! I can fit 2 laptops(tight fit) 1 dslr camera 4 lenses GoPro Magic Air drone and several batteries for each of the respective devices. It’s a little tricky getting it to fit under the seat or overhead compartments on smaller airplanes but overall worth the money!
2,In reading most of the reviews people rave about the quality of the pack.  All I can say is people must not have ever owned a LowePro bag.  I was disappointed immediately with the zipper quality the quality of the pulls and especially the interior velcro.  The first thing I did was try and unzip the bag and the zippers were balky something my 10 year old LowePro still does well.I accept that I should not expect LowePro quality at this price but I certainly expect better than this for the price.  IMO this is worth about half the price.Sending it back and paying the extra for a LowePro.
2,It ripped on the support area that connects the shoulder straps near mid-back.  One of the oddest place for and backpack to rip.  I contacted the company about it and they asked me for my order number and never replied back after I emailed them a few times.  To top that off the zipper straps started to fall off.  Capacity wise it works but construction and the quality it's poor.
5,Si me agrado
1,Its not a real waterproof backpack i used it under light rain for around 20 minutes including the cover protect and after that my camera has 💀. Be careful with this item
5,Love it! We have already taken it out on many adventures out in the woods. It carries everything I need. Comfortable straps
3,Great backpack to have but it's not for taller and heavier people. A lot bigger than I thought it would be but the straps are terrible. I'm 6ft2 and the strap was choking me. Gave it a 3 star because it's probably a great back pack for shorter and skinnier people. Maybe someone in their early 20's.
5,Love it love it love it and so worth buying.
5,I really like this backpack. It has plenty of compartments and it houses everything I need. I also like the extra camera bag.
5,This is a roomy sturdy camera bag with lots of room for all my equipment and peripherals.  It is very comfortable with several support points
5,Huge
5,A lot of storage space good quality material & stitches and comfortable to wear. Will update feedback again later.
5,This is the first back pack style bag I have used. It is huge and still have room for a few more lenses and equipment.
5,I carry my Sony CX 900 A99  3 lenses  Two external flashes and still have room for more.
5,Great quality.  Lots of room and compartments.  I have around 5 lenses stored in there including a 100-400.
1,This is a really nice and well-constructed camera backpack that I purchased for a trip to Costa Rica. Unfortunately it is extremely heavy and so much so that I am leaving it behind in favor of an alternative. Once packed with camera gear it is a back breaker and very large. It would be difficult to fit it into a carry-on compartment so check-in would be best. I wanted to love this pack but unfortunately I cannot do so.
4,Nice bag but small.
5,This bag is awesome! No complaints at all! Well made plenty of separators and storage
5,Excelente para guardara todo mi equipo cámaras lentes 2 drone y las gopro con sus accesorio
5,Great item for travel photographers!
5,This is perfect for my new carry-on! I have room for everything. Love that it is so adjustable.
5,The bag by itself is heavier than I anticipated. It sits well and seems to fit everything and more than I need.
3,Unfortunately after 6 weeks in the field thestraps on this bag broke. My son took it to Thailand for an internship and now is stuck in a remote location without a bag.
5,Great large bag!Fits a lot! Including two camera bodies my 150-600 50mm 85mm and battery grips all in the top compartment!
5,Good product. If you tall more than 1m85 the bag will be a few tiny.
5,Durable high quality carrier for all camera equipment and my computer
2,The empty bag is bulky and heavy yet somehow there still isn’t enough accessible room for my 2 cameras and their accessories. I’m disappointed.
1,I purchased this bag from Amazon about a week ago. I really liked the way it sectioned off my equipment. After packing for a trip I noticed a small gap between the side laptop zipper and the back of the bag. The material on the bag ripped exposing the padding I have not even used it once. This bag is garbage and it’s made of inferior material. Buyer beware you get what you pay for. This bag will never make it on a long trip or any kind of rugged Adventure. I am currently on the trip I purchased the bag for but as soon as I get home I am returning this bag I can’t state enough how disappointed I am in the quality of this bag.
3,I have no problem with the quality of this bag it is a very nice bag but it just isn't big enough for all my equipment. I find the velcro dividers to be less than reliable.
5,Great Quality
5,One good quality bag that can carry everything.
5,Seems as decently made as any other camera bag I have used including my Tamrac ...
5,Robust backpack. Good quality. Really big and spacious
5,Great quality product I haven't expected that though. Enough space for my 2 set of cameras lenses and a laptop. Will definitely recommend.
5,Exactly as described and very pleased with the quality.
5,I love that you can wear it in many different ways. It’s slick and sturdy.
5,Shipped quickly. Very nice product. Have 2 canon rebel cameras and both fit well and with all my extras
3,I like it except... there are no external pockets for my cell phone... rats!
5,I love it.
5,Sturdy and durable. Strongly recommended!
5,Well-made and durable. Fits a mirrorless camera body and two lenses
5,Una maleta para mis viajes en búsqueda de buenas fotos
5,Best purchase and investment.
5,Great backpack easy to carry out and a reasonable price. Wonderful!!
1,This bag is terrible. Twice it has opened up on its own (unzipped) and our camera equipment has fallen out onto the ground. When you have 5k worth of camera equipment you are carrying in this bag this is unacceptable & today was the last straw. Unfortunately our window to return this bag has passed but wanted to warn anyone else.
5,Excellent product. Very good quality.  Lots of room for two dslr's and accessories
3,Much too large for my photo equipment.
5,big bag and very user friendly
2,I like the size before purchasing but when it came its small
5,I lot space
2,took it on a trip over seas and within a month it had to be re sewed as it started to fall apart
5,Excellent quality and affordability. Very happy with this product...👍🏼
5,Perfect for me
5,PERFECT
1,It literally chirps when you walk. Something in the harness rubs against itself and it's actually loud enough to spook animals. Super annoying! I was trying to quietly sneak in to get close to eagles to photograph them but no matter how slow and gentle I walked this darn chirping scared them away.I tried tightening up the straps to the point it was uncomfortable but no such luck. Wish I had kept the packaging to send it back.
5,My wife got me this bag as an anniversary gift. I have a lot of glass including a 150-600. This bag hold 3 bodies as well as all my other equipment. Very please with its performance and size.
5,I love it
1,Haven't even had the backpack a week and the back panel has separated :/ the kicker is while packed it has actually sat in the car more than on my back Would like to return poor quality for what I paid for this pack
1,Not what it looked like in the picture.  All will not fit what they say will.
1,Be careful when you buy this bag the design was not the same and did not have the same features. I got a full refund but they did not function at all.
1,The zippers on this backpack are terrible quality. The zipper on the laptop compartment broke and my very expensive laptop fell out onto the ground and was smashed.
1,Replaced will see if the replacement will have no damage. It’s just a small issue but since I bought it new I expect quality out of the box.
3,First off this is THE ONLY backpack you will find that can carry 2 full wedding sets of cameras and then some but not only that it will 100% count as a personal item on 99.9999999% of all airlines. I've traveled with this pack on 20+ flights in the year I've had it have used it as my main pack on all my photography gigs and have even taken it hiking through countless miles... needless to say I've put it to the test and it's been great.The not so good: it ripped rather quick... also the bottom is flimsy and couldn't handle the weight of all my gear for too long. The bottom will occasionally poke at my back when the load is too much making the pack completely uncomfortable. This pack has so much potential but I will be looking for another one to replace it. The bottom tore into my back and tore off a big patch of skin while running across the Miami airport to catch a connecting flight.If you don't intend to put the pack through a ton like me then you may have the perfect pack!
1,Backpack is WAY to small!!!
1,Its very havey
5,This is an extremely quality bag for the money. Very comfortable when you put it on and wear it. Has plenty of space and customization. Highly recommend it!
5,Hi  I bought a backpack but it's the smallest and it's still good Can I exchange it for a bigger one and add the extra price؟
4,I purchased this bag as my daily carry bag for my laptop and some camera gear. I love all the pockets and configuration. Having the camera at the top was new for me but I love it.That said I've had a small issue where the shoulder straps are pulling out of the main bag. This could be a weak point in the design. I'm going to try to add a few stitches here to strengthen the connection point.  I routinely carry my Surface Book 2 camera several lenses speedlights and a trigger.I did have one other issue which is entirely my fault. I had traveled with the zipper partway open and I had a loose camera battery inside of one of the partitions. The battery slipped behind the partition and out the open zipper--lost forever. $100 gone. Partitions in this bag are not completely sealed as I can reach my hand from the lens area back through to the laptop area. Make sure you are zipped up before moving around.
4,This bag has so much space that I was able to fit other stuff in it for when I go hiking with friends now I don't need to carry around 2 bags! This backpack was also built really well it is really sturdy and has lots of areas that are protected such as the gray spot near the center which is a harder material. Overall great bag and will fit most of your needs.
5,can easily make both the top and bottom compartments into one. i can fit 5 lenses a supertelephoto lens and my camera w battery grip in this with some space left for any small items in the main compartment(s) then 2 extra external pockets for whatever like battery chargers extra batteries power bank cords wipes duster flash trigger and filters...has two sides with straps on each where 2 tripods are possible to hold...and this thing fits great..straps for arms and around waist with comfort..heavily padded and thick..i easily have around 35-45lbs in this carrying everything possible and it doesnt dig into your shoulders like other bags/backpacks can. worth the price forsure!!
2,I received this as a Christmas gift Dec 25 2020.  I was looking forward to this bag as I travel a lot and love photography and have a lot of gear. Drones GoPro's and of course cameras and lenses.  At first inspection it  looked good. So I loaded up my gear and 17" lap top. Yes it will fit a 17 lap top barely.Let me list Pro's and cons :Pro's1 - Lots of small pockets for storing flash drives and manual batteries  ect.2 - Rain cover. I know some of you might not ever need  it but I caught  in the  rain a lot so that was nice.3 - Well padded. (mostly)4 - Outside material looks decent for protection.Cons1 - This is a big one. The zippers are way to cheap for something like this bag. I transferred my gear from my old camera bag to this one. I loaded up the bag with one Nikon three lenses flash batteries and lap top. Not everything I have but the basics. I removed the lap top from the side pocket no problem tight but doable. With the compartment empty I tried to zip it up. The zipper end piece  fell off with NO stress on it. Making  one of the most needed zippers useless. Most of the zippers are way to light for this kind of bag. The pull loops also are not made of strong enough material.2 - This bag will not work as a carry on with  most airlines. The real dimension  are 19" (20" If it is full of gear)x13"x12" Not what they posted on the description  19.7 x 12.0 x 7.5 inches. With the thick heavy straps add even more depth.  I would have a 50/50 chance that they would have me check this bag on most airlines.3 - that brings me to to something some might not think of. This bag has a lot of loose straps zipper pulls bungee cords and plastic buckles all over it.  Great for catching on just about everything and a nightmare if you have to check the bag at the gate.4 - Padding this is more my gripe than a real flaw. I would have liked to see more padding for the lap top.5 - The handle on top of the bag to pull it up or carry it is way way to small and not nearly strong enough to carry the weight of the bag. Not to mention if the bag is full and heavy the handle is to thin and will get uncomfortable very quickly .I gave it two stars because it might work for someone that does not fly.  The lay out of this bag works. It is a good Idea and if the quality was better I would love it
5,This camera bag has a lot of room. If you are a begginger or expert and carrying around 2 or bags around every time you need shoot an event this is the bag for you. After putting all the stuff you see in the pictures there is still room I could out some small stuff.
5,Its big but it should be considering how much is can carry. I def recommend this bag
5,Producto muy completo uso mi Mavic 2 pero no el compartimiento de arriba y mi cámara abajo dentro del bolso que trae incluido muy cómodo ya que todo va en un solo paquete
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The product is defective and came missing one of the two handles on the bottom!  One of the zippers in the upper inner area came defective and does not close!
2,“German quality” in the product images here. It says right on it “Made in China” quite misleading....
5,I was needing to replace my camera bag and this camera bag had a lot of great pouches to offer. The zippers are durable and easy to slide. I like how this bag can be fitted to hold two cameras. My laptop fits perfectly in it and it fits comfortably under the airplane seat.
5,This is a well made bag with a lot of compartments and a lot of room.  The zippers are very good quality and the bag is sturdy but flexible at the same time.  So far so good!
5,I carry 2 cameras with various lenses plus speed lights. This bag has been able to handle everything PLUS carry my laptop and the other odds and ends you might need; such as extra batteries chargers thumb drives etc... Love this bag! Love the side zipper to easily grab my main camera without having to open the whole bag as well!
5,The perfect backpack for my needs!Since recently picking a song mirrorless camera i was looking for a backpack that could fit both the mirrorless my nikon DSLR and a few lenses for both. This backpack can easily be subdivided into two sections with quick access to each section. I’m using the bottom section for the DSLR and the top for the mirrorless. Each section has space for the body + 3-4 lenses depending on the size. There’s plenty of extra pockets  for my ND filters batteries chargers memory cards. There’s also a place for my laptop water bottle and tripod.Was considering the peak design everyday backpack 30L but glad i went with this one instead.
5,It's awesome bag for drones
5,This backpack is a solid camera gear carrier for someone with lots of equipment. It has the traditional fannypack carrier as part of the deal. Everything is high quality. Up there with the best backpacks I've bought over the years. Plenty of dividers for keeping things padded. Laptop compartment fits my 16" model great and is well protected.
5,This camera bag has plenty of room for multiple lenses and multiple camera bodies and other accessories that you may need. Also the separate smaller bag can be used separately for when you just need one camera lens combo. It’s also modular and can have multiple ways of setting it up in both the top and bottom compartments. I like how it has a side opening Velcro for access to the laptop compartment. It’s something that I would recommend for anyone who wants to keep all their camera equipment with them.
5,I tried many backpacks and this is it!Very nice Features. Normal sized tripods will fit in the side and are Not noticable while carrying.The inside is very Good protective for your equipment. I use it for one Body and 3 lenses (1x big tele lens)You have enough Space for cards adapters chargers and batteries. Its very nice and durable.Will fit a Peak Design Clip and Hold your Camera safe.
5,I purchased this backpack after looking at lots of reviews.  I needed a pack to take my photo gear on a hiking trip.  This pack is great quality and holds my gear perfectly - two Nikon bodies and four lenses including an 80-400mm Zoom.  Took a couple of tries to setup the panels just wright but then the pack worked great.
5,Loved this backpack.  Fit my 2 cameras 3 lenses and a gimbal plus batteries charges viewfinder and cables.  It's WAY more spacious than it first looks.  Highly recommend it.
5,I LIKE HOW IT HAS A LOT OF POCKETS. I CAN  PUT TWO CAMERAS AND 5 LENSES AND MY FLASH AND STILL BE ABLE TO PUT MORE LITTLE THINGS. I CAN ALSO CONNECT MY TRIPOD TO IT. IT LOOKS LIKE ITS MADE FROM GOOD QUALITY.
5,This bag is essentially the same bag as the PB-1. They both have the same shape same exterior storage and boast the same 25liter volume capacity. The PB-1 is just slightly larger in exterior dimensions but the volume remains the same. The PB-L is basically the same bag without the bulk of the additional shoulder and waist straps and mesh side pockets.  I chose the PB-L precisely because it was a PB-1 without the bulk.I was able to easily store my Nikon Df with the 50mm attached in the top compartment with my two flash units Peak Design strap 3 camera battery chargers and my MacBook Pro power supply.The inside flap pouch holds my lens filters for my different lenses.All the exterior pouches are handy but don’t get too excited about packing them up. I’ve been able to store leans cleaning supplies camera USB cables owners manuals pens and my personal pocket reference notebooks for my Df and D850. If you pack them up they won’t lay right to close the top area of the bag.In the lower compartment is my D850 with my 85mm 1.8D lens attached my 24-85 f2.8 macro zoom my 28-300mm 3.5 VR zoom my classic glass 35-105 2.8 zoom snugly stored in the compartments.The exterior bag holds my Peak Design wrist strap spare clips spare lens caps and covers my Peak design latch carrier system and a small tool kit and adapters for tripods and monopods.Behind the lower side camera access door I have my spare batteries for each camera.My pack weighs in at 19.5 lbs with all my gear. The shoulder straps adjusted high with your heavier gear in the bottom compartment makes for a decently balanced and comfortable pack. My tripod is a cheap one and is very light. Fitted in the side tripod carry pouch it doesn’t upset the balance of my pack very much at all. Otherwise I would definitely consider using the lower compartment locking straps to secure it horizontally.At nearly 20lbs the pack is decently comfortable for a day hike on or off the trail. It’s large enough to accommodate the gear most photographers would take for a day event wedding festival or sight seeing. It’s certainly big enough for all the photography gear I own and durable enough that I don’t see myself needing to replace it for quite some time.I hope I’ve answered some questions and gotten you a step closer to making a buying decision that is right for you. Cheers.
2,Does not come with SD card pockets like it shows. One of the reasons I got it. If that doesn’t bother you it’s a great pack with tons of customization! Wish it was more honest about it though.
5,If you are like me and have more then One Camera this is the bag for you. Hold a ton of stuff for your equipment. ONLY thing I can say Neg about this bag. Its not made for long lens.
5,Well made. Lots of pads and pockets. Has insert for additional gear on waist
5,Excelente mochila muy espaciosa.. La recomiendo y viene con todo lo que dice 💯👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
5,fits a ton of stuff!  i really like it because it's not super big but still has a ton of space!
4,It was Heavy without anything in so I returned it
5,easy to carry 3 camera body and 6 lens!
5,It's very nicely built only had it for a few weeks has a lot of cubby holes for smaller gear but it did fit my cannon 5d mIV with 4 lenses and a go pro with tons of accessories so has a lot of room
5,This camera bag comes with useful compartments that fits all camera gear from lens to tripod. It also come with an additional waist bag that can be use separately or on light trip. you can see how handy these are from the photo i took. Love it.
5,Fits everything I have and then some. High quality
5,This bag is setup to have a full DJI air 2s fly more combo in the top half and my dslr and at least three decent size lenses batteries and charger in the bottom. As you can see from the photos I use the two accessory pockets for cables filters and manuals.
5,Not much to say. just check it out for your self on the 705 FB page.
5,After a couple of years how amateur photographer my first bag was not longer capable to store all my stuffs so I look for a more spacious option. This bag it’s HUGE. I not only can storage my photography equipment I can also use it for traveling baggage
5,It has a place for everything…and everything is in its place!  This backpack was easy to put together to fit all my equipment securely.
5,Great backpack. Customizable. Holds camera lenses amd laptop no problem. Only negative is cross strap for sholser straps is to high on straps.
5,This is the camera bag I was looking for spacious enough for my 2 DSLR cameras and several lenses also put in my 15 inches laptop. it is sturdy rugged rainproof. easy to carry the material used gives breathing room for the bag not soaked with sweat. it will be my favorite camera bag in future adventures.TARION customer service is also top-notch very quick in response my first order accidentally ordered a smaller one they kindly referred me this larger version and made it easy to exchange. I really appreciate sellers and manufacturers like TARION this makes Amazon shopping trustworthy and getting the best value for my money.
5,I am delighted with the backpack and the amount of storage the different pockets and adding.It is a really super.
5,perfect camera bag
5,Un maletín bien construido y con buenos materiales!
2,Finally got around to transferring all my camera and photography equipment to my new bag. Been super busy. So anyway I get it out of the box and start putting all my stuff in the bag. I find a strap that is no longer attached..... it’s not super important but..... if you pay this much for a nice camera bag would of been nice to have it in working order.  Other than that seems like a very nice bag. Kinda bummed about this!!!
1,Don’t buy
5,Simplemente espectacular multifuncional y versatil la uso para mis viajes y me cabe de todo Mavic Air 2s Gopro 10 Micrófonos Gimbals Sony Zv1 Baterías y Mudas de Ropa es muy buena
5,I needed one bag to go mobile with all the gear. DSLR with extra lenses GoPro goods drone laptop and extras like tripods etc. This bag does it and I love the removable bag inside when I just want a quick go-bag for the DSLR.Great backpack great price and my colleague was so envious that he went and bought one too!
5,Ayant acheté il y a environ 3 ans un sac manfrotto modulable taille large je suis parti à la recherche du même genre de sac mais de taille encore plus importante. En effet bien que mon manfrotto me donnait satisfaction ce dernier ne me permet plus de tenir la totalité de mon matériel photo. Sachant que le modèle que je possédais déjà était le plus gros disponible j'ai eu à me rabattre sur quelque chose d'encore plus imposant. Après quelques longues recherches pour trouver chaussure à mon pied j'ai fini par trouver ce modèle d'une marque totalement inconnue mais offrant une taille sans aucune comparaison avec ce que j'ai connu jusque là.Donc en premier inutile de dire que la marque tarion est totalement inconnue ni de moi ni de personne dans le monde de la photo. Difficile donc de se faire une vraie idée du potentiel de ce sac en dehors des avis déjà donnés sur amazon. Ces derniers étant (à la date de mon achat) très positifs j'ai donc voulu m'y essayer. Il faut dire que les sacs à deux compartiments de très grande taille sont rares et que ce de dernier était clairement le meilleur que j'ai pu trouver dans cette catégorie.Donc en premier le point qui me convient plus que parfaitement c'est la qualité de construction qui est vraiment proche du sans faute ! Coutures de qualité tissus épais et très bien rembourré fermetures solides pas de doutes qu'il durera ! Sur ce point ce sac fait aussi bien voir mieux que mon manfrotto tout en étant plus abordable ! Petit point négatif de cette construction à noter malgré tout les séparations amovibles des optiques ne sont pas fixées sur la base du sac seulement sur les côtés. Ça tient bien malgré tout mais j'ai toujours connu des sacs ayant ces deux types de scratchs et je pense vraiment que c'est un plus pour la tenue du matériel. Autre point négatif à noter : la fermeture principale aurait gagné à être plus grosse que les autres. Ce n'est pas rédhibitoire sachant que c'était déjà le même problème sur mon manfrotto mais j'avoue que je crains un peu pour l'usure sur ce point. En dehors de ces deux points tout est juste nickel !Ensuite autre EXCELLENT point : la qualité de portage. En premier les amortis dans le dos sont nombreux épais et bien placés. Il est possible de régler le tout selon la taille du porteur un peu comme sur un sac de randonnée décathlon. J'ai toujours adoré cette caractéristique et je suis très heureux de là retrouver sur ce modèle. Me concernant avec mes 1m90 je place l'attache sur la partie la plus haute ce qui me permet de placer le tour de taille à bonne hauteur. En parlant de tour de taille et de tour de poitrine encore un excellent point sachant qu'ils participent à la bonne tenue du sac lors des déplacements. Fin bref cela se traduit par une excellente qualité de portage même avec un sac pleinement chargé.Autre très bon point qui m'avait fait choisir ce sac : la richesse et variété des emplacements de rangements. Il y en a simplement partout ! 3 à l'avant 2 sur les hanches 1 sur le côté 1 sur le dessus et même dans les rangements il y a d'autres rangements ! Pour faire le difficile je trouve qu'il faut vraiment être méthodique avec ce sac car on finit vite par oublier dans quelle poche est rangé quoi. Le compartiment photo est suffisamment grand pour tenir un boitier semi-pro avec 6 optiques (dont un 100-400 L). Le compartiment du bas contient un sac satellite bien pratique mais j'ai préféré le retirer pour me servir de cet emplacement comme d'un logement volumineux polyvalent (genre repas et pull).En parlant du petit sac qui fait office de satellite justement ce dernier est assez petit de la même taille qu'un lowepro Nova 140 AW mais avec des dimensions intérieures plus généreuses. Il est donc parfait pour placer une ou deux optiques avec un boitier pour l'avoir toujours prêt à déclencher. Ce petit sac manque d'un peu de rangement de mon point de vue sachant qu'il ne dispose que de 3 poches. Par contre un bon point est qu'il peut se tenir en sac banane en sac d'épaule ou même suspendu au niveau du torse via les attaches qu'on retrouve sur les tours d'épaule du sac principal. C'est vraiment un design bien pensé !Point noir à noter niveau utilisation ce sont les attaches pour trépied. Alors oui je suis content d'en retrouver car elles manquaient cruellement sur mon sac manfrotto mais à vrai dire elles sont pas vraiment pratiques car il faut glisser le trépied via 2 attaches qui ne tiennent pas forcément parfaitement l'ensemble fermement en place. Quite à avoir la possibilité de fixer un trépied j'aurai préféré un seul emplacement plus solide plutôt que deux moyens comme ici. A noter aussi : la protection antipluie fournie ne tient pas forcément en place quand un trépied est fixé sur le côté.  C'était déjà un défaut que j'avais sur mes autres modèles de sac mais je suis un peu triste de voir que pour l'instant aucune marque n'a trouvé de parade à ce problème.Le compartiment pour ordinateur est suffisamment large pour contenir mon PC de 13pouces et je pense qu'un 15 pouces tiendrait lui aussi parfaitement. La fermeture en question est en passant suffisamment protégée sur le côté pour éviter toute ouverture intempestive ou risque de vol. En parlant de cela justement il y a une tonne de fermetures par clip de tous les côtés pour bloquer les fermetures éclair (au moins deux par fermetures). Ca donne au sac un aspect assez chargé mais au moins ça protège efficacement contre les risques de chute du matériel à cause d'une fermeture mal enclenchée.Fin bref ce modèle joue vraiment dans la cours des grands noms de sac photo comme tamrac ou lowepro et à vrai dire il ne déçoit pas ! Sa richesse de rangements est poussée à l'extrême avec un design de sac satellite bien pensé ! Le prix est certes un peu élevé pour un modèle inconnu mais après quelques journées sur le terrain on comprend vite que ce tarif est totalement justifié. Un excellent choix me concernant ! Il a rempli parfaitement son rôle me permettant d'apporter avec moi la totalité de mon matériel photo de tous les jours avec encore assez d'espace pour loger tout et n'importe quoi.Fin bref très chaudement recommandé pour quiconque cherche un sac de grande taille et polyvalent.
5,Je cherchais un sac pour transporter mon matériel photos et diverses choses pour un pique-nique ou un trekking. Dans le sac dans sa partie haute je peux ranger : un Sony a7rIII des objectifs sony:  un 90 mm macro un 70-200 un 40 mm un 14 mm j'y mets aussi mes deux porte filtre nisi ainsi que des filtres dégradés et neutres (quatre en tout) mes batteries et divers ustensiles. Pour la partie basse il y a à l'intérieur une sacoche qui peut rester à l'intérieur ou être retirée facilement je me sert de celle-ci pour n'emmener que mon appareil avec le 70-200 ou mon appareil plus deux des objectifs autres que 70-200.Cette sacoche est très très pratique et la sangle pour l'attacher est très large et tient très bien sur les hanches malgré le poids du matériel embarqué j'y rajoute la sangle d'épaule pour un maintien encore meilleur.Le compartiment du bas me sert aussi de logement pour glisser une petite glacière pour un pique-nique. La qualité : pour ce prix c'est un très bon rapport qualité/prix des sacs beaucoup plus chers de marques connues ne valent pas et sont loin de cette qualité. Bref pratique ergonomique qualitatif il a tout pour réussir ce sac à dos. J'oubliais qu'il est possible d'embarquer au moins deux trépieds.Si vous recherchez un sac avec un gros volume et pratique alors celui-ci est fait pour vous !
5,J'ai cherché longtemps un sac qui comblerait mes envies de randonnée et d'exploration tout en gardant mon matériel photo vidéos / drone à l'abri et en sécurité.Inutile de dire qu'il rempli haut la main son rôle.. Il y'a un nombre très impressionnant de rangements et les compartiments haut et bas sont entièrement modulable un régal.De plus la qualité du sac et vraiment bon et je suis étonné vu son prix.Il dispose en son sein du petit sac ventrale supplémentaire afin de se délester et de partir avec son petit matériel.Que dire à part qu'il est aussi très confortable et qu'il est en plus réglable pour toutes les tailles..Franchement je ne regrette pas mon achat c'est un must have
5,Dubbioso inizialmente per il prezzo sono stato piacevolemente sorpreso perche vale ogni centesimo speso.Per quanto riguarda la versatilità un must perché mi permette di convertirlo da zaino fotografico puro a zaino da trekking puro senza limitazioni la capienza è circa 50 lt. Ho potuto inserire la tenda senza problemi all'interno.I numerosi ganci e supporti esterni permettono di lasciare libero sfogo all'inventiva per l'utilizzo.. dal supporto per bacchette da trekking al cavalletto in caso di fotografia o appendi borracce.Gli scomparti interni sono completamente rimovibili all'occorrenza.E le tasche esterne permette di avere una zona porta documenti in caso di viaggio.La borsetta accessoria può essere attaccata tipo marsupio ma anche fornita di fascia tracolla cosi diventa una pratica borsa fotografica per piccoli eventi o per portarsela in giro.
5,Super sac à dos pour les film maker. Ce sac à une grande capacité de chargement avec des accès rapide aux matériels. Il est confortable à l'usage. Pour ma part je peux y loger mon drone MAVIC AIR2 avec tous ces accessoires mon IPAD mon Hybride FUJI XT200 avec son 18-55mm un 7.5mm un 55mm un SIGMA 50-150mm un SIGMA 150-500mm. J'y loge aussi sur la poche supérieur avant mon OSMO POKET avec tout ces accessoires. J'ai les micros et moniteur dans la partie basse ainsi que des boites avec des accessoires. Sur cote j'y attache mon gros trépied NEEWER. Le plus le sac supplémentaire qui se loge ou non dans le sac principal. Ce sac n'est pas étanche il est livré avec une capote de protection. Avec l'ensemble de mon matériel le sac rempli pèse environ 14kg...
5,Topissime ! Sac de grande capacité bien fini avec de très nombreuses poches intérieures avec fermetures semble robuste larges et confortables sangles d'épaules (heureusement car une fois plein ça commence à peser !!: 12.4 kg dans mon cas) beaucoup beaucoup de petits détails. Petit bémol la pochette additionnelle qui me semble trop grosse pour mettre à la ceinture; j'ai préféré la retirer pour y loger mon Tamron150/600 + le 70/200 + 1paire de jumelles Monarch dans la partie supérieure un boitier Nikon D 750 avec un 50 mm 85 mm macro des bagues allonges + un Nikon Z FC  avec son objectif  une  bague FTZ Nikon.... un trépied et un monopode; et le poids du sac en plus bref un beau bébé; je ne regrette pas mon achat surtout pour un prix aussi intéressant.
5,après une rando de 8km je peut dire que ce sac est vraiment confortable il se ferait presque oublié malgré son poids dedans j'ai un fuji xt4 avec un 16/80 monté dessus plus un grand angle les trois batteries et cartes mémoires. Un drone dji mini 2 avec les trois batteries le chargeur la radiocommande j'avais la place pour un 100/400 et la partie du dessous je l'ai laissée sans la sacoche pour pouvoir mettre mon coupe vent une bouteille d'eau d'un litre et un pull et j'aurais pu mettre une bouteille supplémentaire. maintient impeccable. il y a mème des attaches pour mettre l'appareil photo devant et soulager le coup par rapport a la sangle d'origine vraiment top . coté défaut  le poids et l'encombrement du sac ne pas utiliser pour se promener en ville au risque de donner des coups aux gens en se tournant.pas grand chose a lui reprocher vu le confort .
5,I ordered this as opposed to a well known brand and was blown away with not only the quality and size but also the exceptional value for money compared to other well known brands.If your looking for a large enough backpack for your equipment then look no further than this great piece of kit you won’t be disappointed!
4,*'' Aufbau ***Wie auf den Bildern zu sehen ist handelt es sich nicht gerade um einen kleinen Rucksack. Knapp 29 Liter passen hinein die Außenmaße sind 31x19x49cm.Unterteilt ist der Rucksack in zwei große Abteile zwei Netztaschen an der Seite sowie zweier kleinerer aufgesetzter und aufklappbarer Fächer. Die Besonderheit des PB-01 ist das sich die beiden großen Abteile auch zu einem einzigen großen Abteil verbinden lassen und die ebenfalls im Lieferumfang enthaltene Bauchtasche. Letztere lässt sich zusätzlich zum Hüftgurt am Rucksack befestigen. Stichwort Hüftgurt noch an diesem sind ebenfalls zwei kleine verschließbare Taschen untergebracht. Hier ist zum Beispiel Platz für einen Schlüssel oder Reinigungstücher.Beidseitige Halteschlaufen am Rucksack ermöglichen übrigens das Mitnehmen von mindestens einem Stativ. In den Netztaschen findet eine 15 Liter PET-Flasche Platz.Sämtliche Reißverschlüsse sind mit großen Schlaufen ausgestattet und lassen sich auch noch mit Softshell Handschuhen bewegen für den Fall dass man mal an kälteren Tagen unterwegs ist. Um ein Eindringen von Regenwasser zu verhindern gibt es ein Art Überstand welcher die Reißverschlüsse der beiden großen Abteile abdeckt. So ist die Ausrüstung definitiv im Trockenen.Die aufgesetzten Fächer besitzen diesen Schutz nicht. Ebenso muss die Bauchtasche ohne diesen Schutz auskommen.Kommen wir zu den Trägern. Diese lassen sich in der Höhe der Befestigung am Rucksack anpassen. Ganz gleich ob große oder kleine Person mehrere Positionierungen sind möglich. Die Länge der Gurte lässt sich auf individuelle Ansprüche verstellen. Sowohl an den Trägern als auch am Bauchgurt. An den Trägern vom Rucksack kann man übrigens eine Kamera einhängen. Bänder inklusive Karabiner werden mitgeliefert. So stört bei der Wanderung kein Kameraband im Nacken.Das Obermaterial ist aus wasserabweisendem Nylon für sehr starke Regengüsse liegt eine Schutzhülle bei. Leider besitzt die Bauchtasche kein separates Regencover. Regnet es also sehr stark sollte man besser die Regenjacke über diese Tasche stülpen.Muss man den Rucksack oder den Bauchgurt absetzten befinden sich am Boden stabile Pads damit Beide sauber stehen bleibt. Diese Kür meistert der Tarion ohne Probleme. Erwähnenswert: Ein Handgriff oberhalb der Träger hilft den Rucksack anzuheben und zu schultern. Je nach Füllung kommt im PB-01 doch einiges an Gewicht zusammen.Diverse Innenraumteiler liegen dem Rucksack bei. Einige dieser Teiler sind komplett in hellgrau wie auch das Innenfutter des Rucksacks. Manche dieser Teiler haben aber eine helle Seite in der Farbe Orange. Bleiben wir kurz bei der Farbe. Im inneren hellgrau mit Orange an der Außenseite hauptsächlich schwarz mit grauen und orangefarbenen Akzenten.Bleibt noch die Erwähnung das auch ein Fach für ein Laptop vorhanden ist. Bestücken kann man über das obere Abteil in dem eine Klappe den Zugang freigibt oder einen Reißverschluss an der Seite. Bis zu 17 Zoll Größe kann man unterbringen. Besser kann man es wohl kaum lösen.*** Verarbeitung ***Man könnte bei dem Preis Bedenken haben ob denn alles sauber verarbeitet ist. Hier kann man eine erste Beruhigung aussprechen. Bei meinem Modell sind alle Nähte sauber versäumt die Reißverschlüsse laufen größtenteils ohne zu hakeln. Die aufgesetzte Tasche mit Hardcase-Deckel ist eine der Stellen wo es mit dem Öffnen nicht ganz so sauber läuft. Allerdings nur dann wenn man sie komplett öffnen will. Weitere Kritikpunkte bei den Reißverschlüssen konnte ich nicht finden.Ein häufiger Schwachpunkt an Rucksäcken sind die Clips der Gurte. Die größte Befürchtung ist dass diese Clips fummelig sind oder schnell kaputt gehen. Tarion hat das wie folgt gelöst: Man hat nicht die hochwertigsten Clips verwendet aber auch keinen totalen Billigschrott. Das Einfädeln der Clips gelingt sauber schließen fest und wenn sie eingerastet sind dann halten sie auch an den Stellen wo man sie haben will. Rein vom Aussehen des Kunststoffes darf man ein wenig meckern. Dieser dürfte vom optischen Eindruck gerne etwas hochwertiger aussehen.*** Tragekomfort ***Durch die Größe der Tasche packt man mit Sicherheit mehr als nur die kleine Kompaktkamera hinein und schnell kommen 10 Kg Last oder mehr zusammen. Dank dick gepolsterter Trageriemen und Bauchgurt verteilt sich die Last aber gut auf Schulter und Hüfte.Durch eine luftdurchlässig gepolsterte Rückwand hat man immer ein wenig Zirkulation um "unter" dem Rucksack nicht zu überhitzen. Schwitzen wird man an den Stellen wo die Träger Polster und Gurte anliegen dennoch. Ganz ohne geht es eben nicht.Durch die vielen Gurte sitzt der Rucksack auch stabil in Position wenn man sie denn alle anlegt. Ungewollte Lastwechsel oder das ein Träger rutscht muss man nicht befürchten.Die zusätzliche Bauchtasche erhöht durch den breiten Gurt zusätzlich die Stabilität auch wenn man sich damit vollends als Packesel outet.*** Fassungsvermögen ***Das Wort Packesel ist dann auch die treffende Überleitung. Denn wichtig bei einem Rucksack ist die Frage was man alles unterbringen kann. Freunde von Spiegelreflex-Kameras dürfen sich auf die Aussage des Herstellers von 2 Bodies (inklusive Batteriegriff) und bis zu sieben Objektiven verlassen. Laptop wie erwähnt inklusive. Das Stativ erwähne ich an dieser Stelle nicht mehr ebenso wenig den Kleinkram.In der Bauchtasche kann man so einen Body mit Objektiv unterbringen im oberen Fach als "Toploader" ausgebaut ein weiterer Body mit angesetztem Objektiv. Als Nutzer einer Systemkamera im Allgemeinen und MFT im Speziellen könnte man meinen dass sich Kamera und Objektive in dem Rucksack etwas verlieren. Das mag bei Objektiven wie dem Olympus M.Zuiko 17mm Pancake auch so sein. Bei einem 40-150mm F2.8 Pro sind diese Sorgen unbegründet.*** Negatives ***Wo Licht ist da ist auch Schatten. Da ich gerne ausführlich teste und nichts unter den Tisch fallen lassen will möchte ich auf eine Sache zu sprechen kommen die mir negativ aufgefallen ist. Es geht um den Geruch des Rucksacks nach dem Auspacken. Es roch gelinde gesagt sehr stark nach Chemie um das einmal umgangssprachlich auszudrücken. Drei Tage auslüften an der frischen Luft hat das zum Glück etwas behoben. Um den Geruch zur Gänze loszubekommen werden aber ziemlich sicher ein paar weitere Tage nötig sein. Ob es am Transport (Langstrecken Lieferung aus England via UPS) oder andere Gründe hat kann ich nicht beurteilen. Vielleicht ein Einzelfall vielleicht aber auch nicht. Es erscheint mir daher wichtig dies anzumerken.Ebenfalls fiel mir auf das die Träger auf der großen Wanderung phasenweise geknarzt haben. Ob sich das mit der Zeit gibt oder einfach dem variablen Trägersystem geschuldet ist kann ich in der Kürze der Zeit leider nicht beantworten. Es wird wohl nicht jeden stören ich selbst blende derartige Geräusche mit der Zeit aus.*** Fazit ***Ignoriert man den strengen Geruch zu Anfang so erhält man mit dem Tarion PB-01 eine soliden Rucksack der es versteht viele Anforderungen zu erfüllen. Wer lange Wanderungen plant und viel Fotoequipment mit sich führen will kann oder muss der bringt eine ganze Menge an Ausrüstung unter. Ganz perfekt ist der Rucksack freilich nicht. So könnte man Reißverschlüsse verwenden welche ohne Überstände gegen eindringendes Wasser geschützt sind oder man verwendet hochwertigere Clips an den Gurten. Das wiederum kann man verschmerzen betrachtet man den Preis. Konkurrenzprodukte von anderen Herstellern welche ein ähnliches Fassungsvermögen bieten kostet mehr.Ich selbst habe den Rucksack schätzen gelernt und halte ihn für den für mich perfekt geeigneten Reisebegleiter auf einer Fotowanderung. Für eine Wertung werde ich daher 4 von 5 Sternen vergeben den einen Stern Abzug muss sich der Rucksack durch den anfänglichen Geruch leider gefallen lassen.
5,Der Rucksack ist Ideal er passt exakt die zusätzliche Bauchtasche ist super vielseitig und ergänzt das Ganzezu einem tollen kompakt System. Absolut empfehlenswert.
4,It's a great piece of kit that does what it says on the tin. It's very sturdy and extremely versatile. It's also pretty cavernous so the temptation to overload it is always a possibility/probability.Definitely recommend this backpack 👍🏿
5,Jeder der Hobbymäßig sich mit Fotografie beschäftigt steht irgendwann vor der Wahl eines Rucksacks und jeder wird so seine persönlichen Erfahrungen auch schon gemacht haben genau wie ich. Hab mir aufgrund des Preises dieses Rucksack hier bestellt und hab ihn leider auch wieder zurück schicken müssen ist eben doch nicht der perfekte oder annähernd perfekte Rucksack für mich was nicht heisst der Rucksack ist schlecht im Gegenteil.Was zu bemerken ist der Rucksack hat viele Taschen und auch die Kameratasche in der untersten Tasche ist eine geniale Lösung hab meine ganze Ausrüstung unterbekommen dazu noch Trinkflasche und Kleinkram und es war immer noch Platz selbst mein HP 14 Zoll passt perfekt mit rein die Tragriemen sind sehr groß und breit der Bauchgurt tut was er soll und auch sonst ein durchdachter Rucksack mit guter Verarbeitung auf den ersten Blick.Warum hab ich den Rucksack dann doch wieder zurück geschickt? Ganz einfach er lies sich vollgepackt schlecht tragen die Gurte haben bei mir ein wenig eingeschnitten und das leider schon nach kurzer Zeit schade eigentlich denn sonst wäre der Rucksack fast perfekt für mich gewesen.
4,Hay que reconocer que tiene mucha calidad es robusto y con muchos compartimentos y huecos para la cámara objetivos y lo que quieras meter porque es enorme. Demasiado.Pensé que era más versátil y no tan rígida pero resultó ser compacta y parecía una astronauta de lo grande que me quedaba.Conclusión: para profesionales sí pero sabiendo que va a ser muy rígida.Yo la tuve que devolver y comprar otro modelo más pequeño de la misma marca.
5,I purchased this bag strictly for my travels for photography. I carry a pair of Nikon bodies as well as an assortment of lenses and spare batteries in this backpack. My 15.6" laptop fits (tightly) into the laptop section and I usually have a small tripod on the side in the loop/pocket securing system. In the year or so that I have been using this bag it has accrued several thousand KM of travel in dry and wet conditions.The adjustable shoulder height and waist supports make extended carrying of the bag simple and much easier than expected.Zipper pulls are decent but a slight bit annoying on certain compartments (Lower back). Wish there were more mounting options (Velcro/Molle/etc...) but a very good pack for the price.
5,I liked everything about it except for one feature the competing bag had going for it. The EVA hard shell is in the middle which itself is fine as your primary camera sits behind it slightly but I'm seldom whacked directly in the centre of the back and as the bag has wide set and stable plastic feet on the base I don't see it falling over too easily or to warrant the case being there. Furthermore it has webbing to allow it to not open fully or much really and with all of the compartments inside doesn't hold much. The bag I settled on has the EVA on the top (slanted at a 45) it's empty except for the lining and opens fully using the collar of the main compartment to act as a table of sorts as well as a secure compartment closer to the back of my head which is where I get hit more often than not if not paying attention while shooting. Back to the bag at hand... Overall the bags are virtually identical short of the colours used on the tabs and accents of and this bag has a name printed inside liner on the main compartments. It's beautiful. The child bag is a great addition but I mainly got it for travel via rail or ferry for walking trips. This bag allows full customization inside the main cavity. As i only have one camera and a couple of accessories I took the child bag out of the base and filled the compartment with clothes for the day or two trip iPad in the back camera up top and toiletries and cannabis goodies in the many supplementary compartments. Could use the child bag for a separate toiletries bag too depending on your trip and needs. Very versatile and well made a buy!
5,An excellent bag for storing my DJI Drone x 2 and a DJI Osmo 3.  One Mavic Mini in its case that fits three batteries drone and controller one Mavic 2 Pro in its case that fits three batteries drone and controller one Osmo 3 in its case and all the cables / chargers spare propellers and accessories that I have for all three items.  I also have a 9 inch tablet two cellphone / tablet holders for the DJI controllers and a 10 inch laptop stored in the bag. I do not have much more room; however it comfortably stores everything mentioned above.
5,Lots of padding and lots of room with multiple areas to store bodies lenses and accessories. I has a good tripod system. This is perhaps my 20th camera bag of one sort or another and it is my favorite for heavy duty filed work. I can carry two full frame bodies both with lenses attached and another 4 lenses plus batteries filters and a tripod with head attached.Packed up it is heavy with all the equipment but very comfortable with the adjustments available. The adjustments are not well explained but can be figured out if you play with it a little.
5,This case has plenty of space and then some. I can keep ALL of my lenses in it as well as my camera (with battery grip AND attached zoom lens) in it as well. Many compartments for the smaller things. Only issue I have is it won't hold a laptop (MacBook Air) properly. The upper lid bends over at the top. So unless your iPad or laptop bends you probably wanna leave it at home or carry it some other way. Aside from that there are lots of ties straps adjustable belt and shoulder straps. It's REALLY good quality and sturdy! I can't recommend it enough for the photographer on the go.
5,I was considering going down the usual route. Sticking with the industry leader Lowpro I was ready to drop $400 on a backpack. Then I remembered Amazon and in particular Tarion. I have already purchased a few items from this company in the past and very pleased with their products.Spotted the Pro PB-01 then watched a few vids on Youtube to see it being used. Took the plunge and splurged $125 including overnight postage and handling.Realistically I was expecting a reasonable product up to the task but still a few rungs bellow Lowpro quality. What I very quickly realised when it arrived was a very well thought out product design coupled with surprisingly similar quality to the Lowpro but nothing like a Lowpro design wise if you get my drift.Well done Tarion:-)
5,Carrying drone camera and video camera has never been easier. Very versatile backpack
5,This back pack all the feature you’ll ever need if you are into photography and you can organize the separators any way you want; I have a Sony DSLR with lenses a DJI Mavic 2 pro with the fly more kit my GoPro Hero kit with additional equipment and I still have room for other accessories wallet phone tripod etc. For me this is worth the money and 6 stars.
3,Was disappointed with this backpack.  Found it was much bigger than it needed to be.  Storage is okay but not intuitive to organize.  I was able to get all my camera gear in (2 DSLRs with lenses and extras).  However access to both cameras was not easy.  Build quality was average.  That said if this is your price point this may fit the bill nicely.  I ended up spending a little more and went to a Lowepro ProTactic which works much better for my needs.
4,I love this bag...tons of room and compartments. It is very well built. The only problem is that it is very heavy. They should have made it lighter.
4,La seul raison pourquoi je donne un 4 étoiles  est le poid du sac vide. Un peu lourd mais super rangement  super sac tout mon équipement rentre a 100% et j'en  ai beaucoup..... la qualité est incroyable
5,Great product! I liked the 'speed zippers' and overall bag design and quality. It is working perfect for my situation. Highly recommended!
4,Good value holds my 77D and 2 Maxxum 7000’s with lens.  Little bulkier then I’d like but for the price I paid I can’t complain.
5,This case has lots of room for cameras etc.I purchased mine to use as a carry on bag so my camera equipment etc is stored in the bottom and clothing in topWell made and thanks highly recommend this!!
5,Excellent sac rigide dont les compartiments ont été pensés avec soin.Je travaille avec deux caméras un drone et deux lentilles + flash + chargeurs batteries + trepied. Tout mon équipement a sa place bien définie.Et que dire de son prix concurrentiel? je réfère fortement!
5,After doing some research and purchased this bad I have to say it is simply awesome! Camera body 4 lense with 2 tripods still tons of room. Great quality.
5,Literally the best camera bag I have ever seen now I don't use it for camera gear I use it for fpv drone equipment and I can get everything in it everything. Padding is modular and secure very impressed with the quality
5,I was skeptical about buying a camera bag from a company i hadn't heard of but i am so glad i did!For long adventures this bag is great. Very comfortable at the right adjusted height loads of space and easy access to all your gear.When i first loaded the bag up and went out it was pulling on my neck a little but adjusting the shoulder straps to the medium or large height made this bag very comfortable (3 days hiking in the peak district with no issues or strain).I had a sony A6600 with a 16-70mm on a 10-18mm and a 70-350mm with a tripod on the side as my camera gear. Which left me the entire top compartment all the pockets and lot of space left in the bottom section. The dividers allowed me to tuck a pack rain coat and waterproof trousers with a power bank cables bag cover torch batteries gloves and cleaning cloths all in the bottom part of the bag with the camera.The top section had a jumper and food with lots of space unused. The pockets on the front held some lens wipes but remained mostly empty. There is just so much space that I couldn't fill the bag up completely.The camera compartment unzips and flaps down the access to my camera was easy and organised which made setting up on location a joy! The bag itself is very durable didn't feel heavy or oversized for me and was well worth the buy. Hiking with this bag was just simply amazing.The only 2 complaints i have which are minor are the bag makes an annoying noise when you walk where the adjustments system rubs on itself and the water bottle holder isn't the widest. I have a shorter stuby 1L bottle which was slightly too tight of a fit. A tall slim bottle is best.Other than that the bag was well worth the money if you are looking for a combination of a hiking bag and a camera bag.
4,This is a large backpack.  One of my only complaints is that there is no separation from the top part of the pack and the bottom. Of you have the bottom open your lenses can fall out from the top compartment.
5,Can hold so much equipment it gets a bit heavy but worked well on my latest trip.
5,Ce sac est bien confectionné.  Beaucoup de rangement.  Un peu lourd par contre.
5,Amazing size and versatility. Lots of room for 2 complete cameras and all my lens and flashes.
5,J’ai acheté ce produit pour pouvoir amener beaucoup d’équipement et il fait très bien le travail solide je le conseil!
5,The bag is a perfect size for content creators that travel with lots of equipment! Very sturdy and I can tell it will holdup on my travels! Cannot wait to use this thing!!!
5,Perfect for all my videoshoot i fit all my equipement in it (ronin-s tripod light tripods 2 camera 4 lenses and all batteries needed)
5,Very good
5,I was extremely happy and satisfied with this back pack. The quality is excellent and the storage capacity fits my photography equipment needs.
5,The best backpack i've ever had
5,Love how the backpack is divided into two compartments (and the extra bag). One can be camera gear and another for a small drone. The tripod pocket works well and very secure. The ability to adjust the harness makes it a truly​ custom fit. Love it.
5,Nice and big fits all my gear
5,Amazing bag for the price lots of pockets and compartments for all my gear.
5,Perfect exactly what I wanted
5,I love the design durability and mainly the quality. That's a big yes for photographers
5,Great buy
5,Good quality. Fit for 15.6" old laptop (thick & heavy). Plenty of rooms for camera and lens. But it bigger than I expected and quite heavy. Suit for travel not for daily use.
5,Excellent quality!

5,Very nicely built lots of room to put extra gear great purchase.I definitely recommend!
5,Der Tarion PB-01 ist ein mein erster richtiger Kamerarucksack. Was einem sofort ins Auge fällt ist dass er sehr groß ist und viele Reißverschlüsse hat. Bisher habe ich mich immer mit einfach Rucksäcken und Hardcase oder Taschen rumgeplagt und war immer wie ein Packesel unterwegs. Warum damit jetzt Schluss ist erfahrt in meiner folgenden Rezension:Für wen ist der Rucksack geeignet:Zu allererst. Ich bin Content Creator und überwiegend als Videograf unterwegs. In dem Tarion PB-01 verstaue ich mein komplettes Videoequipment und noch viel mehr. Für Fotografen ist er genauso gut geeignet. Ich hab zwar noch nicht die perfekte Aufteilung und den jeweils perfekten Platz im Rucksack gefunden aber ich denke das kommt nach und nach je mehr ich ihn benutze.Aufbau des Rucksacks:Der Rucksack hat quasi ein großes Hauptfach welches aber im Auslieferungszustand mit einem großen Trenner in der Mitte unterteilt ist. Im oberen Bereich des Hauptfachs sind mehrere Trenner mit Klettverschluss miteinander verbunden. Jeder Trenner kann aber komplett benutzerorientiert umgesetzt werden.Im unteren Bereich befindet sich eine große Bauch-/Umhängetasche die auch dem Rucksack gezogen werden kann.Sie kann separat benutzt werden oder auch im Rucksack gefüllt verweilen. Sollte man diese Tasche aber zusätzlich zum Rucksack nutzen wollen sind im unteren Bereich noch weitere Trenner so dass man sich den unteren Bereich des Rucksacks auch komplett individuell aufbauen kann. Auf der Frontseitr des Rucksacks befinden sich 2 Fächer. Eins mit einem Hardcase als Deckel und ein mit Gummibändern dran. Beide Fächer bieten Stauraum für viele Kleinteile. Im Rücken ist auch ein Laptopfach welches aber auch über das Hauptfach von oben erreichbar ist. An den Seiten sind praktische Netze für zum Beispiel Trinkflaschen verbaut und an beide. Seiten auch festziehbare Gurte für Stative und Co. Besonderheit auf der rechten Seite ist ein zusätzliche Schutzhülle in der die Füße eines Stativ gepackt werden können damit die nicht stören und vor Beschädigung von außen geschützt sind.Tragekomfort:Einmal gepackt lassen sich die Schultergurte in der Höhe flexibel einstellen.Ich bin 178m groß und hab den Rucksack auf die größte Größe gestellt. So liegt er perfekt an und die Polster und Belüftung des Rückens ist optimal. Der Rucksack ist jetzt zu 70% gefüllt und erlässt sich sehr gut tragen. Auch das Aufsetzen und Absetzen funktioniert gut. Er wird halt schwer.Aber bei soviel Stauraum auch ganz klar. Lieber einen schweren Rucksack als 5 Taschen und 2 leichte Rucksäcke!!!Verarbeitung:Also ich bin begeistert. Für das Geld bekommt man einen Top verarbeiteten Rucksack. Die Nähte sind sehr gut verarbeitet. Die Reißverschlüsse laufen ruhig und sauber und sind sogar durch eine überstehende Lippe geschützt die aber auch beim Öffnen nicht stört. Der Rucksack ist super gepolstert und bietet guten Schutz für das Equipment. Er hat eine dicke Außenwandung und der Stoff ist wasserabweisend. Für richtig starken Regen liegt dem Rucksack aber auch eine passende Rege Hülle bei. Die Zipper der Reißverschlüsse sind sehr wertig verarbeitet und durch diesen orangfarbenen Ring auch gut zu greifen und zu öffnen. Der Reißverschluss harkte bisher kein einziges Mal. Die Gummifüsse an der Unterseite sind auch sehr stabil. Und Rucksack steht fest im gefüllten Zustand selbst wenn die Fächer auf der Vorderseite aufgeklappt nach unten liegen. So kann man den Rucksack im Einsatz immer offen stehen lassen und Gebrauchtes sofort wieder an Ort und Stelle verstauen.So bleibt man organisiert und aufgeräumt unterwegs. Ich denke der Rucksack ist mit der Ansichtssache sogar so groß dass ich mir vorstellen könnte auch nur mit Rucksack einen 2-Tagesausflug bewältigen könnte wenn man das untere Fach für seine Schlafutensilien verwendet und die Bauchtasche mit weiteren Equipment füllt.Ach beim Rucksack sind vorne an den Trageriemen auch noch 2 Gurte mit Karabinern befestigt. Ich konnte den Zweck dieser Bänder erst nicht zuordnen. Aber wenn man Fotograf ist kann man diese Bänder nutzen um seine Kamera daran zu befestigen.Fazit:Für um die 100€ erhält man mit dem PB-01 einen komfortablen funktionalen stabilen und haptisch guten Kamerarucksack. Ich freue mich ihn auf meinen zukünftigen Aufträgen und Ausflügen mit dabei zu haben.
5,100% satisfied
5,It is a very big rucksack with space for camcorder camera lenses tapes psu's batteries tripod and everything you would probably need for photography. You can store a laptop also. The only thing to remember is the weight.Lactrodectus
5,Brilliant product. Highly recommend.
4,Je cherchais non pas un remplaçant mais un complément à mon actuel sac photo/droneJe pars de loin (dans le bon sens du terme) car je promène depuis près de 2 ans un fidèle Lowepro AW Protactics IICe dernier est une pure merveille. S'ils sortent un III je serai fou.Mais il manque un peu de place POUR MOI !Un boitier 5D4 + grip + 50mm + 100mm L + 24-70 28 II + 17-40 + Flash + Cactus + Mavic Pro 2 + 3 batteries + télécommande + Trépied ... Minimum car c'est le pack de base quand je pars en randonnée.J'ai beau y adjoindre des sacoches (système MOLLE) je me retrouve juste souvent. Car avec 2/3 barres pour la marche la bouteille d'eau le tph les clés la polaire au cas ou etc etcJe cherchais donc un sac plus gros. Pour y mettre le matériel PHOTO et DRONE.Les tests sur ce TARION sont assez dithyrambiques.J'ai donc voulu tester.A la réception une super impression se dégage. Bonne qualité bons volumes des solutions de rangement assez nombreuses (surtout pour les "gadgets" ou détails comme câbles etc) qui n'ont pas forcément d'endroit adapté dans mon actuel ProTactics.Donc de ce côté je pense que j'aurais la place.En revanche quelques déceptions :- la housse anti pluie traine comme ça dans le sac (pas de poche dédiée ou intégrée dans les doublures ou le fond du sac comme souvent)- pas d'emplacement trépied digne de ce nom. Les lanières latérales feront "office de" mais n'auront pas l'ergonomie de ce qui est fourni côté Lowepro en la matière.- les emplacements restent accessibles uniquement en déposant le sac (pas de système "Flip" ou autre comme mon actuel)Je vais finalement le renvoyer. Mais je le rachèterai. car c'est un excellent sac pour qui cherche du volume du confort et des rangements multiples.J'ai juste un autre achat urgent suite à la chute de mon boitier 5D4 !! et oui... Mauvaises nouvelles...Je conseille cet excellent sac
5,Produit acheté en 2019 pour un long voyage (en remplacement d'un sac Kata 3N1-33). A supporté et supporte toujours tout le matériel nécessaire à mes expéditions. Pour l'instant aucune trace d'usure extérieure. Le petit sac est une idée géniale et peut être utilisé pour une petite promenade une ballade (juste le reflex et un objectif) ou pour rendre d'autres choses accessibles tout en gardant le sac sur le dos (papiers porte-monnaie guides cartes etc. ou petit casse-croûte).Il est vrai que la housse de protection n'est pas vraiment à la hauteur (celle du Kata était bien mieux conçue). Mais avec un poncho (genre Quechua par exemple) de grande taille le problème disparaît.
5,Sono una fotografa amatoriale che ama fare le escursioni...Di solito faccio foto paesaggistiche e macrofotografia...E quindi capite che l'attrezzatura per entrambe le tipologie è ben diversa oltre al fatto che è più ampia.Cercavo uno zaino grande per poter portare tutto quello che mi serve per fotografare e per portare anche qualche accessorio personale tipo occhiali telefono cappellino kway ombrellino bottiglietta d'acqua e anche un panino magari.Tenendo anche conto del fatto che ho problemi di salute quindi non posso portare troppo peso sulla schiena e per troppo tempo... Qui di dovevo sentire leggera la schiena.Beh sono rimasta felice dello zaino e molto capiente suddiviso in due parti più due tasche esterne...Le spalline sono ben imbottite e regolabili anche per persone più alte di me (155cm) va da una taglia S ad una taglia L. E la fascia lombare fa sì che il peso si trovi sulle anche anche che sulla schiena...Le cerniere sono ben resistenti oltre ai lacci esterni per richiudere ulteriormente le tasche forse per evitare dei furti...In seguito vi elenco tutto quello che sono riuscita a mettere nello zainoOlympus omd5iiOlympus omd em10iiObiettivo 12/40 2.8 proObiettivo 40/150Obiettivo 60 macroObiettivo 9mmObiettivo 12/42Flash tt350oWireless per flash godox x1tLuce led con filtri e batteria2 treppiedi Manfrotto da tavolo pixi3 filtri ognuno nella propria custodia1 Telecomando remoto (Pluto trigger) all'interno della sua custodia5 batterie all'Interno di una custodiaOmino di legno di 30cmPalla di vetro 60mm2 pinze2 braccetti con pinza (tipo plamp per le macro)2 tappo corpo + 2 tappo obiettivo1 set pulizia (spray detergente + microfibra + pompetta)1 torcetta1 torcetta da fronte1 protezione per lo zaino1 set da 5 riflettori portatili1 treppiede k&f1 spray igienizzante1 crema solare1 auricolare1 telefono1 paio di forbici1 paio di occhiali1 confezione di fazzoletti1 kway1 bottigliettaInoltre è dotato di una borsetta con fascia lombare estraibile e completa di una tracolla.

Nel mio caso una delle mie Olympus con obiettivo attaccato più un altro .Se cercate qualcosa che vi faccia portare tutto quel che vi serve questo fa al caso vostro...E se avete poca roba potete usare una delle due tasche per portarvi magari un cambio completo di vestiti...
5,I walked 8 hours carrying my film equipment and some extra bits and this back was just fine. Did take me a while to get the straps right for my back but the added padding around the waste and the clips over the chest make it so comfortable.It has loads of space and each divider can be torn off and re applied using the Velcro backing in any configuration you can imagine in order to suit your kit.Can’t complain. So worth the money. And it looks really nice too.
5,Recensione realizzata dopo accurato test in trekking sul Gran Paradiso:lo zaino risulta essere molto solido già al tatto appena tirato fuori dall'imballaggionella tasca in basso si estrae il comodo borsello con tracolla per le gite meno impegnativeche può contenere al massimo un corpo con obiettivo montato se parliamo di reflex di alto profilose avete mirrorless ci sta anche un obiettivo piccolino di ricambioma per fare quattro passi in città è più che sufficiente e avendo il comodo fascione in vitapermette di non avere il classico dondolamento dei borselli meno professionali.Ci vuole un attimo a capire come dividere l'attrezzatura tramite i comodi separatori con velcroe la gestione dell'incredibile spazio interno permette veramente l'alloggiamento di un mare di attrezzatura.In ogni caso il vero best di questo zaino è il trekking quello verocon acqua ascese difficili e tante ore sulle spalle.La struttura gli spallacci la cinta e il materiale sono degni dei migliori Ferrinodopo quasi dieci ore di trekking in un giorno non ti accorgi nemmeno di avercelo in spallaa patto di aver regolato bene lo schienale per la propria altezza.In più il borsello diventa il tuo migliore amico una volta attaccato anteriormente agli spallacci con le cinghiee permette di avere sempre la macchina fotografica a disposizione in qualsiasi momentosenza dondolamenti anche in questo caso dato che il fascione viene comodamente clippato allo zainodando una sicurezza e comodità unica.Per quanto riguarda la quantità di attrezzatura che può contenere probabilmente un negozio non bastama nel mio caso una D750 con 24-70 montato una D7200 con 70-200 montato cavalletto micro della neewerbatterie sd varie e tutto questo solo nello scompartimento in basso.Sopra rimane lo spazio per panini pile tecnico cambio 2 borraccese invece volete alloggiare altra attrezzatura ci sono altri separatori per poter dividere anche la parte superiore.Nelle tasche esterne poi è alloggiato il copri zaino per la pioggiaportafoglio occhiali da sole e quant'altro vogliate metterci (di spazio non ne manca).Inoltre viste le spiccate doti da outdoor non mancano due tasche retinate laterali (per qualsiasi evenienza)e le cinghie sia per cavalletti ben più ingombranti sia per giacche stuoini e sacchi a pelo.L'unica cosa che potrebbe mancare sono le due classiche cinghie sotto lo zainoma in questo caso sono sostituite da due piedi rigidi in gomma per evitare che lo zaino cada una volta appoggiato in piediquindi non se ne sente troppo la mancanza.Voto decisamente 5 e consigliato a chi piace vivere la natura in tutte le sue forme con la propria reflex.
5,Ce sac photo du fait de sa très grande modularité me permet de mettre mon téléobjectif Tamron 150-600 avec pare soleil en place monté sur mon boitier Canon ainsi que 2 à 3 objectifs supplémentaires le tout en enlevant la séparation horizontale (scratch) entre les 2 logements (haut et bas)Les nombreux rangements complémentaires me permettent de mettre beaucoup d'accessoires en plus (Cartes SD Filtres Chargeur Batteries Housse Pluie ....)Le sangles extérieures me permettent d'y mettre mon pied photo.Pour l'étanchéité ne pas oublier mettre la housse pluie fournie avec le sac)
5,Es más grande de lo que esperaba (a pesar de haber cogido un metro y comparado las medidas con las de otras mochilas mías antes de pedirla) sobretodo al tener la forma rígida de "bloque" que no se aplasta que ocupa lo mismo vacía que llena. Me planteé en los primeros minutos devolverla y buscar una opción más pequeña pero después de un rato trasteando y probar a meter mi equipo me convenció.Buscaba una mochila dividida en dos partes para separar el material de cámara del resto (algo de ropa aseo un bocadillo) enfocado a viajes o rutas de senderismo ya fuese por trabajo u ocio. Hasta ahora cuando iba cargado llevaba mi mochila de cámara y otra mochila con lo personal o material extra. Eso se acabó con la Tarion: ambos espacios muy amplios bastantes bolsillos correas huecos para el trípode o estabilizadores buena protección comodidad en la espada (con las sujecciones de cintura y pecho) en caso de llevarla cargada etc. Lo cumple a la perfección y trae el añadido positivo del bolsito pequeño (que de momento lo dejo fuera y lo usaré para el no-trabajo cuando me baste con la cámara y un par de lentes y adiós mochilas).Por ponerle una pega el asa superior (el típico asa que está entre los hombros para mover la mochila) es muy finito. Al menos para el tamaño de la mochila no da del todo confianza cogerla por ahí si está cargada a tope. Pero puede que las apariencias engañen! y aguante todo lo que le echen quién sabe.Y por sembrar una duda no estoy seguro de si la aceptarían todas las compañías como bolsa de mano. En teoría por las medidas sí pero es un mazacote curioso del que más de un empleado dudará.
5,The Camara bag is very well made and as a lot of space for all of your camara gear.Well padded shoulder straps very study and as a added small camera bag included.Well worth the money i have paid a lot more for other camara bags but not had  the space or versatility as the Tarion Bag has  to offer Excellent !!!!
5,This exceeded my expectation. Firstly I'm a photography enthusiast and prefer wildlife and landscape and can in no way offer more insight than my recent experience with the bag. Initially it's bigger than I expected - even though I knew the dimensions beforehand it's always difficult to know for certain if these are accurate. It's comfortable with multiple positions for the straps to sit depending on your height etc. Feels robust and zips are smooth. Each of the clips feel relatively strong as does the grab handle. There's decent places for accessories depending on how much you want/need to carry - which for my is a nikon D750 body D5600 body sigma 24-105mm lens nikon 50mm prime lens and a MD-16 battery grip... that all goes in the top compartment just fine.I also found the space in the lower compartment if left without dividers is pretty handy for keeping sandwiches and other provisions if spending the day out. The additional shoulder bag was a bonus but not something I'll use often. It does clip to the main bag and sits around your waist... that said I found it doesn't stay tight and has a tendency to slip down. All in all it's not a bad addition if you need it... it also has it's own dividers.My only fault or criticism is not having a dedicated little pouch at the side for the tripod to rest in. I know it has webbed compartments but this still leave the tripod sitting quite high in my opinion... would have been better if there was a receiving pouch that dropped the height the tripod sits down  a couple of inches. That said overall could not be happier with the bag.
5,I purchased this for when I want to take both of my drones out. The modular design allows configuring to your preference. It also allows me to take all my controllers batteries and filters. Very comfortable even when full. Ample space for other items like Sun hoods cables and power banks.
5,Le sac correspond exactement à la description il m'a permit de mettre mes APN et Zooms facilement. Facile à porter et avec une bonne répartition du poids. Je recommandes ce sac à dos photo
5,Ist groß aber sehr schönund viel Platz
5,Prima di decidere che zaino acquistare mi sono massacrato di recensioni su ogni sito immaginabile e possibile. Il risultato compatibile con le mie tasche è stato il Tarion Pro Pb-01. Non ha niente da invidiare a zaini delle marche più rinomate e costose ( spesso ingiustificatamente ). E' enorme tanto che può presentare qualche problemino di organizzazione. I divisori con un buon velcro sono veramente tanti e si può sistemare tutto comodamente. Io ad esempio ci ho infilato una Canon D6 Mark II una Canon D450 5 obiettivi ( no supertele ) 2 caricabatterie tutti i filtri necessari le varie schede di memoria il telo impermeabile ( compreso nello zaino ) borraccia e cavalletto Artcise da 185m legato su un fianco....e mi avanza ancora dello spazio! Difetti? Due e non sono dei "veri difetti": è uno zaino robustissimo e quindi pesa ( quasi 3 Kg "a vuoto" ) ma penso sia indistruttibile o quasi; la borsina aggiuntiva per un secondo corpo macchina non è molto profonda e questo comporta non poter montare obiettivi molto lunghi: un 24-105mm ci sta proprio strettino. Ne consiglio l'acquisto senza problemi.Amazon quasi perfetta ( consegnato con qualche giorno di ritardo ) ma imballo ineccepibile.
5,La fiche du site Tarion promettait un sac plein de rangement et il faut dire que je n'en suis pas déçu !C'est en effet un gros sac à dos que je pourrai qualifier de multi-fonctions. Il offre tout de même 5 zones de rangement dans ce volume.Les sangles pour le dos sont réglables en hauteur pour s'adapter au gabarit du porteur et profite de larges bandes pour les épaules et le torse. Deux lanières avec mousqueton à fil sont détachables également (on pourra les nouer au torse ou pourquoi pas porter quelque chose..). Au niveau du ventre deux emplacements de rangement (pour des clefs des cartes CB etc... PAS pour un smartphone). Le confort du dos n'est pas en reste avec d'importants emplacement en mousse et des facilités pour la respiration du dos.Donc pour les rangements sur le dos 5 emplacements principaux.* Celui du haut permet avec son filet d'emporter une charge externe. Puis une fois ouvert donne l'accès à une petite zone de rangement de documents par exemple (cartes IGN documentation etc...)* Celui du milieu avec son aspect caisson gris pour les accessoires (stylo smartphone cartes etc...)* Enfin celui du bas est multi-fonction. Il abrite la housse externe pour emporter son appareil photo et un objectif (selon la taille 2 possibles) en vadrouille. A noter que dans cet emplacement des séparations supplémentaires permettent de récupérer l'espace pour l'arranger. Toutes les séparations dans les 2 sacs sont détachables !* Sur le dessus du sac une autre ouverture qui donne accès à la grande zone de rangement (appareil photo ou nécessaire de camping ?). Le fond donne accès à la dernière zone pour y stocker un portable qui est accessible également par une fermeture depuis l'extérieur gauche.* La sacoche de voyage possède une sangle pour l'épaule ou une ceinture ventrale détachable.A noter la présence d'un sac pluie.Le matériaux en polyester donne un bon aspect de robustesse les tissus internes sont ornés du logo Tarion les fermetures éclairs sont conséquentes (c'est pas de la petite fermeture). J'aurai un léger bémol pour les petits arceaux en plastique orange qui à mon sens dans le temps ne devraient pas être bien solide (à vérifier).Le tout avoisine les 3kg  à vide certes mais le compromis est dans la protection de notre matériel photo.Si mon commentaire vous a été utile merci de cliquer sur OUI.
5,Wenn der nächste Städtetrip oder eine längere Reise ansteht stellt sich für passionierte Fotografen oft die Frage: Wohin mit dem ganzen Equipment? Die Kameratasche platzt bereits aus allen Nähten zudem ist das Herumbaumeln auf Dauer störend. Die Lösung stellt ein Kamerarucksack dar welcher dank variabler Innenfächer individuell an die eigene Foto-Ausstattung angepasst werden kann. Beim Tarion Pro PB-01 handelt es sich um einen Profi-Kamerarucksack welcher im oberen Preissegment anzusiedeln ist.== Verarbeitung & Design ==Im ersten Hands-On fällt sofort die robuste und saubere Verarbeitung auf. Alle Nähte sind sauber gestochen alle Reißverschlüsse laufen leichtgängig und die Rückenpolsterung erinnert von seiner Aufmachung stark an einen Wanderrucksack.Der PB-01 ist komplett dunkel gehalten genau gesagt in Schwarz ausgenommen dem Hardcover auf der Vorderseite des Rucksacks. Hier macht das Tarion Logo auch auf den Hersteller aufmerksam.Beim Hauptmaterial handelt es sich um Nylon. Damit ist der Rucksack nicht nur äußerst strapazierfähig gleichzeitig ist er auch wasserfest d.h. er kann einen kurzen Nieselregen ohne Probleme überstehen. Bei einem stärkeren Regenschauer kann dann das mitgelieferte Rain Cover übergezogen werden sodass der Fotorucksack und die Ausrüstung geschützt sind.== Maße ==Der Rucksack verfügt über mehrere Innenfächer dabei ist der Innenraum in zwei separate Hälften unterteilt. Der PB-01 von Tarion verfügt über eine Gesamtkapazität von ca. 29 Litern was auf den ersten Blick wenig erscheint im Vergleich zu den Ausmaßen des Rucksacks. Hierbei muss aber beachtet werden dass der Fotorucksack über zahlreiche Polsterungen und Einlagefächer verfügt sodass sich die Maße von ca. 31 x 19 x 49 cm relativieren. Hier darf man den Fotorucksack nicht mit einem klassischen Wanderrucksack vergleichen.== Stauraum ==Im Rucksack finden zwei Kameras bis zu 7 Objektive (je nach Größe) und anderes Zubehör Platz. Ein Notebook kann in einem extra Fach ebenfalls untergebracht werden. Seitlich gibt es Befestigungsmöglichkeiten um ein Stativ mitzuführen. Die Stativhalterung arbeitet mit einem Dreipunkt-Halterungs-System damit das Stativ auch bei Erschütterungen festsitzt.Kleine variable Stoffwände mit Klettverschlüssen ermöglichen es den Rucksack auf die eigene Fotoausrüstung d.h. Kamera Objektive Blitzlicht und weiteres Zubehör auszulegen. Die Polsterung besteht im Innern aus EPE sogenanntem expandiertem Polyethylen. Dieses Material besitzt hervorragende Dämpfungseigenschaften sodass bei Stößen oder Vibrationen die Energie absorbiert wird.Weiter gehört zum Lieferumfang eine zusätzliche Tragetasche inklusive Hüftgurt welche Stauraum für weiteres Zubehör bietet.== Tragekomfort ==Das Gurt- und Tragesystem des Rucksacks erinnert stark an einen Wanderrucksack was den Tragekomfort anbelangt. Die Polsterung ist angenehm für den Rücken ausgeführt sodass Equipment ohne Rückenschmerzen auch über längere Strecken problemlos transportiert werden kann.Die Schultergurte sind gut gepolstert etwas Luft am Rücken ist vorhanden. Für größere Ausrüstungen mit Teleobjektiven wie sie Sport- und Tierfotografen benötigen sind der Brust- und Beckengurt sowie Lageverstellriemen unabdingbar. Mit dem Beckengurt lässt sich für längere Touren fast das gesamte Gewicht auf dem Becken lagern. Der Brustgurt verhindert dass die Schultergurte nach außen abdriften und damit die Schultern belasten. Mit Lageverstellriemen lässt sich der Rucksack optimal auf den eigenen Rücken anpassen.=== Fazit: Tarion Pro PB-01 Kamerarucksack ===Der Kamerarucksack Pro PB-01 von Tarion wird seinen Ansprüchen gerecht. Er zeichnet sich durch ein modisches Design eine sehr gute Verarbeitung sowie einen hervorragenden Tragekomfort aus. Er bietet zahlreiche Stauräume für Foto-Ausrüstung diese wird durch eine gute Polsterung vor Beschädigungen geschützt. Ein zusätzliches Rain Cover sowie eine herausnehmbare Tragetasche runden das Ganze ab.
5,Je cherchais un sac de grande taille pour y embarquer mon matériel photo/vidéo (boîtier objectifs trépieds micro filtres etc) mais également mon drone et ses accessoires ainsi que mon ordinateur portable. Je voulais impérativement que ce sac soit de bonne dimension pour l'emmener en cabine lors de vols en avion mais également qu'il soit confortable pour de longues randonnées et robuste.Ce sac est parfait pour cette utilisation car il propose 2 grands compartiments où je peux séparer ces deux types de matériels. Le second avantage est la sacoche fournie dans le compartiment bas où je peux placer l'ensemble de mon matériel de drone (Gamme DJI Mavic). Il est donc très pratique de ne s'équiper que de celui-ci lors d'un simple vol.De plus le sac offre une quantité de rangements énorme en plus des 2 grands compartiments modulables.Son seul inconvénient (mais justifié par son gabarit) est son poids notamment lorsque chaque gramme est compté lors de voyages en avion. Néanmoins la petite sacoche fournie peut faire office de sac à main lors de l'enregistrement et donc diminuer le poids du sac pour cette étape.Concernant la qualité ce sac semble vraiment robuste et est conçu pour durer dans le temps. Les fermetures sont solides et de nombreuses sangles servent à maintenir le sac en place. Sa qualité vaut amplement les sacs photos de grande marque selon moi.Hormis son poids ce sac présente tous les avantages pour de longues balades et randonnées. Le réglage de la taille au niveau des bretelles et les nombreux rembourrages garantiront un confort certains.Pour conclure ce sac est parfait pour mon utilisation. Son rapport qualité/prix est excellent. La livraison est très rapide.Je le recommande vivement aux personnes ayant l'intention d'embarquer beaucoup de matériel lors de leurs déplacements !
5,Zunächst einmal: Ja der Rucksack ist riesig und vermutlich nur etwas für Fotografieenthusiaten mit viel Ausrüstung oder für Profis. Ich finde ihn super da er wie von Tarion gewohnt super verarbeitet ist und sehr hochwertig aussieht und sich anfühlt. Außerdem lässt er sich sehr bequem tragen. Alle Tragegurte lassen sich individuell auf den Rücken des Nutzers anpassen. Zur Stabilisierung hat der Rucksack zwei dicke Polster an der Hüfte welche gut stützen und so ein hin und her wackeln beim Laufen vermeiden. Diese beiden Hüftgurte haben je ein Reißverschlussfach. Dort bewahre ich meine SD-Karten und Ersatzakkus auf so hab ich jederzeit Zugriff zu diesen wichtigen Dingen ohne den Rucksack abzusetzen.Nun zu den Hauptfächern:Der Rucksack ist in zwei große Hauptfächer aufgeteilt die durch eine Trennwand abgetrennt sind. Zur Not lässt sich diese genau wie alle anderen Trennwände herausnehmen.Das untere Hauptfach benutze ich für meine gesamte Drohnenausrüstung. Hier findet meine Drohne Fernbedienung Akkus Kabel Ersatzteile und viel Weiteres Zubehör seinen Platz.Das obere Hauptfach ist mein Kamerafach. Hier sind meine Kamera inkl. angestecktem Objektiv 3 weitere Objektive ein Blitz mit Zubehör Kabel und weiteres Zubehör zu finden. Das obere Hauptfach lässt sich auch halb öffnen um nur die Kamera herauszuholen.Gesichert sind beide Hauptfächer mit Reißverschluss und zusätzlichen Klick-Verschlüssen.Auf der Vorderseite des Rucksacks befinden sich noch zwei weitere Fächer für Kleinkram. Das obere ist ein weiches Stofffach welches ich für Filter nutze. Es hat außerdem auf der Außenseite ein Gummiband um etwas darunter zu klemmen z.B. eine Wanderkarte.Das zweite kleine Außenfach ist ein Hartschalenfach. Darin bewahre ich alles notwendige auf um Kamera Drohne und Objektive zu säubernAn beiden Seiten des Rucksacks befinden sich Befestigungsschlaufen für Stative. Allerdings verbirgt sich nur auf einer Seite eine spezielle Stativhalterung die bei Bedarf aus dem Boden des Rucksacks gezogen werden kann.Beide Seiten haben außerdem Netze für z.B. Getränkeflaschen. Man könnte aber auch ein Objektivköcher hineinbekommen wenn man mit einem Super-Tele unterwegs ist.Es gibt außerdem noch ein Klarsichtfach für Namensbeschriftung des Rucksacks. Hier findet eine Visitenkarte eine perfekten Platz.Alles in allem ist der Rucksack ein wahnsinnig toller Begleiter für Fotobegeisterte die sich nicht scheuen viel mitzunehmen oder viel Platz benötigen.Im Lieferumfang befindet sich außerdem wie auf dem Verkaufsbild zu sehen eine Kleine Tragetasche. Diese könnte man bei Bedarf im unteren Hauptfach des Rucksacks verstauen wenn man dort alle Trennwände herausnimmt so könnte man bei einer großen Tour den Rucksack im Camp lassen und nur das wichtige grade in die kleine Tasche tun obwohl es von außen den Anschein macht nur ein Gepäckstück zu haben.Auf den Bildern kann man sich ansehen wie riesig der Rucksack ist und wie ich ihn gepackt habe.Ich gebe dem Rucksack gerne eine 5 Sterne Bewertung er hat es verdient.
5,Il quasi è riferito alla parte sottostante che non ha la facilità di chiusura della parte superiore. Gli scomparti sono accettabili chiaramente non è un tink tank ma vi assicuro che è ben fatto paragonandolo ad altri marchi noti che ho. Ideale per chi vuole portarsi dietro proprio tutto drone compreso. scomoda l'apertura per il notebook interna ma per fortuna c'è un'altra apertura laterale che consente di usare il computer senza aprire lo zaino
5,We love this camera backpack. It's the first we found that has everything we need. Plenty of storage for all sizes of equipment and it fits our camera several lenses gimbal drone audio gear camera cleaning kit...etc. The little front bag it comes with is also brilliant. It also feels heavy duty and high quality.My only issue is that this is a backpack made for men and I wish it would have advertised that in the description. With a back arch and hips this backpack is very uncomfortable. I simply can't wear it. Thankfully my husband can so he'll be carrying around the camera gear from now on.
5,So many compartments. Very well made. Quite big but it does allow you to carry hell of a lot of kit.
4,Le sac est correct bon rapport qualité prix. Son design est sympathique mais je ne vais pas m'étendre sur ce sujet d'autres commentaires très bien faits en parle déjà idem pour les photos. Celles publiées sont très bien.Mais...Je trouve que les bretelles du sac et la ceinture de maintien ne sont pas au top bretelles trop courtes et ceinture trop haute pour moi (Mesure 1m86.)Je trouve dommage également que la pochette supplémentaire doive être insérée droit dans la partie basse du sac j'aurais aimé avoir ce sac avec quelques (2 ou 3cm) plus ample sur la partie basse pour choisir de le mettre en longueur. Actuellement cela rend impossible de pouvoir y ranger la pochette appareil photo et une pochette pour mon drone (DJI Mavic)Le dernier gros point noir c'est la housse de protection contre la pluie. Elle fait son job je suis d'accord mais... Le sac est clairement prévu pour mettre un voir 2 trépieds sur les cotés la aussi c'est très convenable. Mais admettons je parte en vadrouille un trépied sur le coté et bim il pleut. Il faut choisir soit tu met la housse soit le trépied. Les deux non du coup soit tu protèges ton sac en laissant le trépied sur le bord de la route (Solution qui m'arrange pas des masses) Soit tu protèges pas ton sac s'il pleut (Entre nous ça m'arrange pas trop non plus) sur mon gros sac à dos Deuter la housse de pluie est très ample et permet de la placer par dessus un trépied.Dommage que ce sac ai uniquement une housse qui est plus que limite même avec le sac vide.Autrement je reviens sur ce que j'ai dis au début malgré ces quelques points le sac est correct semble de bonne facture (Pas essayé longuement à voir dans le temps)Si ce commentaire vous a été utile merci de l'indiquer.Bonne journée.
5,I have quite bulky camera gear and was pleased to find it all fitted comfortably in the bag.  Lots of compartments for the bits and pieces too.
5,Der Rucksack geht ohne Probleme durch das Handgepäck Ausrüstung wird ordentlich verstaut und ist sicher. Wertige Qualität und breite Riemen. 1a
5,Loving this bag. One compartment for analogue (Mamiya c33 Nikon F2 plus lenses) the other for my fujifilm mirrorless collection. Very comfortable to carry - highly recommended.
4,je conseille beaucoup de rangement
5,Mi serviva uno qualcosa  dove mettere tutto il mio corredo fotografico e in  questo zaino ho potuto mettere TUTTO . Ho scelto questo zaino perché corredato di un marsupio/borsa che può essere messo nella tasca inferiore ciò porta dei vantaggi enormi : posso portare tutto  a discapito di mobilità e peso. se mi servisse mobilità posso lasciare lo zaino e usare il marsupio con il minimo indispensabile .Sono riuscito a riporre dentro  senza problemi :macbook pro 13"carica batteria machub usb macZ6 con z 24-70 mm f4anello adattatore ftznikon 50mm f1.8Tamron 90mm f2.8 macronikon af-s 70-300 fxCarica batterie nikon da casaCarica batterie nikon per 2 batterie da viaggio con presa usb2 batterie el15filtriflashborsa con mavic air mini 2 combopowerbanck akuey da 20000 mhacavallettoE' inutile dire che il peso è esorbitante  ma cosi ho sempre la borsa pronta con tutto il necessario e comunque c'è sempre la possibilità di portare solo il marsupio per le piccole uscite .Lo schienale è regolabile in base all'altezza del utilizzatore .L'azienda sostiene che lo zaino sia già di suo impermeabile ma viene anche fornita la copertura antipioggia in caso di pioggia abbondante .Non ha nulla da invidiare ad altre marche più costose ecco perchè per me è 5 stelle piene.
5,I used the upper compartment for my camera (Pentax K1 Mark II full frame Pentax 150-450 mm tele zoom 28-105 zoom 14 mm wide angle teleconverter and extension tubes). I still save some space for sunglasses selfie stick etc. there. I can use the lower compartment for my clothes snack and additional drink bottles. The small pockets are good for wallet batteries etc. Outside I can store my travel tripod couple of bottles hiking sticks jacket etc. There are two straps for hanging the SLR camera on the front size. I like it very much -  no need to use the loop around the neck! I am very happy with the backpack but due to lot of space it usually becomes very heavy (14 - 15 kg in my case). The additional small camera bag is very nice for a short walk or as an additional bag during very long hikes but I didn't use it much yet. What is missing? I would like to have mobile phone holder and sunglasses holder on the front size. Those would make the backpack perfect but even without them I give 5 stars.
5,Ich habe mir diesen Rucksack zugelegt in der Hoffnung all meine Reise-Fotoausrüstung unter zu bekommen.Nun greife ich mal etwas vor und kann sagen das ich von der Qualität absolut begeistert bin.Namenhafte Konkurrenten haben ähnliche Rucksäcke die entweder ähnlich Platz bieten oder ähnlich Zugang zum Gear. Beides zusammen habe ich aber vergebens gesucht! Dazu noch in dieser Preisklasse!Kommen wir zunächst zur Qualität: Der Rucksack fühlt sich sehr hochwertig und gut verarbeitet an. Alle Reißverschlüsse sind mit gummierten Laschen versehen. Dies erhöht die Griffigkeit (sehr gut bei Regen).Es gibt mehrere Möglichkeiten die einzelnen Fächer zu sichern. Nicht nur durch die Reißverschlüsse auch über Eine Art Schnürrtechnik.Der Tragekomfort ist sehr hoch. Selbst wenn viele Ausrüstungsgegenstände und damit viel an Gewicht im Rucksack steckt. Die Tragegurte sind gut gepolstert und können auch am Rucksack in der Höhe (drei Stufen) angepasst werden. Ich bin 193 m groß. Der Taillenverschluß gibt zusätzlich halt.Die Staufächer sind in mehrere Bereiche unterteilt und bieten unglaublich viel Platz. Ich habe 2 große Bodys inkl. einige Objektive im oberen Teil verstaut. Dazu noch Fernbedienungen für Beide...Im hinteren Bereich habe ich zwei Blitze Sender und Empfänger Ladegeräte und und und verstaut.Die Liste meiner im Rucksack verstauten Ausrüstungsgegenstände ist riesig.Ich besitze auch einen kleineren (Namenhaften) Fotorucksack. Seit ich diesen hier besitze fliegt der andere nur noch in der Ecke rum.An jeder Stelle gibt es Möglichkeiten etwas zu verstauen oder zu befestigen. Es passen entweder 2 Stative an den Seiten oder eine Trinkflasche und ein Stativ.In den flachen Fächern die vorn angebracht sind können Speicherkarten Batterien usw. verstaut werden.Die Farben passen sehr gut ohne dabei extrem zu wirken.Von mir gibt es eine klare Kaufempfehlung!
5,Dieser Rucksack ist absolut professionell sowohl von der Verarbeitung als auch in den Details der Ausstattung.Als Beispiel sollen die Reißverschlüsse dienen: schnell aufzufinden da sie mit signalgelben Zippern versehen sind.Riesig viel Platz! Ich nutze den unteren Teil als Kameratasche eine Spiegelreflex Nikon D750 mit Zoomobjektiv und zwei Obejektive davon ein großes 200er Zoom.In den oberen Teil passen endlich alle meine Dinge für den (Wander-)Tages- oder Reisebedarf (Flug- Handgepäck tauglich!). Verpflegung Sonnenbrille Kamerazubehör. Festplatte...Das kann man natürlich auch umgekehrt machen zahlreiche Polster für die Unterteilung sowohl unten als auch oben sind beigelegt.Das seitliche Einschiebefach für meinen 156" Laptop ist groß genug und leicht gängig. Gut gepolstert.Zahlreiche Straps Seitentaschen für Getränke Regenhülle Handy vorhanden. Für die (Reise-)Dokumente bzw.  Speicherkarten und Linsen sind zwei aufggesetzte Fächer eines davon Stoß geschützt!Und das Beste: minimales Eigengewicht!!! Alle Fototaschen die ich vorher hatte hatten an der Schulter gezerrt. Dieser sitzt perfekt und ist für die Rückenlänge passgenau einstellbar so dass die Hüftgurte an der richtigen Stelle aufsitzen. Trotz voller Bepackung kann ich den Rucksack stundenlang tragen ohne die Schulter oder den Rücken zu spüren.Meine (minimale) Ausrüstung (s.o.) passt in den separaten Daypack wenn ich ausschließlich eine Tagestour ohne Rucksack nur zum Fotografieren machen will (z.B. in der City!).Für den Mini-Preis knapp über 100-- EURO ein Schnäppchen!Würde ich iommer wieder kaufen!
5,Lo zaino è molto bello e capiente
4,Für Ein- oder Zweitagestouren bestens geeignet. Mein gesamtes Equipement findet prima Platz. Die variable Aufteilung ist sehr funktional die Kamera ist im Transport oben im großen Fach gut gelagert. Während der Wanderung kommt sie an eine der Halteschlaufen an dem Schulterriemen und ist jederzeit sofort zu greifen. Die zahlreichen mitgelieferten Bänder ermöglichen flexible Fixierung so dass die Kamera nicht hin und her baumelt.Für die Objektive für Akkus Speicherkarten ND-Filter Blaseblag Ladegerät etc. ist ausreichend Platz. Das Stativ kann bequem außen seitlich befestigt werden und sitzt dort bombenfest. Es bleibt Platz für eine große Getränkeflasche (15 l) auf der anderen Seite. Das untere Fach kann dann für Wechselkleidung und die Brotzeit genutzt werden. Die kleine Tasche die mit dem Rucksack mitgeliefert wird ist für kurze Ausflüge etwa in die Stadt ausreichend. Es passt eine Kamera (Format Sony a6000 mit einem normalen Objektiv und einem normalen Wechselobjektiv gut hinein. Die kleine Tasche kann entweder mit einem Schultergurt umgehängt werden besser ist die Verwendung des mitgelieferten Bauchgurtes.Das hohe Leergewicht des Rucksacks machte mich anfangs skeptisch. Der Rucksack lässt sich auch voll gepackt sehr gut tragen. Das Gewicht verteilt sich gut auf den Körper selbst nach 6 Stunden hatte ich keine Druckstellen hat nichts gescheuert einfach perfekt.Die Verarbeitung ist tadellos die Reißverschlüsse sind leichtgängig und auch mit Handschuhen gut bedienbar. Das Obermaterial ist stabil schmutzt nicht leicht ein und ist leicht zu reinigen. Für Wanderungen im Regen liegt ein Überzug bei.Einziger Kritikpunkt meinerseits sind die Taschen am Bauchgurt. Gerade einmal so groß dass ein Objektivdeckel rein passt. Hier hätte ich gerne mein Händy untergebracht geht aber nicht. Die Taschen sind zudem sehr weit hinten angebracht so dass man nur mit Mühe drankommt wenn man den Rucksack nicht abnehmen will. Diese Taschen ein paar Zentimeter breiter gemacht und gut 10 cm nach vorne versetzt dann wäre der Rucksack für mich wirklich perfekt.
5,Nachdem ich mir ein paar Rezensionen durchgelesen habe wollte ich mir selber ein Bild machen.Also:Er riecht nicht nach Chemie!Er hat massig Platz!Ich benutze ihn als Profi.Er könnte ein paar Fächer mehr haben (Akkus Kabel etc....).Ansonsten ein sehr gut durchdachter Rucksack.was viele monieren dass die Zwischenwand (Ober und Unterfach) so durchhängt.... Nunja da kann man stabileres einsetzen und gut ist oder?Von mir eine klare Kaufempfehlung!
5,Testato ormai in diverse condizioni posso dire che è lo zaino fotografico migliore che abbia posseduto fino a ora. A vuoto è relativamente leggero pur avendo un'ottima struttura rigida ed essendo super comodo grazie anche alla possibilità di regolare lunghezza e posizione degli spallacci. Non ha le zip impermeabili ma non è mai entrata umidità o polvere fine all'interno. all'occorrenza comunque c'è la cover impermeabile in dotazione.
5,Arrivato in anticipo contiene tutto quello di cui ho bisogno per lavorare: drone macchina fotografica cam 360 gimbal  e tutti gli accessori più il computer. Per la resistenza vedremo col tempo. Al momento dico che soddisfa pienamente la mia necessità di distribuire il peso sulla schiena rispetto ad altri zaini usati in passato.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               J'ai acheté ce sac à dos afin de ranger mon drone et ses accessoires lorsque je suis de sorti et je peux vous dire que je ne suis pas déçu. Il a des rangements de partout que l'on peut modifier grâce aux multiples coussins séparateurs  fourni avec. Des poches à fermetures zippées en veux tu en voilà. Une "petite" sacoche est également fourni et elle s'intègre parfaitement dans l'emplacement inférieur du sac à dos. Une fois cette sacoche sorti elle laisse place a un grand espace que l'on peut amenager à sa façon. Soit avec les séparateurs (fourni) soit pour autre choses (style: vêtement / boisson / collation)Les bretelles sont réglables dans tous les sens devplus elles sont épaisses et confortables ainsi le sac est agréable à porter.. pas encore essayé sur une grande distanceUne protection anti-pluie au contour élastique est également fourni en plus  permettant d'englober tout le sac de façon à le protéger en cas d'intempérie. Le sac tient debout sur un sol plat c'est topCertes il est un peu gros mais on range tout dedans. Ça à l'air d'être du costaud en plusJe suis vraiment ravi de mon achat
5,Acheté pour du matériel photo et drone (stab et FPV). Pas si grand que ça mais le nécessaire pour une rando à la journée (appareil photo trépied deux objectifs anafi drone fpv sur l'extérieur avec radio masque sac à LiPos gopro pièces et outillage minimum la bouffe et l'eau) rentre et il reste encore un peu de place !Une fois sur le dos il n'y a pas de gêne particulière donc pas de soucis de confort pour moi. Pour la solidité à voir dans le temps.Seul reproche la poche ordinateur pas très pratique et le mien un peu épais en 15.6" a du mal à rentrer il faut forcer...
4,alla ricerca di uno zaino da usare tutti i giorni in moto in particolare ho bisogno di molte tasche alla fine mi sono inbattuto su questo... mi ha affascinato il fatto di poter estrarre la borsa nella parte inferiore... il che sarebbe anche comodo... pero' per andare in giro sinceramente e' un po' troppo grande.... per il resto mille tasche accessibili.... buono il fatto che puoi mettere una carta davanti e aprire solo la zip.. molti agganci per metterci le chiavi... tante tasche.... alcune potrebbero risultare un po' scomode da aprire.... pero' in generale soddisfatto... certo e' ingombrante... ci fosse stata una misura leggermente piu' piccola sarebbe stato il top.... e' comuqneu consigliatissimo... ah se siete diversamente magri bisogna fare una prolunga per poter allacciare la cinta frontale
4,なかなか気に入った製品がなくて40年近く以前のバッグを使ってました。このバッグは外形寸法以上に内容量が有る感じ。スペースの使い方に無駄が無い。2泊位の旅行ならボディ2台レンズ4本ノートパソコン1台その他小物と夏物の着替えを入れて行けそう。登山にも充分使えると思います。レインカバーが付いて防水は問題無さそう。耐久性についてはまだ使い込んで無いので正確な事は言えませんが造りはしっかりしてるので10年20年は使えると思いますよ。あえて注文を付けるとするなら三脚ホルダーをしっかりしたものを着けて欲しい。全体的にはコストパフォーマンスに優れたお買得品だと思いますよ。大型のしっかりしたカメラバッグをお探しの方にはお勧め出来ます。
5,Great bag lots of space for cameras and all the kit we need to carry.It'll take 2 DSLR's and a load of lenses flashguns powerbanks batteries and a laptop/tablet without any trouble.Of course by this time you are carrying a very heavy bit of kit especially if you've attached a tripod/monopod to the outside as designed (or both one each side).There are compartments inside for memory cards and also a waistbag that will clip to the main bag should you wish to.Decent quality fabric good zips well padded shoulder straps make this a fantastic bag for the price. I'm delighted with it and feel it was a good purchase.A few niggles. The two exterior compartments are a nice height and width but they could be a bit deeper especially the lower one it looks like a good sized boxy shape but is just to thin to be perfect.The top hand strap feels a little flimsy the bag sits great on the base with no effort but filling it up with kit and then lifting with the top hand strap feels a little insecure.The other slightly disappointing thing is although the bottom compartment is wide enough to take a long lens (sigma 150-600) the dividers don't work well horizontally so nothing fits above it. Some sewing to do for me.It's well padded and even with the little niggles it's a fantastic bag which I'm sure will last for years and most importantly keep my kit safe. It's incredible value for money and if it needed replacing I'd happily buy it again. T.
5,bo0ught this for my sony a77iii & 3 lens's tripod bits and bobs. Even holds my 1ltr thermal bottle. I tend to carry lots of gear and this is so much better than my previous bags. I recently used it traveling through an airport and it carried so much more than just my camera gear. Very sturdy with more pockets than anyone can wish for. Ideal for those treks in all weathers. I was very wary spending so much on just a camera bag but i am so glad i did when it came. My older rucksacks just do not compare.. I guess you get what you pay for..
5,cargada hasta los topes desde primer dia  despues de un año de uso lo unico malo que sde le rompio uno de los cordones de extension de la cremallera ...... por ponerle algo malo ...... por lo demas aguanta pèrfecta como el primer dia.  ideal para realizar rutas de senderismo aun cargada con material fotografico que pesa si es cierto pero la espaldera y las espumas son muy comodas y la mochila es muy muy hergonomica la banda de sujeccion abdominal  sujeta bien y las cintas de sujeccion son de muy buiena calidad al igual que la pechera. que ayudan a sobrellevar un poco mejor el peso.es muy espaciosa y con muchos compartimentos lo que si echo de menos un poco de estanqueidad entre la supesta parte superior  y la inferior que estan separadas pro una placa sujeta con velcro.ya de por si sola es muy hidrofuga de momento la funda que trae la use mas para ponerla en suelos humedos  y tbn cumple bien su funcion no deja pasar el aguaasi que... que opinion tengo de la mochila ? creo que esta claro !recomendable 90 % si solucional el problema de estanqueidad de las partes internas ya seria recomendable un 150 %
5,Bought this to store and transport all of my camera gear. Fits loads of gear in and there are multiple dividers to alter the storage pockets. It is well padded which gives the impression it is huge but it isn’t as big inside as it looks. The external straps are handy for tripods. The lower compartment can be used for clothes drinks or food.  The additional smaller pouch is very handy for taking a camera and a few bits on a walk. Happy with my purchase.
5,Ich bin ein Mensch der sein ganzes Leben lang Rucksäcke trägt und habe in inzwischen sehr viel Kamera Equipment gesammelt welches ich alles zusammen in einem Rucksack haben wollte.Daher brauchte ich natürlich einen sehr großen Rucksack mit viel Stauraum und habe mich dann für diesen von Tarion entschieden.Der Rucksack ist top verarbeitet man sieht nirgendwo irgendwelche Verarbeitungsfehler oderso er steht aufrecht wenn man ihn absetzt und schützt sein Equipment ordentlich vor jeglicher Art von Beschädigung.Der Rucksack ist alleine schon knapp 4kg schwer und wird umso schwerer wenn man sein ganzes Equipment da rein packt. Mein Rucksack kommt mit dem ganzen Zeugs auf ein Gewicht von knapp 11kg aber trotz des ganzen Gewichtes ist der Rucksack so gut gepolstert dass man ihn problemlos mehrere Stunden lang tragen kann.Die ganzen einzelnen Geräte und das Zubehör können ordentlich und sicher verstaut eingeordnet werden und man muss sich keine Sorgen machen dass irgendwas im Rucksack rumfliegt und dabei beschädigt wird.Was ich auch geil finde: Man hat sowohl links als auch rechts die Möglichkeit Stative oder ähnliches zu befestigen. Und falls man nur eins benutzt kann man dieses auch vorne anbringen um das Gewicht gleichmäßiger zu verteilen.Ich kann den Rucksack absolut nur empfehlen und bin zu 100% überzeugt
5,Als Reisefotograf habe ich seit langem einen Rucksack gesucht welcher es mir ermöglicht während meiner Reisen all mein Kamera Equipment mitzunehmen und mir gleichzeitig noch Platz für andere Sachen (Regenjacke Pullover Trinkflasche etc.)  und Komfort beim Tragen bietet.Dabei bin ich auf den PB-01 gestoßen und habe diesen während meiner 2 wöchigen Reise auf Island sowie in meinen 3 Monaten in Lateinamerika exzessiv genutzt und auf Alles getestet.Zu Beginn muss ich direkt sagen dass mich der Rucksack komplett überzeugt hat. Es passt perfekt zu mir und erfüllt all meine Ansprüche als Travelfotograf an einen Rucksack.Der Rucksack besteht aus zwei abgetrennten Bereichen wobei ich im oberen Teil mein komplettes Kamera Equipment verstaue (DJI Mavic Pro Sony A7s 3 Objektive Dronen Controller Powerbank Filter Akkus etc.) und im unteren Bereich immer noch genügend Platz habe um alle anderen Sachen für einen 1 bzw. 2 Tages Trips zu verstauen (Regenjacke Pullover Essen Unterwäsche T-shirts etc.). Zusätzlich lässt sich mein 15 Zoll Laptop wunderbar im Laptopfach verstauen. Darüber hinaus bietet der Rucksack genügend Platz an den Seiten für Trinkflaschen und auch ein Stativ lässt sich problemlos verstauen. Darüberhinaus bin ich begeistert vom Komfort den der Rucksack bietet. Dies ist zum einen durch die verstellbare Träger Höhe sowie den Hüftgurt begründet. Einfach super angenehm und selbst bei langen Wanderungen über 8 Stunden angenehm für den Rücken.Zusammen mit dem mitgeliefertem Regencape ist der Rucksack selbst bei strömendem Regen in Kolumbien trocken geblieben und die perfekte Größe des Rucksacks ermöglicht es mir den Rucksack immer als Handgepäck beim Fliegen mitzunehmen.Der Rucksack hat mich rundum überzeugt. Selbst nach dieser exzessiven Nutzung ist der Rucksack noch top in Form und erfüllt all meine Anforderungen die ich an einen Reisefotografen Rucksack habe.Klare Kaufempfehlung!
5,Seriously big. Holds my camera 5 lenses Weebill S Gimbal camera cleaning kit Joby Gorilla tripod full sized tripod various lens filters white balance card a Rode Wireless G 2 kit Rode on-camera mic a DJI Mini 2 drone my laptop and tablet. I even strap my Z-axis stabilizer on the outside of it. It could fit more in but what else could I possibly need? Straps are comfortable nice to have a waist strap as well.It holds so much kit that carrying it requires me to drink protein shakes and never skip leg day in the gym.If you need a big camera bag this is the one.
4,Der Rucksack kam schnell und gut verpackt bei mir an.Zum Wandern oder auf längeren Strecken finde ich ihn etwas unpraktisch da er sehr groß ist und auch ein beachtliches Eigengewicht mitbringt.Trotz allem habe ich mich entschieden ihn zu behalten. Ich  nutze ihn um mein Fotoequipment sicher von A nach B zu bringen. Zum Beispiel im Auto ist er eine bessere Lösung als alles einzeln zu transportieren. Für länger Strecken nehme ich dann meinen kleineren und leichteren Fotorucksack.Er bietet viel Platz und sieht optisch auch gut aus. Der Kamerarucksack ist in der Einteilung sehr Variabel und bietet auch ohne weiteres Platz für meine 150-600er.Die Verarbeitung ist recht vernünftig. Klar hackeln die Reißverschlüsse hier und da etwas was aber kein großes Problem darstellt.Der Tragekomfort ist recht ordentlich. Bei einem Gesamtgewicht von 18 Kilogramm lässt er sich noch ordentlich tragen. Die Schultergurte und der Rücken sind anständig gepolstert und nicht zu schmal. Wenn man einmal die passende Einstellung gefunden hat könnte man ihn ohne weiteres auch über längere Distanz und Zeit tragen was ich allerdings vermeide.Der Inhalt ist gut geschützt da der Rucksack sehr gut gepolstert ist und auch einen Stoß vertragen kann.Die mitgelieferte Gürtel oder Einschubtasche ist praktisch für den nötigen Kleinkram.Ich habe meine Akkus und Filter darin verstaut.In meinen Augen gibt es keinen perfekten Kamerarucksack. Es kommt immer auf die Situation an und deshalb nutze ich auch mehrere.Wer viel Equipment verstauen will dem kann ich diesen Kamerarucksack beruhigt empfehlen.Für Verarbeitung Qualität Praktikabilität und Preis-Leistung gebe ich im gesamten vier (4) Sterne und meine Kaufempfehlung.
5,Zaino stupendo molto comodo incredibilmente capiente. Preso per attrezzature FPV riesci a portarti dietro tutto l'occorrente e anche di più senza dover per forza smontare l'attrezzatura. il tutto al sicuro da occhi indiscreti e protetto da pioggia o polvere. Felicissimo dell'acquisto lo sto consigliando a tutti gli amici che praticano questa passione anche perché costo è irrisorio se lo compariamo agli altri zaini per questa disciplina in grado di garantire la stessa capienza (170€+). Riesco comodamente a farci stare dentro: La QX7S con modulo Crossfire e antenna Diamond installati i Goggle con tutta la custodia un borsello per gli attrezzi da riparazione sul campo 1 drone 5 pollici con tutte le eliche installate 1 drone 5 pollici di riserva senza eliche 1 Cinewhoop completo di tutto decine di Lipo il Landingpad pieghevole nel vano Laptop svariati set di Eliche di ricambio GoPro e tantissimi altri accessori/ricambi. Davvero super comoda la composizione verticale che ti permette di non poggiare sullo schienale lo zaino nel caso di terreno sporco o bagnato. Lo avevo visto da un amico e sapevo a cosa andavo incontro ma mai avrei pensato di riuscire a metterci tutta quella roba comodamente!
4,Eines ist klar: es gibt ihn nicht den perfekten Kamerrucksack. Und es kann ihn auch nicht geben. Zu viele verschiedene Einsatzbereiche Vorstellungen Kameras sonstige Ausrüstung. Da wird niemals DER EINE Rucksack dabei sein.Für mich jedoch ist der Tarion nahe dran. Warum?OK. Ich bin sowas wie Semipro intensives Hobby aber auch kommerzielle Aspekte. Viel Video. Daher viel Ausrüstung.Und davon geht in den Tarion nun wirklich einiges rein: MFT-Kamera 5 Objektive Monitor Akkus Licht Stativ an der einen Wasserflasche an der anderen Seite Laptop Handy. Das Teil hat eine Vielzahl von Taschen und Fächern alles ist gut anpassbar die Idee das untere Fach herausnehmbar als separate kleine Fototasche zu gestalten ist echt schick. Voll beladen ist der Rucksack immer noch sehr gut tragbar er ist stabil hat sich nun schon einige male bewährt.Warum dann nur vier Sterne?Übersicht: durch die Unzahl an Reissverschlüssen lasse ich zumindest gerne mal einen offen. Hier wäre weniger mehr gewesen. Was ich echt vermisse (ok jammern auf hohem Niveau: eine größere Ausstentasche für Nicht-Foto-Dinge wie Schlüssel Brillen Handy und böse böse Zigaretten wäre sehr schick. Auch eine Jacke lässt sich schwer unterbringen)Trotzdem: das Teil ist im Gesamtpaket sehr gut für reine Fotograf*innen sicher noch mehr als für YouTuber*innen mit Cages und Monitoren.
5,Zaino perfetto x quando ho bisogno di viaggiare o di un secondo corpo con le varie ottiche . Tasche ovunque . Comprende una borsa/marsupio stessa robustezza dello zaino. Spallacci regolati perfettamente x la mia altezza. Ottimo prodotto. Prezzo contenuto rispetto alla concorrenza. Sono molto soddisfatto
5,très bon sacsurpris de la taille à sa livraisonil est énorme.Je peux y glisser mon nikon D500 et sa poignée grip et un téléobjectif 150-600 sigma sport et son pare soleilplus plusieurs autres objectif plus petit.et plein de choses encore comme les consommables (batterie carte mémoire) des plans pour les routards de la photo.Il est nickel pour les grandes balades photos.Attention toutefois au poids mais si il est bien sanglé ça passe.Je suis pour ma part très satisfait pour le moment.Il est livré avec une petite sacoche de quoi y mettre un autre appareil et son objectif et une housse imperméable.Je ne peux pas noter pour l'imperméabilité car pas de sortie sous la pluie pour le momentmais je pense que ça doit le faire mais  j'ai mis une note de 3 etoiles pour rester objectif.
5,Passt alles rein was ich so brauche. Einfach geil.
5,Ero alla ricerca di un secondo zaino per la mia attrezzatura fotografica.Esigenze personali:- uno zaino capiente sia per attrezzatura fotografica ma anche per pochi indumenti di ricambio sia per me che per i figli.Utilizzo a cui destinare lo zaino:- gita fuori porta tra piccoli paesi e zone di montagna.Quindi in base alle esigenze ho raffrontato le dimensioni dei vari prodotti ho ordinato un primo zaino che costava circa 40 euro in meno  ma ad esempio non entrava il mio laptop da 15.6 cosa che era indicata in descrizione. Ne ho ordinato un secondo ovviamente Amazon servizio impeccabile e veloce ormai più che collaudato. Questa seconda volta di un Brand famoso del settore ma nulla da fare alla fine era più grande ma in proporzione meno capiente di quello che già ho. Nella tasca superiore giusto lo spazio per il telefono e una shirt privo di tasche laterali.Dopo un ulteriore ricerca valutando al meglio prezzo qualità e spazio ho deciso per questo Tarion.Premetto articolo non recensito ad oggi è presente solo un breve video promozionale cosa che ha me non da molta tranquillità.È arrivato puntuale questo zaino Tarion dimensioni importanti di sicuro ma con queste particolarità:- piccola borsa interna utilizzabile a parte capiente per una reflex con un 18-55 ed un 50 mm a parte per i video ed altro spazio comodissimo per le brevi uscite del valore di un prodotto simile di 28 euro minimo utile per una gita giornaliera in centro città.- poi lo zaino è paragonabile ad un Suv spazio per due laptop treppiede borraccia una reflex 4 obbiettivi tablet tasche per microsd e molto altro. Telo parapioggia.Per concludere zaino estramamente capiente modulabile nell utilizzo forse la mia unica perpeplissita sta nella durata dei materiali che visto il prezzo andranno stressati e testati nel tempo.Se vi è stata utile la recensione gradirei un piacè qui sotto. Grazie per l attenzione. A presto.
5,Mochila fantástica com imensa arrumação e aproveitamento do espaço.Aperto na cintura com largura suficiente para uma boa estabilidade.A melhor que já tive até hoje superando muitas marcas conhecidas.
5,I bought this to carry my Canon EOS camera and kit around and boy was I surprised at just how much I could fit in it!As it sits behind me I have 8 lenses 9 batteries a tripod (with quick release head) flash (with coloured filters) EOS body battery grip waterproof cover (2 different sorts) filters memory cards and a full cleaning kit. All in the main bag. In the "bum-bag" I also have two more lenses flash and my main camera with its battery grip a couple of spare batteries battery case and some filters and memory cards.I really like the way the rucksack has been designed to make everything easy to get to yet extremely well protected at the same time. If I have to rush out and don't need "everything" the small bum-bag works perfectly as a grab-n'-go bag (some call it a bug-out bag).If you are looking for a high capacity bag to carry a lot of kit safely this should be at the top of your list!
3,Decent bag and reasonably priced.  If the smaller pouch that sits in the bottom section of the bag is removed the bag becomes a little flimsy which may or may not matter depending on your intention. Cords connecting to zips arent strong and come apart but the zips seem ok.  Padding between upper and lower section can be removed which is great but not sturdy enough to separate anything sitting on top section if the separate pouch is removed from the bottom section. Overall happy with the purchase.
5,Cercavo uno zaino che mi permettesse di portare in giro diverso materia da videomaking: mirrorless ottiche videocamera accessori cavi e cosi via.Beh ci sta tutto ma proprio tutto!Da buon possessore di Sony Fs7 camera abbastanza ingombrante sono riuscito a inserirla senza alcun problema senza accessori collegati si intende. Solo il corpo macchina entra nella parte inferiore senza problemi.Nel parte superiore invece ci sta serenamente una camera con lente montata più spazio per diverse ottiche. Innumerevoli tasche taschettine e taschettoni per ogni sorta di necessita.Insieme allo zaino anche l'accessorio per esterno che è praticamente una borsa per portarsi dietro un altro corpo macchina nel caso.Certo risulterà pesante da portare ma è ciò che bisogna pagare per poter portare tutta quell'attrezzatura.Per me da videomaker questo è il miglior zaino qualità/prezzo che abbia mai avuto.
5,Aquistato grazie ad un offerta a tempo lo zaino si è rivelato una grande sorpresa.Prima tra tutte la dimensione molto più grande di quello che mi aspettavo.E' molto capiente nel mio caso sono riuscito a farci stare un corpo macchina 1 obiettivo zoon 2 obiettivi fissi un teleobiettivo il kit batterie e schede astuccio dei filtri un powerbank di dimensioni importanti un gimbal un microfono per la reflex due faretti led ed il set di pulizia e la cosa bella è che ancora avevo spazio per altre piccole cose.In aggiunta all'interno c'è una piccola borsa da portare a tracolla che può contenere la reflex e due piccole lenti.E' anche possibile agganciare lateralmente il cavalletto.La comodità è molto buona a parte lo schienale regolabile che su certe regolazioni delle cinghie fa un rumore strano e "gommoso".Questo zaino è molto indicato a chi deve fare delle escursioni lunghe all'aperto mentre se si gira in città o luoghi chiusi può essere un pelino ingombrante e scomodo.
5,Super surprise en recevant le colis. Un très grand sac (je fais 163cm pour 53kg) qui peut contenir beaucoup (mon macbook pro mon appareil photo mes 3 objectifs mon trépied plus des affaires divers vêtements carnet chargeurs…). Je l'avais pris en complément de mon sac de trek de 70L pour un road trip. Prenant l'avion je voulais mettre mes vêtements et mon trépied dans mon 70L en soute et mettre mes objets de valeurs en cabine (bagage à main). Sauf que le poids est limité à 10kg. Le sac TARION pro est vraiment balèze et difficile à se coltiner en plus du sac de 70L de 23kg. Résultat je ne prendrai pas le TARION pro pour le road trip que j'avais pourtant acheté exprès. Ca me fera trop de poids. Mais je l'utiliserai lors d'un prochain voyage où je ne voudrais amener en voyage qu'un bagage cabine de 10kg (avec matos photo + stricte nécessaire en habits). Il semble donc parfait pour un sac unique de voyage avec matos photo complet ! en voyageant léger tout de même…
4,Der Rucksack wurde von mir erstmals auf einer 3 wöchigen Neusseland Wanderreise genutzt. Das schlechte zuerst: eine Schlaufe für die Gummikordel riss bei der ersten Nutzung ab. Dafür habe ich vom Verkäufer problemlos eine Gutschrift bekommen und die Schlaufe wieder annähen lassen. Der Rucksack geht gut als Bordgepäck durch bestückt wurde er mit  2 Kameras 3 Objektiven Ladezubehör 1x 10" Tablet und div. Kleinzubehör. Außerdem Wanderschuhe und eine Garnitur Ersatzwäsche nebst Zipbeutel mit Körperpflegeartikeln kommt er gut auf die zulässigen 7kg was auch beim Check in kontrolliert wurde! Durch die vielen Taschen läst sich alles gut trennen und -nach etwas Anlauf- auch schnell wiederfinden. Der Tragekomfort ist sehr gut die Flexibilität durch die diversen Klett- Einsätze sehr gut. Der Rucksack ist zunächst für mich ungewohnt groß aber leicht und auch bei großer Wärme ist der Rücken gut belüftet. Ein Regenschutz ist dabei wurde aber nicht gebraucht. Alle Reissverschlüsse waren einwandfrei und leichtgängig. Etwas nervig die beiden Riemenverschlüsse über dem unteren großen Fach die beim schließen des Reissverschlusses immer im Wege sind. Die sollte man vielleicht an die Seiten versetzen zum befestigen einer (Regen) Jacke auf die man schnell zugreifen möchte sind sie aber gut. Fazit: Kaufempfehlung
2,Sah auf den Bildern toll aus. Das obere Fach ist zu klein große Cam mit langem / dickem Objektiv passt nicht vernünftig rein. Einzelne Fächer sind viel zu klein. Auf den Bildern sind die Objkektive alle ringesteckt sodass man die Rundung sieht. Lange Optiken passen so rum aber nicht. Der Rucksack ist schlecht zu bedienen. Zu viele Reißverschlüsse und Gurte die man lösen und zusammen stecken muss. Beim Fotografiern von z.B. Städten mit hoher Motivdichte muss man zu oft an die CAm um jedesmal das Geschnür zu öffen. Die Untere Tasche zum Herausnehmen hat mir gar nicht gefallen. Für mich müsste da eine Öffnung mit einem Reißverschluss für den schnellzugriff sein. Aber man muss erst den ersten Reißverschluss öffnen dann den zweiten. Das nervt. Für große Filterhalter und Rechteckfilter 150mm gibt es gar keinen Platz. Und dann wiegt das teil auch noch 3KG!!!. Hatte ich wohl übersehen. Viel viel zu schwer vor allem wenn schwere lichtzstarke Optiken rein sollen. Sieht aber gut aus.
5,Great value for money. I've seen some bags in the £400-£600 range. This is an excellent bag. Plenty of room for two cameras now and a big zoom lens. Even has a small carry bag that can fit one cam and a few filters for a quick hike up a hill. There's also a hard case area for delicate stuff-ND Grad or 10 stop filter. can also fit small laptop or tab if need be.
5,I needed a camera rucksack that had the potential to safely and securely carry a mixture of gear if and when needed but not be too big. I have tried many bags before but they were all poor compromises. This one is by far the best yet. It's highly versatile ranging from accommodating a mix of 'overnight stay'  to all photo or video related gear.  I am really pleased l found it. Oh and the cost for what you get is very acceptable as well. I would have no qualms about replacing it if l had to.
5,Cela fait une semaine désormé que j'utilise ce sac pour transporter mon matériel photo et vidéo et j'en suis pleinement satisfait. Les deux grandes poches permettent de ranger aisément mon réflex et mon camescope avec les objectif (5 au total) La seconde poche contient également une sacoche qui peut contenir un appareil et deux objectif ainsi que deux carte SD mais je l'ai sortie de son logement pour y mettre mon camescope ; on peut également loger un trépied sur les côtés du sac sans problème.Le sac dispose aussi de quelques rangement en façade pour y ranger quelques batterie de quoi écrire et quelques câble ou des lumière pas trop volumineuse il est d'ailleurs dommage que ces poche soient si petite il est difficile d'y ranger convenablement les chargeurs et les gros câbles mais c'est bien le seul défaut que je trouve pour le moment. A voir dans le temps comment il vieillira mais l'ensemble a l'air assez robuste.
4,Prodotto della dimensione giusta per le mie esigenze porto sempre con me due fotocamerein questi giorni di pioggia non è passata neanche una goccia
4,Lo zaino PB-01 è molto capiente e apparentemente molto robusto. Arrivato nei tempi previsti (amazon powwa). Riguardo la durata dello zaino non ho la palla di vetro e non saprei cosa dire ma ripeto che si presenta molto robusto ha una borsa separata come da foto ed una sacca di copertura per le intemperie.
5,The Tarion Pro is a robust bag. The straps and padding feel very comfortable and can be adjusted to your height. The bag seems to have an endless amount of storage spaces not just for your photography equipment but also for a large laptop and any other travel bits you'll need passports etc. The bag seems to be very sturdy and well made. I have owned a lowepro for the last 7 years and I think this bag will keep me going for just as long or longer!The main feature that drew me to the bag was the removable bag that can be worn around the waist or on a strap. This bag is perfect for quickly accessing a camera or drone or if you want a light travel day.As you can see in my photos you can easily fit a Mavic Air in the removable bag a Mavic Pro would also fit too or a DSLR and some lenses. I've used the top section of the bag to store my M43 system and 2 additional lenses I still have room for 3 or 4 more M43 lenses in there bearing in mind these are smaller than typical lenses.Overall on first impressions I highly recommend this bag! This is my first product from Tarion and I'm well impressed!
5,Really like it lots of pockets for my DSLR lenses and dji drone along with all the accessories I need. Great that all can be taken out with me on a trip. I think it's well made and feels very comfortable when wearing it on the back. It's is a large bag though unless you need to take loads of stuff with you then you might be better with a smaller bag
5,using this as both my sony camera for travelling and as a student.loads of room for both the camera and extra lenses and enough room for a week's worth of clothes.over all well worth the money
5,This is one of the best camera bag for the price out there. I am saying this after uing lowpro and k &f bags.Good thingThe bag is made of high quality materials and it feels premium when you wear it.There is lot of space in the bag and it is highly customisable using paddings. Apart from two major compartments you can also take advantage of small pouches for keeping documents filters pouch small lights and several other accessories.As you can see from pictures i have used the following products inside the bag comfortably:3 cameraNikon d750 + battery gripD7200 + battery gripPanasonic g7 with 14-42 lensSigma 35 1.4 artSamyang 135f2Nikon 50mm 1.8Nikon 85 1.8Tokina 11-16Pentacon 50mmHelios 58mm2 neewer flashSmall led flash.On the side i have a tripod and crane 2 as well.And i use small compartments to keep documents filter pouches and chocolate.the weight is properly distributed and comfortable to wear on back because of extra padding.Over all a great product.One downside is that the bag itself weights close to 3kg but it's the trade off to make use of good quality materials to keep the camera gear safe.This bag is durable and stylish with lot of room.
5,Ich habe mir diesen Rucksack aus rein körperlichen Gründen geholt. Mit zunehmenden Rückenproblemen musste ich mich bei meinem bisherigen Rucksack immer sehr tief beugen um an die wichtigsten Utensilien zu kommen. Diesen Rucksack stelle ich hin und hab die wichtigsten Teile oben. Das hat sich jetzt schon sehr bewährt. Besonders herausragend empfinde ich den Tragekomfort. Er belastet meinen Rücken wenige als eine Umhängetasche und ist selbst mit höherem Gewicht noch sehr bequem.Er ist mir eine große Hilfe!
5,Beaucoup de rangements tellement qu'au début on est perdu pour retrouver ses affairesen se débrouillant bien j'y ai rangé un mavic 2 pro avec son étui de protection rigide idem pour le smart controller 2 batteries supplémentaires un stabilisateur weebill lab mon GH5 des batteries supplémentaires 2 objectifs des filtres tous les chargeurs des papiers des petits accessoires un gorillapod sur le côté on pourrait rajouter un trépieds de l'autre côté et d'autres choses dans des petits compartiments que je n'ai pas utilisé... par contre une fois plein le sac est très lourd mais les lanières pectorales et ventrales sont confortables et vous soulageront les épaules et le dos.A voir sur le long terme l'usure des scratchs pour moduler les compartiments. Sinon bonne finition et de bonne facture.Il y a également une housse imperméable qui est livrée avec et qui épouse bien le sac.Passe en bagage cabine (mais sans les trépieds ou autre gorillapod à l'extérieur)
5,Sinceramente Vale la pena gastarse los 100 y pico euros pesa poco( cuando esta vacia) pero lo importante es lo siguiente: Puedo llevar mi drone mavic pro 2 las tres baterías en un solo agujero de los separadores colocar móviles tablet portátil de todo! y no se me acaba el espacio trípode flotadores de drone y ahora viene lo bueno aun le queda para llevar la bandolera que incorpora sin notar el peso todo el material se ve de muy buena calidad la mejor de todas las que he tenido a y sin olvidar que cuando llevas la bandolera suelta aun tienes el mismo espacio prácticamente para llevar otros 3 objetivos otra cámara baterías para un viaje de 4 semanas jaja y todo lo que quieras la verdad le doy un 11! cumple todo lo que esperaba de una maleta eso si! NO ES PEQUEÑA! por si no os a quedado claro entonces si vais a viajar mucho y solo queréis llevar una cámara dejáis la maleta y os lleváis la bandolera y si no pues completa!
4,LA mochila es suficientemente fuerte para proteger las cámaras. El problema es su peso. Pesa mucho cuando esta llena de tubos y por si misma también. Ahora yo creo que es capaz de aguantar todo.Por otra parte en el cajetín de abajo solo caben 3 tubos de 80-200 y arriba 9 tubos pequeños y la camara. Aparte de tarjetas y otros objetos pequeños. Pero ocupa mucho la mochila. No es pequeña todo se va en protección de las paredes. Creo que la compre a un precio excesivo; si comparo con una mochila de 30 € que me caben dos tubos pequeños y la camara con un 70-200 esta última me da más utilidad sobre todo para ir de viaje turístico.Las mochilas grandes no son prácticas para tirar fotos a no ser que tengas transporte que telleve al sitio. Yo la utilizo para guardar mi equipo. Pero no he salido nunca con ella a la calle.
5,Un ottimo zaino fotografico si gestisce bene lo spazio interno coi divisori. Dalle foto sembrava un pelo più grande e non mi sarebbe dispiaciuto avere qualche cm in più ma nel complesso ha una struttura super che lo rende molto comodo anche per trekking lunghi grazie alle cinture in vita e sul petto nonché le spalliere regolabili anche in altezza. Riesco a metter dentro 1 drone fpv da 5 pollici visori dji e tbs tango 2 filtri 1 mirrorless 1 mavic air 2 completo 16 batterie fpv e 2 del mavic nonché qualche altro accessorio. Esternamente utili i vari agganci per serrare altri droni fpv o cavalletti ecc ecc
5,Lo zaino è molto capiente ed offre la possibilità di portare con sé fino a 2 corpi macchina 7 lenti un treppiede e numerosi diversi accessori accessori come laptop o tablet taccuini e libri senza la mancanza della possibilità di trasportare oggetti di più piccole dimensioni come schede sd e batterie. Tuttavia esso può contenere anche oggetti non utili all’impiego in un set fotografico (e videografico).Il prodotto offre la possibilità di separare dallo zaino una ulteriore “borsa” che è contenuta solitamente all’interno dello stesso per ottimizzare gli spazi fornendo ulteriore posto per attrezzatura o oggetti di vario tipo. Nei due scomparti principali vi è la possibilità di dividere a proprio piacimento i divisori.Realizzato con ottimi materiali lo zaino è resistente a schizzi d’acqua tenendo al sicuro il contenuto e viene fornito assieme a una copertura per tutto il prodotto anti-pioggia.Ricco di tasche e cerniere è rifinito con particolari in colorazione arancione richiamando la colorazione del logo.Ottima esperienza con lo zaino che rende più semplice il trasporto di attrezzatura sia in condizioni di riprese e scatti in ambienti montani sia per produzioni video dove si necessita di uno zaino di grosse dimensioni senza però essere assente nelle situazioni di shooting con poca attrezzatura grazie alla possibilità di separare la sopracitata borsa contenuta all’interno.Che dire?! Consigliatissimo per comodità e la qualità dei materiali.
3,Eigentlich genau der Rucksack mit 2 Innenräumen den ich gesucht hatte:Platz für 2 Kameras und 5 Objektive und dann noch Platz für diversen Kleinkram den man für einen Fototag so braucht sei es 'ne Packung Kekse o.ä. .Über den Stauraum und das ganz drumherum wurde hier schon genug geschrieben das wäre mir auch 5 Sterne wert gewesen... .Der große Schwachpunkt ist die mit einem (schlechten) Klettverschluss befestigte Zwischenabdeckung die das obere und untere Fach trennt! Obwohl das obere Fach extra für eine Cam incl. Objektiv + 4 (!) Objektive vorbereitet ist hält der Zwischenboden nicht mal eine Kamera incl. Objektiv mit nur einem zusätzlichen Objektiv.Und ich meine keine kiloschweren f1.4er sondern nur Standartobjektive F1.8 oder f2.8 mit 400g-700g!Sorry aber das kostet bei der Preisklasse mindestens 2 Sterne!!!PS.: Da ich kein Objektive mit großer Brennweite nutze und der Zwischenboden fest drinnen bleiben kann habe ich ihn mit Pattex festgeklebt wäre aber natürlich schöner gewesen wenn der Hersteller einfach 2 oder 3 Druckknöpfe verbaut hätte...Aber vielleicht kommt das ja noch bei der nächsten Generation kostet ja auch nicht die Welt ;-)
1,After having used the bag a couple of times the stitching has started coming loose on one of the straps.  I contacted Tarion to address this twice they have stated that they will send a replacement however they take weeks to reply to emails when they can be bothered and still continue to promise action but fail to complete.  Poor customer experience which is a shame for such a large company.
5,It is very comfortable and with a lot of space especially for Pro photographers and long trips the best I have tried 100% recommended I would like to try the small one
5,Man sollte wissen das der volle Rucksack richtig viel auf die Waage bringt weil da ja auch jede Menge Zeug drin ist. Ich benutze ihn mehr als gepackte Notfalltasche ab in den Kofferraum......alles dabei. Vor Ort packe ich dann je nach Aufgabe  die Teile die ich genau jetzt brauche in eine extra Tasche oder Rucksack. So funktioniert es bei mir super und deshalb volle 5 Sterne. Der Rucksack macht genau das was ich mir auch vorgestellt habe. Ich kann mein altes 50 cm langes 1000 mm Tele in den Rucksack über beide Ebenen mitnehmen  wenn ich das will und noch jede Menge Objektive Blitzgeräte Filter Zubehör oder sonstwas einpacken. Ich habe den Rucksack noch nicht lang deshalb kann ich nicht viel über Langzeittests sagen aber im Moment sieht alles recht robust verarbeitet aus. Alles funktioniert Reißverschlüsse evtl. etwas mit Kerzenwachs einreiben dann flutscht es schon. Superteil wenn man weitere Taschen hat sonst wird der Apparat recht schwer aber das sollt einem schon vorher klar sein. Viele Fächer in der Einteilung bringen auch eine gut Übesicht in den ganzen Kramladen. Gute Preis-Leistung. Von mir eine Kaufempfehlung.
5,Ich habe diesen Rucksack aufgrund verschiedener Videos und Bewertungen gekauft und das absolut nicht bereut.Ich möchte vor allem auch betonen dass bei diesem Rucksack endlich mal mehr als genug Klett-Einteiler dabei sind die auch sehr gut halten.Es ist sehr viel Platz drin ich benutze das untere Fach ohne die extra Fototasche. Da drin sind eine Fujifilm X-T3 mit 16mm 1.4 1x 18-55mm Objektiv 1x 35mm 2.0 Objektiv 1x 55-200mm Objektiv Filtersets für das 16mm und das 18-55er. Es ist noch Platz für 1-2 weitere Objektive.Oben hab ich ein Reinigungsset einen Regenponcho für mich die Regenhülle für den Rucksack eine Titantasse einen Brennpastenkocher mit Windfang und Handschuhe und einen kleinen Blitz. In den Frontaschen Akkus und sonstiges Kleinzeug wie Fernauslöser etc.An der Seite habe ich oft ein Stativ mittlerer Größe (volle Höhe ca 190m zusammen geschoben ca 45cm).Ich schätze das ganze Zeug wiegt zusammen bestimmt 8-9kg. Ich hatte den Rucksack z.B. einen ganzen tag im Xanktener Römermuseum mit der Ausstattung dabei. Mir tat der Rücken nie weh auch am Abend nicht und ich bin immer schnell an alle Sachen ran gekommen. Ich bin wie gesagt begeistert.Der Rucksack hat übrigens deshalb so viel Eigengewicht weil er die Ausrüstung sehr gut schützt dazu braucht man eben außen stabile und innen weiche Wandungen... und Material wiegt eben...
5,Bellissimo zaino la capienza è meno di quel che sembra ma è fatto in modo da non sentire nessun peso sulla schiena per ore.
5,Dieser Rucksack hält was er verspricht! Er ist sehr schön groß super hochwertig verarbeitet und für den optimalen Sitz sind ausreichend verstellbare Bänder und Schnallen vorhanden. Der Rucksack hat super viel Stauraum den man sich dank zahlreicher  Trennungen je nach Belieben gestalten kann. Mein Fujinon 100-400mm Teleobjektiv passt allerdings nur rein wenn es auf der Kamera sitzt einzeln ist dafür leider kein Platz. Ansonsten ist viel Stauraum für etliches Equipment. Ich bin von der Qualität wirklich durch und durch positiv angetan. Der Rucksack ist sehr robust.Dem Käufer muss allerdings bewusst sein dass dieser Rucksack keinen seitlichen Schnellzugriff auf die Kamera hat aber auch das Fach oben ist schnell zu erreichen und wer ihn zu Shootings in ausgewählten Locations mitnehmen möchte sollte das nicht stören :)Ich finde den Preis extrem fair und bin froh diesen Kauf getätigt zu haben!
5,Ho un vasto set di attrezzatura video-fotografica che devo spesso portare con me. Cercavo uno zaino capiente ma pratico robusto e non troppo costoso. con questo penso di aver fatto una scelta azzeccata! Ora posso stivare le mie 5 GoPro la Reflex con 3 obiettivi una fotocamera compatta una videocamera Sony Ax700 una Instax Wide con le pellicole tutti i supporti e accessori delle action cam due gimbal un cavalletto grande un bastone per selfie tutti i carica batterie un mac pro e un tablet. i miei documenti personali e il set di memorie tutto in un unico zaino.Inoltre con la mini borsa estraibile posso eventualmente lasciare lo zaino da parte e portare solo lo stretto necessario senza troppe complicazioni.Lo zaino è grande ha una dimensione che penso sia il massimo che può essere portato come bagaglio a mano in aereo. ma se non si portano attrezzature può essere utilizzato anche come zaino per i propri abiti da viaggio. grazie a due scomparti separati.Al momento mi ritengo molto soddisfatto.
5,J'ai acheté ce sac après avoir épuisé deux manfrotto (durée de vie pour un usage pro intense : 2 ans chacuns) et agrandi mon parc optique. Pour ceux qui se demandent si leurs matos rentreront dedans voilà ce que j'y ai rangé en phase test : 1 5dmk3 avec un 135 monté pare-soleil inclus 15dmk3 avec un 85 monté pare-soleil inclus un sigma 20mm et un sigma 35mm. Ce qui était trop pour le Manfrotto l'est moins pour celui-là j'aurais encore de la place pour 2 optiques un cobra et les poches hors "gros compartiment" pour les accessoires divers. Une fois chargé il reste vraiment confortable.J'attends de voir pour ce qui est à mon sens le gros point faible après 2 ans... Les fermetures éclairs (tout le reste tient le coup à chaque fois mais une fois qu'une fermeture lâche vu le contenu du sac c'est pas très pratique : à quand une fermeture métal... :) )
2,On first glance this bag appears quite large but on investigation (opening the multiple zips and pockets) it is actually quite small the bulk is actually made up of padding I would guess that the actual usable space is about half of the actual size of the bag itself and that is being generous. I got this in a deal for about £76 which of course is a rip off but even that is probably double what it is actually worth and that is being very generousGood pointsSeems well made but I have not tested it as I will be returning itThe zips (so far) have not snagged or broke as is often the case with these bagsLots of pocketsBad pointsWAY overpriced as above even at £76 it is easily twice as expensive as it should be.The ridiculous logo is ALL over the bag I might as well put s sticker on it stating Expensive camera equipment inside please mug meAs above the deceptive size it is almost a reverse Tardis.I am sending it back and will wait for it to drop to a sensible price of £30 or less or just buy a normal PROPER large rucksack.
5,Nice Bag seems very well made with lots of space to put cameras lenses filters etc. Bigger than I expected it to be.
5,Great bit of kit I needed a larger capacity to hold more gear this does the job I have 2 large lenses I need to carry around plus wide angle lenses 2 cameras and bits and bobs. Even though it is now quite heavy fully loaded it is very comfortable with the different adjustments you can make also getting the extra bag makes it even  more versatile  giving extra space in the main bag.
5,Zaino per lunghe escursioni molto capiente e versatile . Spallacci regolabili sulla schiena ed in lunghezza fanno dello zaino un comodo compagno di viaggio nonostante il peso dell’attrezzatura. Scomparti facilmente accessibili per accessori molto utili durante una sessione di foto all’aperto
4,La mochila es genial tanto de tamaño como de versatilidad. Pero Le pongo 4 estrellas por que en mi caso me la han enviado usada con manchas sin etiquetas y con signos de desgaste.Pediré otra a ver si tengo más suerte.
5,Robust and sturdy. A lot of pockets and space. Best purchase in a while.
5,Lange habe ich nach einem Rucksack gesucht der eine gute oder variable Aufteilung hat. Fast immer habe ich nicht nur meine Fotokamera nebst Objektiven und Zubehör dabei sondern auch noch Videokamera oder Bekleidungsgegenstände.Die Aufteilung des Rucksack ist für mich wirklich sehr gut. Die Kamera kann auch mit großem Objektiv sicher verstaut werden und hat noch Platz für 4 weitere Objektive (Im Oberen Fach).Das untere biete einen großen gepolsterten Raum wo unterschiedlichstes verstaut werden kann.Die beiden Seiten bieten ausreichend zusätzlichen Platz für z.B. eine Stativbefestigung oder Trinkflaschen.Die beiden aufgesetzten Fächer bieten ausreichend Platz für kleine Dinge. Eine Davon ist zusätlich mit einer Harten Schale versehen die z.B. für empfindlichere Teile auch bei einem Sturz Schutz bietet.Letztlich ist die Qualität wirklich Klasse.So manches Mal hatte der Rucksack 15 Kilo und mehr Gewicht. Trotzdem drückte auf langen Wegen nichts.Auch schlechtes Wetter hat er unbeschadet überstanden und der Inhalt blieb trocken.Chapo 5 Sterne.
5,Ottima manifattura e progettazione
5,Ich habe sehr lange einen Kamerarucksack gesucht in den wirklich mein gesamtes Equipment für unterwegs reinpasst ( Kamera 3 zusätzliche Objektive Reinigungsequipment Blitz mit Funkstrecke 2 Stative Bluetooth Box Videoleuchten Filter etc. ).Der Rucksack ist mit Sicherheit nicht das günstigste Exemplar wie aber meistens in der Fotografie gibt es nach oben so gut wie keine Grenzen somit finde ich die Preis-Leistung spitzenklasse !Wer weniger Equipment dabei hat der nutzt das untere Fach dann einfach für Klamotten auf einem Kurztripp somit entfällt eine weitere Tasche oder ein zweiter Rucksack.Alles ist super geschützt und die mit Stoff überzogenen Trennwände lassen sich frei nach Bedarf einbauen sie haften per Klettverschluss an den Innenseiten des Rucksacks.Alles in allem würde ich ihn mir nochmal kaufen und auch jedem empfehlen !
5,Ce sac est génial !Des poches en veux-tu en voilà des compartiments à foison une modularité sans faille et le tout pour un prix "raisonnable" (on peut trouver ça cher pour un "simple" sac à dos mais compte tenu de la qualité et du confort c'est vraiment raisonnable).Personnellement je l'utilise pour transporter un drone DJI FPV et tous ses accessoires (+ une chaise de camping Decathlon) et j'en suis plus que satisfait.Je recommande donc ce sac sans réserve.
5,Zaino meraviglioso comodo e utilissimo

5,I spent a good hour choosing my back pack when this one arrived I was not disappointed the quality is second to none plenty of storage pouches and sections including laptop section a very pleasant addition is the shoulder bag that is stored in the bottom section of the back pack perfect for days when the back pack is to large. Very highly recommended
5,Ich habe lange nach einem Rucksack wie diesem gesucht. Für mich war wichtig dass er zum einen groß genug ist und zum anderen auch einigermaßen ergonomisch sitzt. Ich denke das ist überaus gelungen.Die zwei Seitentaschen eignen sich gut für mein Reiseobjektiv auf der einen und auf der anderen für eine 15l Wasserflasche.Die beiden Fronttaschen sind flach und geben wenig nach das heißt eine Tupperware Box bringt man da nicht unter aber Notizblock Putzsachen für die Linse und Filter schon.Vom Kamerafach und dem Extrafach für die Kameratasche bin ich begeistert. Ich denke wenn man nach Corona wieder fliegen kann wird sich der Rucksack als Handgepäck bezahlt machen. Reißverschluss auf Kameratasche aufs Band legen Kamera wieder ein und Hauptfach frei für Laptop und andere Gegenstände. Im Urlaub dann die Fächer für Objektive etc anpassen. Vielleicht gebe ich ein Update wie es gelaufen ist.
5,Ras  ce sac me convient très bien.. la housse en cas de pluie est fournie.. Très bien conçue pour plusieurs objectifs et deux Boitiers..Les rembourrages pour le transport est très bien fait... on ne le sens pas du tout..Dommage que l' on ne peut pas y mettre une tablette...Le prix est très compétitif .. Qualité Volume 25 L et sa Fonctionnalité par rapport a d'autre sac équivalant..Je vous le recommande sans problème.Cdlt Christophe.
5,Der Kamera-Rucksack ist genau was ich gesucht habe. Wenn ich zu Aufnahmeplätzen unterwegs bin möchte ich gerne alles dabei haben. In dem Rucksack habe ich jetzt eine Maviv pro mit 4 Akkus und allen Zubehör eine Maviv Mini mit 3 Akkus und allem Zubehör eine LUMIX fz 1000 2 mit allem Zubehör diverse Ladegeräte und Kabel und ein 17 Zoll Laptop. Das 17 Zoll Laptop lässt sich allerdings nicht von der Seite einschieben sondern nur von oben. Das ist ein wenig umständlich aber es geht. Mit einem 15 Zoll Laptop dürfte es auch über den Seiteneinschub passen.
5,Very well made well padded/protection for camera and lenses large capacity.
4,utilisation pour transporter un max de materielsurtout 2 boitiers objos dont un 150/600
5,Fatto molto beneMa veramente grande!Quindi per le uscite veloci poco pratico ma per fortuna si può usare la borsa aggiuntiva!
4,Ottimo zaino e ben costruito. capiente e ben organizzato all'interno con la possibilità di personalizzazione degli spazi.
3,Più che uno zaino fotografico lo definirei  uno zaino che serve per gite ed escursioni quando ci si porta un corredo fotografico chi vuole portare solo attrezzatura guardi a cose più specifiche.Lo spazio per attrezzatura fotografica è abbondante nei due scomparti separati ma vi si accede solo frontalmente nessun accesso laterale come gli zaini classici fotografici però c'è parecchio spazio interno. Tutte le fibbie di chiusura dei nastri sono in plastica piuttosto leggera non so come si comporteranno al freddo. Di un paio di questi sugli spallacci non ho capito la funzione nè lo scopo.Buone le regolazioni per gli spallacci e le chiusure vita e pettorale.Per i divisori interni bisogna un pò ingegnarsi a disporli in base alla propria attrezzatura il treppiede si porta solo lateralmente.Una volta sulle spalle è comodo.La spedizione è stata rapidissima 3 giorni prima del previsto.
5,Arrived in good time and packaged well. A very Large bag (a bit to large for me as I'm small) It holds all my gear very easily.Highly Recommended.
5,This is bag is great i carry all of my equipment within one bag and have the second is extremely handy especially doing street photography. I highly recommend the bag and for hiking is great my only problem with the bag is the front doesn't open all way down which would have been great however great bag otherwise and can carry all of my equipment with lots of additional space for other items to be added .
5,Unos años trabajando con audiovisuales y unas mochilas y nada como esta realmente es una gran compra muy resistente fuerte y con mucho espacio.Solo debes tener en cuenta si quieres una mochila grande o no ya que realmente tiene mucho espacio es un poco más grande en la espalda que las "normales".Pero vale la pena el precio es realmente una mochila sensacional.
5,Veramente un super acquisto qualcuno lo ha definito il suv degli zaini concordo pienamente.Estremamente capiente io lo utilizzo per droni fpv ci posiziono 3/4 droni completi con 2 radio visore antenne batterie etc insomma veramente versatile e sopratutto ben fatto robusto ricco di cinghie di rinforzo ovunque altezza spallaccio regolabile rinforzi rigidi sotto sul piano di appoggio e ovviamente inserti tutti riposizionabili.il prezzo altalenante dei momenti si prende ad un prezzo molto vantaggioso .Insomma consigliatissimo.
5,Er hat zwar ein hohes Eigengewicht... ABER... das spürt man überhaupt nicht!!Absolut super Passform und dicke Tragegurte die das Gewicht sehr gut verteilen!Viel Stauraum und ein extrem belastbares Material!In einer der Rezensionen hier wurde über die Reißverschlüsse geklagt. Das kann ich NICHT bestätigen. Alle Reißverschlüsse sind extrem leichtgängig auch in den Nahtkurven!Der Rucksack ist sehr gut durchdacht. Die obere Tasche muss nur etwas geöffnet werden um an die Kamera zu kommen. Es fällt also nichts heraus wie beispielsweise bei vielen anderen Rucksäcken.Will man an die oberen Objektive so kann man einen der zwei Reißverschlüsse teils oder ganz öffnen um diese zu entnehmen. Auch hier bleibt der Rest des Inhaltes sicher im Inneren verstaut.Man muss auch keine Modellmaße haben um die Gurte zu schließen. Selbst mit einer Winterjacke klappt das noch perfekt.Die Regenhaube schützt noch zusätzlich und wird mitgeliefert.Begeisterung pur und Daumen hoch für eine Kaufempfehlung!!
4,Habe mir diesen Rucksack nicht für mein Foto equipment bestellt sondern für meine fpv Racer für die Kameras nutze ich einen anderen da finde ich diesen Rucksack nicht Praktisch da er nicht richtig steht und es ein morzt gefummel ist die Kameras heraus zu holen. Für meine Quadro Kopter aber ist er perfekt ich bekomme alle drei Quads hinein und könnte außen nochmal 2 anbringen Zubehör Sender Fatshark Akkus... Alles hat seinen Platz in die separate Tasche hab ich meinen Duolader gepackt und kann ihn somit in Auto lassen wenn ich ihn nicht brauche. Das Foto zeigt was ich alles im Rucksack verstaut habe. Es ist sogar noch Platz für 6 weitere Akkus.Einen Stern Abzug weil das Leergewicht schon recht hoch ist. Das spürt man aber kaum da er sehr gut gepolstert ist und super am Rücken anliegt.
5,There's a lot of space inside I have 3 photography body with lenses Nikon D 780 24-70 f2.8  Z6 II 24-70 f2.8  D7500 17-70 f2.8-4  and 2 more lenses 11mm f2.8 and 70-200 f2.8  flash sb 910  2 Gopro hero 9 whits 4 battery 1 tripod head 360 panoramas and 10 inches tablet very good stability when you wear it now only in time will see how resistant it is.
5,Bin mit dem Rucksack komplett zufrieden. Würde ich wieder kaufen.Das Schöne ist einfach das ich so ganz easy meine beiden Kameras mitnehmen kann ohne das die 2 Kamerataschen so doof rumbaumeln. Das Schönste bzw ein schönes Feature finde ich das unten eine kameratasche schon intigriert ist und ich selbst wenn ich den großen Rucksack mit in Urlaub nehm und an einen Tag entscheide ich brauch nur 1 Kamera mit objektiv das ich die kleine Tasche rausnehmen kann somit immer eine Kleine Kameratasche dabei hab :DAlso daumen hoch :D
5,Reçu dans les délais prévus très bien emballé ce sac va au delà de mes espérences. Très bien conçu avec de nombreux espaces de rangement je vais pouvoir y  glisser deux reflex mes objectifs de nombreux accessoires. Ce sac est également agréable à porter les bretelles sont rembourrées et facilement réglables. Je le recommande à tous les mordus de la photo car de plus le matériel est très bien  protégé contre les chocs. Je suis ravi.
4,Direkt nach dem Ausacken---große Augen ist der Groß.Aber dafür passt die komplette Kameraausrüstung rein. ( Kamera 2x Blitz 5 Objektive Stativ viel Kleinkram Trinken Regensachen)Sehr praktisch für kurze Touren ist die kleine extra Tasche. Diese ist entweder als Umhänge oder Bauchtasche einsetzbar.Schade ist nur wenn das Stativ mit Tasche an den seitlichen Haltern angebracht ist daß dann ein "Flaschen Netz" ungenutzt bleibt.Selbst mit voller Beladung bleibt es ein bequemer nie aufdringlicher Tragecompfort. Gerissene Nähte wie hier mehrfach berichtet  hatte ich nicht. Auch nach über 20Km Bergtour nicht. Was nicht so schön ist ist das Knarzen der Träger oder Riemen.Fazit : Für den Alltag zu groß aber zur dauerhaften Aufbewahrung der Ausrüstung gut. Auf Wanderung etc. Super auch als "normaler" Rücksack.
5,Zaino davvero comodo e spazioso fantastico per i viaggi!Dispone di numerose tasche e comparti dove mettere svariati oggetti. Se sei un fotografo o Videomaker questo zaino fa per te!!!
5,Endlich........ Endlich habe ich das gefunden was ich seit geraumer Zeit gesucht habe. Einen vernünftig verarbeiteten Fotorucksack mit reichlich Platz. Dieser Fotorucksack ist schlichtweg der Hammer. Verarbeitung Tragecomfort Platzangebot einfach Top.Ich habe nun 2 DSLR beide mit Batteriegriff (einmal Canon 7d und einmal Canon 50D) ein 28er 70-200mm ein 18-135 mm ein 18er 50mmeinen Canon Extender 2fach verstaut. Die Objektive alle mit angesetzter Gegenlichtblende hier spare ich mir also auch schon das ewige an und ab.Zusätzlich mein kpl. Zubehör wie Ministativ Speicherkarten Funkfernauslöser Ersatzakkus Blasebalg usw..... Und ich habe immer noch Platz.Der Burner ist auch die Bauchtasche welche bei Bedarf am Rucksack angeklickt werden kann. Diese sitzt auf einem schönen breiten Bauchgurt und ist mittig mit Klett fixiert damit sie nicht hin und herrutscht. Finde ich sehr gut durchdacht. An der Seite habe ich noch mein Einbein angebracht. Mein Dreibein nehme ich dann doch lieber in die Hand wenn ich es mal benötige das wird mir mit Gimbal Head sonst zu schwer da hinten.Die Bauchtasche werde ich wohl nutzen um kleine Getränkeflaschen und einen kleinen Snack mitzunehmen. Erspart beim durchstreifen des Gebietes das Rucksack absetzen. Alles perfekt also... Ich bin auf jeden Fall glücklich und kann dieses Teil nur empfehlen.
5,Come molti di voi sono un maniaco degli zaini. Ne ho provati decine e ho capito che non esiste lo zaino giusto per ogni occasione. Ho acquistato questo modello perché incuriosito dalle positive recensioni e devo dire che non mi ha affatto deluso! C'è una tasca per ogni cosa ed all'interno c'è una messenger bag che può essere usata autonomamente. È lo zaino per fotografi che mi aspettavo. All'interno ci metto: due sony A7 obiettivi 24/70 e 16/24 installati drone parrot Anafi portatile 14 pollici e cavi schede batterie e merendine di supporto :)
5,Ce sac photo est composé de plusieurs compartiments eux mêmes découpés en plusieurs petites loges aux parois amovibles il est donc extrêmement pratique.Une housse imperméable est fournie à l’intérieur du sac et des renforcements sont situés au niveau des bretelles et de la ceinture de portage ce qui améliore grandement le confort.Je recommande ce produit !
5,war ein Geschenk an den Sohn voller Erfolg  !!!!! Danke  alles super.
5,Si vous cherchez un sac avec beaucoup de rangement pour trimbaler tout votre matériel vidéo et photos c’est le sac parfait.
5,Der PB-01 ist mittlerweile mein vierter Kamerarucksack von TARION und ich bin einfach nur überzeugt vom Preis/Leistungsverhältnis!Er ist perfekt für Fotografische Wanderungen geeignet. Bietet eine Unmenge an Platz für das Equipment wie auch evtl andere Sachen wie Drohne Wechselsachen oder sonstiges.An der Qualität gibt es nichts zu meckern und ich bin überzeugt das er auch den einen oder anderen harten Einsatz wie auch regen gut überstehen wird. Ein weiterer Pluspunkt ist die (integrierte) Umhängetasche die sich entweder im unteren Fach verstauen lässt oder auch mit dem Rucksack am Bauch kombinieren lässt.Ich freue mich schon auf die ersten Ausflüge ;)
4,Lo zaino è ben costruito e i materiali sono buoni è spazioso e mi sembra robusto Lo sto usando intensamente da una settimana (carico 12 kg) non so ancora indicare se sia abbastanza resistente da durare a lungo senza danni ma per ora ottimo
4,Recibido en el tiempo especificado y bien empaquetado. Fabricado con buen material y aspecto fuerte y duradero. Es robusta perfecta para material fotografico y drones.
5,Qualité remarquable pour le prix beaucoup de rangement les différents réglages sont parfait pour un confort optimal il vaut largement sont prix et nous pouvons littéralement le comparer à des produits à 300€Des fermetures éclaire YKK serait top mais nous ne pouvons pas tout avoirs je ne regrette pas du tout mon achat je l’utilise pour du drone FPV racer ;) le top du top. Surtout à coter de sac de marque Torvol à 200€ bien moin qualy !
3,Es sac il est bien comme en photo bonne construction et plein de poche.la qualité des tissu est bonne de la prise enai.ais j'ai des gros doute sur les cerniere car une (la principale en haut) tend toujours a se bloquer. J'en suis pas très convaincu peut être defect unique mais je m'en doute. Les divisions sont des bonne quite épais et avec un bon strap. Je mettrai à jour ci pa cerniere Donne autre problème.
5,Super Rucksack für längere Touren und einiges an Kamera Equipment. Ich habe nur das obere Fach für 4 objektive und die Kamera genutzt. Den Kleinkram habe ich in den vielen kleinen Fächern verstaut. Es passt alles was ich habe wunderbar rein.
5,This backpack is a great backpack for longer trips.Because of it having multiple compartmens you can take your camera gear with you but also clothing food accesories.It has a lot of small compartments to provide room for small equipment such as chargers your phone etc..The backpack is very comfortable and can be adjusted in a lot of ways to make it fit your length and body type.The backpack also feels very firm and is made of good quality material.I have not used it in the rain so I can't tell anything about the water proof rain cover that comes with it. but it feels like it will not let any water through.Very happy with this backpack for a reasonable price!
5,È un zaino robusto molto ben imbottito e con un numero di tasche più che generoso. Il mio portatile da 154 entra agevolmente. La divisione in due reparti è molto utile e la possibilità di unirle per inserire un obiettivo dalla focale molto lunga è impagabile. Nella borsa esterna è possibile trasportare attrezzatura aggiuntiva come un corpo macchina con obiettivo montato flash e/o obiettivi a cui accedere con immediatezza. È un prodotto ben pensato per l'utilizzo a cui è destinato e realizzato in modo eccellente. Vale tutto il suo prezzo.
5,Excellent bag. Loads of space and pockets for allSorts of bits and pieces. I love the little bag which is ideal as a bag to take a lens or two out in the field. Well designed and recommended.
4,Por ahora muy útil el ordenador de 17'3 pulgadas que tengo entra pero cuesta pese a no estar preparado para este tamaño consigue entrar bien los compartimentos y todo lo que a mochila se refiere es inmejorable pero la sujeción superior de esta es pésima todo ek peso de la mochila se soporta por 2 tiras finas cosidas que rompen rápido en vez de recaer el peso sobre los dos tirantes que se colocan en los brazos por lo demás muy muy versátil y útil! En breve volaré con ella como equipaje de mano y espero que no hayan problemas por tamaño parece que no habrá!
5,Prodotto ottimo ci sta dentro tanta roba. Ottimo anche per la consegna arrivata in anticipo. Amazon sempre ottimo.
5,I was a little worried about this when I purchased it based on some of the reviews stating the threads were coming out and it wasn't well made. My experience was and has been quite the opposite. Used this for a week long trek in the Lake District as well as out and about here and there and am well pleased. The layout of the bag makes it easy to retrieve what your looking for lens or camera body cards or whatever. Very pleased with the purchase.
5,Dieser Kamerarucksack hat meine Erwartungen bei weiten übertroffen. Sehr lange habe ich nach einen Kamerarucksack gesucht der meinen Ansprüchen gerecht wird. Sicherlich gibt es viele andere auf diesem Niveau aber ich habe mich für diesen entschieden weil auch der Preis für mich in Ordnung war. Viel testen konnte ich noch nicht weil ich ihn erst zwei Tage habe. 3 Dinge kann ich sagen: Ich bin 176m groß und konnte ihn bequem tragen und es ist wirklich Platz genug für 2 Kameras und hervorragend Verarbeitet. Für mein 17" Laptop ist das Staufach an der Seite allerdings um etwa 4cm zu klein. Vielleicht hätte es gepasst aber ich wollte es jetzt nicht hinein zwängen.
4,Ben curato robusto molte possibilità di carico. Non leggerissimo ma ben studiato e materiali ottimi.
5,Der Rucksack ist stabil und hat genügend Platz für meine drei Objektive. Ich habe sogar mein gesamtes Equipment in dem Rucksack untergebracht allerdings bin auch ein Hobbyfotograf. Aufwanderungen trägt er sich sehr bequem und man kann die Träger  von S-L einstellen. Er ist auch gut gepolstert und es drückt nichts.
5,La compre para poder llevar todos los objetivos 18-55 50 90 irix 15mm 70-300mm monitor de campo+ pluto trigermas 2 cuerpos de camara una 80D y una fuji xt3 baterias de ambas un cargador de 28600 mhalinterna cables de conexiónetc. esto es lo bueno de esta mochila por contra tendras que tener en cuenta el peso yo la utilizo para llevar todo mi equipo y una segunda mochila mas liviana para elegir equipo en las salidas.Los materiales parecen resistentes y los acabados se ven cuidados.La recomiendo.No le pongo 5 estrellas para viajar por razones de peso.
5,Ich bin einfach nur begeistert von diesem tollen Fotorucksack.Pros:Ein Gigantisches Fassungsvolumen ich bekomme endlich all mein Equipment unter. Die separate Tasche ist Ideal für die Zweitkamera oder zusätzliche Objektive bei bedarf. Ideal bei Reise- oder Naturfotografie.Cons:Es gibt nicht viel was ich zum mäkeln habe aber der Vollständigkeit. Ich finde es schade dass die Regenhaube separat und einzel ist und nicht im Boden des Rucksack in einem festen Verstaufach eingenäht ist. In der Beschreibung wird eine Laptopgröße bis 17" angegeben Ich bekomme zwar meinen 17" Lenovo rein aber nur ganz ganz knapp.Summa Summarum ein gelungenes Produkt bit etwas Verbesserungsbedarf was ich aber guten Gewissen empfehlen kann
4,Allgemein gut verarbeitet aber an ei paar Stellen waren die Nähten nicht perfekt verarbeitet. Passt viel rein und ist sehr praktisch. Wenn man den Rucksack richtig einstellt ist er richtig bequem und man kann lange damit wandern.
5,Zaino che cerco da molto tempo!Molto capiente che mi permetta di inserire tutto ciò che mi serve x escursioni fotografichedall'attrezzatura a cibobevande e indumenti!spallacci ultra comodi!Adoro la possibilità di regolazione in base alla tua altezza!Finiture cuciture e cerniere davvero resistenti e ben fatte!ora mi manca solo da testarlo in escursioni di montagna!Complimenti ottimo zaino
4,Der Rucksack hat mir alles in allem sehr gut gefallen mit der einen Ausnahme dass ich ihn für meine Körperlänge  (206 cm) nicht richtig einstellen konnte - daher ging er auch direkt wieder zurück.Wäre das Problem mit dem Tragekomfort nicht gewesen so hätte ich ihn auf jeden Fall behalten der Rucksack machte einen hochwertigen Eindruck und hatte viele praktische Fächer für die gesamte Kameraausrüstung.
5,Mi serviva uno zaino dalle grandi dimensioni da poterci mettere 2 macchine fotografiche con trigger montati in questo prodotto ho trovato quello che mi serviva spazioso modulabile e comodo da portare
5,Good quality
5,LO zaino.... Comodo e resistente duemila scomparti modificabili a piacimento ci ho ficcato dentro : a7iii 24-105 14mm 70-200 Ronin rs2 con tutti gli accessori PC alimentatore carica batterie di camera telefono e Ronin 3 hard disk schede a non finire agenda un cavalletto di quelli leggeri e una bottiglia di acqua da 1litro.... Il tutto senza sforzare neanche una zip....
2,Habe den Rucksack für meine Rundreise durch Costa Rica (in der Regenzeit) gekauft.Und ich bereue diese Entscheidung sehr!Zum Thema Regen komme ich allerdings später.Die Schulterriemen sind gut gepolstert und sind höhenverstellbar. Sie sind nur mittels eines Klettsystems am Rucksack befestigt welches leider bei jedem Schritt echt unangenehm quietscht. Das Quietschen war so laut dass ich beim Wandern durch die Nationalparks im Umkreis von 10 Metern in Ruhe Fotos machen könnte weil es alle Mitmenschen genervt hat.Weiterhin wurden durch dieses Klettsystem sehr unangenehme feine Vibrationen erzeugt.Der Rucksack macht eigentlich einen robusten Eindruck allerdings ist an einer Stelle eine Naht aufgeplatzt auf welcher eigentlich keine Lastung einwirkt.Platz bietet der Rucksack echt ausreichend weshalb er auch zwei Sterne erhält.Die Trennwände im Rucksack sind durch Klett änderbar allerdings sehr instabil. Positioniert man ein schweres Objektiv im oberen Bereich und lässt die Kammern darunter unbefüllt so drückt das Gewicht des Objektivs die Wände ein und fliegt lose im Rucksach herum.Im Lieferumfang enthalten ist auch ein Regenschutz...Dieser Regenschutz schützt auch vor leichtem Nieselregen um von der Haustür zum Auto zu laufen.Ich habe den Begriff Regenschutz wohl zu wörtlich genommen.Kommt man in einen richtigen Regen so sammelt sich das Regenwasser welches zwischen Rücken und Rucksack herunterläuft wie in einer Badewanne im "Regenschutz".Ich hatte im unteren Bereich des Rucksacks "zum Glück nur" meine Drohne (DJI Mavic 2 Pro 1800€). Die sind ja bekanntlich auch zum Tauchen geeignet... NICHT! Die Drohne ist nun defekt!Das Wasser hat sich durch den ganzen Rucksack gezogen sodass auch meine Kamera (Canon 5D Mark iv) und meine Objektive klitschnass waren. Diese funktionieren zum Glück noch. Dennoch werde ich sie zu Canon zur Überprüfung senden.Fazit: wer einen Rucksack benötigt in dem er viel Equipment verstauen kann und nicht wirklich damit unterwegs ist ihn nur indoor verwendet kann sich das Teil ohne Bedenken kaufen.Wer allerdings damit viel unterwegs ist und etwas für outdoor sucht sollte sich besser nach etwas Anderem umschauen.
5,Massisive capacity. Not just camera use. I use it for sensitive test instruments and all their accessories. Highly recommended
5,Das ist ein Fotorucksack der sein Geld wert ist. Ich kann 5 Objektive hereinpacken und zwei große DSLR Kameras und es bleibt noch Platz für Snacks Akkus Ladegeräte Stativ und was zutrinken. Ich bin damit sehr oft und viel gewandert durch den Hüftgurt eine sehr angenehme Sache sehr zu empfehlen.
5,Es tal y como describe el anuncio Recomendable 100%
5,Entra todo mi equipo y es lo mas cómodo que existe micho mejor que mi antigua mochila que se me quedó pequeña
5,Ce sac a tout pour me  plaire! je suis encore plus satisfait que prévu. Rigide là où il faut extrêmement confortable discret  malgré sa taille  fermetures de qualité et faciles à glisser. J'y ai mis 1full frame 1 APS 6 objectifs dont un 70-300mm flash plein d'accessoires. Poids total chargé 103Kg. Et pourtant j'ai pu le mettre toute la journée sur moi en promenade dans des jardins. Tarion vous m'avez conquis continuez!
5,カメラ好きの彼氏へのプレゼントとして購入しました。大変気に入ってもらえて、使う用事がないのに背負っています。
5,me ha encantado si versatilidad comodidad y de momento su construcción esta a la altura me gustaría un asa superior que diera mas sensación de aguantar el equipo
4,Obwohl andere Rezensionen behaupten die Reissverschlüsse wären schlecht funktionieren meine gut. Sie sind ev nicht Topqualität aber für diesen Preis bietet der Rucksack alles was man braucht. Va der Laptopstauraum ist gut. Hatte den Rucksack für einen 4 Wochen Trip USA gekauft - hat sich generell gut bewährt. Einziger wirklicher Nachteil: er liegt dem Rücken vollflächig an und man schwitzt deshalb stark.
5,Ich bin total zufrieden mit dem Kamera Rucksack. Er ist hochwertig verarbeitet und das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis ist Top! Allerdings würde ich mir mehr kleine Seitenfächer wünschen in die ich ladekabel und Akkus vernünftig verstauen kann. Das Einschubfach für das Laptop passt gut für meinen 13 Zoll Mac ob ein 15 Zoll Notebook reinpasst kann ich nicht genau sagen wird aber eher knapp.Die Fächereinteilung ist perfekt und der Rucksack kommt mit zahlreichen Trennwänden sodass jeder sich sein eigenes System einrichten kann. Für mich persönlich ist der Rucksack aber zu gross da ich NOCH nicht so viel Equipment habe. Ich habe ihn mir also auch für die Zukunft gekauft.Trotz ein paar Kritikpunkte 5 Sterne!
5,sono molto contento tutto ottimo e davvero utile per esigenze di fotografia e trekking.
5,Quelle bonne achat j'ai fais.Super produit super rapport qualité prix.
5,Beh è veramente uno zaino gigante forse anche più di quanto credevo. Ho sistemato tutto il corredo fotografico (una reflex e quattro obiettivi FF) nella parte superiore dedicata e rimane ancora spazio. La parte inferiore rimane completamente libera e ho scelto di utilizzarla per metterci dei vestiti e/o un eventuale sacchetto con uno spuntino e una bottiglietta d'acqua.Un ottimo zaino !
5,Bello grande quello che mi serviva per piccole produzioni video "one man"
5,What a useful backpack! I couldn't find this kind of setup anywhere else. Very convenient to have two large sections two medium sections as well as several small pockets here and there.Other than pretty much all your camera gear you can also carry a waterbottle at one side and a tripod or another waterbottle at the other side.The straps in front of the bottom part can also be tightened to hold for example a rolled up sitting pad.Just an amazing level of detail!
5,Fonctionnel robuste offrant une grande possibilité de modulation confortable au transport etc.Je n'ai vraiment que des éloges à faire sur ce produit avec lequel je transporte mes drones et l'ensemble des équipements et accessoires nécessaires à ceux-ci. Il a une très grande capacité et la sacoche interne indépendante est très pratique. Je recommande vivement ce produit.
5,Der Rucksack ist gut zu tragen und überaus funktional. Wir nutzen den für Wandertouren mit den Kindern und haben neben einer kleinen DSLR-Austattung eben auch an Essen Trinken und Windeln alles dabei was man für einen schönen Nachmittag braucht.Für unsere Zwecke absolut geeignet...
5,Mai più senza
1,Spazi utilizzati male si spreca molto spazio ed è enorme rispetto a quanto dichiarato. In uno zaino più piccolo ci entrano le stesse cose.
5,Ich habe mir den Rucksack gekauft da ich als Hobbyfotograf eine ganze Menge Equipment habe. In meinen bisherigen Rucksack habe ich nicht alles einpacken können. IN dem jetzigen Rucksack geht das aber gut. Er hat 2 Fächer in die man viele Objektive und auch ohne Probleme 2 Kameras unterbekommt.Selbst mein 150-600 mm Objektiv passt in den Rucksack. Neben den 2 Kamerafächern gibt es auch noch 2 Fächer in denen man Speicherkarten Akkus und sonstiges Zubehör verstauen kann.Die Fächer gehen alle nach vorn auf. Mir würde es besser gefallen wenn die Kamerafächer in Richtung des Rücken geöffnet werden könnten.Der Rucksack sitzt angenehm am Rücken und lässt sich durch viele Verstellmöglichkeiten auf sich selbst anpassen.
5,Es fantástica en todos los sentidos!!!Tiene gran capacidad todo va bien colocado y protegido cómoda de llevar yo le he llegado a cargar 11/15 kg. de equipo andando por el monte y es súper cómoda. Además tiene un diseño y colores muy guapos. La recomiendo 100%
5,This bag is an absolute lifesaver. The very convenient storage capacity is overwhelming and is very well designed. It is beyond expectations and serves as a great investment. You can't go wrong with this bag.
3,Es una mochila GRANDE. No pesa mucho o al menos bastante menos de lo que me esperaba siendo una mochila de dichas dimensiones.Llevo siempre dos equipos enteros conmigo 2 cuerpos y 7 objetivos con todo tipo de accesorios de fotografía necesarios y el portatil. El tripode normalmente lo llevo en su mochila porque pesa mucho y ya sería demasiado peso en la mochila.La pega ENORME que le encuentro es que los bolsillos "exteriores" no son nada seguros de alguna persona de mano larga que te los quiera abrir y robarte todo lo que lleves ahí porque no tiene ningun sistema de seguridad en esos bolsillos y la verdad que viviendo en Madrid esto es algo que es muy importante.
5,
5,Zaino robusto fatto molto bene aderisce bene alla schiena e una volta pieno quasi non lo senti. Unica cosa è davvero molto grande e per persone minute e piccoline come me magari è un po' difficile metterlo sulle spalle (infatti mi devo sedere prima). Comunque se avete parecchia attrezzatura secondo me è un ottimo zaino. Contiene bene anche un laptop (il mio ad esempio misura 26 h/ 45 diagonale e 39 larghezza)
4,Guter Rucksack für meine Linsen und Bodys. Gute Einstellmöglichkeit von Gurthöhe usw.Die zweite kleine Tasche ist praktisch im Urlaub und auf Reisen und war bislang öfters im Einsatz. Nachteil: Dadurch das soviel reinpasst  in den Rucksack lädt man das Ding auch bis zum Anschlag voll. Einige Linsen hab ich gar nicht gebraucht und auf einem 3 wöchigen Trip durch Asien hab ich beschlossen weniger reinzupacken. Man schleppt dann doch ganz gut Gewicht mit sich rum :) Also gut überlegen was man wirklich braucht sonst schleppt man sich tot. Ging bislang als Handgepäck ibei jeder Fluglinie durch. Keinerlei Probleme.
3,Mochila muy grande entran demasiadas cosas. Si la llenas pesaría una barbaridad.Aún así es una mochila muy muy cómoda. Y bien construida. Muchos apartados y muchas maneras de administrar los compartimiento.Si estás buscando una mochila grande para tu equipo fotográfico 100% recomendable.Yo la descambie por que tengo un equipo Olympus y era la mochila demasiado grande. Aún metiendo flashes y todo no la llenaba. Una exageración de mochila.
5,Great rucksack
5,Je recommande vivement ce sac les finitions sont propres et les rangements sont incroyables.Impossible de trouver mieux à ce prix contrairement à la concurrence
5,Comodo spazioso versatile con copertura impermeabile a prova di pioggia intensa. trovano posto la mia Canon 80d con due ottiche il drone Dji mini 2 e la videocam Dji pocket 2 con tutti gli accessori per tutto il corredo. Assolutamente indispensabile.
5,Super produit je ne suis pas déçu.Le gros sac pour ramener le gros du matos et le sac banane pour ce que j’ai besoin au moment de la prestation rapidement.Dans la banane je peux mettre un A7III avec le tamron 28-75 et la cage smallrig monté et un objectif de 50 et de 35
5,War schon länger auf der Suche nach einem Rucksack mit dem man 3 DLSR mit Zubehör und verschiedenen Objektiven bequem mitnehmen kann. Der Tarion kann es. Unfassbar was man alles in das Ding hinein bekommt. Dennoch hat man schnelle Zugriff auf alle Kameras. Das Ding wiegt nun gut und gerne 15kg. Auf der Schulter getragen ist das Dank der weichen Polster überhaupt kein Problem. Wie lange er das Gewicht aushält wird sich noch zeigen müssen.
5,Fantastic backpack. Good size e good quality for the price
4,Well here I am saying about this Rucksack it is very good size  very well developed great for who travell a lots and caring your camera this rucksacks has  plenty of space for camera and lents and  also space for  passport which  is very useful.Thank you so much for the company and the responsibility with their clients I am glad to buy with you hope soon we can beeing in contact again.I really recommend.
5,Fantastic piece of equipment for photographers well worth it
4,un sac que je viens de recevoir et qui me semble de bonne fabrication. Des poches partout et le compartiment qui permet de ranger une petite sacoche (bien vu). Attention c'est quand même un gros sac et on peut y mettre pas mal de matériel photo. Je verrai à l'utilisation mais au premier regard je suis très content.
4,La mochila en general está muy tiene bastante espacio y muchas configuraciones aunque si tienes que llevar un tele largo por ejemplo un 150-600 o un 70-200 me da la sensación de que va un poco justo pero es la única pega que le veo de momento.
4,Photo en balade
4,Me ha encantado sobretodo porque al quitar todos los separadores interiores se queda un espacio diafano amplio para meter todo lo que me hacia falta de ropa etc... Tiene muchos bolsillos.Tiene un par de fallos:- La primera es que los dos bolsillos laterales quedan muy hacia atrás en mi caso.- La segunda que la cinta de ajuste de la cintura se sale constantemente y hay que volver ajustarla.En general le doy un 8/10.
4,J ai acheté ce produit il y a deux mois.Je cherche un sac pour transporter mon matériel photo (objectif 70 200 24 70 60 600 mon boitier et mon mavic.Ce sac me satisfait parfaitement !
5,Lots of space a few pockets
4,ちょっと予想したより大きかった。でも2台の一眼レフを持って行く時は、望遠鏡なども一緒に車で行くので、問題はありません。一つのバッグに2セット入るし、小物を入れるところも沢山あるのでOKかなと思います。それに値段はとても安い！
5,Genial para llevar todo lo que necesita para sus clases de audiovisuales: cámara portátil estabilizador…
5,Quand on est photographe on a besoin d’un sac avec du rangement  le sac Tarion correspond à cette demande . De multiple rangement des grands et des petits . Un sac ergonomique en plus !!! Une poche pour mettre l’ordinateur . Une sacoche détachable quelle super idée !! Je suis pas déçu de mon achat je vous le recommande !! Il est top !!!
4,Imperméable confortable  etanche et pratique
5,pour les sortie nature tout mon materiel a dispositionle. sac a dos est tres confortable
5,Good
5,Der Rucksack ist sehr geräumig und mit der flexiblen Inneneinrichtung für mehrere Zwecke zu gebrauchen. Wir benutzen den Rucksack für den Transport einer Funkausrüstung.
5,En general me encanta!! De muy buena calidad y los separadores también son firmes.La única "pega" por decir algo es: la Compré por llevar cámara y ropa en algún viaje de 2-3 días todo junto pero no entra como bulto de mano gratuito así que tendré que pagar el suplemento de 10e de maleta extra de algunas compañías porq es más grande.Pero mola 1000000000 la recomiendo!
5,Erano mesi che cercavo uno zaino/borsa conforme alle mie esigenze. Ho trovato questo e per le caratteristiche e la media delle recensioni ho deciso di acquistarlo. Che dire è veramente uno zaino capiente comodo MOLTO versatile robusto e ben bilanciato con un'ampia possibilità di personalizzazione. Consigliatissimo.
5,Je viens de le recevoir. Esthétique 10/10. Qualité 10/10. Taille parfaite avec un confort vraiment parfait... J'ai hâte de l'essayer en randonnée. Mes deux réflexes Nikon ainsi que mon drone Mavic pro rentrent parfaitement ainsi que tous les accessoires et mon ordinateur. Parfait pour les viyages. A voir a l'utilisation mais tout semble prometteur....il y a même un sifflet de "secours" intégrer dans les bretelles. Et un sacré protection contre la pluie. Le petit sac en plus est vraiment un plus 👌
5,Ich war erst skeptisch. Neues Produkt über 100 Euro Langstreckenversand und keine Bewertung.Was soll ich sagen? Das Ding ist Klasse. Der Rucksack hat genau die richtige Größe um die Kamera "schussbereit" zu transportieren und auch den nötigen Zubehör mit zu nehmen. Die Innenaufteilung ist flexibel und gut gepolstert.  Alles ist sicher verpackt und durch die Öffnung oben muss man den Rucksack nicht erst in den Dreck stellen um an das Innenleben zu kommen.Zusätzlich sind Gurte verbaut die breit und bequem sind. Sowohl an den Schultern als auch an der Hüfte. Zudem lässt sich die Rückenpartie auf die Größe des Trägers einstellen. Wer keinen Kameragurt im Nacken mag nimmt einfach den im Rucksack integrierten. Zusätzlich bekommt man eine Bauchtasche die auch ausreichend Platz bietet.
5,Ho da poco questo zaino . Da subito mi è apparso molto capiente e robusto. Munito di una borsa nella parte bassa per portare l’essenziale rappresenta un plus in più molto comodo. Numerose cerniere ben strutturate e ben cucite e dotato anche di una supplementare copertura anti pioggia. Risulta estremamente capiente e comodo ovviamente una volta carico di tutto ha il suo peso ma per le uscite naturalistiche e il top tra i tanti offerti direi che è il miglior compromesso per qualità e comodità . Lo riacquisterei sicuramente.
5,Great value for money comfortable to wear and it’s got loads of compartments for gear. I find it really well made and the tripod fits to it brilliantly.
4,Le poids du sac est vite oublié par le super confort de sa structure.Très fonctionnel totalement modulable.Un gros regret : la housse de pluie ne peut pas  être installée si un trépied est transporté à l'extérieur du sac. En cas de pluie pas d'étanchéité.
5,Ottimo prodotto robusto e capiente nulla da invidiare a zaini ben più costosi. Ci sta il mio corredo con 2 sony A7III 4 ottiche drone dji mavic e gimbal. Fantastico
5,Per adesso son molto soddisfatto di questo acquisto. È molto capiente e l'accesso alla prima fotocamere è molto rapido. Lo consiglio a tutti gli amanti del trekking e della fotografia.Sul mio canale YouTube (Nicolas Toninelli) potete vedere il video con la recensione utile per farsi un'idea completa
5,Questo zaino per me è davvero ottimo. Siccome tra drone gopro macchina fotografica con vari obbiettivi e accessori ho bisogno di molto spazio questo prodotto ha risolto tanti dei miei problemi. Il prezzo è molto competitivo rispetto ad altri ed è anche bello robusto.È molto utile per chi come me ha bisogno di spazio.Consigliatissimo
5,Auf die herausnehmbare kleine Tasche könnte ich verzichtender Raum für ddiese Tasche läßt sich gut für zwei Teleobjektive und ein Kameragehäusemit Zwischenböden optimieren.Sehr gut für umfangreiche Ausrüstungen. Starke Muskulatur ist erforderrlich
5,muito boa mesmo com muita coisa a sua ergonomia faz com que o peso distribua pelos ombrosbonita e versatil
5,Con esta mochila cubro mis necesidades a la hora de salir a hacer fotografía todo un día.Cabe el material fotográfico y el almuerzo o abrigos que siempre son necesarios sin necesidad de llevar otra bolsa
5,Superbe sac je suis vraiment étonné de sa taille et sa qualité c'est une fourre tout incroyableJe peux mettre tout mon matériel FPV un drone Mavic 2 pro avec du matériel photo.Pour le prix imbattables
3,Der Rucksack ist für meine Ansprüche (Wander- Motorrad und Kabinentauglicher Rucksack mit Kamerafach und Platz für restliches Gepäck) nahezu perfekt. Auf Motorradtauglichkeit habe ich noch nicht testen können und dass es bei dem breiten Anforderungsprofil für alles passt sei auch dahingestellt – in der Summe ist es ein sehr guter Kompromiss. Negativ fielen mir jedoch sofort folgende Punkte auf:Die Reissverschlüsse sind alles andere als leichtgängig und verhaken sich auch in spannungsfreien Kurven sehr schnell. Ich weiss nicht wie lange diese schadfrei überstehen.Wie so oft bei "Made by noname in China": Es bleibt ein mulmiges Gefühl bei den verwendeten Materialien. Schmierige Gummiteile (Hebegriff) hinterlassen einen Film auf der Handinnenfläche die "Textilien" (vielmehr muss man heututage von Kunstoffen reden) verbreiten nach dem Auspacken einen unangenehmen Duft. Ich ließ ihn erstmal ordentlich ausdünsten.Behalten werde ich ihn allein aufgrund mangelnder Alternativen. Ich hoffe das Format setzt sich so durch. Wer Alternativen kennt gerne in die Kommentare!
5,Sac très bien conçu et robuste semble t-il le seul inconvénient est que compte tenu de la capacité d'emport il devient vite très lourd mais c'est à chacun de s'organiser pour emporter le stricte nécessaire. Personnellement je l'ai acheté pour y mettre un drone Mavic 2 Zoom et un camescope Sony FDR AX 53 tout rentre parfaitement y compris l'IPad 4 mini.
4,リュックとしての機能・性能も文句無し。
5,Stabil und sehr gut verarbeitet! Du willst 15 lipos an einem ort fliegen wo du mit deinem auto nicht weiter kommst?! Kauf dir diesen rucksack und lauf los....
5,Looks great interior is very flexible even at moment I'm not decided which design is perfect for my Pent K1 + 4 lenses + pano heads + etc. And this additional small bag is perfect for "temporay" hiding of camera this wide waist strap is good idea suits very well.All straps are adjustable so to find own placement is easy job.
5,Das war der richtige kauf für meine Kameraausrüstung. Man bekommt so viel rein. Bei mir passt:  meine Kamera  Objektive + zubehör dji mavic air Drohne + 2 Akkus insta 360 one x mit kleinem Koffer die ganzen Netzteile und dji mobile 3 rein. Platz für meinen 17 zoll Laptop ist auch noch Platz. Wenn man noch die kleine fototasche hernimmt (die ist gold wert) passt noch mehr in den Rucksack rein.
5,So much room that I was able to fit in all my equipment
5,Leider konnte ich den Rucksack noch nicht im Einsatz bewerten. Jedoch ist er sauber verarbeitet und von sehr guter Qualität. Den andere Stelle beschriebenen Geruch nach Chemie konnte ich nicht bemerken. Der Rucksack bietet ausreichend Platz für mein Kamera-Equipment und auch noch für andere Dinge die man auf einer Wanderung benötigt. Nach dem ersten Eindruck bietet er einen hohen Tragekomfort jedoch konnte ich das noch nicht auf einer längeren Wanderung testen. Die beigefügte Kameratasche verfügt uber einen sehr breiten bequemen Hüftgurt und die Möglichkeit die Kamera an den Schultergurten einzuhängen sind weitere durchdachte Gimmiks.
3,Por fin encuentro una mochila en la que entra todo mi equipo. La he usado para llevar equipo de vídeo y he reducido lo que antes llevaba en 2 mochilas a una. teniendo en cuenta que la llevo a reventar de cosas es bastante cómoda. No le doy las 5 estrellas porque no me convence el compartimento para el portátil. Resulta incomodo meterlo si la mochila no está vacía. en mi caso por el lateral no entra y por la parte de arriba al tener el pliegue en la parte superior hay que manipular mucho para dar acceso al portátil. Importante tener en cuenta que cumple con las medidas para esa mochila.
5,Fantastico prezzo giusto robusto comodo e versatile. Comoda tracolla compresa che trova alloggiamento sul fondo dello zaino. A mio avviso perfetto tante tasche ben cucite e spazi notevoli per un buon corredo anche professionale.Lo uso da un anno circa ed è ancora perfetto. Al momento non ha nulla da invidiare a marche famose.
5,Conforme alle aspettative il prodotto ideale che cercavo come compagno ideale per i miei viaggi fotografici in giro per il mondo
3,Grand sac à dos mais pas adapter pour les objectif 70-209 en F2.8.Tant de place mal explorée
5,es útil para distribuir tu material..siempre que sean piezas más o menos pequeñas....trípodes o palos largos han de ir fuera al ser un formato de dos espacios separados en la mitad de la mochila.Su calidad y precio cubre perfectamente las expectativas encantado.Solo un problema..el espacio para el ordenador es justito en mi caso...mi 17" workstation HP no cabe.
5,Ich habe diesen Rucksack extra gekauft da ich immer noch einen Platz brauche um für die Kinder etwas zu Trinken und Essen dabei zu haben. Mit meiner normalen Kameratasche war man auch noch eingeschränkt da man die nur seitlich tragen konnte und die meisten Kamerarucksäcke zu wenig Platz bieten um alles von der Kamera dabei zu haben. Hier bekommt man alles unter und hat im unteren Fach noch genug Stauraum für andere Sachen. Ich kann ihn nur weiter empfehlen.
5,Bien qu'un peu lourd à vide il se presque oublier sur le dos qualité du produit excellente !Des rangements... en veux tu ? en voilà !Excellent !
5,Plenty of room for everything you would need
4,人生初のカメラ専用バックパックとして購入中国製で価格も安いが作りは良い。収納物はPanasonic LUMIX DC-S1RLUMIX S 24-105mm F4 MACRO O.I.S.LEICA APO-VARIO-ELMARIT-SL 1:2.8-4/90-280 mmDMW-FL580L フラッシュライトDMW-MS2 ステレオガンマイクロホンMOMAN 3-WAY VIDEO HEADMOMAN Desktop TripodNEEWER COLD SHOE EXTENSION ADJUSTABLE 8" RAIL ESE-20apple iPAD miniホルダークリーニングキットその他レンズフィルターを入れるとはみ出してしまう。カメラポーチを外出し使いでやっと撮影機材が入れられる。登山用具を入れられる程容量が無い。しかし、この価格でこの出来栄えはお買い得。
4,他の人はベージュ？を選択したようですが、私はツーリングに似合いそうな黒を購入。特に不具合はないですね。早速、今日、撮影しにカメラ二台にGoProとモバイルバッテリー3個(GoProの電池消費が激しい為)を持って出かけてきましたが、とにかく"重い"、それにつきますね。ポケットも多く色々な物を入れられるスペースがあって助かるのですが、上記の物を入れると半端なく重くてなります。これを所持して登山して〜なんて私には無理かな。ただ、今まで使っていた物よりカメラの取り出しも楽だし、上記の物も今までのでは全く入らなかったけど、このバッグなら余裕で入るので凄く助かるんですけど、上記の物無しでも相当重いですからね。それだけですね、不満は。後は何一つ問題無し。いや〜・・・肩にアザが・・・というぐらい重かったです。
2,Grande possibilité de rangement mais par contre l'élastique qui lache 24 heures après achat du sac le velcro intérieur du sac n'accroche pas si bien que ça les coutures du réglage de hauteur de bretelles n'est meme pas complet (manque de point de couture) on voit bien que c'est du chinois déguisé.Je ne met pas 1 étoile car le sac en vaut la chandelle mais ne va pas durer longtemps dîtes vous que c'est un sac pour savoir comment organiser un sac photo.
5,a l'exception d'un petit element aidant a l'ouverture des zip qui a cassé rapidement le sac est juste parfait !!Utilisé avec un dslr un drone et un ronin S tout rendre parfaitement dans ce sac !
5,Sehr Compact und durchdacht. Gibt viele Möglichkeiten der Anpassung an eigene Bedürfnisse . Fällt größer aus als auf den Bildern zu erkennen.
5,Estremamente ben fatto e robusto specialmente nelle parti ( come le zip ) sottoposte a usuraSpazio infinitoEsteticamente piacevole ilChe non guasta affatto
5,rien a dire matériel de qualité et très fonctionnel
5,Super Qualität zum Toppreis! Vielseitig robust und super Optik!
4,到着後三度使用。詰め込みにも、開けて使うにも、背負うにも、ちょうど良い。自分にぴったりでした。耐久性はこれからーです。バックインバックで、ウエストポーチタイプの小型鞄も良きでしたー♬付属品のはずのレインカバーがどうしても見つけられません。どのポケットに内蔵されていますか？
5,Grande contenance tout est pensé pour la photographie casier modulable etcA acheter les yeux fermés
4,BonjourJe viens d'offrir ce sac pour un anniversaire et en l 'ouvrant on vient de constater que le protege sac n'est pas dedans. Pouvez vous faire quelque chose.Merci Mme Rome
5,I’m really impressed with how much space this bag has to offer and is an essential bit of kit for any outdoor photographer.The compartments can comfortably fit in my DSLR camera lenses drone and all other stuff needed for a day of being in the outdoors.I’m extremely happy with the removable waist bag that’s turned out to be the perfect bag for carrying my drone.Would highly recommend.
5,Love the bag
5,Nach längerem Testen kann ich sagen das der Rucksack bis jetzt der beste ist den ich hatte
5,I've used the bag extensively including climbing Munros and its been brilliant.Considering how much use its had it is showing very little sign of wearI would highly recommend loading it full then adjusting the straps on the back while in the comfort of your own home. Saves backache
5,Sehr schöner und gut gemachter Rucksack mit allen Tricks für diejenigen wie mich die mehr als eine Kamera benutzen.Die Gurte können von M nach S gewechselt werdenSehr professionelles Produkt
3,Sortie en nature et en lac
4,Lo utilizzo da un pò e mi trovo molto bene capiente e versatile nonchè resistente
5,super  pratique et énormément  de place suis au ange.
5,DAS IST DER BESSTE RUCKSACK DEN ICH JE HATTE NOCH DAZU ZU DEM PREIS!MANN KANN ICH TOLL BESTÜCKENICH HATTE DORT EINEDJI MAVIC WIE AUCH EINE OSMO UND EINE NIKON D7100 MIT 3 OBJEKTIVEN ( 24MM  18-105MM  200MM)DAZU HABE ICH NOCH FÜR DIE OSMO EIN KFZ SAUGNAPF DRIN GEHABT ICH BIN ECHT BEGEISTERT!DAS BESTE ER GEHT OHNE PROBLEME BEI DEN MEISTEN FLUG GELESCHAFTEN ALS HANDGEPÄCK DURCH .TOP
5,Parfait pour utilisation et rangement de drones fpv
5,A
5,fonctionnel à souhaitbon produit !!je le conseille
5,Versatilità e qualità a portata di mano spazio a non finire versatile e comodo per il trasporto in spalla.Eccellente
5,Habe einiges an Ausrüstung und viele andere Rucksäcke sind viel zu kleinDieser Rucksack ist ein RaumwunderTrägt sich sehr angenehm und ist super praktischJetzt steht ihm noch die Herausforderung in den Bergen an. Mal schauen wie sich der Rucksack im Gebirge schlägt.
5,J'ai longtemps hésité avant d'acheter un sac... Je suis heureux d'avoir opté pour celui ci ! Il est très confortable/pratique sécurisant et plein de rangements ! Pour le prix c'est un super achat ! Et j'ai deux boitiers à mettre dedans avec différentes optiques - matériel !
5,ottimo per lunghe uscite ben rifinito e solido. Mi ci trovo benissimo
5,Ce sac est super confortable les compartiments sont super bien pensés beaucoup moins chère que d'autre sac je recommande
5,The perfect camera bag for professional. I got it as a gift for my boyfriend's who's a professional photographer and he absolutely loved it and was impressed with all its features. Can highly recommend.
5,Un muy buen producto y mejor relación calidad/precio.Me parece una mochila muy buena grande y con multitud de bolsillos para aprovechar el espacio. Muy buenos materiales de construcción.Además viene con otro bolso extraible para poder llevar solo con la cámara.Muy aconsejable.
5,Ein absolut traumhafter Rucksack für ambitionierte Fotografen. Da passt wirklich alles rein. Bequem und stabil. #FotoBerti ist glücklich.
3,Es passt einiges rein und man hat auch viele Möglichkeiten sich die Tasche passend einzurichten. Der einzige Nachteil für mich war das bei mir einer der Träger riss als ich unterwegs war. Ich hatte aber Glück im Unglück den der Rucksack ist mit zwei Träger gurten verbunden und mir riss nur einer ab. Ob ich den nochmal kaufen würde weiß ich nicht den sonst war alles super mit dem Rucksack.
5,Ich suchte sehr lange nach einem Rucksack bis ich mal endlich was gefunden habe.Der Ruckasack lässt sich einfach an die Körpergrösse anpassen.Ich kann jetzt endlich meine Drohne meine 2 DSLM Kameras sowie ein Gimbal und ein Stativ überall mitnhemen durch den Gurt und das einfache Tragesystem kann man den Ganzen Film Equipment bequem über längere Strecken transportieren.
5,Magnifique ce sac le genre qui donne envie de partir en randonnée pour en profiter au maximum. Tout est très bien pensé des rangements dans tous les sens.J'aurais aimé que les élastiques du haut soient un peu plus étirables pour y mettre un sac de couchage mais ce n'est pas bien grave il peut s'accrocher un peu partout ailleurs.Très confortable avec des réglages un peu partout pour s'adapter à la majorité des morphologies.
5,bravo très beau sac à dos très bien consu complet et de belle qulitéavec sa pochette intégrée pour se déplacer uniquement avec l'appareil photoje recommande à ceux qui recherchent ce genre de produitattention il est très grand et profond à déconseiller pour les personnes petites et menues
5,Probably the coolest and most useful camera bags I've ever used. Really spectacular durable bag
5,Spazioso comodo possibilità di trasportare corpo macchina e obiettivi.
5,Molto pratico e comodo da indossare molto capiente per portare droni e accessori.. Consiglio
5,Produit conforme à la description. Emballage soigné et envoi rapide. Très bon article. Je recommande
5,Ottimi materiali capientissimo e molto versatili. Ci metto dentro di tutto e la piccola borsa è molto comoda per gli spostamenti leggeri sarebbe stata perfetta con qualche centimetro in più ma dipende solo dalla mia attrezzatura. Veramente ben fatto sono convinto che durerà tanto.Controllate bene le misure se si vuole passare inosservati questo non è lo zaino l'ideale.
4,È grande e grosso. Occhio alle dimensioni prima di acquistarlo. Va saputo gestire bene. Contiene tanta roba ma...attenzione a non “imbottire” troppo...che poi diventa un macigno. È molto robusto ed ergonomico. Comoda (non grande) la piccola borsa inclusa nella tasca inferiore.
5,Good
3,An sich ist der Rucksack wirklich Top!Hat Platz für meine konplette UW-Kamera & Drohne. Perfekt für den Tauchurlaub.Bequem zu tragen und die Fächeraufteilung sowie Platzmanagement sind klasse.Leider ist mir bereits nach einer Woche die Halterung zwischen Träger und Rucksack gerissen.Das sollte bei dem Preis nicht passieren.Glücklicherweise konnte mir ein "Fisherman" auf einer kleinen philippinischen Insel mit schwerem Gerät die Lasche wieder annähen ;-)Fazit:Top Rucksack der mit schwerem Inhalt an seine Grenzen kommt.
5,Super content de mon achat
5,Sac à dos avec énormément de rangement. D'aspect très solide.Article parfait pour des petites randonnées photos. Possibilité de mettre 2 fourre-tout le trépied ordinateur portable et bien d'autres choses. Un fourre-tout et une protection pluie livrés avec ce sac est un véritable plus.
5,Ich habe mir den Fotorucksack als Ersatzanschaffung für meinen alten Rucksack bestellt. Ware kam sehr pünktlich. Ich war auf die Verarbeitung gespannt. Da hat sich jemand Gedanken gemacht! Alles sehr gut verarbeitet viele kleine Extras die ich echt klasse finde. Inzwischen habe ich 3 Fototouren gemacht alles passt. Man kann alles auf seine Körpergröße einstellen sehr guter Tragekomfort. Ich kann ihn weiterempfehlen!
4,収納するレンズの長さによりちょっと工夫が必要かもしれません。私の元に来たこのリュックは縫い目やファスナー部分に問題は有りませんでした。時々ある匂いに関しても今回は大丈夫です。作り自体はしっかりしていて手持ちのレンズやフラッシュ、カメラ本体も入ります。私が使ってるのはOLYMPUSのOM-D E M1mark2１台とPanasonic LUMIXGX7mark2ですがOLYMPUSの12-40f2.8と40-150f2.8、Panasonicの100-400、42.5f1.2、フォーサーズマウントのレンズ２本（マウントアダプター付き）はとりあえず入ります。ただ、これだけ入れてしまうと小物やメモリ、レンズクリーナーを入れるスペースが微妙です。オマケで付いて来た？ウエストポーチの様なバッグに小物類を入れてしまえば本体のリュックの中はさっぱりするかもです。現時点では実際のフィールドで使用していないので使っているうちに評価は変わる可能性が高いです。フル装備で行きたい場合は良いのかも。若干頼り無さげなレインカバーもついてるので多少の雨は防げるかもですが長時間の雨に耐えられる様には見えません。
5,È quello che fa per me!sembra molto resistente è poco che lo uso ma è veramente fatto bene!!!
5,Ottimo articolo capiente impermeabile comodo e versatile
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               La calidad de esta mochila es increíble en ella puedo transportar absolutamente todo lo necesario de equipo de grabación y fotografía!
5,Gros sac parfait pour un photographe qui veut emporter le maximum !
4,Sind wohl die falschen Fragen
5,tres beau sac avec plein de rangement un peu partout...adaptable selon les hauteur ou on veut le portermes 2 D800 passe largement et je peux mettre encore mon flash???la sacoche en supplément est excellente aussi et pour un très bon prix
4,軽く小分けできて非常にいいのですが　最高に残念なのが、バックについている紐がすぐにとれてしまった。せっかくオレンジなのに耐久性悪すぎ。
5,Sac parfait pour un filmaker freelance On peut transporter trois caméras un enregistreur un moniteur trois lens un trépied et voir même soyons fou un gimbal et tout cela en même temps.Il me sauve la vie dans certains tournages...
4,J’ai aimé la grandeur pour faire des randos tout en alliant nature et phot
5,This is perfect gear for the drone and the cameras.
4,Perfekt geeignet für Fotografen!Ich empfehle jedoch gleich eine Imprägnierung vorzunehmen! Hält das Wasser deutlich besser ab! Ansonsten TipTop
4,Bon produitEfficaceBeaucoup de rangement
5,Gute Ausführung prompte Lieferung und Preis / Leistung okay
5,This backpack ist just awesome and every photographer needs it! It has the perfect size to pack everything you need but it is not too big. Perfect as hand luggage as well!
5,Des rangements des rangements partout des rangements ! Ce sac est un monstre de rangement et de modularité: vous pourrez aménager toutes les pochettes et tout l'intérieur en fonction de votre utilisation.Une fois pris en main vous en ferez ce que vous voulez avec une grosse capacité d'embarquement et des petits détails bien pratique. Je recommande !
5,耐久性があると思います。小さいバックもついてるので多用性あります。
5,Rien à dire au top
4,Lots of room. lots of padding.
5,Zaino molto robusto all'interno molto capiente e gli scomparti possono essere posizionati in base alle necessità.
5,Buon articolo
5,TOP
5,me gusta el espacio que tiene y la distribución
5,Muy bien acabada. Muy versátil y sobretodo una gran protección para la cámara! Tiene más capacidad de lo que parece a primera vista. Por poner una pega algún sistema que no dejará tan expuesta a robos sería perfecto.
4,La mochila en general tiene buena distribución. Los cierres tienen buena calidad y facilidad de uso. La única pega es que el peso del conjunto cargado con objetivos y cámara es elevado. Ya por si sola la mochila tiene un peso considerable. Moverse con ella cargada se hace pesado y tedioso.
2,Ich habe mir den Rucksack gekauft um nicht immer mit der Nikon Kameratasche in die nicht mal mehr 1 Flasche Wasser passt rum laufen zu müssen. Nach längerer Suche bin ich dann auf den Tarion Rucksack gestoßen. Perfektes Teil.Genügend Trennfächer da. 3 Monate lang war ich damit voll zufrieden bis dann auf einer Reise der Schultergurt eingerissen ist.Der Schriftverkehr mit dem Verkäufer war langwierig und nervig. Nach 1 Monat haben sie dann gesagt " im Garantiefall bitte an Amazon Logistics melden" für diese Info hätten wir keinen so langen Schriftverkehr gebraucht ....Deswegen gibt es auch nur 2 Sterne da das Material an der wichtigsten Stelle versagt hat ..
5,Très pratique utile et robuste.Permet de mettre tout le matériel possible et inimaginable !Il prend cependant pas mal de place donc ne convient que pour les personnes avec beaucoup de matériel et qui ne veulent pas faire de concessions ;)
3,TARION Pro PB-01（一番大きいタイプ）ネイチャ写真の写真家からの評価です。耐水性小雨でもレインカバーがないとバッグ内に浸み込む。評価に値しない。使いやすさ（収納力）小物入れは役に立たないしアプローチも最悪。カメラ、レンズの収納私の場合、レンズの収納が前提になかったので問題ないですがカメラ、広角、標準、中望遠、マクロまで収納したければミラーレス機用のバックです。カメラに標準レンズを付けたままでの出し入れは悪くありません。上段にCannon １DXMarkⅡプラスCannon大口径16-35mm　F2.8　Cannon24-105mm　タムロン90マクロ下段はヘッドライト、レリーズ、ルーペ、角形NDと専用ホルダー、ブロアー、Cannon５D MarkⅣPCの収納スペースにはタオルを詰め込んであります。背負い心地は個人的にGood
5,Sehr guter Kamerarucksack indem wirklich sehr viel Platz ist. Habe beide Kameras 3 Objektive und sämtliches Zubehör untergebracht. Die einfache Unterteilungsmöglichkeit macht es super möglich. Ebenfalls sehr guter Tragekomfort.Dieser Rucksack ist wirklich eine Empfehlung wert.
4,機材収納の都合の良さと、ドイツのメーカーということと、価格も手ごろだったので購入。カメラ、レンズ等色々詰め込むと10キロ以上の重さになるのだが、手で持ち上げると重いリュックが、背負ってみるとめちゃくちゃ軽く感じる。人間工学によるものか。足腰に故障を抱えているので、この点は特に驚きだった。付属のミニバッグはごついが使える。不満を言えばPCが背面付近にあり、収奪しづらい。
5,Sehr zufrieden und sehr komfortabel
5,Really big! It's perfect for me because it fits my Camera 4 Lenses my Gimbal my Tripod my Drone and i could keep that list going! Just amazing how much space it offers for a very very good Price - would buy it definitly again!
5,very good
2,The first trip with it and the strap breaks! The stitching completely comes away!The bag itself is good loads of room and plenty of places/pockets for storing cameras and equipment.The overall quality of the product was great. But... The design of the back velcro straps which hold the bag straps to the main section of the bag isn't strong enough to hold an above average load. I'd be wary of checking these back straps from time to time to make sure they're not coming apart as mine did...
5,Ottimi materiali robusto tante tasche e soprattutto il Marsupio estraibile che lo fa diventare un due in uno !Centra proprio tutto e di più. Comodissimo da indossare tutto il peso si ripartisce perfettamente sulla schiena ed il supporto lombare è ottimo
5,Bello solido comodissimo
5,Nice large bag takes 2dslr 6 lenses and flashgun and filters pleased with make of the bag  and looks great
5,Perfetto comodo e davvero capiente
5,Mein Sohn ist begeistert von dem Rucksack. Er bekommt die ganze Fotoausrüstung rein und unten in das Fach passt acuh noch seine Drohne perfekt hinein. Sehr zu empfehlen auch vom Material her sehr schön gemacht und bequem zu tragen auf dem Rücken.
5,Very large bag with lots of storage. Well made. Easy to carry
5,富士山撮影５日間旅行にバックを新調しました。近隣大型カメラ店で他のバックも検討しましたが、価格とデザインが折り合わずWEBで探した所に本品と出会い購入しました。　デザインも良く価格も手ごろで、商品を手にして良い買い物をしたと思います。α７R3・70-200ｍｍGM・16-35ｍｍGM・NOKTON50ｍｍF1.2と古いSonyのAPSミラーレス1台　他はレンズフィルターや予備電池、クリーナー類を入れて全重量９Kgで車に搭載して、旅先の駐車場から撮影場所まで三脚もバックに取り付けて担いで移動しました。担ぐと大きさを感じたので後日、2輪や電車やバスに利用する小型のPBLも追加で購入しました。両方とも今後活躍してくれそうです。
2,Der Rucksack macht auf den ersten Blick einen guten Eindruck alles scheint gut verarbeitet zu sein. Auch die Inneneinteilung ist vielversprechend.Leider aber ist für meine Zwecke der Artikel unbrauchbar da er mit einem Eigengewicht von etwa 3 kg erheblich zu schwer ist.
5,Robusto e spazioso per muoversi con facilità in tute le situazioni!
5,Super sac! On est parti en vacance avec et il est super pratique pour l’avion. On peut avoir quelques habites et nos affaires informatique bien rangée avec nous!
5,Sooo much space lots of pouches/pockets and at a very good price ..quality backpack as good as some of the known main line brands.Lots and lots of straps.
5,Questo zaino è fantastico è abbastanza leggero pur essendo di dimensioni non certo piccole gli scomparti sono fatti e studiati bene
5,買って良かった
5,sac pro très confortable est solide ... grand volume harnais très confortable adapter a toute les tailles de personnes.fournisseur très sérieux  répond a toute question sur le produit !!envoie très rapide.
4,動画撮影と同時に釣道具まで入れてオールインワンです。
5,Geräumiger und vielseitig nutzbarer Rücksack. Verstellbare Innentrennungen zahlreiche separate Fächer. Angemessener Preis.Für meine Verwendung einfach perfekt...!
5,想像していたより中々良かったです♪耐水性は実際に試せていないので無評価。同メーカーのRB-01より買い替えたのですが、15cmの長さのレンズを立てて収納出来ます。私はサムヤンの35mmf1.4+mc-11 の状態で収納してるのですが寝かさないで入るのはありがたい。下の気室は横にすればFE100-400ぐらいまでなら入りそうです。小物入れはちょっと少ないですが、ウエストバッグをそれに使えば解決します。ジップの開け閉めもしっかり考慮されているのと防水用に気配りされた設計になっていました。いや…本当に中々良い…w
4,登山では、下り坂で滑って仰向けに転倒することが多く、この場合、ザックが受ける衝撃はザックの下方で強くなります。したがって、カメラやドローンなどの精密機械はできるだけザックの上方に収納するのがベストです。本商品は写真のように、比較的ザックの上方にmavic 2が収納できます。ザック下方の収納スペースは軽い登山用具、最上方のスペースは重量のある食料などに利用しています。付属のカメラバックはウエストバックとして使っています。
3,Far too big for what I wanted or need. Unfortunately it is going back as this would not do the job I wanted it for
5,Bisher erfüllt er alle Erwartungen und ist auch bis oben hin voll gestopft noch angenehm zu tragen
5,Parfait pour ma fs5 on peut tout y rentrer  les objos les batteries et surtout la fs5. Il y a de la place pour tout.
5,die qualität des Rucksacks ist sehr gut und er wurde sehr schnell geliefert danke
5,Esta mochila es perfecta para viajes largos. Tengo intención de usarla para ir al camino de Santiago ya que tiene la parte de la espalda reforzada. A pesar de su robustez es muy liviana!!! Tiene muchos bolsillos y compartimentos para tener todo bien ordenado. También se puede cambiar la altura de los tirantes. Sin duda una muy buena compra.
5,Top Rucksack. Gesamtgewicht voll beladen ist natürlich nicht unerheblich... Durch das Gurtsystem aber gut zu handeln
5,大き過ぎるのではないかと危惧をしておりましたが、軽いしたくさんレンズを詰め込んで背負ってもあまり重さを感じません。とても優秀なカメラバッグです。仕分けもかなりフレキシブルに変更可能なので、色々な要求に応えられるポテンシャルを秘めています。
5,Zaino perfetto con moltissimo spazio per qualsiasi obiettivo e macchina fotografica. Spazio per inserire schede di memoria batterie e seconda camera. Ci sono un moltissime tasche per inserire qualsiasi cosa necessaria. La cosa eccezionale è il marsupio per mettere dentro le cose necessarie ci stanno sicuramente due obiettivi più qualche batterie.
5,Je cherchais cette taille depuis un certain temps sans la trouver et la c'est parfait beaucoup de place pour le gros matériel et les petits accessoires facilité d'ouverture rangements multiples. Excellente qualité de fabrication attention tout de même au poids (un peu plus de 3 kg à vide...)
4,great bag for the price
5,Articolo corrispondente alla descrizione ottima qualità
3,フィルター径77mmのメインレンズ4本を携帯していくときは、下層両側にEF100-400mm、EF70-200mmを縦方向に(少し無理やり)、中間にEF16-35mm、EF24-70mm。上層に野鳥の会の長靴、フィルターケース、掃除道具、レリーズ、予備電池、ヘッドライト、EOS5DⅣ。これ以上道具が増える際は、サブバッグ利用(若干入れ替え)。雨天使用歴無し。
5,Diesen Fotorucksack kann ich allen interessierten weiterempfehlen. Er ist stabil gebaut und es passt einiges rein. Nach Ankunft des Paketes beim auspacken zu merken : Volltreffer schöner kann es nicht laufen. Herzlichen Dank
5,Tres bon sac conviens a ranger mon matos photo et vetments  exactement ca que j cherchait
5,Un ottimo prodotto capiente è veramente ben fatto molteplici modi per disporre una reflex con tanto di obbiettivi ed eventuale drone dji Mavic 2 pro.Consigliatissimo questo zaino!!!!!
5,Top top tolle Verarbeitung echt Geld wert super kann ich nur empfehlen. 👍👍👌
3,sac reçu hier mais malheureusement contrairement à ce que j'avais pu trouver comme informations sur internet un PC portable 17 pouces ne rentre pas dedans
5,カラーも機能も価格もベスト
1,Nach genau 1 mal tragen löst sich der Rucksack in seine Bestandteile auf. Gefüllt war er mit 2 Kameras und 2 Objektiven. Also nicht wirklich schwer.Nun öffnen sich die Nähte an diversen Stellen .
5,Prodotto completissimo in tutto. Non riesco a trovare un solo difetto.  Tasche ovunque materiali ottimi  scomparti ampi e vano per PC addirittura da 17 pollici con doppia apertura.  Sono stracontento.
5,A premiere vue sac tres ergonomique de grde capacite a voire ds le tps pour la solidité....
5,Ottimo come capienza comodità e robustezza ci metto 2 fotocamere e 5 obiettivi + tutti gli altri accessori e ci sarebbe ancora spazio

5,Reçu dans les temps très bonne qualité efficacité robustesse je recommande le produit
5,Muy bien fabricada muy contento. Es una mochila de calidad.
5,Good product
5,最近持ち歩く機材が増えたので購入しました。一眼レフ2台にレンズ数本とバッテリーやフィルターなどを入れても十分に対応でき満足しています。造りもしっかりしていてクッションも効いて安心して機材を運べますね。オマケで付いていた小型バックも良く出来ていて重宝しています。強いて言えばちょっと重いかと思いますが、安心との引き換えと納納得してはいます。
4,Très bonne capacité de rangement
5,Uno zaino spettacolare molto bello e comodo per chi ama stare nella natura e fare fotografie senza preoccuparsi di aver dimenticato qualcosa
5,Perfect voor 2 camera's!
2,一眼レフと交換レンズと小物を入れて十分使えるかと思い購入しましたが、小物を入れる部分が小さく、思ったほど収納ができませんでしたので返品しました。
3,Très bonne qualité mais je ne le voyais pas aussi imposant surtout pour une femme.
5,Overall a fantastic and super practical camera bag though a little pricey
5,Top
5,Zaino ben fatto robusto con molti vani e ben accessoriato. Un ottimo acquisto.
5,Je l'utilise pour du transport de matériel audio

5,Me encanta y buenos acabados vamos a ver si en el tiempo es resistente.
5,GénialPlein de rangement  excellente modularité apparemment très résistant ( on confirmera dans quelques mois )
1,Ich habe den Rucksack jetzt seit einem Monat und fast nur an den Wochenenden in Benutzung und er ist schon kaputt!Eine Naht hat sich auf ca. 5cm geöffnet. Und das auch noch bei diesem Preis!!
5,Buen material muchos compartimientos y bolsillos contento. Con el producto lo recomiendo

5,me cabe hasta el perro
5,veramente ben fatto
5,Ottimo prodotto molto comodo
5,Alles in Ordnung
5,Parfaitement conforme aux vidéos de démonstration
5,Preso in promozione con black Friday sono molto contento ottimo zaino fotografico l'ho già soprannominato il carrarmato
1,He devuelto esta maleta porque ni en dos días de uso y cargada con un equipo normal una de las tiras ajustables del asa se ha descosido. Resumiendo está mal diseñada ya que el peso de la maleta y su carga recae en dos tiras finas de poliester trenzado que se unen a las asas por una simple costura... es cuestión de tiempo que esta maleta de más de 100€ se te rompa. Una desilusión muy grande ya que para el resto de aspectos esta maleta es PERFECTA.
5,Good quality
1,写真と違う色のリュックが届いた！性能以前の問題！
5,lo consiglio
5,Grand sac de qualité idéal pour mettre sont matériel photo et drone.
5,Super Fotorucksack
5,Ottimo prodotto
5,Super résistant léger
5,Il est super amovible extrêmement bien pensé j en suis agréablement surpris. J adore !!!
5,Acabado muy bueno.Falta probar en trabajo.
1,購入後初利用しましたが、チャックを引っ張るツマミがちぎれてしまった。しかも一番利用する箇所です。　パッと見は、黄色いツマミ部分の中に紐が通っているように見えますが、圧着してあるだけ。　これじゃ遅かれ早かれ取れますよね。　であれば、２つくらい予備のツマミロープを入れておいて欲しいです。コスパが良いはずのカメラリュックですが、こういう細かいところはやっぱり・・・ですね。
5,Es grande y multifunctional，muy recomendable para gente que salen con más de dos cámaras.
1,No me ha gustado la calidad pero además solicité la devolución hace una semana y aun no han pasado a recoger el producto.
5,ottimi materiali versatile lo organizzi come vuoi
1,Al segundo uso la costura principal que une las asas a la mochila cedió y quedó inutilizada.Este es el tipo de comentarios que deberías tener en cuenta para no comprar este producto.Mochila mal fabricada. Demasiado mal acabado para lo que vale.No se ni por qué le doy una estrella ya ni me la puedo colgar de las asas.
2,Estoy encantado.Llevo dos cuerpos de cámarados teles y otros objetivos.Mucho espacio.Muy buena mochila.
5,Au top! Je conseille fortement
5,Bonne sac
5,tres contente
1,Le produit est de très mauvaise qualité je suis très déçu de mon achat.Il s’est décousu tout seul au niveau des bretelles de soutien qui se sont désolidarisé du dos.Je souhaiterais un remboursement cela n’est pas un sac professionnel.
4,Sac léger mais un peu petit si vous désirez transporter beaucoup mais pour des expéditions d'une journée ou quelques heures c'est bien
5,Very comfortable even when loaded. Lots of storage space.
5,Absolutely love this bag. Being able to grab my camera with little notice via the side entry is awesome. Decently padded and water resistant and it comes with a cover that fits the entire bag so if it starts really raining you can enclose it to be super safe.
5,Handig in gebruik multifunctioneel
5,I went on my first plane ride in over two years. I brought my camera flash extra batteries cards four prime lenses two zoom lenses my laptop and charger. What I really likes most is that everything was secure and well protected and also immediately available.  I wish I had bought this years ago.
5,Super ryggsäck mycket ket bra får rum med mycket u den. Bra midjebälte.
5,La calidad es excelente el diseño genial. Puedo llevar una cámara 3 lentes varias pilas y tarjetas una grabadora de sonido un dron con baterías su control y un ronin y aún queda espacio. Totalmente recomendada.
5,Wat een opbergruimte heb je  alleen de riemen voor de losse lenstas had iets meer gekund. Vooral als je in een rolstoel zit
5,Es un mochilón! Por el precio y la calidad que recibes es impresionante yo la uso para mi equipo de field recording y es una maravilla.Muy espaciosa y llena de bolsas.Mi único pero su peso es pesada pero con buen ejercicio y acondicionamiento sale adelante.
5,Videomaker
5,muy útil
5,Excelente calidad y confort. Buen tamaño
4,Lo único malo es que me quedó un tanto justa por el tamaño por la cantidad de equipo que a veces tengo que mover fuera de eso se siente resistente y bastante cómoda entre los espacios y la cantidad de bolsas.
5,Får plats med det mesta av min kamerautrustning. Väldigt många möjligheter.Supersnabb leverans från Amazon.Rekommenderar denna starkt.Mycket nöjd.
5,ME ENCANTÓ CABE TODO MIS ACCESORIOS EN UN SOLO MALETA
5,J'arrive à tout entrer dans le sac sans problème. 1. Une boîte de nettoyage complète 2. chargeur et fils d'alimentation  3. Adabteur pour monter F. 4 Lentille Nikor 24-105mm + 24-50mm/4-6.3 + DX 50-250 /4.5 - 6.3 + Si je veux mettre mon zoom 300-600 c'est possible  en retirant 2 lentilles.
2,No like. Not very sturdy. Wants to fall over and I can’t have that. Handle on top is not Center so when you pick it up by the handle bag goes off Center. Much better backpacks out there for the money
5,Heb in de 40 jaar dat ik met camera’s en objectieven loop al veel foto rugzakken/tassen gehadook dure merken zoals Loweprodeze tas verbaasd mij ivm de ruimtegigantisch draagcomfortuiterlijk van de tasgoed materiaal waarvan deze tas  is gemaakt geweldige tasen vooral voor een vriendelijke prijs
5,El producto no se ve al 100% como las fotos eso es obvio y pasa siempre sin embargo el acomodo la calidad de los materiales la construcción resistencia y detalles de la mochila son muy buenos y excelentes. Compre la básica para ver la calidad del equipo pero después de verla en acción y testearla sin duda alguna me compraré el siguiente modelo de esta mochila para mis viajes de mochilero. No lo dudes es un excelente producto y tiene una buena relación calidad/precio 10/10
3,Should have bought larger bag.
5,Po wypięciu wszystkich przegród mamy jedną dużą przestrzeń czego nie widać na zdjęciach i filmach. DLa mnie to duży plus ze względu na gimball.
5,Es funcional y se adapta a mis necesidades.
5,Sin duda una mochila muy recomendable y cómoda !! La uso para campo !!cabe todo !!
2,Grandecomodaboniotabuen diseño pero NO RESISTE SE ESTA ROMPIENDO DESCOCIENDO CON UNA SEMANA DE USO  - NO ME SIRVENO SOPORTA EL EQUIPO
5,Las dimensiones son buenas y buenos compartimentos
5,I am no professional camera guy but this has been great to take my limited gear on road trips and day trips. Good padding and so far no issues.
5,Cabe todoIncluyendo un 150 600
5,Es una excelente compra está muy bien confeccionada. Es algo pequeña si tienes cámara full frame y objetivos grandes pero aún así cabe todo.
5,Muy buen material excelente distribución todo lo que ven en las fotos así es. Eso si algo grande pero excelente de verdad
5,Fits all my gulesr and not to heavy
3,La mochila pequeña que viene de accesorio se rompió la correa a la primera usada ...Su peso es mucho. Tiene muchos compartimientos y es muy amplia
5,Llevo unos meses con ella y es lo mejor que he adquirido durante mis ultimas compras aunque el tamaño no es tan grande la verdad cabe todo lo que necesitas para unas buenas fotos si necesitas mas espacio hay un modelo mas grande pero en relación calidad precio podría decir que esta es la mejor mochila que he probado sin duda la recomiendo es excelente!!!
5,This is the perfect camera bag the price wasn't too bad and it is very durable
5,Está chidonga!!!
4,Super quality but deep is little bit more. Extra deep is not good for lenses..
3,Muy muy grande (no me agrada tanto el tamaño pero ya me voy acostumbrando)Le cupo una camara con lente baterias de camara baterias cargador y luz led Drone control de dron baterias y cargador de drone Gimbal RSC2 completo flash speedlite estuche de microfonos inalambricosy laptop pero toda llena las costuras no se ven que aguanten y el peso es una exageracion que desafortunadamente tuve que devolverla por estos motivos
5,I looked for a backpack that can take all my stuff for a long while. This holds all my camera gear several lenses laptop a bunch of accessories gimbal (on the outside) tripod gear - and the extra bag is now my drone bag also connected to the backpack. Amazing!
5,le coloco dos cuerpos y los accesorios  y va super  excelente calidad en el material
5,Apenas pagué un poco más de MXN$2000 por una mochila que sin duda vale mucho más. Una calidad increíble en los detalles materiales de primera la mejor mochila que he tenido. Cabe perfecto mi cámara mirrorless y mis dos lentes de batalla (el enorme 105mm de Sigma y un Sony 28mm) además de mi dron con todos sus accesorios en el compartimiento superior. Mi computadora de 13" también cabe perfecto. Me encantó.
5,rzadko to stwierdzam ale plecak jest na prawdę przemyślany a po wykonaniu wygląda na trwały.Liczba zapięć i możliwości regulacji spora.Wersja z torbą z przodu i sposobem zaczepu do plecaka odciążenia pleców rewelacyjna. Prawdopodobnie projekt lub pomysł dał inny fotograf wyprawowy.Plecak można zaaranżować w kilku wariantach: 1. tylko rzeczy  2. rzeczy i sprzęt foto 3. tylko foto.Tam się mieści jeszcze spory laptop.Mój dotychczasowy plecak nadal jest b.dobry lecz przy dłuższych wyprawach kiedy nie wiesz ile będzisz chodzić np. po górach w tym jestem w stanie zabrać więcej sprzętu mieć lepszą równowagę i mniej się zmęczyć a więc ważne kwestie (zalety). Resztę pokaże czas. Polecam.
5,We have not taken it out outdoor yet. It's very comfortable and has great storage capacity with lots of compartments. It's very comfortable to wear on your back.
