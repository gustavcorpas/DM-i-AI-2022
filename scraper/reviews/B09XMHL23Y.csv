4,This has a pretty decent sound and the pre-programmed EQ helps a lot with finding a sound that works for you.  This is a very solid speaker and in most cases is enough for me around the house or sitting out back.  I have not had a chance to test it around water yet but it's good to know that it has a IPX6 Waterproof rating just incase.  I bought two of these speakers and the pairing functionality was very simple and allowed me to play them in stereo.My only knock is that it's a little loud when you first turn them on.  You will hear beeps first (piano key sound) followed by "BLUETOOTH CONNECTED" which I wish I could turn down or even mute if possible.I'd like to listen to it at night or in the office without alerting others that I just turned it on.Overall 4.5 out of 5 for me!
5,I looked at a lot of these speakers before choosing the Zealot and am very happy with my purchase. I wanted a loud high quality Bluetooth speaker to use while grilling out on my carport. I plan on getting another one because it has a special feature that allows you to sync two so each speaker streams left or right for true stereo that will mimic the live performance quality sound of a live concert! I’m really looking forward to having that experience. The 3 level equalizer is a great feature. No flashing lights just great audio quality. These speakers are loud!
5,I have been looking for the right speaker for months. My first few units were smaller and lighter but lacked either sound quality or battery  life or both. Well I have been really please with this speaker.  It has great volume battery life is excellent ( today listened to it for 3 hours at half volume and only down 1 bar out of 5.  Half volume is really pretty loud as filled my backyard with music while swimming.  It's bigger (mid sized) and heavier then the smaller units but it's definitely a quality unit and if you want to hear it from more then a few feet away buy this one.  I use my speaker in my backyard and one the back of my electric bike for my wife who rides her bike behind me 5 star.  BTW I got the one with the strap not the handle which is perfect for my needs
4,No need to crank up my volume. Level one is enough to fill my living room with music and not interfere with conversations. Crank it up to 2 or3 volume and it will rock!! Sound is not as refined as my Anker because Anker has an app where you tweak the equalizer to your preference. This one doesn't except for the 3 modes. Only one works to my liking- more punchy bass. Definitely will get one more in the future to link it stereo for more amplification. I do hope Zealot can have an app on Android to tweak the sound
4,It's the loudest bluetooth speaker I have ever owned. Additionally it sounds good and makes my other speakers sound like trash. However I realize that 50 hour battery life advertising is false. I can barely get 7-9 hours in mid or high volume. When I see 50 hours battery life I expect to get 50 hours on all volume. My Anker Soundcore last exactly 24 hours even at high volume. So why isn't Zealot doing the same? The battery life indicator is also bugging me because when fully charged it only lights up 4 out of 5 led lights (whats the point of having extra one then?). Nonetheless it is stylish and looks better than JBL.
5,Cuality  The build is very good for the price fairly above average I could even say premium the handle on the handle version feels nice the buttons are nice and clicky also very responsive and the mesh on the whole speaker is very niceSound cuality  Over all it is very very loud at max volume also the highs are always nice and clear mids are well rounded and the kick man this is what you call a punchy/kicky speaker is maybe just lacks a tiny bit on the bass and rumbleBattery  On an average daily use of 1:30hr I could say it lasts a week a bit less a bit more sometimes but it is greatDetails  The only detail I have is I would really prefer that the leds were white instead of the kinda annoying blue but no biggie
5,At first i had my doubts but after trying it for a few weeks i absolutely love this speaker its loud and great sound quality the battery life is great. I take it with me to the beach and on bike rides definitely recommend it.
5,I bought it for my fiancee' for his birthday. He wanted a  JBL charge 5. I did some comparing of all kinds of wireless speakers and the Zealot  was  the best out there..IT IS VERY LOUD and my fiancee loves it better than the JBL he had.Great speaker  with distance and long lasting  charge time .top of the line so far.
5,This speaker is great...been using it for a couple months now and the quality sound bass portability etc are all outstanding...especially on the beach where I use it most! A++ highly recommend
4,Would have given a better review but the battery life on this is NOT at all what it states. I followed directions as soon as opened and did not use it until I did a full charge got about an afternoons worth of it and then it would say low battery and you cannot continue playing on it even if it's plugged in charging thats my only con. Love the sound and how loud it is. Great speaker other than that.
4,Even on the second lowest mode it is good volume loud enough for your neighbors with thin walls to hear possibly. It is one of the loudest long-lasting Bluetooth speakers I've ever bought. I've had it for a few months now and have dropped it a couple times from low heights and now I have noticed that the top sound of the speaker either blew out or got damaged because at low volume when I first got it its not as clear/bass not has heavy on the top part of the speaker.  Hard to contact customer service since their brand is located in China. Nonetheless still a good speaker...just protect itI've ridden it out during light rain and it hasn't affected the performance of the speaker in any way love it.I usually have this strapped around my chest when I'm riding my bike and it definitely gets people's attention so they know I'm in their blindspot.For the price probably my favorite budget-friendly speaker with good subwoofers and clear sound.I have not really used the EQ modes because regular is perfect. Definitely worth the price.
5,So far I like this speaker. It has a nice loud and clear sound long-lasting battery and the buttons are easy to understand.  The carrying strap and the flat pedestal make it easy to place wherever I need i
5,Surprising that this speaker is as loud as it is. It’s a great design that looks good displayed on a shelf and with a nice leather strap to grab and go. Using this with an outdoor projector and Bluetooth 5 there’s no lag which is great and when there is (think it’s the projector’s fault I just use the 1/8” input to go direct. Highly recommend this product as a great travel speaker or accompaniment to a portable outdoor theater setup.
4,I work in a mechanic shop that gets pretty loud. So for what I use it for I don't really care about the quality I just need it to be LOUD to overcome the shop noise if you put it on the 3rd (green/least bass) sound setting it gets really really loud!!! Works for me.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Volume is crazily loud when the two are paired together  Scared to turned up to half in fear of scaring neighbors (far). Also the sound is crystal clear doesn't sound blown off or anything even at extreme high volumes. Low  midhigh range sounds are all very clear ! Honestly I think the seller should charge more on this unit lol. The other brands are just not so good compared to this (both less and more expensive brands). I high recommend this product it is my solution to my long and tedious quest to find a pair of inexpensive but also decent quality. I would say this has exceeded my expectations. Thank you ! ( I have not given review on my first unit yet but will get to it)
4,I like it but I wish the battery life was better
5,Sounds great. I think I finally found a that will do what I want it to and still affordable. I’m happy with it.
5,The sound is amazing. I love this speaker.
5,This speaker shines on the outdoors With careful volume adjustments indoors it too can be a welcome addition. It is a great value for the money.
5,Pretty good sound. Very good bass but also well balanced across other frequencies but it also has 2 other eq options. Also sounds pretty loud. Loving it so far!
4,The speaker is very well built and the sound is good but it has more midrange than anything else. also I don't like the Bluetooth announcement when you turn on the speaker it's kind of annoying.
5,INTRO:I work in a loud environment with dozens of people who use all sorts of Bluetooth speakers. My old one (Anker Soundcore 2.0) started losing some of it's bass so I started looking at the JBL models because I see and hear them everywhere but I didn't like the volume/watt output and they're strictly bluetooth with no aux connection. I added a bunch of speakers to the cart compared features decides to give this a chance and holy heck'n balls I'm 200% satisfied. Will update if anything changes.OUTPUT: Very loud. Very awesome. Probably not 75watts but at least very Very close if not. At lower volumes the bass overpowers the mids/highs a little but not at disappointing levels. I tested this out for about 6 hours max volume and the speakers aren't having any issues whatsoever. The balance & clarity are 4.5/5 starsINPUT: multiple options including USB and AUX. It's fantastic though because you press the "mode" button on top to switch inputs and it plays back a confirmation voice identifying the channel. This also means if you're hooked up via aux that no one's interrupting your music by accidentally (or purposely) interrupting your jams. SOLID FEATURE FOR THE WORK PLACE very well thought out good job Input 5+/5 starsCONVENIENCE/DURABILITY:Feels pretty solid pretty sturdy. Standing up to 6 hours of sawdust and airborne lathe/plaster debris I'd imagine it can take some water but I will never purposely test my speakers like that. There's no way the battery is 50 or 40 hours but after 6 hours only 1 of 5 or 6 battery life indicators went down which means at full volume it'll definitely last 2 straight working days. 5/5 starsCompletely satisfied Zealot definitely has my attention on speakers now. Owning a personal recording studio playing live for several years in front of hundreds and installing 16 vehicle audio systems I've had a lot of opportunity to play around with and test different PAs and subs you name it. I really enjoy speakers with titanium drivers; not sure if this has them or not (probably not) but I would nsver trade it for a 200-300$ JBL bluetooth there's no way
5,So happy with this purchase! Great sound quality long battery life easy pairing and looks exactly like the more expensive JBL. Very very happy!
4,*update* Everything I said before is true it is very loud and perfect for attracting attention....though when playing near full volume I only get about 4 to 4 ¹/2 hours play time. Which is no where near enough for what I need it for (I'm a pedicab driver). Not sure if the battery in mine is no good or what? But that's a fraction of the "40 hours" playtime. It is very loud and I like it for what I use it for. Just the playtime is disappointing. Having to use power banks to keep it charged for about a 7 hour shift.Also the leather handle fell off within the first few days. I don't even use the handle so not sure why it fell off so easily. Changed star rating from 5 to 4.*original*So far it BUMPS. It's really loud as others say. I bought it to have on my pedicab so my customers can jam out and I can attract customers so I need it loud and to attract attention. This one is perfect.Knowing that it automatically comes with a year warranty is comforting.
5,It's awesome quality. Sounds great
4,I was expecting more base out of it. For the price it’s good. But it tends to roll over and fall off of things because the bottom isn’t wide enough.
5,This speaker is loud and un like JBL’s the max volume is much higher  the battery at max volume last about 2 hours which inside is probably to loud for most at half volume my security system trips for glass break so this speaker get VERY loud. However that being said at regular volume last for 3 or 4 days or even up to a week. I work in construction and have this speaker outside in the elements it has been soaked by rain many times and works perfectly still. The shoulder strap makes it easy to carry up and down a letter. I definitely recommend this speaker!!!
5,I was looking for a speaker to replace my beats pill xl and seen the reviews for this on YouTube and Amazon and took the leap. This thing has power! It’s not to big like my pill was and it’s stylish. The bass is awesome and the carrying handles and options to use other straps is great! And all for under 100$ . You need it for your family parties! Trust me!
5,This is just as good as JBL if not better and the price was a steal. Great sound Great bass I normally have my volume full blast and I have this halfway it's loud with perfect sound Very happy
5,Better then Expected
5,Perfect for Me
5,Sounds good and gets loud.
5,I like how good the speakers sound and it has a very long battery life and I also like it’s water  resistance! I would definitely recommend it.
5,This thing is solid in weight which is good quality. I barely even turn it up and its loud. Great buy !!!!!
5,The speaker is great it has good sound and bass its price is worth for its quality
5,This product is loud. Long lasting just amazing. Took it to the beach in Jamaica and had a blast. to believe I didn't have to buy the most expensive brand and still get some quality maybe even better than the mainstream brands.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Me agrado el sonido muy bueno
5,TWS Pairing works but it can be tricky to set up on the first try. I almost returned them before contacting support. But after their advice I tried it according to their instructions and it finally worked!! So my advice to you is to contact them first before returning the product for any issues. They responded after a few hours the same day. After the initial TWS setup your BT device will more easily recognize the speakers even if you forget device and reconnect them again or connect one speaker and then connect the second one. Also if you're a bass fan I would highly recommend these as a pair set in TWS mode. The speaker bass excursion does have some serious flex and it also comes with 75 watts of power and a built in equalizer for higher pitch frequencies as well. Also for the price I bought this for $78.19 each with free shipping on 12-17-2021. That's a real bargain for what you're getting. So they are the highest wattage that I'm aware of at 75 watts for a tube-type designed portable BT speaker And the pricing was at almost the same amount of wattage! But even if the price goes back up to around $103 I believe it's still a great deal. But if you can get it below $80 you really scored. Congrats!!!! Get them maybe on Black Friday or Cyber Monday etc... Also sometimes the manufacturer has a higher price point on the listing but when you open the link to view the product there's a discount incentive cut out coupon that drops the price point from the original listed price. I would recommend getting these speakers if you like portability and lots of bass and power and a built in equalizer with TF card USB-C for BT speaker charging and USB for BT device charging and Auxillary port. It's made in China but it works well once properly set up and paired in TWS mode. And their customer support solved my problem in a timely manner by getting back with me within the same day.Specification from the manual:Input Voltage: DC 5v  Driver: 4 OhmsTransmission range: 10m  Frequency Response: 80Hz-20KHzSNR: _>95dB  Distortion: < 1%Working Voltage: 7.4V  Weight: 1700g  (about 4.4 pounds when weighed on body weight scale)Dimension: 297*133*130mm
5,This speaker is exactly what I’m looking for!  It has a long battery life portable and LOUD!  I like the small handle.  Easy to connect to Bluetooth as well.  Worth the price!
5,Excellent full range sound and stereo when paired with 2!Outstanding battery and Bluetooth!
5,Product has an amazing sound! Love this speaker
5,Like this
5,One of the best Bluetooth speaker you can buy for  less than ninety bucks like the other branded names (WOW! only $67). I was so hesitant when i chose this item but i was wrong. It's nice looking rugged and most importantly sounds GREAT!!!.  I put the volume to the MAX and it BLOWS roof of the warehouse where i place this speaker. Really really LOUD !I LIKE it very much!
5,This is a good product. Very good sound
5,This speaker is amazing!! Beautiful sound and connected effortlessly to my iPhone! I’m in love!
5,Great sound better than my JBL that I forgot and someone took and a third of the price. I added a climbing hook to it hang it off my golf cart
4,Looks great and volume is awesome
5,Product stop charging
4,Loved the loudness
5,The better off better in Pricing is good sounds is great 👍👍👍
3,What a powerful little speaker!  Love the power and battery life.But after two weeks I returned it.  Here is the one reason why:Bluetooth connection is finnicky and difficult to change between devices.  We constantly switch between 2 android and 1 windows device.  If my laptop is connected to the speaker I can't connect my phone until the laptop releases it.  Tonight I couldn't get my phone to reconnect no matter what I did.  Not gonna deal with it.Aside from that I didn't like the equalizer options - they didn't sound right.  The handle is in the way of the buttons.  I'm pretty sure the battery life isn't as good as advertised.  The user interface just seemed half baked.  The LED lights bleed over into others.  Such a shame that such little details ruin what is such a phenomenal speaker.As a point of comparison my other speaker is the original UE boom.  This speaker sounds alot better than the Boom but the 7? year old Boom just works without any fuss.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 EXCELLENT DEEP BASS RESPONSE IN TWS MODE  STEREO IMAGE MAY BE WAVY AT TIMES BUT IF THEY ARE IN A GOOD SPOT OR CORNER TURNED UP LOUD ENOUGH  THEY WILL GIVE OFF A BASS RESPONSE TO SHAKE AND RATTLE WALLS AND OBJECTS YOU CAN FEEL . RECOMMENDED BUY .
5,Great sound but battery life is short. If the volume is up high it will drain the battery quick.
5,I'm overly impressed great speaker all the way around
4,I love it
5,I use this speaker for 6 hours and only use 10 percent. If you are on the bubble to buy. GET IT!
5,I got this on Prime day for 60 bucks and I like it almost as much as I like my Soundcore Motion BoomIt is loud to start and so far the battery life has been good.  Pairing with phone is easy and stays paired at 25 ft.  I have not tested beyond that.Bass can get a little distorted at its highest level but again at 75 watts at 60 percent is just as loud as my Motion Boom at 90 percent.Price to performance wise this is a very good deal.
5,been shopping and looking around for a Bluetooth speaker for a while and I finally found one with outstanding sound and outstanding build quality so far I've been really happy with this Bluetooth speaker
5,Buy it and you will love it. Dont leave home to the party without it. Big sound Baby!
5,This probable bluetooth speaker packs a powerful punch at 1/2 the cost of the big brands. I have never had any issues with the bluetooth connection. I visit the beach also the sand bar on the boat and thus speaker is perfect for that.
4,Sonido bien similar a la jbl xtreme
5,Like the speakers selling for 250+
5,Good sound and very much appreciate the strap to carry around.
5,Not to heavey but good sound usb drive and sd card love it
4,I t works for what I was looking for good sound battery life is good
5,Best Bluetooth speaker I've herd yet for under $300  !just got the ZEALOT 75W Portable Bluetooth Speaker the Loudest n  clearest  w  great sound  n lots of bass Best i've herd yet for under $300 . I'm very impressed with THE ZEALOT 75W Portable Bluetooth Speaker Better than JBL  Bose or Sony that I've herd !! I will update this ..... after I use it for a while best $75 Speaker yet ... Thanks ZEALOT some one finally did it Right !!
5,Great sound for the price battery life could be better but its still overall a steal.
5,Fantastic sound quality for a reasonable price better value than JBL ANY DAY!!
4,The sound quality is very good since I don't bother with the eq function on the speaker I have my mp3 files playing flat from my phone and highs midrange and lows sound very good. You might want to use the eq depending on what kind of music you listen to but normal sounds very good for jazz and jazz fusion. Price is a good selling point too.
5,Recommend
5,Completely satisfied
3,The Zealot S-67 gave me great sound and bass even at low volumes. While charging it took roughly 9 hours to fully charge. When I paired the speaker to my bluetooth device it would show 100 percent power for about 5 minute then bobble between 90 and 100 percent power. I used the speaker for 2 nights and got only around 15 hours of total play time out of it. When the indicator on my device show that there is still 30 percent power remaining on the speaker it would soon say the battery low. Then the speaker would power itself off several minutes later.It is a real shame because I do like this Zealot portable speakers. And I'm a first time buy of the brand. However I will be returning it.
4,This is a great player when you pair two the sound is even better.  but the way it handles song order with  USB drives is not the best . The Full volume when  play starts  is annoying .
5,I love my music especially on the beach. I needed something that wasn’t too heavy so I could carry it on the beach on my walk if I wanted to. It is loud too!! This is perfect. Exactly what I was looking for!!
5,I'm so in love with this speaker!  It's sleek sturdy INCREDIBLE sound I love the leather strap easy to connect!  I'm a speaker junkie and this is in my top 3 for sure!!
5,Excellent battery life very loud
3,This review comes from someone who has tested over 60 different BT speakers. Of course expectations have to match the price point of the item. In this case the regular price is reasonable but a Lightning Deal along with an extra discount coupon made it a good opportunity to give a pair of these a shot.First the good stuff. The BT pairing and TWS linking between the two speakers was a breeze with quick response blue backlit buttons. The mid and low bass is punchy and produces a nice full soundbuttons.Now here is where I referenced that some adjustment is needed to make this Zealot speaker a keeper. I removed two stars based on 3 main points.First the 2 speakers working as a stero left and right produce a spacious soundstage but in a weird way. There is somewhat of a "surround" aspect but with a fakey hollow result.Second as mentioned the bass is really good but along with the hollow soundstage the mids are significantly harsh along with overly bright highs. There are 3 EQ settings via a button labeled as such that turns a different color for each setting. Blue is "normal" the best of the 3. The other 2 are pretty much a waste of time. Orange for "bass" removes the harsh high end but unfortunately goes too far the other way and nearly completly muffles it. The green "vocal" setting further increases the hollowness of the normal setting. As my experience with these onboard limited EQ settings on various brands has revealed that they are more or less an unusable gimmick there is always the app/device EQ settings on the music souce that can be very capable of compensating for these units that h
5,Tried to pair with my TV (Samsung TU7000). The TV recognizes the Zealot but will not pair. Zealot flashes blue (after announcement "BLUETOOTH") TV includes Zealot in bluetooth list but will not pair. TV paired with my Android phone immediately. TV paired with my little Zenrue bluetooth device immediately. No joy with the Zealot. Different bluetooth type? Don't know don't care won't work. Just be aware.Initially had an issue. When pairing I was rotating the speaker and - voila - it paired and has remained paired. Couldn't be happier. Nice speaker.
4,I use it for my TV and the sound quality is good for my living room acceptable.
5,Love this radio  was debating on this or a jbl but the price on them are so crazy ! This sounds just as good for a fraction of the cost. I bought it to make bed roll radio for my motorcycle and I believe it is going to work perfect. U will not be sorry buying this. It has just enough weight to it make it feel good quality. I added a pic with a tv remote for scale. I'll add a video when I get it put together.
5,This is my initial review for the ZEALOT 75W Portable Bluetooth Speakers and I'll continue updating it as I am using it.This Bluetooth speakers is ideal for home work outdoor activities and much more! You can bring it to the park you can use it as a hand-held Bluetooth speaker or carry around with you on hikes. it’s also great bachelorette party accessories! These portable speakers are larger than most other comparable products but that is because it packs amazingly large woofers for such a small device with an amazing sound! Plus their 14400 mah batteries last for hours and hours and allow you to charge your phone or tablet as well. With 3 EQ modes you can choose from clear voices high volume or anything in between. In addition to the EQ modes this ZEALOT bluetooth speaker comes with an awesome LED light show that lets you decide if you'd like static lights (which are festive!) blinking lights (which are perfect for raves or dance parties!) or a variety of fun patterns!I’m just loving the quality of this speaker and everything about it is screaming premium and I highly recommend it.If you found this review helpful click on the helpful button below to help other customers develop a more informative decision and raise more awareness within the community.
5,Great sound for the price. Connects to very BT easily & stays connected.
5,The bass on thos thing is phenomenal i love it
5,Just received it and can't comment on long-term use but so far I'm impressed with the sound quality.
5,The sound is awesome and the price is feasible
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Amazing I was surprised even I read the reviews I was kind of wondering if it really has a boom well it sounds like a Xtreme 3 or better for les than a third of the price you won’t return this little fella it sounds amazing
5,As advertised no complaints long battery life between charges.
4,Great and good sound when I’m outside
3,This speaker is just ok. It performs it's best at loud volumes. The low volume goes from barely being able to hear it to much louder with nothing in between. If you're in a small-medium sized room that can be frustrating. Don't get me wrong; I'm all about busting some 90's hip hop for my best dance party but a little more control for the less epic ballads would be optimal. Also when you turn it on it chimes and says "Bluetooth" VERY loudly. I don't hate the speaker and recognize that it was a fair price but wouldn't buy another one. If you buy it for outside mostly loud volumes or very large rooms it's a great price for what you get.
4,Battery life issue
4,This speaker is good but not great. Too much bass and adds distortion to the music. I suppose if you are of the younger generation who seems to lean into the "the more bass the better" mentality but it comes at a cost: distortion. I like that it was actually smaller than I imagined it might be so I still can use this like my much small JBL Flip 4 that I got this to replace. I wish there was a setting or an app that you can custom blend the equalizer with. It does have 3 differnt EQ settings but everyone of them is marginal at best as far as what I would consider higher-def sound quality. Also you cannot return this as per typical Amazon Prime Refunds. Not sure why this is and I looked for a way to determine this but could not find. Overall for the money I consider this a great buy since it performs as well as the JBL Flips but is less expensive and more powerful. The real trade off is this unit is simply bigger. But I appreciate the fact that I also get more power and the added size is worth it overall to me.
5,So far perfect
4,Rich amazing sound I use it at the basketball courts and it’s great
5,Its very nice
5,Awesome speaker
5,So far so good! Excellent sound…love all the sound options you can pick from. Very easy to connect to Bluetooth as well.  Bought for husband to use at work in factory!
4,Speaker sounds good indoors but not as a 75W as advertised haven't played it for a length of time to know how long the battery last when fully charged nor test it for water resistance. Durable and pairs easily but no protective case to fit would recommend this product for home and small parties
5,Which it was remote and had more hookup feature sound is clearly amazing it needs a cross body carrying strap
5,Sound quality is great I would definitely recommend
5,I was very impressed by the sound from the Zealot!I own a bigger sound bar and this puts out more power. Bigger bass and better sound quality!
5,Zealot is a beast! Very satisfied with my purchase.
5,Great quality good sound. Would buy again.
5,Amazing speaker exceeded my expectations
4,Very nice!! Very loud great Bass have not tried it in the water yet but pretty dope speaker!!
5,This thing BANGS!!!  Nuf said!  However Amazon Prime is Not the way to order it. 2 day shipping ruined the last order.
5,Awesome speaker. Had purchased a second set to replace one of the slightly cracked ones. It has everything that a true music fan looks for the prize of this speaker. The only con I have is that the material for the speaker is pretty delicate and upon an accidental impact it can crack the speaker cabinet. I had recently a week ago had an accidental drop on both speakers. One sounded good still the other began to sound distorted. I had personally inspected one of the speaker and seemed to have split a little open on the seam of the bottom of the speaker. Other than that it was fully functional still.....
5,Wow this is one of the best Bluetooth speakers I ever had this is loud I was not expecting it to be loud can't wait to take it to work
5,This is probably one of my favorite Bluetooth speakers! The sound of this thing is great so i purchased a second and wow! Putting two of these in stereo mode is the ticket! Loud clear and plenty of bass! Buy it seriously!
4,Great speaker very loud and clear. Just never get it around liquids as it does ruin it
4,Amazing sound that fills the backyard and my office.  Some interference when I have more than one device joined to Bluetooth - or if I use the mic cable but that's easy to avoid.  A final concern is that the USB-C does not charge when connected to a fast charger.  You have to use a slower USB-A to USB-C connection - but this too is not a big deal since the battery lasts a long time.
5,Great sound great warranty solid speaker!
5,Great sound and price
3,Good sound but the batterie is really bad
5,
4,GREAT for the price
5,I got this speaker for the pool and the volume is incredible  no distortion at all and the equalizer works wonders. The sound is loudand crisp with the bass is noticeable. The price is right for the quality of sound.
5,Muy bien sonido pronto compraré otra para TWS lo único es que no conecta con mi TV Samsung a pesar de que lo reconoce
5,Muy bueno
5,This Bluetooth speaker is better than I expected.The sound system is incredible with an awesome bass sound.And talk about loud with the volume just at 40% it had my apartment walls vibrating.Have not tested the battery life or waterproof yet. You won't be disappointed with the sound system.
5,Looks good and clean. Sounds is tremendous very satisfied.
5,Love the sound clarity & balance i can achieve with it! Plenty of bass to match!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Debated on purchasing this or new jbl charge5 definitely happy I bought this instead for less than half the price of jbl! Battery will last 2 days at full blast and so far the quality has not suffered at all. Ride with it on my Harley and it’s loud enough to hear over the bike and wind at 70mph.
5,I love everything about this speaker. The price the sound and the range. It's a very good quality speaker don't change anything!
5,Great sounds but no longer battery lifeGood water resistance
5,Great sound able to fill the backyard with plenty of quality sound
4,Another better than anything I've bought was a little scared that it would perform worth anything was totally worth the money bought my niece one cause she like mine so much
5,Muy bueno

5,Sounds great on the boat
5,Great bass loud for such a small device and great value.
5,Has excellent volume and a strong bass.

5,This portable Bluetooth speaker has a lot going for it.  When I took the box containing the speaker out of the Amazon shipping box I was amazed at the weight.  Not crazy heavy but substantial letting you know this is something special.  The instructions are easy to understand and it connected easily to my wi-fi network.  The control panel is lighted easy to read and operate.  Quite simply the sound is amazing.  When I began streaming the sound filled the room.  The bass jumps right out at you and the built in equalizer makes certain that your music is crisp and clear.  Outside on my deck the sound is equally impressive.  Don't be afraid to crank it up because it can handle it with no distortion.  It has all the features you want.  You can make and receive Bluetooth calls use the cables provided for auxiliary devices and more.  The speaker is also water resistant in case a sudden rain shower blows up your outdoor activity.  If you are looking for a portable indoor/outdoor speaker this is all you will ever need.  It will not disappoint!
3,I am disappointed in the speaker .. a lot of blowing smoke but the speakers showed signs of wear after the first week .. distorted when u turn up the volume past . 75 percent..seems like a lot of noise about how good if is but doesn’t perform to the story…
3,Not for quiet bedroom settingsAt medium and higher volumes this is great but if you want to have it at a low volume it’s not very low at the lowest setting.
5,Nice sleek looking design.  Spectacular Sound and Clarity.  Bass is awesome too! Great price point for the quality!
5,Sleek Design and gets pretty loud.
5,Received speaker in great shape. Charges easily and lasts all day long!
5,Great speaker. The sound and bass is excellent.
5,Bought it for my fiancé and he loves it
5,Very good for the price. Good quality. Decent bass. I would recommend it.
5,Good sound quality and easy setup.
5,Great speaker  only used for 2 days will not hold a charge  dies after 2 hours
5,Great sound and BASE! Easy bluetooth connection too.
5,Love the bass in this
5,First of all it's really loud! Pretty decent bass! The drivers really thump and it's nice to watch. The sound quality is pretty good too!
4,Buena sonido recomendable
5,Excellent speaker.  LOUD!! I would compare this to the JBL Extreme 3!!! At a fraction of the price!!!I was expecting this to be decent speaker.  But this has exceeded my expectations.
3,I love almost everything about this little powerhouse. Beginning with the price. The battery life is fantastic! The audio quality is damn good for this price point. I love the handle.But two things are unbelievably annoying and that's why only 3 stars.1) The blue light flashes the entire time it's on. There's no reason to design it that way but it flashes. The whole time.2) The volume is impossible to adjust subtly. One "click" up and it's too loud and one "click" down and it's not loud enough. There's no way to get a volume level between the "clicks" not with your phone's volume adjustment nothing.This is again a huge design flaw.So for the money this thing is great. Tough to find anything waterproof & with this long battery life for only around $85.But if you're easily annoyed by design features that are incredibly dumb (like me) **do not** buy this. Pay a bit more and get the JBL Charge 4/5.
4,My friend liked it a lot and promised to buy again next time
5,Sounds great and looks very premium material wise. Plenty bass everything sounds great on it. It gets very loud without any distortion and actually does better playing quiet than some if my lower powered speakers. This is an amazing value!
5,I really like this speaker.  It has a great sound and you do not have to turn the volume up too high in order to get a good volume.  It was easy to unpack and it worked right out of the box.  All I had to do was turn it on and then connect it to my phone.  It showed up immediately in my list of bluetooth devices and connected quickly.  I use it in a classroom so that I can easily play music or other sound from my phone and all the students can hear it.  It does turn off after a period of nonuse in order to preserve the battery life so keep that in mind if you go for periods of time without using it during the day.  I'd recommend this for anyone looking for a good speaker that can be heard throughout a room.Another plus: Very fast shipping!  I received it the day after I ordered it.
5,What powerful speaker for it size. What a great value. I'm using it in my vintage corvette so I can play my music play lists. This speaker is great and load get one before they are gone.
5,Buen sonido y buen volumen  lo único qué no me gusta es la base es muy pequeña si mejoran eso puede ser una de las mejores bocinas bluetooth del mercado!!! Sonido bestial!!! buenos bajos buena conectividad!!!
5,Purchased as a gift for Father’s Day and my dad loved it! He said it had a great sound and that he loved the bass.
3,While this is one of the loudest speakers for its size(good for outside and my purpose-on a motorcycle cruiser) it did not recharge so I had to return it. Would have been nice if it actually worked more than once.
5,Great sound and bass.
5,
5,I like the sound. The speaker was very easy to connect to Bluetooth. The bass is amazing. I used it for an outdoor party. Everyone inquired about the system.
5,Definitely worth the price. Da bass be thumpin. If what you're looking at is with in spitting range of this. Just get this.Noted the last time I got one that they had a pairing feature. Finally bought a 2nd one during the sale and it was worth it. Using them form my desktop setup. It's like I got a home theater
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 OK folks get off your wallet this is a premium product amazing portable rechargeable Bluetooth speaker  $100 for and worth every penny I had it hooked to my phone via Bluetooth at 25% volume and it was loud enough to be heard 2 houses away at full volume somebody would have called the cops I am sure but the really amazing part is the whole frequency range comes through crystal clear no distortion at all :)  All I need to let this baby go full volume is an empty beach since any place inside city limits would get me in trouble this speaker is truly amazing.  When you consider VALUE + PERFORMANCE + QUALITY + EASE OF USE this is worth more than 5 Stars
5,Sound quality
5,Great product for the price - comparible sound to so many others!
5,Very well constructed. Easy connection. Great sound!
5,I use this Bluetooth speaker for assisting my disabled wife with her cell phone and music player experiences.  Straight out of the box it feels sturdy and looks more expensive than its very reasonable price.  The only assembly required was attaching its leather carrying strap which took seconds.  The controls are in top and the access ports are behind a cover on the lower side.  For testing purposes the sound was LOUD and clear but for my use we kept the sound at levels appropriate for a 12x14 room.  Charging is simple via the supplied USB cord and my own charger.  This device is very flexible.  Music can be played via a Bluetooth connection or from a usb drive or TF card containing music files.  Its external case texture makes it easy to keep clean.  I am impressed have no regrets about my purchase and recommend this speaker
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Perfecto el sonido
4,The speaker sound is not 8 clear at a very high volume.
2,Bought this to replace a 40 watt portable speaker that wasn't loud enough when planes fly overhead and this speaker doesn't come close to putting out the volume the smaller one does - it may have a lot of bass but it's mid-range and high-range output is almost non-existent. I listen to talk radio/comedy from SXM channels while working in the yard sometimes music but with talk radio you cannot hear the voices well at all - speech is at the frequency right where this speaker has lousy performance. It might sound louder inside a house but outdoors it's not loud at all. Returning it for a Zealot IPX7 which claims to have (2) 25W full range speakers and (2) 15W tweeters - hope that one has better frequency response in the range I listen to most often.
4,So far Iove that bass and sound.  I would have ginven a 5 star if there was an indicator for charge and volume percentage.
5,All great sound awesome and last a long time on one charge!!
5,Buen precio y excelente sonido sigan manteniendo el precio estoy pensando en adquirir otro éxito son una buena opción de compra.
5,One great sound and tremendous bass
5,Smooth operator!👍
5,Got it today. This speaker is super loud I only had it halfway up… obviously I’m not gonna test the water resistance but hands down a big heavy loud speaker…
5,I am in shock at how adorable and powerful this lil speaker actually is!I absolutely love how the strap is attached to it aswell.Extremely sturdy.I can see myself running around and dancing with this outside on my back with no issues!I am very happy with this purchase and will definitely be recommending it to my friends and family!Thank you soo much.
5,Tienen un sonido increíble por un excelente precio. Nada que enviarle a las JBL del mismo modelo. Sin duda una gran compra.
5,Best Bang for your money. Very loud with great clarity and good bass.
5,Good speaker
5,This thing is loud!  Bought it as a work speaker.  To be heard over grinding and welding.....well worth it
5,La bocina suena perfecto pero sus botones son muy débiles si tienes uñas no tocar solo con la yemita de los dedos…
4,Buen producto
5,After a few weeks of testing this speaker I can genuinely say that this speaker is pretty amazing. I'm able to hear the speaker through the shower at below half the max volume. It is USB-C and has quickcharge and it waterproof None of the materials feel cheap and the sound quality is great for this price point. While it does have a built in EQ I kept it at default because it does have good high's and lows. Also the handle seems a little overkill but idk someone might want to swing this thing around. The only thing I didn't like which is just me being nitpicky is while yes it does have a built it battery bank and it works well It does not have quickcharge so the device you are trying to charge will charge slowly.
5,Very good value.  Strong sound. Would recommend.
3,Pairing has been challenging
5,This speaker is louder than jbl extreme 3... it is a great product for 70$ couldnt be happier!
5,Crisp clear sound. The equalizer is a tremendous help in finding the type of sound I'm looking for during my bike rides. Battery life is to be determined once I begin using it outdoors but it looks promising thus far.
5,i love this speaker. It is much louder than i expected and the sound is very crisp.
5,Great sound! Bass is rich and connecting to my phone was easy. I also love the battery life!
5,Very good sound plenty loud enough also even on boat! Would definitely recommend and buy again!
5,The Zealot S-67 has great sound and bass. I was not expecting this out of this speaker. It is awesome and loud. This has my recommendation for others to get.
5,El producto venía bien empacado lo que me sucedió es que no dura la carga de la batería pero todo el producto venia nuevo
5,I just got it and the sound it’s great I like it so far
4,I liked the size and weight of the speaker as well as the wonderful sound.  However I did run into a problem when trying to utilize the Aux input for my digital sax.  There was an annoying and nearly 1/2 second delay between when I would play and sound came out of the speaker.  This did not happen with other speakers or headphones so I believe it to be a design defect.
5,Pretty loud and Bluetooth has hood range.
3,It's loud just not as loud as I thought it was gonna be. I still hear most vehicles over my music when I'm riding around and it's also more bulkier than I thought. Other than that. Great speaker. I'm gonna look for a smaller one sorta to speak and louder. Thank you.
5,Very loud and clear. The Equaliser function allows for different sounds modes allows for listening to podcasts or blasting heavy bass. Definitely recommend.
5,
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Nice bass and great look.
4,Excellent sound quality until you hit the loudest point. It has a great bass and very good quality sound comparable to any of the top brands but at a much lower price. Just don’t turn it up all the way because you will get some distortion. Overall it is worth every penny.
5,I have used this several times so far (at full volume which is extremely loud to the point where I have to turn it down). I love that it has that capability. For whatever type of music I turn on it has the setting to adjust to make those highs and lows very crisp and clear. I do not have any complaints about this speaker. It is a great value compared to my UE boom which costs are similar and this blows it out of the water in capabilities and quality. You'll like the leather strap. It's just the icing on the cake. I have not tested the water resistance capability yet.
5,Absolutely love this speaker.  A little bigger than you think it would be compared to their other products but it is fantastic.  Easy to use bluetooth compatible very secure leather handle to carry around fits comfortably in a backpack and looks really nice.I am a teacher and a swim coach.  I use this in both areas.  In the classroom with 25+ students I don't even need to put it 40% volume for it to be well above the volume of the students.  In the pool with 25+ swimmers swimming simultaneously this speaker easily fills the entire pool area with volume to spare and I'm not worried about it getting water damage.Great speaker
5,Speaker sounds great LOUD!
5,So far seems great.  Loud crisp sound and feels durable.  I like the size too.
5,Muy complacido con el sonido buen producto.
5,This is lightweight heavy on sound and sync together!  Exactly what we wanted for our pontoon boat.
5,Buena calidad
5,Great value sounds great
5,Great quality built very sturdy and has good weight. The sound is incredible deep base with a nice EQ. For the price this product is excellent. I'm going to the park with mine and cool out.
5,Great sound. Sturdy well built. Nice aesthetics
5,The charge plug take a lil puch to fully connect. The strap may need to be cut off if you prefer oer-the shoulder carrying. Other than those two points this speaker is AWESOME !! I tested it with an Iphone-7.  I couldn't use more than 25% (+/-) volume. But even at the lowest volume the sound was very crisp. All three modes performed as advertised. I can't wait to crank this bad-boy at work !!
5,This thing is stupid loud. It’s awesome and you won’t find a better product for the money.
5,Great sound
5,Beautiful piece and great sound
5,excellent quality long battery life and awesome bold sound
2,Ooohh ok ok damn.  Was exactly my first words playing music the first time. If your like me and looking for something clear and freakin loud this is it. I wanted a speaker easy to carry to the river or lake and hear while Im in the water swimming. Sand was easy to get out. Water did not effect it at all. The bass makes my music more lit. Definitely standed out over a plain azz speaker. Loud af amd the sound is just so clear and crisp to the T!  Heard it on the boat while I was tubing!  Easy to carry literally everything I want.  Like people seriously I am beyond amazed and swear I couldn't of found a better find. I like loud! Get this speaker.Update !!!!!!!!Battery lasting barely 6 hours and dying at 40% charge turning off like its dead. Long battery life ?!?! NOPE so inconvenient for out door activities for a day!
2,After reading the reviews of this and other products I decided to give it a try. I fully charged the unit before using it. Fired it up paired easily to my phone and playing music very quickly. At a moderate volume level (30% - 40%) The speaker was telling me "low battery please charge" after only about an hour of use. Very frustrated I charged it completely and this time left it plugged in to the charger. Not much help. It was still dead long before its advertised battery life expectancy.  Sound quality was good and is the reason for 2 stars. But the battery life is terrible. I have had no-name Bluetooth devices in the past that played for much longer at full volume. Simply unacceptable.
5,El sonido es excelente
5,This speaker is great!! Used it for parties and personal vibe sessions!!! I recommend it to anyone who wants a good vibe. Only downside is that the battery drains out after having it for some time!
5,After watching many reviews I decided that these speakers would be an amazing value and I can confirm that the audio quality is great and it gets very loud. Happy buyer thus far 👍🏼
5,I can’t think of any complaints with anything with this product
5,Awesome well built sounding speaker. Very surprised on the sound quality.
4,I'm very satisfied it plays great and loud. I got my money's worth.
5,Great speaker very loud it was definitely a great purchase
3,This little system actually does what it's supposed to. I am impressed with the sound it puts out. I am in my fifty's and have had some Awesome house systems but with this portable by the pool it's easy to get lost in the moment.
5,Great quality sound super loud. Perfect for summertime/outdoor activities!
5,I am impressed with the sound output i’ve taken the Zealot for an outdoor party it kept. Everyone dancing and enjoying the music
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 When it was delivered to my home I think it was cumbersome but not. I tried it for some weeks and put it on my desk. When I began streaming the sound filled the room. I feel just about 30% volume is enough for my room. I think it is equipped with a dual pairing function like a live concert experience.
5,Everything you hope that it will sound like and a whole lot MORE 100%
3,Yes it's loud an cheaper in price than the JBL charge. It has deep bass but way to much distortion at higher volumes
5,* Loud and powerful sound from this speaker.* Stylish leather strap to carry the speaker.* Very clear sound.* Effective and powerful bass.* Bluetooth connection holds well even I am using it from another room.* 3 different sound modes for different kinds of music and mood.* No sound distortion even on full volume.* Waterproof speaker so you can use this around shower bathtubs pools or any other outdoor place.* Long battery life. One full battery charge work for weeks (They claimed 50H)
5,This speaker is AMAZING!!! The sound quality is great. Talk about bass 🔊
5,Works great
5,It’s great it has a very clear sound and the bass is really powerful my room vibrate completely
5,Good first impression. Nice volume output sound.
5,So far so good! Glad I bought it!
5,Quality sound with great bass to the music! For under $100 its a great deal!
5,Excellent sound! Love it!
5,Great bass! I love the price and quality of this speaker. I’m used to JBL products and this speakers is definitely on the same level as JBL
5,Excellent speaker with great sound and bass.
5,Love this product it sounds great it's portable it's multi-purpose and most importantly the cost/value vs units in its range/group. This is the one!
5,The sound quality is comparable to JBL's Xtreme speaks. The battery life is quite good also. I only use it when I shower and I end up charging it every few weeks. I wouldn't recommend treating this like most of the water resistant speaker that are out there. The plug in ports aren't what I would call water locked. For the price it's definitely worth it.
5,great speaker very loud! the sound is good
2,I love how loud it can be but it dies in then an hour even while plugged in and not at max volume. Honestly not worth 60 for how fast the battery dies
5,What more can I say? I have the MusiBaby which I have been using in my front yard while I work and love it. When I found out the Zealot was manufactured by the same company I had to check it out. For a $100 how can you go wrong? It has an amazing base that sounds fantastic especially if you place it on a carpeted floor. So far I haven't had to go any higher than 60% even outside. Any higher than that and the neighbors will be complaining. This is absolutely a steal for the price!
5,Although we only have a month of experience with the speaker I can say that the quality and speaker volume are both very good. The speaker is large and somewhat heavy but that is expected with such a big speaker with as much volume as this has. No complaints so far and I love how loud it can get while still having quality of music.
5,I absolutely love my new speaker  Zealot you knocked it out the park with bases loaded
5,After 3 months use of the first oneIt was well worth buying a second
5,Super sonido muy nítido y el bass fuerte para su tamaño
5,Great purchase for the price and the sound quality was freaking awesome. I love my new purchase.
5,Great portable speaker. Very loud. Easy to connect via bluetooth. Amazing quality. Thanks
4,The bass is there. I love it in a small room. That vibration is awesome.
5,I had previously purchased a small bluetooth speaker for outdoor use but this one is going to be so much more appropriate. The sound is great--I'll play mostly from my phone--quite impressive. The handle is sturdy and well constructed. I like that the base is soft so that it will not scratch the surface it's placed on. Looking forward to exploring it further and to next spring when it can be outside playing those ROCK tunes I love.
5,Solid boombox sound quality is good
4,Quite loud for a speaker these size. 3 different EQ. Durability we will see.
5,I was looking for large bluetooth wireless speaker for work and this one i ordered was the best decision made! its a little larger then a football and is really really loud. i noticed it has a pre option EQ on it and it made the bass thump which was a awesome surprise. the phone i was using was running out of a charge and this speaker had the capability to play music and charge your phone at the same time and the charge lasted forever! DEFINITELY A MUST BUY!
4,GREAT QUALTY SOUND!!!VERY LOUD!!!AMAZING FOR THE PRICE!!!
5,I over the bass of this apeaker 😁
5,I’ve never heard a louder and cleaner bass production from such a tiny device. It’s like a scooter with the horn of a full size truck! Simply awesome. But there is a down side All my girlfriends want one can you imagine what that dose to my bank account?
5,Its high quality and the noise control is awesome
5,Can't say nothing bad about the zealot speaker thats a freaking boss boss on everything on voice bass that bass psssh hitting hard just a good speaker so far $$$$
5,Sound quality
5,This speaker is absolutely INCREDIBLE! I could not be happier. Definitely 5 stars!
2,I've owned this less than a year. I will charge overnight and now IT LASTS ONE(1)  hour. The bass distorts at higher volumes. DO NOT BUY THIS SPEAKER.
5,
5,Really worth it for me. Great sound with small footprint and is one of the best products I've ever bought in Amazon that has really surprise me of it's great workmanßhip. just look at the battery capacity alone it's practically a small generator by itself!
2,The product looks nice and if you do not turn it up to more than half volume it sounds ok (not as good as some of the brand names but passable). If you turn it past half volume it distorts badly. The 45 watt Vizio I have has better sound quality at the same volume.
5,I took a chance on a smaller speaker from the brand when it was on sale and it delivered so went back to them when I wanted a bigger speaker and won again.  This 75w speaker delivers big rich sound and is great outdoors on the patio/deck or for hearing it inside throughout the house.  It's hard to beat the sound/price value!
5,No llego cargado
5,This is a fantastic speaker with lots of features. The bass is great and it has three equalizer settings to allow you to customize its phenomenal sound to different audio preferences. Also it is extremely loud for use outdoors or in large rooms but also sounds great at lower volumes too. It has very long battery life and additional inputs besides the easy to set-up Bluetooth. This speaker is a great value for the price.
5,Great sound and Quality.
5,Sounds so good and the quality is so perfect
2,I want instructions and all the product information and numbers. Nothing was sent with this!!!!
3,It's loud but it starts losing sound quality the higher the volume goes up. You can't go past 50% of the volume without hearing distortion. It sounds good and loud at the level. They should change the software to not make it that loud so it sounds clearer.
4,Great Speaker. Fantastic Value!!
5,I've been using a Bose speaker system for years and I honestly think the sound on this is better and way cheaper
5,BOOM!  goes the bass. The sound fills the whole room as if you had a quality rack system. '
5,Better than expected
5,Awesome product. Sound is amazing.
5,Full Disclosure: Received this item free from the company to try out. However blown away by the quality the base and the overall sound of the product. Could not be happier and its to my knowledge that the price is much lower than something of equal quality from a name brand. Amazing!
5,Nothing to dislike
5,I love it
5,I like it alot just what we wanted great sound.
5,Super loud!
5,Unboxed the speaker looked it over turned it on (70% charge) paired it up and found out that the sound is great.It has some weight to it and feels well builtI listen to a lot of music and like to crank it up when I can so only time will tell how this is going to hold up.
5,Amazing value. Can blast music with amazing bass. Has battery life that will last all day no problem. Would be great for a boat or at the park. Easy to use straight out of the box can literally set it up in less than a minute with Bluetooth and comes with an Aux cord
5,Really like the sound from this speaker(as mentioned we were impressed with the sound that came from it). No complaints really. So far so good. We use it for listening to music chilling on evenings having few drinks just on those relaxing nights. Very good speaker.
5,It  sounds good but the bass sounds a little distorted other then it great. I don't know about the water resistance of it yet. The battery so far its fine.
5,A very sharp looking and great sounding speaker. Multiple means of access to include BluetoothUSB port aux port in TF card slot to listen to music. Easy to set up and use. Provides great sound in my office area but also in large living areas and outdoors.
5,I love this speaker. It has the best sound. I took a out door fair that we were having and everyone could here the music playing really loud. The battery last for almost the whole day. I reply like this speaker and I totally recommend it to anyone!!
5,Really surprised me how loud it can get while still being clear. It has different EQs to get the sound you want and it has a surprising amount of bass. Can’t comment yet on durability yet or battery life that well right now but I’ll try updating if I remember.
5,Sounds amazing!
5,Great sound.  Original purchase stopped working but seller replaced even though it was out of warranty
5,I purchased the Music baby M68 and it is just great. I purchased this one and it exceeded all my expectation's. Sounds Great Bluetooth is on the money no WIRES. I got rid f my wired speakers and use the instead. Worth every Penny. Try it out you will Enjoy. Thank
5,I consider myself a connoisseur of speakers. I was not expecting what I received. This is honestly the best sounding Bluetooth speaker I have experienced. There is a double subwoofer that creates unbelievable bass. I find myself listening to music constantly now because it sounds like it was intended. This is amazing.
5,When I receive this speaker and I took the box im understand the power of this item.Clear sound and powerful bass. The best power of battery and the option to re-charger one of my devices (yes its a power bank too)This is amazing. :)
5,Overall great design and sound for the price! Battery lasts atleast 8 hours on normal volume. The audio buzzes a bit when using the auxiliary charging port.
5,It will last for the whole day. Really good battery life and sounds amazing for the price
5,This bluetooth speaker is just awesome.  Sound quality is excellent and the bass is the best I've heard from a speaker of such size.
3,Would've liked radio too but knew what I was getting
5,Sound quality is great and seems to be built very well. Just received as a gift but it looks extremely durable.
5,Great sound just wish lights didn’t flash while playing music. Also wish owner’s manual was a little more in depth.
5,Good price great speaker. Good solid base sound. No distortion at any volume. Battery life is outstanding. Used it right out of the box. Had 90% charge. Used it 4 days in a row for over 10 hours a day.
5,I had ordered the small one and really loved it but no words can describe how beautifully the sound is on this newer and bigger Wireless Speaker is. great bass Well worth the money !

Cool EQ feature SUPER long range (10m) Also super long battery life. Stoked.
3,😞
5,I'm very happy with it. It exceeded my expectations I'm more than satisfied with the sound. If it were a little cleaner it would have a Bose label on it.
5,Shipping was super fast. My daughter loves the speaker such a small size for such a big sound
5,Great sound

3,Sounds ok but the bass distorted  when the volume is high
5,This is the BEST portable speaker there is.... at a Great price !!!

5,Tremendous sound out of this Bluetooth speaker.  Amazing bass the volume capabilitities very impressive and clarity of sound is top notch. Nice equalizer capabilities for a compact product
5,Para ponerlo en cualquier sitio y llevar tu música de preferencia a todas partes..
5,easy to use and charge.
5,Tiene muy buen bajo
5,We love our speaker!!! It was shipped quickly and the quality of sound is out of this world!!!!!
5,The Zealot has great quality sound. It is one of the many features this speaker has that is very important to me.
1,I own 5 of these  feel that they are the best in all categories  however  one by one[own 5] the silver end pieces are separated from the rubber radiator ends.  I have tried to reglue them  but noticed the end caps are actually 1 pieces  and they are not centered  as a result just normal use will cause separation or blown sounding bass radiator.  Still no word from Zealot and I actually filed the warranty cards.  Shame Anthony Wilson. Warranty being ignored 🙁 DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY. IT WONT LET ME POST PICTURES OF RADIATOR BLOWN OUT PLUS WITH ONLY 3 USES SCREWS RUST OUT NOT IPX6 AT ALL
5,EXCELLENT SOUND SYSTEM!!!!
5,No regrets in ordering this Zealot blue tooth speaker. Easy set up sturdy stable tremendous sound.
5,good job

5,great product! really happy with it
5,
1,I very gently used this for six months. 1 month in conveniently when the warranty disappeared the sound would have periodic 1-sec skips. Then it would be good for a while and the sound quality was fine. Then the skips would come back on a random day. It wasn't because of low battery or heat this was freshly charged and indoors. I checked everything. Yesterday I was outside for sunset (not hot) listening to music and it says "low battery please charge now." It died. And ever since a muffled sound like hearing sound at 1% of its potential. It is completely toasted. I have tried fully recharging it playing it plugged in and connecting to different devices but nothing works. Made in China died from extremely gentle use after 6 months. This company is creating products for the landfill such a shame.
1,When the eq is adjusted for a certain song the treble sounds bad and vise versa. Had to change eq every song. No good overall setting.
1,Baterry only is for four hours when you said it is more
1,Had it for just 2 months and the on/off button malfunctioned
1,Went to the river with it and had it charging the whole night before and used it the next day and lasted a whole 2 hours highly upset about it !
2,I love it but it’s not loud but it got great bass but I wish it could be more loud
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             PARTY OUTSIDE  They die if not plug-inJust brought them last week I'm DISAPPOINTED.
1,Kept this speaker at my office to listen to music something. Purchase in March 2022 and can probably count the time i use on both hand. By the end of May 2022 the speaker stop charging and now is unusable
1,It's a great speaker but when I received the item it only came with the speaker and nothing else. I assumed any other Type-C charger would work but it did not and now I have a useless dead speaker.
1,Will not hold a charge and gets far less than the advertised hours on battery
1,Que el cargador no me sirve y nuevo
1,I really like the sound but the battery died not hold a charge. This is my second one that I tried.
1,N/a
1,Not loud
1,
1,Lo más chafa en sonido por ese precio
4,Great Speaker would recommend for anyone who like a loud bass speaker
1,Too large and bulky. Sound quality was really bad. Would not accept a refund.
1,Has low volume quality and is not reliable
5,I'm a dj and was looking for a quality sound product that I can tote around on a boat. This Speaker here is better  than your top notch name brands. Battery life is superb 👌 the bass has nice lows...love this little party starter....
5,Excellent sound!
4,Good sounds and good bass but the battery won't charge. I received it yesterday with 80% battery and plugged it in to charge all night and this morning it has 70% battery
5,El volumen de sonido es muy alto y con claridad. Quizá al extremo se pueda escuchar un poco de distorsión pero nada grave. Otra cosa son los bajos. Que me parecen muy precisos de manera que no esconden otras notas más agudas como voces  y la batería no me ha presentado ningún problema yo escucho volumen alto y en promedio 5-6 horas me dura pero la mayor ventaja es que es muy portable y con un sonido muy alto. PERFECTO
5,I'm  actually impressed 👌! I was not expecting this kind of LOUD! And I love it. Purchased mainly for the waterproof to be able to carry everywhere with kids. I still have to tested outdoors and see if it actually last for a couple of years.
5,I was very skeptical at first but when it arrived and I turned it on I was completely blown away by the sound. Needless to say I have recommend it to friends already.
5,The sound is incredible that's all I can say is it's the best Bluetooth I have ever purchased.
5,El parlante suena súper bien la calidad de los bajos me gusta tiene tres opciones para que se reproduzca el sonido y la batería es de larga duración.
5,I bought several speakers to test out for my outdoor patio needs. This speaker had very impressive sound in terms of bass treble and volume(!!!). However out of the speakers I tested the JBL Charge 4 and Flip 5 had slightly better quality sound (not as much volume though) and were much more portable. The Prime Day price was perfect on this Zealot but the size was simply too big for my needs. I am returning it and deciding on one of the JBLs.
5,The plug-in essentials can be a bit tighter to prevent and moisture but very happy with overall product after so many reviews later and a supprise discount
3,I’ve tried playing music while charging and for some reason it stays on for a bit but then it shuts off which is not very useful. Idk if I’m the only one encountering this problem but I would think if your charging the device you can still use it. I play music everyday so having to charge it if it dies and not being to play music sucks. The battery life is pretty nice tho get a couple days before needing to charge if I use it all day at work.
4,El sonido esta muuuuy chido. Se escucha muy claro y fuerte como debe de ser.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Love it
5,Nice and loud!
5,Perfect device
5,
5,It works flawlessly I love it
4,This speaker offers a strong 75 watt amplifier that powers the right and left channels and a center subwoofer. Sound is excellent you can also custom adjust using the 3 level Equalizer. The blue back lit controls are great much better than many models that are very difficult to see. I only wish I could stop the blue lights from constantly flashing it’s very annoying. One star lost because of this.
5,Great speaker!
5,Bought this as a second one it sounds good with the other one makes more sound and it’s very clear I really like it
5,Love it!! Been awhile since I’ve heard a Bluetooth Speaker like this! Great sound and stylish!! Very pleased!!!
5,The sound is clear and loud. The speaker is extra heavy too. It's pretty durable and it looks really nice
5,I absolutely love this speaker.  Sounds amazing.
5,Its a beast. No other words needed to describe this thing.
5,Great speaker! We used it for an outdoor movie night and worked like a charm. The speakers a very loud and high quality. Great price as well for 75W speaker!
5,This speaker sounds pretty good. It's a little bigger than I thought but that's OK. If you use the equalizer settings on your phone or whatever device you use it sounds good even at higher volumes. I'm pleased with it.
5,so far so good...nice rich sound n strong battery!
5,Only used it for a short time so far Loud clear speaker easy to use but one of bad things is  no radio
2,it is good but not up to JBL quality.Speaker is loud sound is nice/adequate  holds charge very well. But...When turned on it starts on max volume. Why?!?!Min volume is way too loud.Volume adjustment is not continuous but preset. Sometimes it is hard to get the sweet spotWhen on LEDs are blinking. Not too intuitive.Charge level indicator would be nice. This speaker illuminates one led completely and semi-illuminates a few next to it when charging. When charged all leds go off. Not too intuitive.there are no hard cases for this speakerskip button would be nice.BT establishes connection not as reliably as JBLI'd say that I can live with with these gripes if price us under $70 or so. Above 70 - I'd go with a name-brand speaker
5,When I received the package from Amazon I was surprised by the weight. This speaker is not going to knock over easily but luckily it comes with a convenient strap to carry it around. Pairing the speaker to my iPhone was quick and easy but it also comes with all the normal attachments you would expect if you didn't want to drain your phone battery's charge. There are different sound settings - playing around with the treble and the bass and on full bass full sound my tiny one-bedroom apartment was bumping. For the sake of my neighbors I have not been able to test out the battery life on high volume but at a low level it lasted a good 5-6 hours on the charge right out of the box. I cannot wait to go on a picnic and bring this bad boy with me!
5,This 75w speaker packs hella sound and rich bass. It’s roughly 11.5 inches across 4.5” wide and 5” high. It weighs 4.6 lbs and comes with 3 front facing speakers and 2 side subwoofers. It has usb usb-c aux TF ports in the back. It stands on a rubber base. This speaker is loud for its size with a lot of bass. It has and EQ button to adjust the bass & treble to 3 different settings. It also comes with aux charging cables and instructions on how to use the different functions. The carrying strap is faux leather but it’s thick and very sturdy. The strap assembly was easy. The battery lasted about 2 hours on max volume max bass & treble for me playing pandora. Connectivity to my iPhone was very simple as well. On lower volumes and less bass the battery may can last longer.This is a great pool Side speaker because it’s splash proof according to the manufacturer.On a scale of 1-10 I’ll give this speaker a solid 9. It’s fun easy to carry connect and has  great sounds. The features are good and so is the quality.
5,I love that there's other formats that can be used to play and hookup ( for the future for me and maybe right now for somebody else ). Cards and connection. But this is a whole house speaker . Ranch style 3 bedroom and 2 bath . Sounds fantastic throughout..  and compare to JBL speaker.. Just wish for colors... Florida 😎🌞 sun. And the company that has this marvel speaker is 👍 GREATEST
5,We use this speaker all the time. Great little product for the price. Bought this for my husband and he loves it.
5,Gave it my early 20's nephew and he's thrilled with it.  Many have asked where he got it.  I think it's a big hit.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The quality is great sounds amazing the strap makes it so easy to transport anywhere. Overall 10/10
5,Talk about mighty sound n power in this speaker  we use it every where.  Took it camping and out on the boat  works great!
5,Not bad for the price  I get 3-4 hours of playtime on 70-80% volume plus it takes forever to charge I would not purchase this again nor do I recommend this speaker .
5,I like to enjoy music with great qudio quality systems different and famous marks. I also have a 5 watts speaker S9. The change from 5 to 75 watts is amazing. Bass sounds great! battery power warranties a good outside party!
5,Love it love the fact I can plug it up to my Alexa at work or Play Bluetooth off my phone  again love the sound  since my hearing is bad.👍
5,I waited for a while after purchase to so I could really test this out. You will not be disappointed I truly do not see how the 500$ to 600$ dollar JBL speaker of same size can perform any better then this. You will not be disappointed. I own 2 and glad I decided to buy another nothing like stereo sound to get the full richness this speaker can deliver.
5,The Zealot 75W speaker is a great find! The sound is powerful with a fantastic bass.The equalizer function gives music a clear rich sound. There is a strap that makes this speaker easily portable. It is something to bring to the beach or on a picnic. Even waterproof if you get caught in the rain!The speaker is solid and durable.Highly recommend!
5,Highly impressed. The sound quality is great. And the bass is extreme hahaha. Great product glad I bought this instead of spending 400 on a jbl extreme!!!

It is large and carries an INCREDIBLE sound – clean and clear!  Make sure your phone volume is not on high when you turn it on!  The speaker volume works great!!  Quick to charge.  Comes with a removable handle so it’s easier to carry or hang.  Tip:  It’s easier if you put the handle on with the screw on the outside not the inside like I did to begin with.  It will make it easier to take on and off.  This is a great speaker to take to the beach the pool to the park or just to use at at home.  It’s great for parties!  This will make a great gift.
5,Great sound quality
5,The media could not be loaded.
5,This speaker is amazing great sound very loud and the bass hits perfectly for the size and sound of this set up. Perfect for camping and I used it with our projector and it sounds as good as any sound bar surround sound set up under 500.00
5,I didnt know what i was getting when i purchased this item. I was looking for something cheaper to use on my Motorcycle. I found a way to mount it on my windshield and it  works amazing even my rider hear it very well going 60.Excellent
5,Great speaker works just as advertised. Loud good base strong song quality and battery lasts for a while. You can’t go wrong with this speaker.
5,Muy buen sonido con poco dinero la recomiendo no te arrepentirás.
5,Great sounding speaker much larger than anticipated and extremely well made. Nice heavy weight
5,It is so nice! I love the leather strap detail as well. The sound is great especially the bass. This is going to be perfect for family gatherings bbq’s and for listening to music while I am working outside.
5,Great size and sound
5,super bass
5,We needed something to listen too when traveling in an open roadster - the road noise wind and car being loud had to be overcome and this speaker did just that. We linked two of them together and it worked perfectly!
5,Awesome soundEasy Bluetooth connection
5,Bought the speaker for my son's room had to tell him to bring it down to 25%. It is loud very loud. The bass ufff the night table was vibrating. Like it so much I bought another one for my garage.
5,First the shipping was really fast and came well-protected. Compared to other items I'd dare to say that glass objects do not come as well packaged like this one! Furthermore the bass is amazing! I'm not overreacting it is! something that I love so much is that the sound is so loud that I don't even know how's that possible if this speaker is not too big. You know what else is waterproof and the price! I'd recommend this to people who are looking for an excellent Bluetooth speaker!
5,This is a great speaker at a great price. Very high quality with three different sound modes. Sound quality is clean and clear indoors and out. This would make a great gift for college dorm rooms and parties as well as a speaker system for apartments or condo's. The battery life is very good as well. Very satisfied!
5,It's very nice for It's price no competition at the price range. Bass is a lot though but it's very nice in a confined space like a small room. Love it though and i never have to worry about battery below 50% volume.
5,This speaker has amazing sound!  The base is great for any speaker let alone a portable speaker.  Just a great speaker!
5,My neighbor hates it :))
5,Excellent speaker at a good price. Very loud.
5,Excellent sound and appears well constructed. Definitely a great value.
4,All was fine  until I dropped it.. sounds like a robot now🥺
5,this product has excellent quality
1,Honestly - I wish I could have returned this speaker but I missed the deadline. The sound quality is either muffled or too sharp - two extremes. The “bass” channel is so muffled and the volume turns down so you’d have to turn it up to hear it. The “voice” channel is the only decent sound level I find for the music I enjoy listening to… but then the treble is so high it’s uncomfortable to my ears. Then there happens to be a gap in one of the volume steps - right where it counts - making it either too soft or too loud when listening in a room by yourself. I should have ordered a JBX. My loss :(  Bottom line - the sound quality of this Zealot is crap. I don’t recommend it to anyone.
5,El sonido es muy bueno lo recomiendo

And very long battery life and it's very sturdy and not to mention I showed the base in 1 of the videos very cool. And I got the  The decibels to about 110 impressive
5,I love how this speaker is big enough to play music or podcasts throughout the whole place. Sound quality is great and it’s easy to set up and use!
5,Great speaker very solid. If you don’t like a lot of bass then it’s not for you.
5,Love this speaker. Works just as good as the boyfriends JBL and looks just like it for a fraction of the cost.
5,Great speaker. Can get really loud and still clear.
5,Good speaker.  I had purchased a smaller one from a different company but ended up wanting something louder.  This one is good and loud for sure.  It has a good weight to it.  It is pretty large maybe the only negative point - but not a big deal and the size gets you good sound and large battery.Edit:  the volume adjustment could use improvement.  Each push of the button is a good leap in volume.  It's good and loud but hard to have at a low volume when you want quiet music.  Also while playing all the lights blink for some reason.
4,This seems like a nice speaker just got it. I might come back to update my review. Thanks
5,Great little speaker that really packs a punch.The sub power of this is amazing for what it is.I also haven't bought a bt speaker in about 6 years or so n the last one was a little tiny pos one.So this is the upgrade of the century for me.I have a nice little sound bar and 8 in sub box with that and although this doesn't pack that much heat its pretty darn good for whst it is.You can fill  a very large room with sound with this easily.I use it in my garage when doing stuff and upstairs while working out. So it makes it so easy to be able to do those things and just grab this go.QUALITYThe quality of this soeaker is above anything I ever thought itd be.Its great when you buy something and expect one thing and it completely over delivers ur expectations.Jsut the strap alone is so sturdy and stout i love it. The color of it against the black is very appealing.Anywhere you could touch that should be cheap plastic is that nice soft touch material that is nice cars. Its just fantastic on every front.They did an amazing job with this.I like the fact the buttons are all you need. No gimmicky features that they jack the price up n u never even use anyway.This has a few settings. Otherwise you can dial it in using ur phone on whatever u play the music through.Some people rave about how they can update this ir that with their speaker no one is doing that. So who cares.It plays music through it at way better volume and clarity than anything that is a big brand name for this price n thats a fact.Its not heavy the base is also that soft touch kinda rubberish material that is pleasant to feel but also aids in both stability but also from hearing any unwanted noises when its set on something. So more less this doesn't vibrate or anything to interfere with ur experience.Great speakerGreat priceGreat sellerExcellent packaging that is well protected.I recommend 100% to anyone looking for a great sound that likes to be able to hear some good bass and doesn't wanna soend a fortune on a speaker to do that.This is it all you need and def everything I wanted.Thank you
5,Love the sound and the size of the speaker very nicely designed 👌 got it on time for Christmas love it thanks 😊
5,So far all I can speak on is the sound. Which is amazing. I’ll report any issues with battery life or the speaker if any issues come up. Right now I give the speaker a 5/5.
5,Excellent speaker !
5,Heavy duty good quality speaker that sits beautifully in my bedroom or living room. Sound is impressive! Not travel sized but the quality and look of it makes it a staple in my home! Charged it for a day connected it via Bluetooth and works like a charm. Highly recommend!!
5,Returned another speaker and purchased this this is louder clearer and all around sounds better.
3,It is a nice unit with great looks and great sound quality.  However I found one major flaw.  If you turn it on while a USB or micro sd card is inserted it will start playing at onset with near maximum volume. After asking for a remedy on this site I didn't get a resolution.  So I woke up this morning thinking mmm what if I turn it on via Spotify first (which when tuned to Spotify it plays at low volume at onset) then insert the USB.  Wha La!!!! The volume does not increase when it recognizes the USB.  If you are like me not wanting the whole office to hear your speaker and get blasted when you power up with the USB or micro sd inserted you need a remedy.  Well here it is: Have the phone's music program playing FIRST (ie. Spotify) then insert the USB or micro mini. When the speaker automatically switches to the USB you just inserted it plays at the same volume as was playing from cellphone's music program.  Also I am kind of thinking that the battery life maybe very understated.  The stated 40-50 hrs. of advertised life expectancy was a key point in making my selection.  I have only used it for a short period of time maybe four times for less than 30 minutes at low volume (other than the blasts received when turning on) and I have already received a charge command.  I am thinking although the speaker isn't being used it is still losing battery life while idle. Yesterday when stop playing the unit it was at 2 bars (when I received the unit it was at 3 bars).  When I turned it on this morning it was at one bar. The minute I turned it on I got the recharge message. I am now waiting to see how long it takes to charge back to 4 bars.
5,I absolutely love this product. The sound quality is crisp the connection and bass are extremely good.  I absolutely love this product. I use it in my car and home
5,The speaker is absolutely amazing! It’s perfect! Sound quality and style all in one. Easy Bluetooth connection and battery lasts long. I feel confident showing off this speaker as well. Can’t wait to play it outside!
5,This speaker is amazing. It is very powerful booming Bass crystal clear voices and treble. It has a lot of power for loud outdoor volume with no distortion even turned all the way up. It also has a USB output to charge your phone or other devices. I would definitely recommend this speaker to anybody who wants a powerful outdoor Bluetooth speaker. Being able to charge devices is a good Plus. The battery lasts a long time between charges. It is also water resistant great around the pool or at the beach.
5,This speaker is the life of any party it has enough bass to bring the house down. The eq settings are great I prefer the bass one. Battery life is amazing only charged it once and used it for hours over a 2 day span. Comes with a great looking leather carrying handle. This speaker is going to take the place of my ihome and be something I can take anywhere. Super easy to connect bluetooth to it as well will find your phone right away!
1,Buy this at your own risk. This speaker appears to have no DSP within the speaker and even at medium volume the bass will distort noticeably. At higher volumes it's terrible. This is one to avoid.
5,This speaker is amazing especially for the price. Perfect size (not too bad) and sound is amazing. Can't think of any reason you would want a speaker louder than this!
5,This is the most we have spent on a speaker and it haws not disappointed!  It is easy to pair and we have had ALOT of issues with other speakers.  You just turn the Bluetooth off on a devise and the next one can find it easily.The sound is really clear and loud.  3 levels of sound available and the volume buttons on the speaker really work!We have used it in large gatherings and it is pretty loud.  We haven't had it under water to know if it is waterproof or not.Very happy with the quality and sound.
5,pretty well with good clarity and 1/3 price of JBL
1,Having read and watched many reviews of this speaker I was expecting far better. It uses a nonstandard usb-c port so it doesn't work with all usb-c cables. It doesn't show the progress for charging just a single red light that eventually turns off. It doesn't get nearly as loud as I was expecting. And the worst is it goes in and out. Listening to music or audiobooks it will drop out for part of a second randomly making it hard to understand what is being said. I haven't been able to fully test the battery life because it's too annoying to listen to lo g enough to test it.
5,It was easy to attach the stylish strap-just had to unscrew each side. The speaker was a bit larger than I expected but has great sound and bass. It connected to my iPhone Bluetooth easily and quickly with no issues. I’ve used it both inside and outdoors. A friend easily connected to play their music. Looks and plays like a high quality device. Haven’t had to recharge it yet after several hours of use. Will be great at the beach and pool in the Summer.
4,As nice as this is there are caveats that no one is mentioning. The bass in impressive but still has it's limitations and WILL have flat spots in the sound.ANSWERS To Other Q&As; seem like people are under the impression it is invincible and can blast full temp and sound great; the eanswer is a BIG NO. It is the strongest sound stick I have owned although my cheap 15 year old Sony home stereo is drastically better for Theater usage.Pros: Best use is somewhere you need bring music on the go; work park picnic beach and not as home theater. With that said...Battery lasted 2 work shifts on one charge and still wasn't dead (medium volume line-in mode.)Decent sound for the size; It has a lengthy sound projection depending where you place the speaker. In a corner at a 45 degree has some impressive bass projection with limitations; room acoustics matter here.Feels durable in design solid body and no rattling internal parts so far. Cognac colored handle matches my suede shoes lol. Charges my phone as well.Cons:It fine outdoors but Bluetooth volume control is using the phone's volume level and is too loud at level 1 or Muted at zero grrr... (If you line-in mode there are softer sound options for a wisper using both volume controls via speaker and device separately.)EQ is a joke; Bass mode is muffled highs Voice mode may be good for something I don't use it and normal is where it stays. Use sound EQ on your device if you have the option to.Lastly I haven't used the TF card yet although I'm interested.  It's Not the Insane speaker the overly-hyped reviews on YT lead on to believe. There are lots of other BASS inclined Speaker options to choose from depending you desire. And just this may be what you need depending your intented use and expectations. I definitely would recommend this for Work or Play; just not home theater or think it will Bump your neighbors' dishes off the tables and call the cops. Get yourself a cheap Home stereo kit with a Center channel and cheap (or expensive Velodyne) powered-subwoofer instead. You'll be happier at home that way. Hope my honesty helps you
5,I love how great the sound quality is for this speaker the bass is amazing and you can feel it’s vibrations on the table. I love how it comes with a strap that is very easy to put on and the battery life is pretty great. I used it while working on the kitchen and it can be heard throughout the whole house
3,It had great sound and very good bass
5,This speaker is a beast. Sound quality is amazing. Has long battery life and suitable for indoors and outdoors. I’ve found out that to get the most controll over volume use it with the auxiliary cord. That allows more volume controll so you can turn it down very low. On Bluetooth mode volume 1 is a bit too high for the room at nighttime especially because I live in an apartment and don’t want to disturb others.The strap is super strong with adjustable length and easy to clip on and off allowing versatility and flexibility.Pretty much waterproof. I used it on a beach where the waves were splashing against it and it held up with no distortion whatsoever.It has weight but not too much to be an hassle to carry around plus the straps make it easy whether I'm walking or biking. I use the straps to attach it to my bike while biking and it holds firmly.Overall great experience so far. I love it. Great job Zealot. 5 out of 5 star rating. A happy customer 😁
5,Impressive design and great sound quality
5,It sounds great.  Good for indoors or outdoors entertainment.
5,I had a great Tribit speaker small but great. I purchased a smaller version of this speaker - then upgraded to this one. The reason I wanted this one was the USB port to plug in a thumb drive with downloaded music. This upgraded speaker is Ahhh-mazing. The sound quality even compared to my favorite small speaker is phenomenal… loud base not crackly legit sounds awesome. I am impressed. I have not played with the settings. This product far exceeded my expectations. And the price for the quality is spot on.
5,It's amazing the quality is very good I love this speaker
5,Amazing sound quality
5,Sound is REALLY nice. Very good quality. Well worth the money! The different sound settings is nice for different songs and definitely enhances the experience!  Would definitely buy another
5,Great sound quality and VERY loud. I highly recommend this to anyone who plans on having an outdoor party or just wants a nice emotive speaker inside their home.
5,I love all MusiBaby speakers!! They’re on the same level as JBL to me. Highly recommended!! 💯💪🏾
5,I love this speaker so much. I would definitely recommend. Easy to set up use and has great volume.
5,Speaker is very well built. Very good sound all around.
5,I bought this product recently and got it yesterday. The speaker is heavy with great sound quality. I have already played for at least 6-7 hours and I don't think I need to charge it frequently. Thanks
5,Perfect sound and quality built speaker. Perfect job on This one!!!!
4,The sound is big and clear!
3,Too bass heavy and makes the sound muddy and unlistenable.  Constant blue blinking light that you cant turn off.  EQ didnt fix the sound issues listening to full range Rock/Blues/Jazz music.I returned.
5,This Zealot S67 Bluetooth speaker is a substantial and powerful speaker with 75 watts of power.  Personally I like listening to classic rock and the bass on this speaker is great.  There are 2 bass woofers and a tweeter for a full sound.  You can make some adjustments to the sound profile using the equalizer button.  The control panel is lighted easy to read and operate. If you like to listen loud it is easy to take outside with the included detachable strap and you can crank up the volume and there is no noticeable distortion.  If it begins to rain no problem since it is water-resistant but should not be submerged. It was easy to connect to my Android phone and I was able to listen to music news and podcasts and it can be used at distances of up to 100 feet from the source.  If you would like to listen to your own playlists there are inputs for USB thumb drives and Micro SD cards.  It even takes phone calls.  The 5v output can be used to charge other devices such as your smartphone or tablet. The aux output lets you connect to other devices with the included audio cable.  The 14400 mAh battery lasts for a long time between charges. For approximately $ 100 it is a great buy.
5,The Zealot speaker Definitely feels sturdy and well-made and has a great sound. I like my speakers to really put out high-quality sound not only in volume but in bass as well. The speaker has good volume and good base neither of which distort the sound coming out making me happy on this purchase. Speaker is about the size of a small football and when you pick it up you can really feel that it is solid. It has a base on the bottom so it stands up nicely on a table or countertop. I gave this five stars for sound quality and battery life and three stars for water resistant only because I believe it can take splashes of water but I wouldn’t go submerging it in water it’s definitely not waterproof in that respect. But I think if some water got on it it would be just fine. I don’t really plan to test that out but as long as you’re careful I think you’ll really be happy with the sound quality of the speaker. I’d buy again.
5,It's very sofisticated beautiful expensive looking speaker. It will fit  any furniture in the house.  The quality is stunning clear crispy sound with rich bass. I'm very satisfied with this product after several months of usage.
5,The bass on the speakers sounds awesome! Easy to use and great quality definitely a must buy.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Definitely liked it’s stereo sound capability ease to set up and use extended battery life and convenience (the strap and weather resistance).Sound quality seems average when compared to similar devices but reasonable for its price range and other features.
5,Awesome speaker!!! Very loud with great deep punchy bass!! Love how it has different EQ modes!! Definitely will recommend to friends and family!!!
5,Muy buen sonido
5,We just received our speaker and were very impressed overall.  This thing is a powerful speaker and definitely delivers bang for your buck!  We are taking it with us on our upcoming beach vacation and will update if we incur an issues.  This thing looks solid though and I think it will be awesome.
5,This little speaker packs a surprise did not expect it to sound as good as it does this is by far the best little speaker I have owned.
5,From the slick packaging to the look/feel and especially the sound this thing literally booms high quality. I just unboxed it and took it to the park with my family. I can't believe how good this thing sounds and how in physics name does this fairly compact speaker achieve such booming bass? Totally satisfied with my purchase and excited about all the fun musical memories our family will make with this awesome speaker.
5,This speaker has a fantastic sound!
5,I was surprised at how loud it can get. Build quality is good. Love that it comes with an aux cable and charging cable. The sound is nice and crisp. Looking forward to buying another to pair the for stereo sound.
5,This speaker is amazing. The sound quality is excellent and can go load enough to use for a party outside.When using the speaker outside it rained lightly and did not damage or affect the speaker whatsoever which is a huge plus.I would definitely recommend this speaker to a friend
5,Very good speaker for the price. Love it love it love it!  Bass is good for its size.  I use 15 inch subwoofers for our business but for a portable speaker the bass if good enough and more.  Compared to our Bose sound touch speaker which is not portable it really gives it a good match.I had an issue with my order and after sending my concern through amazon messaging they emailed me back and resolved the issue in hours maybe even minutes.  That is GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE.  I am very impressed!
5,Very easy to use with excellent sound quality. Handy carrying strap.
5,Very Good
5,Amazing speaker and everyone loves it and the sound carries
5,Great product
5,Great sound and the battery life is amazing! Do not under estimate this product!!!!
5,Just received my Zealot speaker yesterday and have fully charged per instructions.  It came charged over 50%.  Connectivity was a breeze… turn it on and wait for your device to identify… done.  As for sound quality… far exceeds my expectations.  This is my “go to” speaker for indoor and outdoor situations.  This speaker has a really big sound.  I’ve tried all 3 EQ settings and I’ll stick with the normal state… subwoofer state is good but I don’t need that much bass.  The vocal state would be great for movie sound.  Range is really good… have not done a technical test with actual distances but I’ve went well over 50’ with ZERO drops.  I have not and will not conduct an intentional water proof test.  This speaker resembles the footprint of the similar JBL at a considerable lower price.  I’ve heard the JBL and if there is any quality difference it was hardly noticeable.
5,This speaker works great and it performs as advertised.  Very easy to use.  Specifications state a 10 meter bluetooth range but I had a good connection at 60' unobstructed.  Has 3 EQ settings which I like because I personally don't feel like fine tuning extensively all the time when using a speaker outside - just toggle a button.  Plenty of volume for my needs and it is easy to use.  I've had it for just a few weeks but so far I am very pleased.
5,What a awsome speaker! The speaker is just the right size! Sounds amazing powerfull base and it has an equilizer  on it for your own tastes! Bluetooth parred with my phone with no issues. You can pair it with onther Zealot speaker for more stereo sound! Also the leather strap for it looks great! Just a great speaker I am very happy with my purchase!!
5,We had a party and used the Bluetooth speaker. I'm so glad I bought it. This is the one to buy. We love it. Very loud
5,
4,So far the speaker has good mobility with the strap good volume good tone quality and excellent over value.
5,I haven't fully tested it yet. Because I haven't turned it up because I have close neighbors 😐 but from what I could hear it is a beast! I currently have five other Bluetooth speakers and this one puts them to shame as far as bass. I have a Damson Vulcan and it's solid and very bass heavy! But Zealot 67s don't care. Damson Vulcan 30watts compared to 75 watts..... No contest. It's like wearing a car with subs on your shoulder. Bigger than any JBL extreme.
3,I returned it cuz when its playing lights is blinking And more issues
5,the sound quality is excellent the bass is very good you can feel it rumble and bluetootooth  type plays perfectly with my bose speaker th t plugs directly into the tv theres no delay in  the two speakers I'd recmmend this speaker
5,works wonderful i'm really pleased with the sounds thanks.
5,I am very pleased with this purchase mostly because of the price drops leading to and on Prime Day. Original price with tax 82$ and change. ON PRIME DAY with tax 55$ and change. NICE!!!So I have 2 speakers I expected them to connect and play simultaneously. They both are connected to my phone but only one will play at a time. When reading the directions I noticed it said left and right speakers. So my understanding is that they will not play together simultaneously but may be more useful as a duo as a surround sound system for a TV or a computer. ***Not useful for making music louder or to have one speaker in one room and the other in another room playing the same song at the same time.***Kinda disappointed but great deal. Highly recommended
5,It gets really loud and has great bass. The fact that it's wireless and waterproof makes it that much better
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                           Buen altavoz lo compraré otra vez su sonido es muy potente y bueno
5,Es Fascinante
5,Este es un hermoso parlante para escuchar la buena música nítida y de buen volumen me gusto se los recomiendo
5,Very loud And awesome bassLong battery lastingGreat material made
5,Wow I wasn't expecting this speaker to be as amazing as it is....its really a beast!Larger than I was expecting but not too big either.  The carry strap is nice (and you could also switch out the strap for another longer one if you wanted to.The equalizer options are a nice feature also for sure...as most speakers dont have this.  Haven't tested the waterproofing but I don't think it will have any issue there.Really good deal for the price I'd say!The only thing I don't love is that the buttons all flash while music is playing.
5,Lo utilizaré en mi trabajo
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Solid but can benefit from a better eq since it’s bass heavy. Astonishing sound when paired. Great on its own!
5,Sound is awesome
5,Great speaker!  So happy we bought it
5,An amazing sound easy to pair and a great value. I love the speaker. It's portable but on the larger side but the strap helps the portability.
4,Excellent clear sound and easy to operate. Yes it can get very loud. Only complaint tho minor is on the other hand it has limited ability to play quietly. If you want to use something like this in a quiet environment look elsewhere. For me I like the overall clarity of sound.
4,11/2/2021Pros: still worksCons: has one or two volume settings without pissing off your nieghbor. But the worst part is the highest setting doesnt piss him off enough. I heard him knock and through the wall he spoke to me this is one evil sob he said.. "your last speaker at least prevented me from sleeping."He has now won the war. Out of embarrassment I just.. drop it.. fumbling out the door to get in my uber going straight to my moms.One drop of concrete one well heard jab from a neighbor and a broken heart egg made the omlette of my speaker soul look like that pictured.I'm upset n its easily blamable on my lack of thick skin sure but Zealot has just as much fault!NOTE: They have you review when having its warranty activated most people like me would want it activated before touching it its why you see a lot of good reviews.Sound n bass both not as well as the Motion Boom previously referred to although the sound quality i feel is better.
5,Very powerful and loud for its size. A good buy.
5,I didn't really expect much since most off brand speakers I've used have disappointed me. Not the Zealot though. From the moment inpulled it from the Box and felt its weight I could tell this was a quality build. Then I turned it on. Connection was seamless and it connects very quickly eventide thereafter. As for sound I could not belive how loud it is and in my opinion it sounds amazing although the bass setting is a bit too deep for my taste  but I'm not a bass guy to begin with. Since I'm the type of guy who kites to test claims that I feel are exaggerated intooknit into the shower and left it at my feet for the duration of 15 minutes. It played great the whole time and still sounded amazing afterward. Then there is the battery life  it's like the energizer rabbit... it just keeps going and going. Great job with this build folks you did an amazing job.
5,Resistan qualité sonore top
5,J'aurais aimé que le volume baisse un peu plus le son reste fort mais je suis très satisfaite wow je ne regrette pas mon achat
5,Súper sonido y duración de batería
4,Pros:-  Volume: The speaker is very loud. In order to be able to speak at normal conversation volume you'll need your volume on 10 or 20 at 30 you'll have to start talking louder and louder. In an outdoor setting I think this would excel. For indoor it's pretty overkill unless your goal is not to be able to hear your guests or you set it on the far side of your mansion.- Build Quality: This is a very aesthetically pleasing speaker. It looks nice feels nice and has a nice weight to it.Cons:- Sound Quality: The EQ modes on this speaker are an absolute joke. The first mode enhances voices which I think would only be usefully for audiobooks which I highly doubt the vast majority of people will be listening to through this speaker. The second mode is normal and third is "bass enhance". The bass enhance mode makes all the highs and mids sound very very muted. Like it absolutely destroys the sound quality so it's useless. You'll only use this speaker in normal mode.Also the overall sound quality is only OK. The speakers are front firing and the woofers are side firing. This means you must place the speaker against a wall or have it to the side of the area of music. When you do this the woofers just don't sound great blasting out the sides. This speaker has good highs but the quality of bass and mids are not good unfortunately.
4,Great speaker for a decent price! I bought another “bigger name brand” speaker and it didn’t pass my personal tests.The half way point for volume is more then sufficient for loud sound! But with that said I feel like the lowest setting for volume could be lower… Bass is great but does get distorted when at higher volumes.Highly recommended when coupons are available!The brown leather strap is going to be the first thing to go but I’m sure anyone can use imagination to make a new handle if need be!
4,It's a large speaker but the sound quality is very good the EQ is a nice feature. I use it mostly at my cottage outside by the fire with my playlist from my phone sounds great outdoors. I get lots of compliments!!
1,If you want any sort of resolution or clarity do not buy this speaker horrible
5,Buena estética duradera y fácil de transportar una gran bocina. La compré para ir con mis amigos de viaje a la playa y fue perfecta. Lo que hice fue quitarle la agarradera (facil de remover ya que se desatornilla y se vuelve a ajustar sin problemas) y la cambié por una cinta más larga para colgármela en el hombro y resultó sumamente cómoda para escuchar mientras camino en la playa con mis amigos ya llevamos un par de viajes que nos la llevamos. Me gustaría que sea un poco más potente pero para el precio no podría pedir nada más. Recomendada.
5,This is worth to buy the loud is really loud the bass is punchy
5,Excellent son
5,I really the full sound you get.It is to me better sound wise than my Doss XL.You can probably use this guy ata party for for dozens of folksPair them up and you have excellent sound system and probably get the cops banging on your door.the only bad thing for me is that i like may rock loud but not as loud  and clear and as this.Best 85 bucks  spent this year.
5,Perfect!!
5,Le speaker sonne très fort au volume max idéal pour les grosse soirée. La batterie dure très longtemps. Ce speaker égalise les grande marque!!Plus que parfait pour ce prix.
1,Good sound and bass but:Level 1 volume is very quiet level 2 is drastically louder…There is no disconnect button you have to disconnect whatever phone was already connected to it which can be a pain at times in certain situations…
5,So far so good! Great sound quality! I’ve used it for about a week and have yet to charge it! Thumbs up!
5,Good sound. Easy Bluetooth connection. Worked right out of the box pairing to my phone. Got this with a $15 instant rebate so great value.
1,Good sound and bass but:Level 1 volume is very quiet level 2 is drastically louder…There is no disconnect button you have to disconnect whatever phone was already connected to it which can be a pain at times in certain situations…
5,Portátil y potente
5,Amazing speaker for the money! Easy to connect to. Great sound even outdoors!
4,Dommage que le mode de fonctionnement ne soit pas dans les deux langues soit; français
5,Je suis très satisfaite le son est super toute est correct que de bon commentaire
5,Great speaker! Sound is incredible. Very happy with this purchase!
1,Over all is not good quality
1,Je l.utilise a tout les jours et avant de finir mon entraînement le speaker ferme et je le charge a chaque utilisation la batterie es pourris je ne vous le conseille pas dutout
5,Agréablement surprise par rapport à la qualité du son surtout dans le mode EQ orange (basse )-Le son est un peu trop fort pour le mode normal juste à diminuer le volume.Superb produit 👍
1,Battery ruins out fast. I wanted to send it back but I threw out all the packaging. Use it as home speaker because it needs to be charged so frequently
5,Beautiful blue tooth speaker amazing rich sound. It's a speaker your neighbors may not appreciate as much as do. FIVE STAR REVIEW
5,Love this speaker
5,
5,Love the portability  sound quality and battery  life
5,When it comes to sound quality I am extremely picky. Just to have an idea I have the BOSE Companion 5 for my PC and the Logitech Z-5500 for my home theatre. For a portable sound system I needed something that has extremely good quality sound loud and very good bass. I have all these for now. Even the battery life is very good. Even the built quality is good. It doesn't feel cheap at all. Good job manufacturer. I 100% recommend it.
5,This is a great speaker.  It has good sound and a few eq options.
5,Ad says battery lasts 40 hours! I'd be lucky to get 25 hours at half volume! Other than that I like it! Stays in Blu tooth mode when ubturn on and off and starts music at full volume!
5,Been playing this in my backyard. I’ve had a lot of people complementing it.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 So far so good. Killed the battery so charging it up. Has great weight so build quality seems good. Sound quality is nice with good driver size for wattage output.
1,Didn’t come with a charging block we had it plugged in with a 5V block for 3 days - nearly melted the blocks it ran them so hot. Died within an hour of using it. Sound quality was great but perhaps ours was defective?
1,Sound is not that great as expected battery backup is nice but need to be sound good as its a speaker.
2,I really wanted to keep this speaker nice look sound was decent. It took 12hrs. to charge it from 70% to100% . It played for about 5-6 hrs at medium-low sound level then it shut off and kept saying low battery and to charge it even though it was still had 40% battery remaining. Again it took forever to charge and kept going up and down from 80-90-100% charge so I had to return it.
5,Just got it delivered. So far so good.
5,Used the speaker at work very long battery life especially if left at lower volume which is still very clear sounding fairly long range for Bluetooth I bike to work with it in my bag and even after my bag is wet the speaker still functions fine all round great speaker.
5,
5,Amazing sound . I love it
5,Sounds great with lots of bass!!
2,Update..bought this speaker 2 weeks ago. Wanted to buy another. The price has increased 20$$ Greed equals downgraded review! Great speaker sound gets a bit distorted at high level..but so do most. Good weight to it. Will probably buy another to pair it.
5,
5,I like that it came with all the cords
5,Wow vraiment un très bon speaker le son est EXCELLENT .. je l’utilise au travail et super ..
5,
5,I got it at a steal first of all and out the box i was blown away. Couldn’t ever be labeled as simple as just an “off brand speaker”. Great sound great base great build quality and GREAT PRICE. (For me anyway lol prime day babyy!)
2,Work great inside for a few hours - sound was great functioned as it should. Then paired two together and after 20min started  skipping so turned both off unpaired used only one and it started skipping so turned that off and used the second one same  --- in and out with sound so turned off everything.... Changed the Bluetooth device and within  15 seconds started skipping --- not fun on a Saturday night sitting around with friends
5,Perfect speaker for gazebo beach cabana etc.  Little disappointed that bluetooth connectivity isn't as easy as other speakers but overall I'd buy this product again.
5,Rien a redire  tout est juste parfait super contente de mon achat
1,J'écoute ma musique préférée à l'extérieur et il a une belle qualité de sons
5,Sound quality is fair has three settings for EQ and 1 and 3 are terrible essentially unusable as 1 is extreme treble and 3 is so much bass it is about a quarter less volume. But 2 is perfect nice and loud nice and clear semi bassy. For the money a really great speaker overall! It's pretty loud
5,
5,Bought it because my uncle has had it for like 5-7 years and its Absolutely amazing. Now tgat i have it  just confirms how great the quality is  for a crazy steal of a price . Speaker is so loud on a low volume. Its like a surround system. Great for BBQ  anythiing big and small
5,Maison et activité extérieure
5,Absoluetly worth it for the price !I underestimated it at first but it's an absolut beast!The sound is clear with no interferance really loud (can be put a in a very large living room and every onw will hear it).I really like the equalizer fonction too can be set as a subwoofer usefull with the ability of having two of these connected at the same time (that's a feature too).Recommend it !
5,
5,Really great speaker it's really good quality and amazingly loud
5,Nice sound and volume long lasting battery
5,Love it and not much bad to say yet
5,sa fait sur ma mote
5,Great value a little distortion but it's a very good overall speaker
5,great sound good price and fast delivery! what more could you ask for.
1,Defective product  I should had listening to the other reviews battery doesnt charge. waist of time -
5,Awesome sounding speaker for the price point. Proof you don't have to drop $300 to get quality sound. I'd recommend it.
5,One of the best products I've ever bought off Amazon
5,Loud good built
1,I bought this to take to my camp 2 months ago. Now I am at camp and it is not working. I connected it to 3 bluetooths and it's not working. Sadly it is past time to return because I never opened it to use until now. I would not recommend this product. It it quite pricey not to work.
1,Bass sounds like a fartdies very quicky4 months old and now it wont turn on again.WOULD NOT RECOMMEND
4,Great sound. Loud speaker. Good quality. Great battery
5,Superbe son
4,Very loud. It’s a little distorted when you get it up to 75% and higher. Great speaker for the price .The lasts a long time. I would definitely recommend this product. It’s very comparable to JBL
5,Le son est très bon. La batterie dure longtemps. Très bon achat pour le prix
5,Awesome speaker good built. Very happy with the prod.
4,Me gustó el sonido por medio de Bluetooth pero no por la entrada auxiliar. lo necesito para el interior de mi casa
4,Excellent pour le prix
5,
5,Originally bought it for work but it’s a little too nice for work
5,My only concern is the battery would last longer
3,It's loud but too much bass
3,Had this speaker for about a month had a great sound and decent range. Battery life kinda sucks but if your using it in a home or work environment it's fine. After a month it just refused to pair to anything not sure why. There isn't alot of forums about this specific brand. Now I'm just left with disappointment and a blinking blue light. Sad panda
4,Bon dans l'ensemble.
5,Very powerful speaker. Bass response is really nice and the volume carries through my entire room and volume is set very low too! I use this for streaming music movies and gaming and it's more than what I need. Highly recommended!
4,Bon dans l'ensemble.
4,[new post]I've had an opportunity to revisit a newer version of this speaker and there have been some updates to it since the last time I tried it out I'm back to update my review.Firstly I would like to thank Kim at Zealot for reaching out and listening to my concerns and working on updating their speaker to be able to provide the best quality speaker possible.  Although in my new review you will find my likes and dislikes I've encountered with the new speaker I have changed my rating of this product from 3 stars to 4 stars.  One thing that stands out from any other company is that they really go above and beyond to make sure customers are satisfied with their purchases.  I commend them for their diligence and commitment to strive for excellence and would be happy dealing with them again knowing that my feedback is valued.[updates]- New adjustable over the shoulder carry strap.  The old leather handle looked nice but this new update makes the speaker more versatile to carry around and heavy duty clasps for a secure hold.- Improved bluetooth connection.  Older version I tried multiple devices sitting right next to the speaker and it noticeably cut in and out making it unenjoyable and unusable.  This issue has been fixed.  The product information says 100 feet of connection range without distortion I got about 40-50 feet with this new one before range starts cutting out.  But let's be honest there's no real reason anyone would need to be that far when using something like this so it's not a major deal breaker.- Adjusted sound.  This is a negative and a positive:Negative because it no longer has the rich deep bass sound I originally liked about it.  The EQ has 3 settings the only useable one I found is the 1st setting which is Flat.  The 2nd one the bass boost does not boost the bass but instead cuts out the high and mid frequencies which makes it sound muffled.  The 3rd setting is the opposite of the 2nd setting it boosts the mids and highs so it becomes excessively loud.  Probably more use in a setting where you have the speaker set far away from where you are possibly like a beach or park.A positive of the new sound (and probably the reason for adjusting the low end range) is that it no longer distorts at high volumes.  I was happy to find that I can listen to this at moderate volumes and full volume and the sound stayed in tact.After spending a few days with this new updated speaker I would be happy to own this product.  I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a portable speaker solution that aesthetically looks nice with some good features and decent sound.  It lasts about 24hrs on a full charge and has a 14400mAH battery to charge devices while using it on the go.[previous post]I really wanted this speaker to work out at first glance the build quality of it is solid and it's aesthetically pleasing looks better than 99% of speakers on the market today.  This speaker has some weight it feels good looks good I was very excited to try it out.  On low moderate volumes this sounds really nice and full bodied with rich bass.However Higher loud and max volumes the bass doesn't hold well and distorts.  The physical sound of the speaker itself is just as loud as the music.  I figured if I can't use it for a loud speaker I can enjoy it for chill relax listening.  I was skimming through different songs while testing it out but when I let a full song play through the bluetooth connection became choppy.  I was within 10 ft. of the speaker and the sound was cutting in and out.  I tried to being closer and sat next to it and it was still cutting in and out tried with my iPhone iPad MacBook all with the same result.  Instruction booklet is minimal barely explains how to operate the device let alone any troubleshooting on anything or if it's a possible firmware issue.  Comes with a warranty card but not a good feeling when you have to think about using it 5 minutes after unboxing.If the manufacturer tightens up the quality of sound on higher volumes + provide a stable bluetooth connection I would definitely revisit this speaker as a serious contender and would be satisfied to purchase it again but at current time I experienced many red flags (imo) that I have decided to return it and continue searching for a speaker.

5,Love this stereo the sound is awesome. I would recommend this to everyone

5,This speaker does an excellent job whether you see listening to music or enjoying a podcast. It's very loud while minimizing the noise.  The unit itself is heavy which indicates it is built very well. I will definitely be getting a second one so I can use them in tandem (stereo!!!). I am zealous for Zealot Speakers!
