4,Because this can go either horizontally or vertically I am able to have my battery charger in the top outlet and then have this in the bottom outlet going horizontally to then use it for my phone charge cord and still have six more usable electrical outlets as well as two more computer outlets.
5,Love it .one of the best so far
5,Use for my grandson‚Äôs game console and laptop
5,It works great
4,I had a bigger outlet of this same replaced with this because of the compact size. Big fan this is very stable no ‚Äúrocking‚Äù.
5,Excellent travel companion
4,I like the versatility of having extra electric outlets and a phone charger all in one. Great for my guests when they come to visit.
5,Great
5,Perfect fit!
3,I liked all the options on the strip. Seemed like the answer to my one outlet in the bathroom. When attaching an appliance using one the plugs  you have to stabilize the strip in the outlet. Feels like it is coming our.  I have had another similar strips that included a plastic 3 prong mock plug that fits in the other holes on the outlet stabilizing the strip.
4,Needed more outlets
5,This power strip will be useful anywhere we need it in the house and in our motorhome as needed.
5,i can connect with odd and overshaped plugs.
4,Nice solid made power strip. The mobility action allows me to free up valuable counter space.Like the additional USB ports.
5,It does what the advertisement says its strong and reliable
5,Great for traveling. Can keep track of all your electronics in one place
5,I didn‚Äôt dislike this at all  it‚Äôs all it did all it said it would.
5,I have about six of these and I travel to meet my clients with one. I love this surge protector I have it in every room of my Apt
5,Works just like stated.  I love power strips/cords with usb and regular electrical ports.
5,USB ports are low voltage
5,Good to have
5,We had a six plug extension cord with wires all over to plug in/charge various electronics.  This eliminates the need for the chord is a surge protector and moves ugly wires to a less visible location.  i am very pleased.
5,Awesome
4,Thought this would be good it‚Äôs a good idea but wouldn‚Äôt stay plugged in and one part didn‚Äôt work.
5,This is my 3rd. one  It is so versatile and meets many needs including USB charging
5,Great price and so useful that we have 2.
5,Like the versatility of the plug.  The fact that it also has USB ports is a plus.
5,This item is a perfect fit for a tight space. I love the swivel aspect. I was using an extension cord that was inconvenient not attractive in the space. Did away with the extension cord when I got this.  So far so goodüëçüèª
5,Power strip with surge protection is wonderful.  This one is the best we have found on the market.Linda
5,A great space saver for wall plugs and USB powered devices!
4,It works.  Reliability unknown.  A bit speedy.
5,Delivery. was.  A1. CUTE OUTFITS
5,Great item used for my bathroom vanity. It really does so much by charging my shaving razor and my toothbrush.
4,Worth the money
5,Loved the way you can put it into a single outlet and how you can turn the socket up or down. well made and love that you can put a USB in it.
3,Used the Swivel Power to have more outlets in the kitchen AND have outlets to recharge phone and iPad.  When I took it out of the package I noticed the housing would not stay together on it there‚Äôs a big noticeable crack up the side and around the bottom.  It does its job just fine but it is unsightly.  I was still ok with it until I saw the same item in my local Lowe‚Äôs for the same price and an intact housing that looks fine.  But I‚Äôve spent my money on this one.
5,My plug in my apartment bathroom is upside down. Why? I don't know.  This allows me to use it correctly while having USB to charge my phone or fitbit. Bought one for the sideways plug in the kitchen .
5,It seems that everything and everyone in my house wants to rapid charge EVERYTHING on the kitchen counter.There's times when one person was unpluging another persons item that was being charged.....and this was causing major problems.So now since I bought this swivel power cord there hasn't been any problems between family members... thank goodness!Plus the "rapid charge" feature is definitely a plus.  Everyone loves that and I do too.Being able to swivel it is also a handy feature.  So many electronics come with a large plug that covers 2 outlets.  So having "extra" outlets is a life saver.  This power strip is definitely a life saver.I highly recommend this power strip!!!
2,When I plugged in a toaster and a standard drip coffee maker it trips the switch every time when both are on. This is by far the worst option for adding additional devices to a standard outlet. The 3.1A USB ports failed to charge devices as quickly as other 3.1A USB ports on my computer and various USB hubs. This product does not do what it says it does.
5,I bought this to use in hotel rooms while traveling because you can plug your computer phone and whatever else in at one place.  Very convenient.
5,Bt let‚Äôs see how long it will last for.
5,All of office equipment (computer monitors printer phone etc) can be connected to the power strip.  I may need to purchase another one for the gaming room....
5,I didn't have the problem that others have reported of the unit sagging down and refusing to stay in the upright position.  The combination of electrical and USB is innovative and welcome.
4,Granddaughter uses it in her room as she can plug in her phone and use the outlets for her nightstand light and clock without any issue.
5,The cordless design allows for a clean look and works perfectly when multiple devices are plugged in. Even when I have had every single outlet in use all of the devices charged perfectly. I particularly liked its minimalistic design and modern look. It is incredibly well made at an affordable price. The other outlet also works while the Swivel Power is plugged in. I am definitely adding three more to my cart after I finish this review. If I could add a sixth star. Overall if you are looking for a good quality power multiplier then you should 1000% purchase this product.
5,After purchasing this single item I saw the exact item on the Amazon website offered as two for the same price as I paid for one.  I wish I had known that before purchasing this item. Disappointed in Amazon!
5,Took this on a trip and was able to plug many things into this without looking all over the room for multiple outlets. Will keep this in my travel bag. Love it so much purchased one for our bedroom as well. Will recommend purchasing for sure
5,It‚Äôs so practical for small spaces
4,I like this (and the idea) and needed it for bathroom outlets. However I have to swivel it 45 degrees (upward with plug toward the bottom) but the device is so thick it separates from the outlet when I plug something in (so I push it back in although it's still loose).
5,Provides both powers for USB devices and 110 VAC devices.  The USB output is high power and made it possible to charge my phone in 1/0 the time.
4,this item works as described. easily swivels. accepts numerous cords.
5,I have a decent sized bathroom where I also have my washer and dryer. Problem is there are only two sets of plugs and with the iron the blow dryer the electric toothbrush the flosser‚Ä¶well you get the drift there was y oo much plugging and unplugging going on and it was driving me nuts. This alleviated all of that. Not to mention I can now charge my phone and watch while in the shower without missing a beat
5,Works great and gets rid of all the clutter.  Good buy
5,I have 5 of them now great product
4,Holds lots of plugs
4,I loved this when I first bought it.  I was able to charge my iphone 7 in one of the phone connectors.  But my new iphone 12 does not fit in the phone connectors and I have to use the regular plugs.
5,This product is great especially for someone who doesn't have much space or many outlets. Works great for a coffee or tea station. Excellent to use to charge our many electronics. I have mine close to my bed.
5,Value for money
5,I now have a designated place for our phones and iPads to be charged! It‚Äôs great!
3,I like the fact that this multi-use swivel power strip does the job for different types of gadgets.  The only thing is that it's cheaply made and the cover comes lose easily.
5,I wanted a item that I could plug all my electronics at once. This does the job!
5,It's out of the way takes up little space and offers many connections.  I love it.  Will definitely buy it again.
5,Convenient
5,Love that it can be turned up down and side to side
5,The item does exactly what it says. Great buy
5,Easy to manipulate and fit into your space. Handy to have USB outlets.
5,I originally got one of these for the home office but quickly realized it would be great when traveling.  I now keep one in my backpack when I travel.  I found it very helpful when a hotel room has limited outlets available.
4,No real experience yet still getting used to the system.
5,Great item
5,Love this product
5,Great.....Agift for someone else....
3,No problems charging with it but the housing started to separate just after a few uses.  I had to superglue it back
5,Great versitility blends into room works well blew circuit breaker once but I ran a 1600 watt heater. Understandable sustained service at 500W. Re ordered 6 more for other properties I own
5,I love it it works don‚Äôt have to go looking for the little gadgets it‚Äôs worth the money to me.
4,I like all the plug that it rotated
3,Ordered 2. 1 didn't fit together right works ok.
5,Powerful and safe.
5,Versatility
5,I love everything about this product. I feel safe plugging in multiple things into this unit and love that I can charge up to three devices. I'm happy with this purchase.
5,Connecting several items in family room and den.
5,Have used  4 of these throughout our house.
5,Just what I needed for computer and printers
5,works well-serves it purpose.
4,Work great for what I needed it for a little wobbly while it‚Äôs plugged in
5,The product is very easy to use!
5,This device worked exactly as shown in its TV commercials. Very helpful in a compact condo kitchen with limited work space. Very helpful product.
5,I have many all are well built and reliable
5,Would order again
5,Amazingly handy little product.
5,I take this with me when I travel because even the best hotel rooms don‚Äôt have enough of the right kind of sockets where I want them. Recently used this for the first time and was very pleased with it.
5,Very good purchase does what it says about it like all outlets but not all the cords hang from it. Should have had place to hide the cords
5,did the job
5,perfect for space
5,Works great but would like the plug part to be moved around BEFORE you plugged it in.  Was on a cruise and needed it to do that.  Was a little disappointed but will love it for home next to my bed...
5,Good addition to wall outlet
5,Loved it it is just as advertised !
5,works great  may order more in future
5,Multiple iPhones and laptops.
3,USB ports do not work
5,Had a small outlet area to fit the plug worked perfectly. Very convenient to be able to move the power strip so that all the plugs fit.
5,I use it to connect my clock.  I will be ordering more
5,Used to connect various tech items.  Elegant  enough to be seen by anyone !
3,I had the item for a few months and everything was good.  One day my sone plugged in his phone to charge in the USB port.  After a while his phone starting making a loud sound and when he checked it said it was drawing too much power.  It wound up melting his phone.  He has to buy a new phone.
5,Highly recommend!
5,It works well for me
5,Easy to use and love having 3 USB plugs along with outlet.
5,I used it to charge my phone AND to use my ceiling lamp. Great innovation!
5,It worked out GREAT!.. LL
3,I was unable to use this because I needed it to swivel 180 degrees to make the plug upside down. It will only swivel left or right 90 degrees.
5,Good for use
5,So far it‚Äôs been perfect. I don‚Äôt need a surge protector and it holds my watch phone and I pad. Plus I have normal plugs for my clock. It‚Äôs up off the floor too so it doesn‚Äôt take up space. It does exactly what it says it does.
5,This product was such a great investment for my family and I it was use so much for virtual schooling that was taking place in our home
5,My vanity finally is uncluttered!
3,Not all outlets worked; design was useful
5,I truly enjoy the multiple items plug in once placed.  Plus the safety of a surge protector.  Fantastic I ABSOLUTELY LOVE it.
5,Excellent!! You can plug a lot of cables
5,These are even more versatile than described.  I have several and have given as a gift.  Space saving and handy.
5,Excellent device
5,Perfect xmas gift for my son.
5,I needed something to be able to plug in Five things in one area. This was perfect.
5,Love the USB ports. Saves a lot of room.
5,No more plugging and inplugging
5,My home is old and does not have many outlets.  One in the kitchen has a light switch to the right and two outlets all on the same outlet plate.  Sometimes this is just not enough!  With this swivel surge I am able to use my toaster crockpot and microwave all on the swivel surge protector.
5,Works great
3,I would buy it again for the value
5,Perfect for the $ & soOo much easier for Charging‚ù§Ô∏èüíï
5,I would prefer the cord to be longer.
5,Perfect for my kitchen counter with phone chargers and multiple items needing plugs.
5,EZ to use very convenient buying more putting one in our truck for grandsons to use with video games phones and hot spot !!
3,Adds more outlets but.... When I plug and echo show 5" and my daughters fire tablet the tablet won't charge. The tablet is only a few months old and I'm not using the USB ports only an adaptive fast charger. So I don't recommend this item. Too bad I threw away the packaging.
5,good
3,The description said you could plug multiple devices with no issues.  I had 2 devices a curling iron and a blow dryer plugged in on it and it tripped.  It does swivel as described but useless to me if I can't use it for multiple things.
5,electronics
5,Alleviates a mess of cords...more organized.
5,I love it for all the rooms except the kitchen. High powered kitchen appliances such as microwaves air fryers or anything higher than 10 amps it's a no no.
5,Gifted my college student with one & she loves it too!
5,This item is very convenient for your needs.
2,This completely fell apart after a month and I don‚Äôt unplug and plug things in too often. I have never seen an outlet strip do this. Definitely not worth the money. I like the concept but cheaply made.
5,I like the compact and variable uses
5,My aunt got 1 of these 4 Christmas from me she took it to the outer banks N.C. vacation home Everyone using it while on vacation
5,This item is perfect for my home office. It has made me feel safe not having all of those electric cords laying on the floor.
5,Like the swivel ability
5,I love it
3,I thought I would have a good area to plug it in but in the end it looks just like the other place I had.
5,The multi socket saves space on my kitchen counter
5,Love having the extra plugs AND being able to charge electronics. So Handy!
5,Gives me more outlet choices. Great for tv and other video devices.
5,Great buy
5,Phone earbuds fanlamps all connected.
5,To plug into the wall for other cords!  There is no chord but it is versatile and  Is sturdy very convenient
5,So much Versatility.
5,These are great...I bought 2......one in bedroom and one in Bathroom at counter!!  Wonderful to finally have enough plug-ins!
5,Very good
1,After only 3 months of use the front cover is dislodging from the unit.  Seeing as I am the only one using this outlet I am disappointed that it is falling apart so soon. It‚Äôs a great convenience just not holding up after only a few months of use. I‚Äôve tried to snap it back in place but to no avail.
5,Great product. Makes it easy to plug in multiple devices!
5,Liked it‚Äôs versatility
5,Works well.
5,This looks better than a power strip when placed in certain locations. Great to have usb charging ports available.
5,Just what we were looking for. Cord could be longer.
5,Design is good. The ability to swivel in two ditrction was vital for our corner outlet.
1,The electrical outlets are still working but USB charging ports stopped working after three weeks.  I was very disappointed since the main reason I purchased  was for the charging ports.
5,The only outlet we ever found that fits in our skinny place beside the stove.
5,Easy access to one spot
5,It works great.
3,It was too big for my outlet to plug in wall
5,Good
5,This is pretty handy. Buying a couple more now. Never have enough outlets.
5,There compact so they don‚Äôt tack up so much room
5,Excellent
5,like it very much
5,Very versatile and efficient
5,A very handy item.
5,Perfect
5,It works as describe
5,Works great get one
5,It is a good product
5,Perfect
5,This was perefect for my needs
5,Very useful
1,The UBS ports do not work
1,Bought this for use in my bathroom.  Upon receipt of product read enclosed pamphlet. Learned immediately cannot be used where there is water! Bought it for use in my bathroom! Also cannot plug into it a hair dryer etc.! Returned immediately.  Too bad all the items you could not use it for was listed on Amazon. Never would have purchased it.
1,Piece of junk came broke an will not go back together. An I don't have time to be going to fed x or ups
1,The lights plugged into the unit flickered. When I touched it the unit was very hot. I unplugged and won‚Äôt be using again. If I hadn‚Äôt thrown away the packaging I would return.
1,What good is it? You can‚Äôt plug in anything! A waste of my Amex points if I would have spent cash I really would be pissed. You can‚Äôt even use it in the bathroom. It really SUCKS! Don‚Äôt buy this item!
1,Cheap fell apart when i opened the box
1,the USB chargers stopped just 1 month after the return policy expired.  Very unhappy with my purchase and the short time it lasted.
1,Once I added the plugs it fell off of the wall
1,This plug is not durable. The face plate came off immediately when I plugged it in.
2,Flimsy when plugged in awkward to use
1,USB ports worked about a week then nothing!  Do not waste your money!  I pitched the box and cannot return it.
5,Pretty nice product good quality plenty of outlets and duper versatile. So far used to charge Samsung iPhone  beats  and more. No issues.
2,Product should be more sturdier.
3,I chose this one over many of the others available for 2 reasons but it seems maybe both of those end up being not true.1. this one looks a bit more 'sturdy' and has 'as seen on TV' on it so I thought it may be from a more reliable manufacturer. Given that I assumed it's 15A max like most of the plugs out there even though it wasn't specified on the web listing. Wrong! the instruction that comes with it says max of 10Amp. I wish Amazon would have made this clear. I would have skipped this if I knew.2. another reason I chose this over others is the claim it has 3000 watt surge protection while most of the other plugs claim only 1500-1600 watt. However nowhere on the packaging or instruction does it mention 3000 watt which makes me wonder where amazon gets that number and whether that's right. In fact the product does not indicate how much surge protection at all so is it even the normal 1500-1600 watt the inferior 1000-1200 or none (probably not since there's a 'protected' light on the product itself).Anyway kind of disappointed for the above reasons. This plug is also more bulky than many others and with a less modern look. oh well guess I'll learn to live with it.
4,Love the swivel as the large protruding cord from my hair dryer makes it difficult to plug into the receptacle at my sink.  Problem solved!  Turn it to the side!  USB does not charge cell phones very well.
5,This is a handy charging station to take for travel or use at home. We always have four or more devices to charge daily so this station is perfect for us. Will bring it with us when we travel!! There are never enough plugs in hotels.
5,Great product
5,Using in my F150 AC plug and it works great.  Can position it out of way when not using. Like the rotating plug.
3,Not what I expected. Kinda disappointed
5,Perfect tks...
4,liked versatility of one simple solution for multiple plugs & usb ports. wish it came in black
5,very good and works good
5,The cord should have been longer
5,Love it that my husband ordered one too
5,The swivel really makes this unit very versatile.
5,It is exactly as advertised and much more...the swiveling plug makes it WAY above any competitors.Use 4 of them around the house and have had NO issues with any of them the ac receptacles and hdmi plugs are VERY STURDY AND TIGHT NO loose plugs falling out etc.
4,I have a very limited number of outlets.  These 6 really help.
5,It does what it supposed to do
5,Used to hook up a computer cords. It got my cords and power strip off the floor. Much neater looking.
5,This is great.
3,It‚Äôs not bad. It‚Äôs just not the space saver I thought it would be because of the direction the outlets face. Anything you plug-in sticks out not down no matter what way you twist it. I think future versions should have one side with the outlets that face down. Thanks
5,I like the swevill feature as well as the multiple outlets and USB ports. Highly recommend.
5,Like the way you can put it to one side to the other
5,it is just what I needed and it shipped very quickly.  Would buy again.
5,Helps to keep the wires neat and up off the floor.
5,I love this! Everything you need in one spot. Convenient and neat.
5,Love the versatility of the product. Enables a person to bundle cords and keep them neatly in one place!
5,Love it
5,Sturdy and swivels easily when plugged into wall socket. Many cords can be plugged in at same time. It is a bit deep though.
5,Heats up the bathroom quick which is great after a bath
5,Great!
5,The best and most used power strip in the house now.
5,I love this item. Bought at a big box store and they no longer have them.  I bought a total of 3 more from Amazon to give as gifts for my grandsons.Multiple outlets and 3 USB ports .  Also it only uses one outlet!
5,Has multiple outlets plus surge protection. This is a great device to charge many different deviced
5,For some reason the plugs in my old apartment are upside down and this makes multiple use of outlet impossible This has solved my problem
5,We had a rather confined outlet and needed to plug various things into it while also providing a convenient USB outlet. This worked perfectly and the swivel feature meant it fit the restrictions of the space. It's perfect and it's a plus that it's also a surge protector.
5,Would recommend and will again purchase another name brand.  Definitely replaces some extension and strip cords..  added benefit for charging cell etc.
5,Perfect to provide additional plugs
5,Was cheaper then anywhere else I looked works great will get another one like it but with a extension so I can use it farther then the plug
5,Purchased for an outside vendor event.  Great product for the price and met all my expectations.
5,used in Office/sewing room works well.
5,I wouldn't suggest this device for travel.  But for home use yes it's very much needed if you have many appliances.
4,As expected this was a handy product. The top should be more flat or smaller as it almost covered the second outlet above it so I couldn‚Äôt use that. It would be better to not lose both plugs in the outlet.
5,Excellent design of this power strip in that it hangs down from the outlet making for a sturdy connection to the wall outlet.  The three USB outlets are perfect for multiple electronic cable types.  I use small 12 inch charging cables with various connectors and so now convenient to be able to plug in any device regardless of connector type.  If more cable types are needed then the 120 outlets may be used for other charger types.  If placed in bottom outlet top outlet is accessible.  Very pleased with this device decided to buy another.
5,Allow so many different connection very good to have
4,The outlets and USB are all good but the swivel feature is most helpful.
5,It's a gift for someone else. I haven't opened the pkg or tried it. It's just what they needed.
5,Son love it
1,Ugly
5,I say this because we only had one outlet in the bathroom and my husband has a million technical things that need recharged. Now he has enough outlets to let me have my half of the bath! So I say this is a handy item. It also has a surge protector built in...Woo-hoo!
5,No cord lengthvalue for money
5,You've seen the ads on TV - but there are quite a few power managers out there - some cheaper a few more expensive. The Bell+Howell Swivel Power has to be built well because can be twisted or swiveled to fit your needs. I found that keeping it like it is looks better and avoids having to swivel the device too much.This comes stock with a three-prong plug. If you have an older home (or 2-prong plugs) you have no choice but to have an electrician change the outlet to 3-prongs or use the device with a 3-to-2 prong adapter - which is not included. The latter isn't ideal since gravity will pull the Swivel Power device down - as well as the attached plugs.
5,I need it to be smaller. Too large for me but quality. Just not right for my space.
5,I find that it worked well in the tight place I ordered it for and was not disappointed.
5,Good quality product and offer a good alternative to a standard power strip. Very versatile. I'm enjoying mine.
5,Versatile and well made
4,Really like but still a little pricey.
5,I love this item because it's cordless and convenient... it takes up no space.
5,Many family members are able to use this product at the same time.
5,Work like it says
5,Cannot rotate 360 degrees
5,Seems like you never have enough outlets and this power strip definitely addresses this problem by providing 6 additional outlets that can be swiveled to accommodate different positions.
5,Na
5,I like the swivel feature for versatility.  I also can fit the larger plugin's side ther are two on each side.
5,I like it  GOOD FOR DIFFERENT ANGLES
5,Works great
5,Works perfect
5,very functional
5,Iam so so glad i found this so far doing great didn't know if I needed another or not  thanks about given it as a gift got Christmas..
4,Product was a gift
5,I use this in my bathroom for larger plug styles.  It works great.
4,Plug in most of my USB plug in's
5,works
5,Width is smaller than the outlet platecover but very effective.  Really like it.
5,Great product and highly recommend.  Keeps all of your cords organized!  A+++++++
5,with so many electronic devices in each family it's often to find an empty outlet for charging them.  this could be the best since cell  phones fit into your pocket.  this has 6 power outlets with many facing in different directions so no matter the shape of the plug it most likely fits in one of the plugs. It has 3 USB ports for devices as well.  These are quick charging ports and  have surge protection on all nine devices.  no household should be without one.
5,We really liked this unit. It worked great for traveling because we have to plug in phones tablets games etc. This way everyone gets a plug. The only problem was us forgetting to take it out of the wall when we left so we bought another one because we loved it so much.
5,I bought this during a summer thunderstorm. We had just one or two storms last summer but this summer has been a thunderstorm delight...I realized that my work laptop was plugged into a plain old socket. I chose this unit because of its versatility and because it's a Bell&Howell.
4,I was pleasantly surprised to find that the Swivel Power by Bell+Howell Power Strip Rapid Charging Station was exactly what it said it was. I was a little concerned to not see a UL stamp on it but I check it regularly and it is not overheating or displaying any odd issues that would concern me.The plugs and usb ports are tight keeping what's in them secureI am thinking of where else in my house I can use them.
5,I formerly had one outlet which was not enough for my needs. This outlet expander is perfect for my needs. I use it for a lamp 2 USB adapters and will accommodate additional USB cords.
5,Computer printer keyboard mouse Smartphone tablet lamp and Oxygen. One less cord is priceless.
5,This is a must if you have loose cords hanging around & you don't want the kids to trip over them then get this product. Definitely recommend this product.
5,My son loves it.
5,This is great for when we travel since we never have enough outlets in outlets in our room and this is great for our house which is an older house that doesn't have nearly enough outlets.
5,Very well made. like the ability to plug in different cord ends and USB cords
3,It works. And adds extra plug points and options.
5,excellent produit
5,I use this in my bathroom for multiple inputs are needed works well and does not take up a lot of space and is flexible with the USB outputs.
5,it works exactly like they said do not remove screws just plug in and rotate left or right. Do not force the unit so so easy to use and super convenient.
4,Regrouper les branchements
5,Would buy again!:) thx!
4,Il y a un morceau de plastique en demie-lune qui entoure les fiches de la station de recharge. Cela ne permet pas de la placer dans certain endroit o√π ce morceau de platique est trop large et emp√™che de brancher la station. Trop encombrant pour le voyage.
4,brancher tablette et cell
4,Great multiple charging options. Product description lacks electrical limitations. ‚Äú Unplug swivel power from wall unit when not in use ‚ÄúUSB charging ports may Not work if total amp exceeds 3.1ANot rated for cord length as this is not applicable
5,the way it clears up the messy look around the outlet you use it with
5,Love it because I can charge my devices and have outlets open for use
5,Works as stated
