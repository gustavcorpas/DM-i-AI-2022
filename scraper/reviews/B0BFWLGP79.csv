5,Fairly easy set up just had a small pass word problem but the swift and considerate customer service really helped me to make sure all was good.  Thank you very much! Small businesses are the back bone of our country!
5,So far so good only had this one day but seems to solve my issue.
5,I tried everything and at last my friend suggested not to change wifi operators but get this magic device. I was hopeless as I even changed router with great bandwidth but it didn’t work. This is the first wifi extender we have tried. We were very skeptical due to the price but decided to give it a try. I gotten a couple security cameras for my yard to watch my dog mostly and there signal to wifi wasn't good. Until I got this easy to set up and ready to use. My signal to my camera's are great shocked me how well it actually works. I am 100% satisfied and can say this WiFi extender works 100%!!!
5,This wifi extender is much better than I expected. First of all after receiving this I was delighted with the friendly manual with images. I have experience with the extender but the manual with images is helpful for faster installation than the written manual.I don't have a main router but it took me about just a minute to set up this wifi extender. Very quick and easy setup!And when I compared the speed to another brand of wifi extender I have I can see that this wifi the extender was faster. I am very satisfied and will buy this if I need another extender!
5,My house is roughly 3200 square feet and my old router would go anywhere in the house and outside a ways but this new one wouldn't even get to my basement or the other side of the house. I put it in the basement and now I can use internet in the basement again its that simple.  I was kind of hesitant buying this due to the fact of ordering an Wifi Extender before and it not working and no instructions on how to set it up. This was 100% super easy to set up and install and I finished setting up within 3 minutes. The app is pretty accurate and it also had great instructions on how to set up the placement of the Wifi extender. Strongly recommend a buy!!!
5,fixed my dead zone in house wifitook 3 mins to install
5,excellent productThis gives you a great boost to your wifi on any device. My wifi is on the other side of the house. I used this on the opposite side of the house and what a amazing difference we have. no more slow down load. And checked it out by performing a speed test and found that my DOWNLOAD SPEED was greatly improved. And again the ease of installation and configuration was so easy that a third grader could do it. I highly recommend this product to anyone.
5,This took about 3 minutes to setup and I am immensely techno challenged. I’m talkin plug it in follow the steps in the easy set up guide and you are good to go. My signal did not reach my bedroom from my study where my modem and router were. and now my Tv works phone works laptop works. I plan to install one in my garage too haha
5,I was very tired of getting disconnected so i gave a shot of this product. Very pleased with this device and the ease of installation. I absolutely love it!!! I have gone through two top-rated modems and two top routers before I purchased this one.  Our Wi-Fi wasn’t strong enough in the upstairs portion of our house to meet the needs for the cameras around that part of our house. We bought this and this solved it! Now the Wi-Fi signal is strong! It’s stronger in other areas of house too. It works better than any other extenders ( good enough to watch youtube video & netflix). I get stable wifi signal and internet speed with this one than any other extenders ( now I get 50~75 Mbps).I can highly recommend this unit!!!
5,Works perfectI liked the fact that my WIFI SIGNAL STRENGTH was greatly improved. I had no idea how slow my wifi signal was until I purchased this repeater even with the mesh options my cable company gave us this repeater had made such an positive impact on the change in put work from home situation. Absolutely surprised at how easy it was to set up and go in minutes.... all of the outdoor security cameras and the garage door opener that is on a detached garage all working great!!
5,So far so good! It arrived quickly and it only took about 3 minutes to read the directions carefully and have it set up.My security camera on my front door has no more connection issues! The whole house is covered. We no longer struggle with the weak signal in the bedroom which is in the far corner of the house. It also seems to have improved the reception of our WiFi. It connected I ran Netflix to test it and my tv is working so much quicker now! A pleasant surprise to spend little money but get a quality product.
5,This product has completely fixed our dead zone Wi-Fi issues in our house. The signal from the house barely reaches my garage. The antennas provide direction for a directed area.The packaging and shipping were fast. My phone connects and works fine in my garage with perfect Wi-Fi calling. I have no cell service in my area and this worked great to extend my Wi-Fi calling outside my house. At least I can receive and make calls and surf in my garage now. Price was offered as a less costly item but provides the requirements for extending the Wi-Fi. Great purchase！
