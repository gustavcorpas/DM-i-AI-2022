5,I bought 4 tags for my luggages and my car as I moved from TX - OR.I had to shipped my car across the country in the moving progress so I used a ziptie and tied the tag to the rear view mirror. I was able to track to car movement everday while my car travel acrossed all the states.I used the other 3 to put in my check-in luggages. As traveling is getting out of hand it gives me a piece of mind knowing my luggages made it on the plane lol. I had 2 layover and both time I was able to track all 3 luggages movements.It is very impressive and I would do this everytime I travel now.
5,I'm a golf pro. SLOW PLAYERS REALLY SUCK.....the fun out of the game for everyone behind them! If we get a group that shows all the classic signs of being slow (shows up 5 minutes before tee time-cowboy boots-tank tops ESPECIALLY MEN bros hoes carry clubs INTO the pro shop-more than one rental set in the group-asks more than one stupid question-) we attach one of these tags to the cart body near engine compartment. Then we let them play 2-3 holes....if the classic signs point to our hunch the Marshall is on them all day babysitting. Play faster and we wouldn't have to use them.
5,Got one of these to hang from my cat's collar because he's an escape artist. Got it set up and on him and then kind of forgot about it until the other night and we went hey where's the cat? I check the device on the app and he's made it over a quarter of a mile away location being reported by other bluetooth devices. Get in the car manage to get close enough it connects to my phone and make it ring to pinpoint the cat. Long story short got the cat back saved a traumatic trip to the pound and he's never going to be without one again. So worth it.
5,I recently traveled by air around Europe with the Galaxy SmartTag tracker in my suitcase. The network is dense enough so that it was detected at least once every 10 or 15 minutes -- often enough for practical purposes. Twice it gave me great peace of mind when my suitcase was delayed. I could see the city and airport where the suitcase was located. In one case I could zoom in enough to see the gate number nearest to the latest place the tracker was picked up which led to a good inference about which flight it must have gone on. I had a Tile tracker in my suitcase as well as the Galaxy. The network for Tile (in Europe at least) is so thin that it would be detected only some of the time with long gaps in between. Not good at all. For Samsung Galaxy phone users I highly recommend this tracker!
5,Fits right in on my key ring and works with the Samsung Smart Things app on my phone. Not only can you find your keys from your phone but you can find your phone from your keys. I usually misplace one or the other on a daily basis and this has saved me time on many occasions. I would highly recommend for people who misplace phones or keys or have children like I do that move your stuff around without your knowledge.
5,It took awhile for me to figure it out.  I needed to detect and assign it via the Samsung app Smart Things.  Once I figured that out it all fell into place quite intuitively.  I've only had it a few days not long enough loose anything give me time.....
5,Got two of these for me and my wife for our trip to keep tabs of our luggage. it was nice because they worked as expected and let me see that my bags were with us and or nearby!
5,Great for when you have a sneaky pup. I'm no longer asking everyone in the house where the dog is. He's usually under the bed. Now I just listen for the tone.I'm very happy with my purchase.
5,Purchased so that I can always locate my keys. Always setup this tag as soon as you receive it by downloading the phone app and connecting it. Location detects an address and you can ping the rag to ring ... as long as everything is setup and installed as soon as received in the mail.
5,Extremely easy to set up with my Samsung cell phone. I hide the tracker in my suitcase (so that way it's not easily found by anyone other than myself). Then I travel with ease as I am able to track my suitcase from when I first check it to when I arrive at my destination and collect my suitcase at baggage claim. Highly recommend this item.
