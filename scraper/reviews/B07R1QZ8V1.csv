5,I've had this product for almost a year and a half and it still works well I have it glued to my windshield and its been there ever since. I live in Texas and we constantly have 100F heat waves and my car stays in the sun constantly I'm so surprised it's been holding on extremely well! it's a great product the little space on the phone holder allows me to charge my phone while I drive. Over all its a great product!
4,Sadly does not hold phones that have pop sockets.  The brackets on the sides are too short.  It’s a design flaw.  All you have to do to make the device compatible with any attachments to the phone is to have the side brackets longer.  So it can hold thicker devices.  Other than it not holding my phone 🤣 it works great with my husbands phone that does not have a pop socket.  The device itself is quality plastic and stays secure to the car.  Has good grip on the phone.
5,First off let me say that I really like this phone holder.  I mounted mine on the windshield & use it every time I drive.  It is very handy and you are able to look ahead and see both your phone & the road and other cars.  It was simple to install and easy to use.  I love mine.As for the Customer Service I was really impressed and greatly appreciative.  You see we live in Central Texas and it is super hot this summer.  As per my picture the 100 degree temps finally took a toll on my suction cup and I watched it melt away day by day and it finally separated and fell down.  I was so sad but I told myself to reach out anyway and explain my situation.  So I wrote to them and told them exactly what had happened and asked them if they sold a replacement suction cup replacement.  They checked on it and approved it and sent me not only just the suction cup but the whole end and all we have to do is replace the end piece clean the windshield really good again and re-apply.  I am debating on waiting until this horrible heat wave is over and the cooler temps are here.Thank you Lily for all of your kind help!
5,I bought this car mount from Vicseed in April 2021. After nearly a year and a half of good use the tightening screw broke.I messaged the Vicseed customer service team on Instagram expecting them to tell me that they can't do anything because it is outside of the 1 year warranty period. To my disbelief they promptly sent me not one and but two replacement screws completely free of charge. The replacement parts arrived at my doorstep within 4 days of sending a message to them which is just phenomenal. Shout out to Zhung Lili from the customer service team.Big brand companies with much higher profit margins than Vicseed should learn a thing or two from them about what good customer service really means.My recommendation: Buy this product without worry you won't regret it.
4,This could have gone 180 degrees the other way but I found the replacement part.  The mount works well enough the locking handle/retaining nut wore out quicker than I thought it would or should.  Without the locking handle the mount is worthless.There is a place here on Amazon that sells the part so I got a couple.  Seriously Vicseed include an extra one or two.
5,First and foremost this is a great product and works well with all our vehicles.  Secondly the company’s customer service is outstanding - I thought I was missing a part (which as it turns out wasn’t missing) and they delivered a new part the next day!
5,Have had this for about a month now and I have to say this is one of the best phone mounts out there suction cups don’t melt holds phone with minimal shaking and very sturdy. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product.
5,If you have a 2013-2018 RAV4 you know how hard it is to find a phone mount. You can’t just pick one up at the store like everyone else because of the dash and the orientation of the vents.I have purchased another phone mount on Amazon that cost more than this and was only willing to hold a phone as large as an iPhone 8. Once I upgraded to a 12 it just kept falling out.This phone mount is superior to the previous headache I had. This was simple to install and is easy to use and very flexible with whatever size phone you may have.I definitely recommend this phone mount especially for Toyota RAV4 owners.
5,Love this phone mount. I have purchased 3 of them for two of my cars and a work truck. Solid phone holders. It even sticks to the textured dash without falling off.
5,What stands out to me about this product was the customer service from the seller. Very responsive and attentive. I bought 2 of these and returned one. They were more than willingly to make things right. The best part of it all was I wasn't returning it do to any issue with the product. But because they were willingly to make it right with no questions asked? This stands outs as customer service 101.  Make the experience with the customer memorable. I will buy from them just on that bases alone. Oh Btw the product worked wonderfully. The adhesive suction power and mounting system all worked well. I was concerned about it being out in the AZ heat but nope. The suction continues to hold and the adhesive has not come off. Well done!
5,Outstanding customer satisfaction and service.Many variables for mounting due to products flexibility and superior suction even on slightly textured surfaces as opposed to other similar products of this type I have tried very happy with this product.
5,I have bought this for both of my cars and they are still holding great.
5,He decided to use the bracket that attaches to the air vent and has been very happy with it. I'm pleased that he's not sitting his phone in the center console where it use to bang around or trying to hold it while he uses the GPS. It's been a good purchase that has given us both a piece of mind!
4,It was a great help traveling
5,Easy to install and does the job. I've had this mounted for some time now and the adhesion is still holding up. Very easy to maneuver and I'd definitely recommend.
5,My wife drove my car and is now replacing her old mount with this one!  Great product with lots of available mounting options.
5,Been using this product for more than a year and I could say that this is a great product been using it most of the time.I would recommend to follow the advise of the seller to remove the product if the temperature is high(so not to loss the grip of the suction cup) and if not using it or if traveling just use the vent phone holder instead to prolong the lifespan of the suction cup.based on experience I made this mistake and reach out the product seller/customer service.The best part is the seller/ customer service is so kind and easy to reach out and solve my issues with my vicseed dash phone holder. Highly recommended!!!
5,Holds to surface great holds device in place
5,Me encanta es el mejor que a podido comprar después de gastar mucho en varios que no me sirvieron por fin encontré uno que si vale la pena😊
5,The mounting system can either be used with the included flat disc to mount the suction cup or you can mount with just the suction cup as the cup has a thick lining glue that is more than enough to hold the holder as well as any cellphone you mount.Our cellphone holder was mounted upside down on the windshield an even holds up in direct summer sunlight.
5,I needed a part replaced. I texed Vicseed and was responded to immediately and the part was sent to me 2 days later free of charge. Lily Cheung Rocks!
5,Wife and I have large phones.  I have a Pixel 6 Pro and she has an S22 Ultra.  This mounted stable and holds both phones with ease.  It has a lot of different mounting option and articulation so there was no problem setting it up to work with either phone.Only complaint is the sun visor doesn't fit with this installed but that would is not fault of the mount and would happen with any mount attached to the window.
5,Para mantener mi teléfono listo para cuando uso la navegación GPS.
5,El producto para mi es ideal. No tuve ningun problema adaptandolo a mi auto. Nunca se cayo y es ajustable.  Sin dudas un excelente producto!
4,I bought this to install in my sedan so that I may stream music (and skip songs safely) without having to look down for the buttons on my phone. The holder works great! It supports any phone from the bottom and the width is adjustable to secure your device. The only flaw is that the volume button on my phone is partially covered by the side grips however I have simply lifted my phone a bit higher in the cradle and all works well.After transferring the holder to a differ6 dedan I ran into difficulty with the adhesive suction cup becoming too damaged to function. I emailed the company and they worked quickly to help me replace/reuse parts I would need.I highly recommend this product and company.
5,After about a year of successful use the back screw sheared off from the holder. I wrote to customer service and they sent me a whole new unit within a few days free of charge!! Great customer service.
4,Good items
4,This is a well-made product that has great stability when installed according to the package directions. I installed it on my dashboard in my Subaru Ascent and it’s extremely stable and holds my phone with no problem. I needed a phone mount with a longer arm due to having an SUV that by nature has a deeper dashboard. My only real complaint regarding this product is that it would be nice if there was a way once installed to change the angle of rotation by tightening and loosening something. The way that the product exists currently once it is in place whatever angle it extends out to is where it stays forever. You can shorten or lengthen the extension arm as well as change the height of the holder up or down but you cannot change which direction it comes off the anchored adhesive circle. Overall great product though and I actually just bought a second one for my best friend.
5,Had a retired GS8+ and needed a phone to display digital data from my new outboard motor. But the console was already packed and there was just a small area to land a suction-cup mount at the back but then needed a long reach forward. Bought this particular mount because it has lots of adjustable reach and looked fairly rugged.I've had the mount installed for nearly a month now and been blasting around up to WOT (~49mph) and the mount has never moved a bit. Two thumbs up!
5,I purchased this product for a road trip in my RV. I plan to purchase two more for my personal vehicles. Suction is powerful and held my phone in place during the trip. Wide enough to hold my iPhone 13 max with a phone case.  Pleased with my purchase. Highly recommended!
5,I love this! It keeps my phone in place and really durable. I got another for my daughter.
5,I am very pleased with the car phone mount. I have tried multiple car phone mounts and this seems to be the best one yet. I have only used the air vent mount so far but it is very strong and study and working well. I also love the squeeze grip and release button. Very handy.
4,It did take a couple of mounts before I found this one. I do carry a larger phone with a pretty durable case around it and one of the issues I have had with other mounts I tried was they just couldn't hold the phone well or would detach completely from wherever I had it mounted in the car with even slight bumps in the road. I will say that the suction works best on the windshield which is perfect for me since I like my phone mounted in the left corner of windshield behind the steering wheel. Although it does stick pretty well to other surfaces in the vehicle.I have only had the mount itself detach once when the inside temperature of the car was well above 100 degrees on an unusually hot day. I have never had an issue since.My one issue and this is very nuanced is that because I have a case on my phone when I go to plug in a USB cable and then place the phone in the mount it does not fit perfectly with the case/USB combo. This may be in large part due the fact that my phone case does have a dust protector over the USB charging port that hangs from the bottom of the case when a USB cable is plugged in. However if they would just make a small adjustment bottom of the mount (since many decent phone cases do have charging port covers) that would accommodate phone cases with or without charging port covers it would make for an almost perfect phone mount.
4,I mounted this on the passenger window of my 1969 M35A2 Deuce and a Half.  Works perfect.  I can not think of a better vehicle to test this mount in.  If you have ever had the privilege of riding in a deuce you know just how bumpy the ride is!  There is a very sticky adhesive on the back of the suction cup.  Go SLOWLY removing it from your window as it is VERY sticky stuff BUT it is removable.  If removed I would suggest doing so when the vehicle windshield is not hot as it may cause the adhesive to remove itself from the looks of other's reviews.  The arm is extendable and overall it provides plenty of adjustment.  I have a Samsung S21 in mine.  Works great!
5,I absolutely love this product. I did not use the suction holder but instead screwed the holder into my air conditioner vent. I was convinced it would not stay but it did. I’m an Uber driver and it has stayed put over  speed bumps curves u turns etc. holds my iPhone 12 with a phone cover over it. Highly recommend
5,Don’t waste your time. I have one and that thing is secure. It sticks to my window even in the heat waves. It adjust to size weight  and you can rotate to whatever angle you need. I ordered one for my aunt who has a sad clip in her vent the clip version of this is just as solid! She loves it!
5,I purchased this and mine ended up breaking. I contacted customer service and they sent out a new one.  I have been using this for about 6 months and love it. It's so convenient to have your phone available.
5,I highly recommended to buy this product!
4,Arms aren’t big enough to hold a mophie charger.
5,I like everything
4,I like the system and it held my phone very good but the screw knob to tighten the swivel cracked because they use plastic.Edited on 12-10-2010So I reached out to the company and shared my issues with them. They immediately sent out the parts to make the repair. I followed up with another email stating that I had another issue with the suction cup once again they immediately sent out parts to repair. First problem was a broken knob. This issue can be from the user over tightening the knob. The second issue was the suction cup. It had NO problems sticking to my window for a full 6 months the issue was removing it!  It was so strong I had to use 2 hands to pry it off. To be honest my truck is in the sun a lot and I have never removed the product from my windshield. What seems to have happened was that months of Texas heat possibly made the rubber break down a little and made it stick even more. There is NO damage to window and the product as it sits with the new suction cups still works just very sticky.This is a robust product that I have put through some rough conditions. So I give the product 4 stars but the support and response a big 5 stars.
5,All of my previous experiences with car mounts involved things falling off.  I've had various Garmins with Garmin mounts and they always fell off (whether from the windshield or a disc).  It got to the point that I would leave my GPS plugged in constantly while using it so that if it fell in floorboard while I was driving I could pull it up with one hand using the power cord.  It did that a lot.  Inevitably while I was driving in very heavy crazy traffic with an exit coming up in under a mile.  So that's what I have to compare this mount to.This mount came with a disc to put on my dashboard but I didn't want to pry off the old Garmin disc.  I was afraid that would damage my dashboard since the thing has been there for 12 years or so.  I considered stacking the discs but thought I should try the new mount on the old disc first.  The mount just barely fits on my old Garmin disc.  The disc that it came with is slightly bigger.  But it did fit. Just have to be really careful to get it lined up since the fit is so close.  And it does NOT fall off.  Honestly I can't even pry it off.  I have to get my husband to pull it off when I want to remove it and it takes him a minute or two to get it off.I've had this for two months now.  It's had a decent amount of city and country driving and it's been on one roadtrip so far.  Lots of bumpy roads and such.  And it never once fell.  That's all I really wanted.  Was something to not fall.It fits my iPhone SE well.  Because of the case I have it is difficult to insert the plug into phone in while it is in the mount so I just plug it in before I stick it in the mount.  I like how adjustable it is.  I was able to position it to where it was comfortable for me very easily.  The air vents in my car would not take air vent clips and those were too low for me to see easily.  This one is perfect.The one thing I can't speak to is how meltable it may be.  It spent most of the hot days at the end of summer in the garage.  Not a lot of chances for it to melt the gel.For what I wanted though this is great.  It just barely fits on the pre-existing Garmin disc and it doesn't fall.  It's never dropped my phone.  It was a good purchase.
5,REALLY easy to put together! I used the air conditioning holder piece to hold my phone and it’s really strong. I like that it has two ways of use
5,The nut that hold the holder to the base broke.  I contacted Vicseed customer service and within 2 days they sent me 2 upgraded nuts.  Thank you very much!  Highly recommended!
4,Occasionally the suction cup would fall in hot temps but works well
4,Adhesive to my dashboard mount wore out and eventually lost stick. Maybe due to heat. The vent clip chipped off after a while as well. I am now left the suction option. Unfortunately the adhesive between suction and dashboard mount is so strong I can’t  separate without risking further break. Can I have another adhesion slip for the dashboard mount?The product is great and I love it which is why I want to continue using it.
4,After my original review the seller reached out to me to make it right. Suggested a different one and sent to me at no charge.  USPS lost the 1st one so they resent. I am extremely happy with the one they sent me. Its smaller and works great for the RAV4. I greatly appreciate the seller reaching out to me and suggesting the phone holder they did. Great customer service we stayed in constant contact thru out the processHighly recommendBig and bulky; didnt work for Toyota RAV4
5,Nice grip
4,This phone holder works very well. Do not understand why the suction cup has adhesive on it
5,VICSEED Universal Cell Phone Holder for Car Phone Mount Car Phone Holder Dashboard Windshield Air Vent Long Arm Strong Suction Cell Phone Car Mount Fit with iPhone SE 12 Pro Galaxy S21 All Phones Over the years I have tried numerous phone car mount holders numerous!  About 2 years ago I searched through Amazon and rolled the dice on this particular mount made by VICSEED it was well worth the gamble.  The mount came in well packaged and simple instructions.  This mount can be used on the dash window and vent.  I particularly prefer the vent mount holder with any phone mount holder I have purchased.  The major difference that I seen and noticed is the quality it is hands down better quality than any of the phone mounts I have purchased over years.  So satisfied that I quickly ordered another one for my other vehicle.  Attached are pictures of the VICSEED Universal Mount (first 4) compared to one of the mounts I have purchased in the past (last photo).  The VICSEED Universal Mount securely holds my phone in place no matter if I hit a bump or any form of driving.  The other mount in park doesn’t stay in place and will completely fall off the vent leaving my phone in the floor.  I personally have a large phone in which (Note 20 Ultra)  in the picture is my son’s Phone note 9 and the VICSEED holds up amazingly it also has a quick release for when you want to release your phone.  Lastly what I noticed is a major difference is the quality of the clamp. Great customer service….one day I accidentally broke the vent clamp I didn’t think about contacting the company at first because it was my fault I just ordered another one.  After receiving my new VICSEED mount (same one) I emailed VICSEED simply to see if I could purchase a new vent clip they responded fairly quick and shipped me a new one (no charge). Awesome product with great customer service!
5,I bought a cell phone holder from Verizon 6 months ago. I was impressed...for a day or two. Fast forward to turning a knob to tighten the sides around the phone and this being such a pain and u could never get it quite right. It even fell out one day while I was driving which was really dangerous. The sides also had foam inserts in them to cushion your phone as it held it. They were both falling out. I actually brought the phone holder inside and was super gluing it and securing it with clamps to dry when it struck me how ridiculous the situation was and how this product was so much more trouble than it was worth.I am getting ready for a road trip and needed something to hold my phone safely so I can use it for phone calls navigation music (and be switching back and forth between all these functions. To be honest for once I didn’t really read a lot about the product or look at the reviews which is wild considering the nightmare my last holder proved to be. I picked this one cuz it was an Amazon Choice and it had almost perfect stars. OMG!!! The button on the side is AMAZING! I just rest my phone on the “shelf” for the bottom and squeeze the sides together and it just stays put. NO KNOB TO TURN!!! But WAIT...it gets BETTER...to release your phone you just push the MAGIC BUTTON!!! WHAAAT??? Who is the genius who came up with that? This seems really well made and I don’t anticipate any unusual wear and tear like I ran into with the piece of crap I had before. There is no foam in here to fall out and I am not worried in the least that my phone will slip out when I’m driving and be sliding around under my feet. I liked it so much straight out of the box that I adhered it to my dash. I have never done that before with anything and didn’t know what to expect. I don’t worry about that coming off either...it’s solid. You know how every once in a while an everyday purchase makes your life infinitely better? This was that purchase for me.
4,e comes with 2 different ways to attach it to the car.  One is using a clip to grab onto one of the vent slats and the other is with a peel-off sticker to adhere to the dash.  I use the clip into the vent since the sticker method isn't recommended to leave in the sun.I like the way it holds the phone and has a button to easily release it but found putting the clip with the ball difficult to fit into the ring section of the arm.  It took several tries with some force but I finally got the ball to snap into place.It holds better than a magnet method.  I am ordering a 2nd one for another family member.
5,Happily replaced my units two years after the fact due to the suction cup failing in the hot Texas heat
5,I like this mount. I use it on my vent. If you have bigger hands you might have a slight issue adjusting this. I would adjust the prongs until it just will slip over the vent because then you will only have to make a few adjustments. (If that makes sense.)Like any other thing that has a suction cup you will need a smooth surface. (Logical would state this.) If you don't think a suction cup from the dollar store will stick to your dashboard more then likely this won't. If you have a plastic console in the middle of the console that feels like plastic this will more then likely work. The fancy coating will not with this suction.Also. Like any other suction cup... it's thin. It will melt in the heat. Plain and simple. Especially in the summer. There really isn't a way around it.I bought three of these. One was for my boyfriend and the other my ex liked and I just gave it to him. (We are amicable.) And my bf is one of those for some reason or the other thinks higher priced things work the best. He had like a 60 buck thing or something and it sucked. He loves this one.
5,Works as intended. Sticks to dash holds phone snugly releases phone quickly and easily.
5,I had bought one back in August of last year and recently I took it off of my dash to put on my wife's dash of her vehicle. She loved it so much I let her keep mine and bought another for me. Absolutely love this product!
4,Well-made holds the phone securely in place and the adhesion to the windshield is extremely strong.  Almost too strong.  I'm not sure if it is the intended design but it cannot be moved (e.g. I wanted to use the holder in another car and couldn't remove it from the windshield).  The only other item I did not like is that the release button (for removing the phone from the holder) is on the left side instead of the right side.  Minor detail but that design makes it a bit awkward for one handed removal (for me anyway).
5,I love this
4,Great mounting system and adhesion while it lasted. Rubber melted off
5,VICSEED Universal Cell Phone Holder was delivered on time. It was easy to install. Phone fits great in it. Sits perfectly on my dashboard.
4,Holds phone in work truck drive a triaxle dump truck so it takes a beating
5,I like it all
3,It suctions good but I have to keep tightening the screws down because phone tugs down on it when I hit some bumps in the road.
5,This is by far the best car miunt for my phone I have ever used. Not to mention their support is amazing!Due to it being in the hot sun for so long I had to move it to a different location on my dash. Customer support was very helpful (They even offered to send me two new 3M sticker mounts free of charge) but it turns out I didn’t even need them. Had no problem and even liked the new area on my dash even better! The suction on this thing is fantastic!
5,First and foremost their customer service is outstanding! Amazon tracking had indicated on the item specs that it was going to be delivered 2-3 days. Constantly checked up on delivery and nothing. A week went by and "sorry your package is late please wait a few days and you can cancel". Well I called the seller VICSEED and they immediately sent me another one overnight. Had it the next day! They were so concerned that I hadn't received my product. The product is very good. Very sturdy I had one similar in form but not as durable. You can extend the post to accommodate for the distance from mounting area. I have it mounted low center on the windshield so not to obstruct visibility. So then I have it extended fully. It's easy to remove and place phone onto carrier. Also I'm in Texas heat and the suction on the windshield has been excellent. Hasn't fallen yet. Great product for the price!
4,The main unit seem to be well made but could be a bite more sturdily made My 6 in phone with heavy case fits the phone clamp just fine but can get a little shaky depending on road conditions. Used a little non oily cleaner on my dash and this unit has stuck directly to the dash without the use of the mounting disk which was supplied. My next trip to Florida from the northeast will be the test to see if it stays where put. I would recommend this item to a friend. As far as the AC duct mounting clamp I'm not a fan. 1st i doesn't want the kind of weight hanging on my AC vent 2nd it block the vent and lastly I really don't like the idea of my AC or heat blasting the back of my phone. Extreme heat and cold is the worst enemy of any battery so as far as my choice i would rather not use it.
4,My phone did not fit with a case and the one time I got it to fit it was too heavy and the whole thing was shaking a lot. but it works well and did the job it needed to
4,Works as advertised
3,The holder itself is great and the vent option is decent but this was highly recommended for a Ford Edge dash attachment and that does not work very well.  If you want to attach it to a dash board you need a perfectly flat surface.  The Edge is slightly curving in all possible attachment areas so the adhesive disk does not have full contact.  For other cars a 4 or 5 star rating might be appropriate.
5,Lo que me agrado  fue que esta dicellada para usar la en diferente poción y fácil de intalarla
4,I found the adhesion of the dock itself was poor even after cleaning my dash with alcohol. However the adhesive disc that comes with the unit stuck well to the dash and it was easy to attach the dock to the disc with crazy glue.
4,Update Below:I’ve owned this now for just about four months.  For the first three months or so I had a very hard time with the suction keeping it attached to my dashboard.  I would frequently get in my car the next day only to find it sitting on the floor.  Finally just in the past month it’s stayed put.  Otherwise I like the way it holds my iPhone 8 Plus securely and I can easily see my screen.  With hands-free law just taking effect in Massachusetts I’m glad to have this since I can easily tap my phone to answer a call or bring up my navigation maps with no undue effort.  I do like that you also have the option to attach this to your vent but I have not ussed this option as yet.Update:  The problem with it falling off has been resolved.  The customer service rep sent me a new kit.  I think you just have clean the dash extra clean. and press and hold the disk for several seconds to ensure adhesion.  Mine has not fallen of now for quite some time.  It easily fits my iPhone 8 Plus with it’s case.  My wife also has the 8 Plus but in a “wallet” case; this won’t fit into the holder since this case is much thicker than mine is.In short I now love this holder and it works perfectly thus far.
4,I am an over the truck driver. I've had this product since january and have put it through 24000 Miles of use... that's about 2 years worth of Miles for an ordinary car driver. To my surprise this product has never lost suction or fallen off the dash. My phone is a Samsung s5 active plus I have a case on it.. and it holds my phone adequately although more depth in the holder itself would have been nice.As for the side support arms they simply ratchet click in place to hold the phone.. and has a quick release button for removing the phone. The bottom support arm slides in and out as desired.If I had to complain about anything it would be the suction cup. The suction cup uses an adhesive film in order to assist the suction cup with sticking and staying on a surface. The problem with this design though is that every time you remove the holder from the car a little bit of the adhesive film wears off. Eventually if the holder is removed too many times the adhesive film will become useless. For that reason it's best to pick the vehicle and spot that is desired and leave it.. don't move the holder to a different spot unless nessesary.Other than the adhesive film issue.. I think this is a great holder.update: 10/2/2022I finally retired this holder last week.. only because I got a new phone and wanted to have wireless charging not because this one broke.. I would still be using this one if it weren't for the lack of wireless charging.
5,This was used in my boyfriend’s car to mount his phone. It fits any size phone can be placed in any direction you need it to face extends rotates etc. it’s the best adhesive! I’ve tried other brands and the adhesive failed. I waited the max amount of time (72 hours) for the adhesive to stick before mounting the device. Highly recommended!
5,I had search  for a dash cell phone holder and at Walmart Best Buy and Target. I was no impress with the selection. I have an Iphone 12 max which is a heavy phone. I noticed in the description of this one it said for large foods. I thought if I order through Prime and don't like it I can always return it. I got it in and used it and it worth every penny I spent on it. I would highly recommend.
4,It’s very adjustable
5,I use the vent clip feature of this holder and it works great. Took me a minute to find the exact right place for it as it blocks a vent completely but very sturdy and phone is secure. Used for a Galaxy Note 10 and a Galaxy S22 Plus.
5,We've tried 2 other phone holders and the phone would wobble or push around instead of me being able to select things on the screen. I love how this has many joints to adjust and 'lock' into place. I love how easy it is to place the phone - and release it when done. We installed the first one on our subaru outback 2013. then we bought a second one for our Subaru Forester 2003. Love.
5,have two of these and was working great till one had an issue but contacted supported and they helped out immediately.  Will definitely do business with them in the future.
5,I really liked the design of this with the flexibility of mounting. I originally had an issue with the supplied "disc" with the 3M adhesive to place on the dash for the suction cup of the mount to attach to. I have a "textured" dash and the disc did not adhere to it very well and everything fell off after about 10 minutes of driving. It is possible I helped to contribute to this by not waiting long enough. I mentioned all this after I received an email asking if I liked the product. Davis from VICSEED contacted me asking about my experience with the product and asked a few questions about my vehicle (09 GMC Sierra) and mounting surface/area. He said the 3M disc should work and said he would be sending me a couple more to try again. I received the new discs and have since installed them (waited like 10hrs while working before adding mount) without any issues The mount seems to be holding strong even with encountering rough road/potholes. I would recommend this to anyone.
5,Full disclosure I usually do not leave reviews unless it is a junk item but I am truly amazed with this thing!I have not used a mount before this one so I do not have anything to compare this product to; but this is amazing.I have two separate jobs one requiring me to drive to certain destinations using a company vehicle the other doing the same in my own vehicle - the fact that I can easily use this mount in both vehicles by only unscrewing the phone cradle is great! One vehicle utilizes the extended bracket with the suction cup and the other uses the vent clamp. The extended bracket is adjustable both in height and length and very sturdy - I cant even begin to explain how many REALLY bumpy roads i have flown down and the extended arm still stays in place!The phone cradle is awesome too! It has a quick release button on the side so I can remove my phone in a moments notice and the spring clamp (holding my phone in cradle) is strong enough to prevent wiggle. The cradle also has an adjustable height bracket that allows me to position the phone exactly where I need the phone to perform fingerprint unlock. You can also position the cradle at any angle - you can have it titled up wards for easy one hand use landscape to view media better or even upside down.Great product i would recommend this to any of my friends!
5,Can't be happier with this cell phone holder! And the customer service is very good.
5,This is a Quality product and it worked great for several years. After several years the window suction got hot because of Florida's heat and loosened. I emailed the manufactory and they responded immediately. They sent me a new replacement product and I am completely happy. I was happily surprised when they told me they would replace it because it was past the warranty period. Thank you Vicseed I will always be your customer.
5,I love most everything about this product; it’s the best car phone mount I’ve ever owned.  I mount it to my windshield and it has stayed there so far in all weather and temperatures (owned for 1 year so far).  The only complaint I have is that the silicone suction pad or whatever material used for the suction pad starts to permanently adhere to the windshield over time.  I bought a new truck and moved the holder from my old one to the new one and some of the suction pad touching the glass on my old truck had seemingly melted or something and it stayed stuck on the windshield when I took it off.  The pad still stuck to my new truck windshield properly and I haven’t had any issues so far but the pad is slightly damaged from the removal.  I might recommend removing these on a cold day or at night and the suction pad may let go of the windshield easier.
5,Bought this Vicseed Easy Clip Car Mount for a Pixel 3a XL phone in a Spigen Tough Armour case and for a dash mount installation on the small shelf on the dash of a 2003 Toyota Camry.  The size of the mounting disk and the angle of the hinge of the mount took up more space than a previous installation of a smaller unit.  I emailed Vicseed on a weekend with a question about installation (of note I had not yet found the installation guide which was under a flap at the bottom of the box).  I received a quick response from the company with a request for a photo of the dashboard which resulted in an equally quick response with instructions to dispense with the disk and use only the suction cup and a link to an instruction video.  Installation proved to be both simple and workable in the space I had available.  Phone mount seems very stable and works well.  Customer rep also mentioned that she had notified their marketing folks to ensure that the instruction manual was more prominent in the box.  Excellent customer service.5/15/2021 Update.  The suction failed about 1 1/2 months ago after well over a year of use.  I reviewed the installation instructions and viewed a Vicseed video then re-installed the phone holder.  The suction cup failed again about 3 weeks later.  I emailed Vicseed and communicated with Alice who I believe was the person I communicated with about my original installation.  I simply asked for suggestions as to how I could reinstall the original unit.  She said that she would send a new suction cup but I today received an entirely new unit.  Excellent support for a very good product.
3,As I said the adhesion didn't hold up
4,This is a high-quality product that is beautifully made very sturdy and I'm sure will last for a long time. If you can get it to fit in your vehicle I'm sure it will serve you well.  However I could not make this work in my car and sadly must return it. I have a 2018 Subaru Forester.  Not enough height from dashboard to windshield.  I cannot mount directly to the windshield either because my car has what Subaru calls "EyeSight"- cameras that show blind spots in the sideview mirrors and also detects things straight ahead like if the car in front of you suddenly slows down it will automatically slow my car to avoid collision.  Anything mounted on windshield interferes. It does come with a vent mount but I specifically bought this to avoid using a vent mount.  They are not a good option for me with my big Pixel 3XL phone and rugged case- very heavy.  Tried it in my neighbor's pickup truck and didn't work there either- that vehicle has a sharply angled windshield with very little space to the dashboard. The mounting bracket was just too tall no matter how we tried to attach it. He ended up buying a CD mounted bracket which worked for him. That's what I will try next.
5,Y’all this phone stand kept my phone IN PLACE during a high speed rollover accident. I was in that car flyin around like a dang EF4 tornado was slurping me up. Anyways I survived and my phone was still in its stand connected playing my fav song while I lay there waiting for the paramedics LMAO. Never wanted to write a review so bad till now. Buy this stand y’all!!! 😭😭🤣
5,This mount is very sturdy the suction power is strong and easy to apply. There are expendable brackets on the sides and a foot that also can be adjusted to fit your phone with its case.
4,Not perfect but pretty good. The suction cup is made from a clear silicone rubber compound that adheres very well to textured surfaces common in interior car plastics. Mind you you'll likely need to clean the surface with rubbing alcohol to remove any slick shiny stuff. I'm quite sure it will stick to glass but that's not where I wanted my phone so I didn't attempt it.What it will not stick to is any surface that has even a slight curvature. This is unfortunate because my first choice would have been such a location.Also problematic was the included plastic disk with a back adhesive covered with a red plastic similar to auto trim tape I've seen and used many times before with good results. This disk is so you can apply the suction cup after sticking it to  where you want it to go. In my case it didn't stick any better than a post-it. I think this particular disk had bad adhesive. Disappointing but not a deal killer.I imagine that the soft silicone rubber of the cup (which must be clean when you use it) would warm and deform and pop off a windshield in a hot summer day. It is much softer than most suction cups of this type which seems to help it adhere to tougher surfaces. It works well but I don't imagine it lasting as long.This also comes with a vent clip holder which works very well but I wish I could use the included arm with it. This is not possible as it currently ships; i.e. I wish the main arm attacked with a ball socket on both ends and could be swapped. I'd recommend this change to the manufacturer when they update the design.I've had this phone holder for a couple of weeks and it's one of the best ones I've tried. It can use improvement however and that's why I give this four stars rather than five.
5,Love this item.  Holds on the dash well. It is easy to use and will buy another soon when my new cell phone comes in. Customer service is great.  They got back to me immediately and the issue was resolved quickly. I would definitely purchase this item again.
5,I have been using it for a week now and am only commenting on the air vent clip configuration as I do not want to mount anything to my dashboard. That being said the clip attaches very easily and securely to an air vent. Mounting the cell phone holder onto the vent clip afterward is very simple as well. All together it provides a very stable holder for my cell phone that is easy to rotate with one hand and that I can position it so that I can quickly access it without that it interfering with the steering wheel or blocking my view of the radio/ backup display screen in my minivan. The clip and holder also position the phone about 2 inches from the vent itself so it does not block or significantly impact airflow from the vent.  Very satisfied.
5,Liked the first one I bought I bought another for my other vehicle.Only issue is if you have to remove it from the windshield for any reason (I had to for a windshield replacement) it won’t hold after you remount it.  Trying to get support from the manufacturer.
3,The phone holder worked great for 12 months. Then the steel nut fell that holds the tilting screw fell off. Finally the adhesive gave up the ghost. Time for a new one. I'll go for a vent or CD Mount next.
5,She didn't want one that clipped into the vents. Just simple sticky glue onto the hood of the car and presto.
5,Great product
5,I upgraded to a larger phone and my previous magnet mount isn't able to keep my phone upright.  Plus I would really like to not have a metal plate in my phone case that interferes with the wireless charging.  So far this mount is easy to use and I haven't run into any issues.Soft padding on contact points with a phone - I wanted to make sure my phone wasn't going to get scratched up or mess with the case.  Both the clamps on the sides and bottom are well padded as well as the middle where the phone rests.Very adjustable - Being able to move the arm up and down and rotate the clamp as needed makes it easy to adjust the viewing angle.  The only difficulty is if you need to adjust the arm left or right.  You have to undo the suction turn the arm and then redo the suction but it's fairly easy.Two-part suction - This feature was one of the main selling points for this model.  You peel and stick a base that gives you a flat surface to attach the suction cup on the arm.  So far the arm has not fallen off and seems very stable.  The true test will come this summer when the vehicle reaches over 100 degrees.
5,I was looking for a really good mount for my work truck. I deliver for a living and my truck isn't exactly made for comfort.  That being said....I needed something that would really stick to my windshield and not drop my phone. Got to work on Monday and opened the box. Boy was I impressed! First of all....the suction cup is heavy duty and thick as well. It already has sticky stuff on it to help it adhere. I moved it several times before I found the right spot. Keep in mind I ride with my doors open so everything is dusty. The entire mount is adjustable with screw like things to really tighten them down to lock it in place. The part that holds the phone is strong as well. And the quick release button is located in a super convenient place. I go down dirt roads and crappy driveways all day and this thing has not moved or dropped my phone at all! I feel completely confident that my phone is safe even without a case! I like it so much that I bought a second one for my car the next day! It also comes with a small mount for your vents but I only used it once....didn't care for it being on my vent.When it's all said and done...you can't go wrong with buying this... especially if you need one that's tough and want to keep your phone safe. It really is worth the money! If it wasn't I would not have bought two! Get one and you won't need another one because it comes with a year warranty on it....yup sure does! So.....click buy and thank me later lol.
3,I loved this until the 100° weather hit Kentucky then this melted into a sticky mess and the oily stuff covered my windshield im going to try and fix it with out the adhesive pad sry the pic is dark couldn't charge my phone bc of this mess
4,Really loved dismount. Bought one for myself and my son. It fit in the awkward spot that I needed my phone to be mounted. Only problem is that the adhesive disintegrated in less than 2 years. And I'm trying to find replacement adhesive. I really don't want to buy a whole new unit
5,I bought this in October it is now the end of May. It worked great with very few times of having to remount because it fell off. But today when it was 95° outside it fell off and I can't get it to stick back on.
5,This is the best mount you can get. It’s sturdy. The suction it’s amazing. I don’t worry about it falling our it melting in the heat.I like this mount the most because it is a simple design so it holds up. All the other mounts I have tried that also allow charging all fall apart or just stop working. This is incredibly made for the price.I have purchased 4 or them over a month.
4,It works as intended but the prongs on the side aren’t long enough for my phone since I have a wallet on the back. If they would make one longer it would be a 10/10. Also sometimes on heavier devices the ball joint swivels while driving and the phone can fall off.
4,The only issue I had was with the pad that was supposed to go on my car. Every time the heater came on the adhesive would come off. After that I just stuck the suction cup directly to my dash and it works 100x better. Love this thing best one I’ve ever got as soon as I got rid of the pad
5,Sirve muy bien para lo que necesito. Durable y confiable
4,ORIGINAL: I was disappointed with this product because the adhesion on the suction cup failed after about a month. I had the product mounted to my dashboard in my Subaru Outback. I cleaned off the surface before using it and the summer heat got to it. It was surprising that a product intended for cars couldn't handle summer heat (Indiana 80s and low 90s outside). I have a larger phone (Galaxy S10+) which may have contributed to the problem.UPDATE: The seller replaced my product for me and provided recommendations on how to make the most out of it again. They recommended using the included "flat pad" to help even out the surface I had it mounted on but this product didn't stick to my dashboard (even after cleaning) so I just mounted it how I did originally looking for the flatted surface possible. It's no longer summer but the product has held up longer than it did originally. I made sure to remove all cases from my phone to try and cut down on the weight. I'll update this again next summer if I run into any issues again.
4,ANTI-SHAKING IS MODERATEI love this product. I have another quality dashboard phone mount ( radioshack brand). By far this product absorbed more shocks when travelling on bumpy and hilly roads.My phone does not have video stabilization when travelling on rough roads. As a result the videos recorded was always shaky and blurry. A phone with good video stabilization is expensive. This product did a really good with absorbing some shocks.HOLD YOUR PHONE COMFORTABLE BY SLIGHTLY SQUEEZINGThis mount holds your phone tight and comfortable.  it's also easy to remove your phone to take take a quick video by hand and replace phone back into socket quickly. Just one little squeeze and the phone is locked into socket.IT RELEASES THE  PHONE QUICKLY FOR HAND HELD VIDEO RECORDINGThere is also a nice button below the socket to release phone quickly so you can remove phone and do a hand held recording.
5,The 3M adhesive is very strong is applied according to directions. I have had it through pretty hot days without an issue. However be sure you have it where you want it before following through. Not only is the 3M adhesive very strong but so is the "suction cup" on the mount itself. I positioned it on the disk and a few months later when I had to remove it it took a butter knife and some serious hand strength to get it off the disk. It's not a true suction cup but has an adhesive on it. It's not going anywhere and that's ideal for the design.Just make sure you put it where you want it the *first* time.
4,This holder was very easy to install. I live in the South and even in the 90°+ heat the suction cup has stayed adhered to my dash.The only reason I did not give this product 5 stars is because it does not fit your phone completely if you have a Pop Socket or accessory of any kind on the back of your phone. Other than that it's gravy!A cool feature: if you don't have a flat spot to stick the suction cup to it comes with a small plastic disk; you would place the disk on the surface then place the suction cup to the disk. I didn't need to use it but it's a nifty option!
5,Its the best universal phone holder I have tried.
3,Everything except the 3M adhesice is very nice. I followed the instuctions very carefully and gave it 36 hours to set before attaching the mount. As soon as I applied the suction cup to it it fell off the top of the dashboard. I used another type of glue & now it works fine.
3,When your cars windshield gets very hot amount does not hold to the plastic plate anymore
5,Everything worked well for about 17 months and then the silicone cup broke down and became a sticky mess and started to come loose. I contacted Vicseed about buying a replacement part. They got back to me quickly a sent a replacement right away at no charge. They went above and beyond
5,I needed a phone mount that was dashboard capable as for me mounting a mount on the windshield was just too obstructive. I’m very pleased with this product. It mounts on the dashboard securely and the fact that it’s ultimately adjustable makes this mount perfect for my usage. The phone holders are very secure even on bumpy roads. I think this product is very well made and durable and I recommend this product to anyone reading this review.
4,Mounting is a problem. Suction is a problem gets hot it falls off.  Don't want to use the adhesion thing leaves marks on the dash. Had to use the fingers in the air outlets works but not a very solid soluision.
3,Loved this item to start. First one stayed put for 2 yrs or so but it finally cut free on a really hot day. Could never get it to hold so I bought another. Cleaned the dash per instructions located it a couple inches over so it wouldn’t be on top of the old location. With a few months and not a hot day at all it lost adhesion. Done with this brand.
4,This is by far the stickiest phone mount I have seen so once you install it it will stay in place and won't budge. I had to use a putty knife to pry it off my windshield to reposition it. So it's great for stability. However the release button is on the side which is unreachable when your phone is in the cradle. So I swapped out the cradle for the one on my previous holder whose base broke. Also the arm isn't quite long enough. With windshields so steeply sloped these days you have to mount the holder so far away to position the phone low enough but the arm doesn't extend far enough to keep the phone within reach. Build quality is pretty good - the arm is hollow plastic but everything else is solidly made.
4,Works great mounted with the clip. Adhesive came apart within minutes when I tried mounting it on my dash which is really where I wanted it.
5,suction and adhesion poor
5,I live in Florida where it gets REALLY hot and the heat causes problems with the suction cups for my tech devices. Some of them even melt because of the intense heat. I decided to use the dashboard mount as I already stick a dashcam and GPS to my windshield. The vent clip would work but it blocks airflow from my A/C and I want all the A/C air I can get. I tested all 3 attachments and was pleased with the construction and materials used. They all felt solid. I drive a lot and hit a lot of speed bumps potholes road debris etc. I use my iPhone 7 Plus for calls (sometimes GPS) hey Siri etc. It's pretty big but the the holder keeps it secure. It moves a little when I hit the rough stuff but everything stays attached. I got one for my wife too because I can put her iPhone right in front of her so she doesn't have to look away from the road. She likes it. I would recommend this product to a friend.
5,Love everything about this! Best one yet!
3,This device is very poseable and puts my cell phone right where it want it but the adhesive on the bottom smooth metal mounting disk did not hold to the dash. I followed the instructions and waited longer than the minimum waiting time for it to set but still had to put super glue on it after the "lifetime" adhesive started pulling free.Side note: The suction cup has a sticky gel pad on it that holds wonderful but does not want to release if you want to reposition the suction cup. I pulled the gel pad off and discovered that the cup had very little suction without it. Super glued that too.
5,Worked out great. No problem installing and is very good for me.
5,Love this phone mount. I've tried a couple cheaper ones and they wouldnt stay mounted phone didn't fit with case or my phone position woukdnt stay where I adjusted. This one eas super fast and easy to mount to dash it vame with a extra plate incase your dash had a texture to put down and then suction to that also vame with air vent clip mount option as well. I was able to mount direct to my dash without the extra plate. As my kods day I got trex arms so the extension arm is awesome feature that makes it so I can easily touch the screen to open maps hit answer to a call etc without having to stretch for it. The mount can easily fit my phone ( LG stylo 5) with case and even a larger phone if needed has quick release and it actually stays in the position I put it in. I highly recommend this mount worth the money and I should ha e ordered this 1st verses trying cheaper versions before this one.
5,First purchased this phone holder with just the air conditioning vent mounting point for a cross county trip in a rental moving truck. Liked it so much purchased two more. When my sister visited she left with one in her car so I purchase a replacement this one with the arm mounting for our RV (air conditioning mount also included).I had previously tried other units such as cup holder and windshield mounts. But this is perfect when attached to the air conditioning vents in our cars.Easy to clamp and release phone from holder with one hand.
4,The suction is pretty good it fell one time from heat when I first applied it but since then it has not fallen off of my Jeep Patriot dashboard. I have a popsocket on my Iphone 11 and most of the time my phone does not slip out as long as I make sure my phone isn't angled and the side pieces are as tight as they can go. Phone has not fallen out when I take my popsocket off but that's a pain. The worst thing about this holder is that almost no one can hear me when I'm using speaker phone. I'm not sure if it's the placement of the prongs on the bottom blocking my phones speakers or if the phone is just a little too far away from me because my Jeep is kind of big. Either way that's the worst thing for me by far because I bought this for hands free phone calls. Otherwise the holder does what's advertised and works for directions.
5,I purchased this holder to switch to a widow mount because of my last two failed attempts at getting a good vent mount holder.  We have many roundabouts with some double and triples here.  My phone  would flip to the side never seeming to grip tight enough on the little vent fins; I thought my vent fins were to thin or something. I decided to give the little vent holder they include a try before trying the window mount- it’s rock solid! It clamps on and has a little like nut that you tighten that really locks it in place tight.The whole thing is solid once you get the phone in position you can lock down the angle you want to have it set at and it stays. The window mount looks solid and adjustable; I was really happy with my purchase after checking the quality and playing around with it but honestly I am so happy with the vent mount that I didn’t try actually putting on the window mount.The only thing I think they should add is a phone release on both sides (there a release on the left) but that is really the only thing I am really happy with this purchase.
5,I liked this holder but it wasnt strong enough to hold my phone with its battery charging case. It mightve done better with a normal case but the part that holds the phone gave out and let my phone fall as I drove over some train tracks. Before that a bumpy road kept making it droop down. I tried tightening it as much as I could but its hard to do when its already attached to the car and even more so when trying to tighten in while keeping it in the right position. So although it felt sturdy and was very nice to look at it couldn't hold my phone.***Edit 11/17/2020: The company reached out to me after reading my review and sent me out a slightly different model of their phone holder. It clips into the vents and feels sturdier. I use it in my sisters car since my Jeep vents are pretty much incompatible with just about all vent mounts. But it works good has a much stronger grip on my phone and I was left impressed by the willingness of the company to reach out and send me a replacement.
5,Is so great that it do not slide or move off of my dashboard
5,This holder has a great suction to the dashboard without using the adhesive pad- it’s so solid it was a little difficult to remove and put in a different location. It does not budge! Holds my iphone 13 in an Otterbox type case with no problem either horizontally or vertically. The arm is adjustable in a couple spots for getting the phone in the best position for you. Love it- would buy again or recommend!
5,Tenía mis dudas de que realmente fuera resistente.Es una de las mejores compras que he realizado. Recomendado al 100%. Desde que lo puse no lo he movido ni se ha caído. En mi familia me pidieron pasarles la marca.
4,Has stayed on my windshield through and already rapidly changing temperature season in the Midwest. One day it’s freezing next day 80’s with a heat index over 90°F then back to normal spring weather in the 50’s and humid.It didn’t want to stay mounted on my dash but it’s not exactly a perfectly flat surface. Instead of fighting and complaining I switched to the windshield and it’s been great. Holds my phone steady enough to act as a stabilized 4K dash cam. I only wish the tension ring holding the phone portion of the mount in place were smoother to position...but for “normal” advertised purposes I can’t complain. It’s a really good mount and offers plenty of articulation and extension to be used without leaning forward in my seat.Update August 2021: On an exceptionally hot day I found this poor mount lying on the floor of my car. I think a year and a half is all it gets. Not too bad since it’s cheap but also I had to find a new mount.
5,I have only used the vent mount so far but very pleased with this.
4,My AC needed recharging but before I got it done the cell phone holder fell off the dash.  I would like to get another adhesive disk as it is Fall now and my AC is charged again.  But I don't know how to get that.  The Amazon help connection to the manufacturer takes me to a site that is not working - so I cannot ask to have a new adhesive disk sent to me.
5,Works great!
4,Used with an iPhone 11 in a tanky otterbox case (keep that in mind). Mounted on a solid steel epoxy coating device made for such applications and its locked down solid as a rock. I don’t use this in the extended application option. I keep it short and it definitely has a moderate vibration. Tolerable yes! Still a nuisance though.
4,I have an IPhone 12 Pro Max.  It is large and heavy probably the heaviest phone on the market.  This holder can handle it.  The only problem that I had was the cradle would droop after put the phone in it.  I was able to fix this problem by placing a piece of rubber band in the ball socket.  This gave a tighter fit and allowed the ball to grip better.  The suction cup holds firmly even with the arm fully extended holding the phone.  All the other connection held tight.The only reason it does not get a five is because of the little problem that was fixed by a rubber band.
5,TY!
4,I researched car dash mounts on Amazon and found this one w/ good reviews and I also read the bad ones to know why they had an issue.My phone can't hold the sticky magnet plates (cuz I have a weird phone case)....When I received my VICSEED car phone mount I didn't use the Mount on Vent option cuz...no! why would you block the air and it wiggles...dangerous option IMO.Easy to install...I would recommend you practice where you want it first before you peel for the long stick. Measure out the full Mount arm and when you reach to interact w/ your phone. I placed mine in the middle of the dash and forward toward me with full Mount arm out and it was PERFECT position without distracting my field of driving view...Don't over tighten the joints... I heard that the SUN can melt the glue so time will tell on this part. Would it be funny to make a little cover to protect it from the heat? Maybe too much.
5,The best of the CP holder so far I have purchased and used. I bought two of this cellphone holder one for my Honda Accord and the other  for my CR-V.  I am very satisfied with their design and construction.  Comes with an air vent clipthat can be easily installed air vent louver and also comes with a suction cup mount and even have an extra dashboard stick pad just in case the mounting surface is not smooth enough to hold it. I t hold steady all the time and the CP is easy to slide and just squeeze the clamps and the CP is  safely tucked in place. To release the CP just press the quick release button and the CP can be easily pulled out.  The dashboard assembly Ball joit and a telescoping arm so ityou can position the CP to your satisfaction. One of the great benefit for me is that I don't have to look for my CP when I have to hop in on my vehicles and it's always in front of me and ready for use anytime with no worry.
5,I have complaints it’s perfect does everything great for me as a truck driver!!
5,I only use the vent mount so I will not comment on the suction cup portion of this phone mount. I installed the vent mount and after two days it was slipping a bit so I retightend it and it would hold again. After I few times of this happening I had overtightened the clip and it broke. I contacted the seller and they immediately sent me a replacement clip which was also an upgraded version of the clip. When it arrived there were no installation instructions and I ended up attaching it incorrectly and was unable to remove it. I contacted them again they recreated what I had done wrong and gave me a solution to fix it. After following their instructions to remove it I attached it properly and installed it in my car.  I've been using it for a little over a month now with no troubles! It stays securely on the vent and it holds my phone securely as well. I definitely recommend this product and with the amazing customer service would definitely buy from them again!
4,This worked great for the first couple of months on my dashboard. Once the weather started to warm up it started to fail. At first it was every once in a while but over time it became a daily issue and then finally just stopped sticking at all. It's a shame because it did great in the beginning.
4,I drive a tractor trailer for a living and have tried many different mounts and after 2 months I can say this is best bar none.
5,So far so good. I have been using for a week. The suction works good. It has not came off hoping it doesn't. I have a galaxy s10 with a case and holds well. Has a release button which makes it easy to grab phone and go.
3,I like the design and materials used for this style phone mount however it’s still not made to hold onto phones with thicker cell phone protective cases. I have a recharging battery pack (almost an inch thick) built into my protective cover which makes it impossible to find the right dash cell phone holder to mount it securely. I’m still looking for the perfect holder but I do like what this holder has to offer for just a cell phone only.
5,I have had this mount in my 2014 Ram 2500 4x4 for 50000 miles. Got it almost a year ago. It just has today lost suction and fell. I cleaned both surfaces and stuck it back on the dash and totally expect it to last another 50000 miles. 5stars for sure  highly recommend!  * iPhone with Otter Box case. *
5,Solid easy to apply and very satisfied
5,Great product….. very good grippers and button release.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Trust me when I say I’ve tried multiple ones…this is very useful and sturdy.
4,I'm satisfied
5,Sticks quite well to the dashboard and also has an air-vent option. The phone clamp swivels to you and will hold the phone firmly even in rough roads.The swivelling clamp and arm for the dashboard option make it easy to adjust phone position and angles.What takes a bit of leaning is how to clamp the phone  - you need to press the small release button on the side to release the clamp fit the phone then push it in to fit. Also takes a while to learn how to loosen the clamp from the vent to the dashboard holder - you need to completely loosen the knob at the back then slowly but firmly pull the holder off.Very solid product compared to other options and I would highly recommend it.
5,I use this with a Samsung Note 10+ a big phone and there is room to spare when I try to load it and when you close it down nice cushioned support holds it tight.  Note; I have it attached to the front of my dash a vertical surface and so far it is working great but I live in a colder climate.  However if I need to move it in the future to a different location on my dash I will instead of buying a different one.  The design and function of this unit is great.  Highly recommend.
4,The air vent holder is amazing. You can adjust it to you liking while keeping your phone steady contained in the clips. I was nervous about the price and quality compared to other cell phone holders. but this item will hold up to any of the more expensive brands. It works perfectly.
4,Works pretty well but a couple of things would make it better. The suction cup vacuum pressure is not adjustable the sticky pad adhesive is not strong enough so I cant use this the phone holder on my dashboard and the vent tool is a little too short so my phone cant fit within the holder in my car.
3,As my product review with the first order company did reply back to make things right which I really appreciate. They sent me a free disk phone holder to try and I am very thankful for all effort and great costumer care they showed me. They do really care about the impact of their products to valued costumers.I apologize for the long rating the 2nd one provided to me worked for awhile... couldn't really figure out why it falls after being put in the disk slot for at least few days... I enjoyed the moments I've used it it is very cool. Again very sorry for any inconvenient I have cost as a costumer but I will be only rating costumer care service effort of the company great communication/ response....Didn't do what the advertising claimed.... Suction is badly poor👎🏽👎🏽 Waste of my money 💰 💰 "1 STAR FROM ME!!!!" I ordered new Suction to replace the bad batch i got!!! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! I learned alot from working in plastic manufacturing on how business works for 8 years from being a temp employee to becoming the 3rd shift Quality Lead. I bought this around the beginning of this year⏳. I belive🤔. Instead of returning it I just went ahead and kept it and try to fix it ourselves🤳🏽🧲 Then we forgot all about it for quite awhile⏱ I was just going through my history then I saw this🤔 I'm  only sharing my experienced with this product📦
5,When I was driving for the different delivery apps this was wonderful for holding my phone.
4,The holder is a nice design. Grips the phone well release button very satisfying to click. Air vent clip broke a year in but the 12 month warranty allowed me to get a new one free of charge. Customer representative May was very helpful and accommodating. She responded to my emails very quickly and got a new clip in about a week. Thank you May.
5,This purchase turned out so good in spite of several negative reviews. I am very pleased.I followed the instructions and waited 48 hours before mounting the base and arm. Works great!
4,Very solid mount.  Warning... the adhesive is good so make sure you have it where you want it before applying.  Mine isn't coming off without some force.
5,This product lives up to its detailed description.  I've had other Phone holders and none of them have been as easy to use as this one.  It came with a Sticky Pad to affix to my dash which is porous making suction impossible.  This Sticky Pad has a smooth top finish for a strong suction by the mount.  I followed the directions and let the sticky pad cure for 24 hours before attaching the mount.  Once the mount was attached it was very solid.  Popped my phone in and a way I went.  Needed map directions and I was able to touch my phone without any issues.  I wish I had found this product sooner as it will be the last one I'll ever by (might need new sticky pads if I get a new car).  Thank You for making such a Great functional phone mount.
3,*Update* it says my phone is compatible (iPhone 12) but seems too heavy for the hardware. The round plastic knob broke and my phone is always tilted down. Didn’t want to have to purchase an entire new mount so I messaged the seller about purchasing a replacement part and have not heard back. Changed my rating because of this! I’ll be looking into another more durable mount.So after following instructions: cleaning dash with alcohol letting it dry sticking dash pad & leaving it for 72hrs … the phone and mount came falling down. The dash pad did not stick! However I have it suctioned to my windshield and the suction is good so far it’s been about a month. I bought this with the intention of using it on the dash so there’s some disappointment there other than that I like the way my phone is secure in the mount and I have the option to use the vent clip if needed. That deserves 4/5 stars alone however the seller should consider giving more than one dash pad cause once it falls off it cannot be reused only purchased and that feels a little unfair.
4,This phone mount works great holding a phone.  I have only had installed for one long road trip (approximately 2000 miles) and this mount held two different phones one with a case and the other without a case very security and can be adjusted from my mounting location on the dashboard to be easily within reach and view.  Has held up more securely than other cheaper suction mounts I have used in the past.  The ratcheting lock tightly held both phones and the one-touch release is easy and quick to use.  The reason for the 4 star review is that when a phone is not installed in the mount the ratchet mechanism rattles constantly while driving both in the fully open and fully closed position.  I remove the mount and keep in my center console with not in use to eliminate the rattle but it would be nice if I could leave the mount suction cupped to the dashboard full time instead of removing when not in use.
5,I used it once and could not remove it it was extremely hard.  It says not to keep in the sun and I did not but the gel pad was almost impossible to remove and was a bit gooey.  I now left it attached to the inside to my windshield because it's too much work and messy to remove.
5,I had a problem with the phone flipping over because not enough friction at the ball. I sent an email and got a response from Jenny requesting a photo and from that she and Davis determined that I needed a nut to tighten it and sent 2 to me. It works great. I didn’t know it was missing thanks so much to their great customer service!!!
4,I was really happy with the quality and ease of installing.  However i notice that it bounces quite a lot when driving.  I use the suction cup on windshield so the arm has to extend all the way for me to reach my iphone 11 pro.  I am guessing that the combination of phone weight and extension just results in a bounce.  it could be fixed with a more rigid arm.
4,Edit*: The manufacturer reached out to me shortly after writing this review and not only replaced the old clip free of charge they will be sending me a new one once they revise this version AND updated my warranty to a lifetime. Lily was super quick to reach out and has been so much help.Thanks for making this great experience.I've had this for little over a month I really liked it at first but after just a few car rides the clip for the vents started to get loose so I would have to constantly readjust it. Just yesterday I was readjusting it again and the side of the clip broke off sending the spring and axel flying all over my car.Super disappointed 😔 I really liked this design but it started to not work properly after about 2 weeks and now it's broken.
3,The back side of the charger broke easy  sometimes it charges sometimes it doent
4,Only downfall i did not receive the part for dash. i for holder only for vent. the package was damaged and not included the dash stand. it was suppose to have all parts though it did not have this part. I drive for a living and i needed both parts.
5,So I can't currently speak for the suction and adhesive but the clip for the vent works just fine for me. Needed a new holder as my old one didn't have the bottom portion to support the phone and the sides had worn so my phone had begun to slip out and not ideal when driving clearly. Decent replacement and holder for the vent clip portion.
4,Was hoping to mount on dash buy I did not have the perfect spot so I attached via the ac vent and it works great!
4,Had this about a month so far and working well Super easy to install good suction using the plate that comes with. Only failed once but it was over 100 degrees that day and I had the arm fully extended on some rough roads.Only thing I wish was a slightly larger space in the rear for accessing my phone's fingerprint reader.
4,The holder is easy to install and adjust. Well made. Only issue I have seen is that if you mount it using the base with sticky compound on it it is very hard to remove. Once it got mine off the compound was not usable and without it it would not stick properly.
5,The suction cup is very strong!
5,Bought it to mount to the custom center console I built for my 01 Chevy Z71 4x4. I've put this through bouncy roads4 wheeling and then some and it hasn't even thought about popping off. Love the quick and easy way to lock/unlock my phone in-very easy & simple. Mounted it once and it hasn't moved nor lost suction yet. Great adjustability to get your phone at the angle you want it.
5,I bought this phone holder for my new car but when I received it my phone didn't fit.  I have the iphone 12 Pro Max with a pop socket on the back.  After I sent it back I received a message from the customer service asking what happened.  I explained it to her and she was super quick in helping me out and getting me a product that would work for my phone.  Annie (customer service) was absolutely amazing!  She would respond super fast and just the best person!  Now I have a phone holder that works great!  I would DEFINITELY RECOMMEND this brand!  They will do everything they can to make sure you are satisfied!
3,It's  a nice cell phone holder with different mounting options and position settings. The plastic nut that tightens the swivel to the pad broke on the second time I mounted it. dissapointed
5,My oversized folio case fits perfectly in it.
5,Ordered this product last December and it worked great. Flexible mounting options (air vent windshield dash)  mean you can place it just about anywhere. Unfortunately the air vent clip attachment recently broke when the phone was knocked loose from the mount. Contacted Vicseed (since the Amazon return window had closed) and they responded immediately by sending a new mount free of charge. Opened the package and saw that the new air vent clip has been designed and beefed up to handle bumps and bruises. Installing it today and expect it to hold up much better. I appreciate a well made product but more than that I respect a company that stands behind its products. Vicseed came through.
3,Bought this product March 23rd of this year needed something to keep my husband's hands on the steering wheel. It worked very well at first great suction good handle on the phone great for the drives. Summer came around and because of the heat the adhesive on the suction didn't work anymore without it the suction didn't seem that great either. Our stand fell from our dashboard twice and figured we couldn't keep it anymore.It did great for the time being but figured the heat wouldn't be too bad there's hotter places out there and California weather isn't that bad. Our parking has a roof so I didn't think we would have to worry about the adhesive wearing off much. With all these issues 3 stars seems appropriate should've lasted more than 4 months I think $24 was too much for just a short time. If the weather is better where you are and doesn't get as hot as Los Angeles weather then this may be perfect.
5,This car phone mount is the best I have purchased.  In fact I’ve since bought an additional one for my son. The installation process is simple and quick.  The phone fits snugly rotates 360 degrees and swivels to any direction.  I give my highest recommendation!
4,I loved the look and the actual product but I sold my car and had to remove it from one car to another. After moving it my new car it wouldn’t stick anymore and would fall off. If you only stick it once and don’t move it again you should be just fine.
5,I use the vent support with the phone holder. The phone holder is sturdy and grabs on well with good non-slip rubber faced clamps. This all gets easily released with the press of a button. I also like that it grabs thick phones securely. My wife has a phone with a thick case and a pop-socket on the back. I tucked in the bottom clamp (near where the power cord plugs in) and it grabbed her phone securely with no issues.I do not use the support arm but it looks like it is well made too.
5,What I DO like: Car mount came quickly (package delivered in perfect condition) easy to use have more than one option windshield/dash mount OR vent clip. I tried the vent clip first didn't work as well in my car as I would've liked plus I rely on my vents for air/heat didn't want anything 'blocking' the flow. I decided to try the dash mount found that I liked this better plus the 'arm' pulls out for easier reach of phone. Read the directions as to whether or not you need to use the sticky pad enclosed I did use it. Also make sure you clean the area to stick the pad on if using. I also received a 2nd vent clip from VICSEED it worked great too liked it much more than the 1st clip. The company is awesome at customer service I would DO business with them again. I recommend VICSEED.
5,I like that this phone holder has several options to install it. I decided to install it my car’s vent system instead of using the suction to mount it on the dashboard. It works perfectly!
5,How did I go this long without my cell phone mounted where I could see it? The VICSEED came with two optional mounts--a clip for the fan louvers and a suction cup for the dash. The set included a separate solid mounting circle for dashboards with a textured surface so the suction cup would stay in place. I chose to mount on the fan louvers because of another reviewers' comment about the chance of the cell getting too hot on the dash.The mount comes with a clear set of illustrated instructions and it is easy to assemble and install. Don't try to force the side clips for the cell phone holder look for the release. While I didn't use the dash mount I like the idea of the stand so much I ordered a separate product that adjusts to hold tablets phones kindles etc. to use around the house. Good work VICSEED outstanding product.
5,I did not mount it on my dash I used the pc that you hook it into your air vent. I don't want anything sticky on my dash as its to hard to get off if you don't want it anymore. Holds my Gpower Phone very well and adjustments are decent. I would recommend!
5,I purchased the VICSEED Universal Cell Phone Holder for Car but had issues with the suction cup and needed a replacement part. I contacted Vicseed and reached Davis. Outstanding "personal" customer service...something you don't see much anymore! Vicseed truly stands behind it's product and backs it with a "personal touch." Top quality product and great service...what more do you need?
4,I actually really like this mount for the most part. I have an otter box and a pop socket on my phone case and it surprisingly held it pretty well! (I still take my phone case off because I don’t want to risk it though) The mount is easy to install and adjust and comes with an air vent attachment and a suction cup attachment. I used the suction cup aaaaand that’s where my issue lies. :/ The mount’s connection to the suction cup is basically worthless - the cup adheres just fine! But it’s connected to the rest of the mount in such a way that the whole mount can shift around in a circle on top of it. There’s no way to adjust this unfortunately and I’m still trying to rig something to keep it in place. I think I’d still recommend the mount but I do wish I’d known in advance!!!
4,I have used several cheap products that eventually stop working after holding the weight of my phone for so long. Using the mount for the air vent the products strength has held up to the weight of my Galaxy Note 8. The only reason for a 4 star is that it is slightly difficult to adjust how it holds the phone.
5,Finally aphone holder that doesn't give out when the weather is hot. And I love the fact that my phone is not in the air vents.
5,I drive a small car with tiny air vents and a very sloped dashboard and could never find a place to set my cell phone while driving. The suction cup on the VICSEED is smaller than others I've tried so I can use it in the left corner of my windshield without it blocking my view of the road. The suction is super strong too - it has lasted all summer in the heat without falling off once. It's also super easy to set the phone in the holder and a quick squeeze secures it in place. Easy one button touch removal makes this the ideal cell phone holder. Couldn't be happier!!
5,I’m buying another one for my other car
5,We've had one of these mounted in the car for about 6 months. It works so well I bought another and mounted it on the Can Am Maverick UTV SxS.  This past weekend we were on the trails for over 40 miles of bumpy riding (way more aggressive than most vehicles would ever encounter) and it held in place perfectly! I did take the extra precaution of using the optional dashboard pad to stick the suction pad on. This was a lot cheaper than the RAM Mount alternative although I've bought used and really like their accessories as well.10/13/20 UpdateWe've traveled over 200 miles of off-road trails since I mounted this in our SxS and it hasn't budged. It's been more reliable than I would have imagined since probably only 20 miles have been on the road the rest has been on bumpy Minnesota off-road trails. My phone has been mounted the entire time for its GPS.
4,Whereas I had previously written a somewhat negative review I would like to amend it.  The product did not work for me as it didn't fit in my vents.  Customer service responded immediately and offered to find a solution.  I chose not to do so but they graciously refunded my money even though it was past the date to do so.  What I would say about the product is that is well made but you have to be sure you can get it to stay on your vents.  Customer service will help you.  I am guessing that it will fit most vents just not mine.  Do not be reluctant to buy this product it's a good overall design.
4,We found it hard to attach it to the dashboard because the surfaces were not flat and smooth.  So we used the vent clip and that worked very well.  Easy to see not distracting.
4,I like your product mounted
4,1) I need an extra sticky pad for a second-choice location.  I know they're available (not sure of the size match yet) and I don't want to order a dozen.2) Big miss: a normal phone case will not fit.  Naked phone only.  It only takes a minute either way - but it's another thing to get lost in between this and the other thing.  And I really prefer to keep my phone in its case.
5,This product has exceededy expectations. It is hard to find a mounting system that is wide enough for my phone this one just barely makes it. It sticks to my dash very well it holds the phone firm and has not broken I bought another for my second car and a third for my mom. I highly recommend it!
5,I absolutely love this cell phone holder! I had another one before this one and it was horrible.I purchased it over a year ago and recently just got a new car and went to switch it and the suction did not want to work as good so I wrote the company and they sent me out a new one right away.So happy with this company and the product highly recommend!
5,Need the circular piece that holds the phone base. Mine broke
5,Just came in today compare to my old Iottie it cames with more accessories even better quality this sticking pad is hard plastic compare to soft Iottie pad which keep making the suction cup fell off I believe this new thing won't fall off during summer again. Also it comes with a additional vent adapter which allows you to adjust the tightness to the vent I have already set it up and tried it my phone stays in place and doesn't wobbie. Speaking of the holder it has a relatively larger back support than my old Iottie very easy to use with one touch both arms release there are pads in arms to make sure the phone holding in place both arms are very large as advertised my girlfriend's phone case has a ring in the back it doesn't fit my old Iottie but this new holder solve this issue. It's very flexible like you can adjust it to whatever angle you want also if you have a large phone like me(pixel 2 XL) you can pull down the bottom pad so your phone will be hold in the middle this thing really worth the money atleast for me it is.
5,I’ve been looking for a windshield/dash mount phone holder for awhile since the last one broke. I read the reviews for this one and decided to give it a chance. I am so happy with it the suction power is ridiculous I have to fight to take it off! There’s no worries about it flying off while driving that’s for sure!!!I can’t comment on the adhesive for the dash or the vent clip because I won’t use either. I have a 2014 Honda Accord and it suctions perfectly to the windshield and the dash with no problems.TMy only minor gripe is that I can’t turn it the way I want to in the position I wanted.Great product! It also comes with a 12 month warranty so you really can’t go wrong.
5,So far it has stayed stuck to my dash without using the adhesive disc...even through some very cold Michigan winter days/nights. I like how adjustable it is but with the phone in it it sometimes jiggles and gets bouncy when on a bumpy road. But it's very convenient and much safer than having to look down at the console or cup holder area of my car.
4,Works just like it should.
5,I have a Motorola G7 Power with a large high protection case. My vehicle had an MPOW holder which has held to my dash very well but a lot of times my phone would not stay on the actual holder very well due to its size. This is an excellent replacement. It stayed on my dash without having to use the included disc. It is just the right size to hold my phone securely and opens and closes smoothly.I do not use vent clips in the car since I like my heater on quite high but it is an excellent design I ended up clipping it to a part on my computer case and using the old MPOW holder which was compatible for a handheld radio..so no waste there!
5,I liked that it was exactly as described. Packaged well. No damage. I especially liked the 18 month warranty it came with. I did have a slight problem with the Scan QR code. Fortunately I emailed vicseedcustomersupport and May helped me. She didn't just give me directions to troubleshoot. She completed the warranty and activated it for me! I only needed to provide her with the Amazon ID order number. Then poof! A few minutes later she emailed me back telling me I was all set! Saved me time and a headache.Thank you May!
5,I purchased this for my 2002 grand Cherokee.  At first I thought it would be wonderful and the sticking power was really good. But when the cold weather came under 10°F it lost its power and fell off. I was happy it had a second way to mount it on the vent. It has an awesome quick release to pop the phone out. Great connectors to snug it to the vent. Easy to turn sideways. Hold and iPhone XS without dragging on the vent fins. I think the suction part would be really good in warmer climates it had excellent sticking power until the temperatures fell in my area of Pennsylvania. The company was excellent. Very friendly and offered me a refund but since I’m using it I didn’t feel it was appropriate. They then offered me a CD Mount Which I have never heard of and accepted this even though I was happy with what I had. So you can’t beat the company they go the extra mile to make sure you are satisfied.
5,I never actually used the dashboard mount because it turned out that the shape and height of the dash prohibited the mount from placing the phone in a convenient location. However I did use the air vent mount and it worked perfectly where other air vent mounts failed for various reasons. I love this mount it is convenient and the handy screw assembly for attaching it to the vent works much better than other spring loaded mounts. Further and key feature was the somewhat longer arm that held the phone about 2” away from the vent; critical to mounting in my car with recessed vents. The actual assembly that clamps the phone is the best I have seen and works exceptionally well being easy and convenient to insert or remove the phone quickly. This is the best vent mount I have seen and recommend it highly. The dash mount is well made and amazingly versatile but in my case the vent mount was more convenient. Amazing to me to have both high-quality options in one purchase.
5,I really like it.
4,The dash top of my car has a subtle curve so I was afraid this wouldn’t stick. I’ve been using the long arm holders that stick to the windshield but they block a bit of view. After cleaning the area I applied the sticky pad that is included to help adhesion. Well the darned thing kept falling off. With nothing to lose I attached the holder directly to the flattest part of my dash and voila’...it stuck perfectly! After about a week of use it’s still firmly attached. The phone release button is in a different place than the old one so I’ve been grabbing and pulling until I realize the release button isn’t on the back. If it can handle my inadvertent rough grabbing and pulling I expect it to have no problems with regular use.
4,I have mounted this in different places in my service vehicle. Happy with it.
5,Good quality  long arm  good value
3,I searched and searched to find a car mount that would hold an OtterBox commuter case because they are thicker and heavier particularly with an iPhone 11. I’ve only had this for a week but it definitely seems to clip more securely in the vent. The clip goes fairly far back and one can tighten it pretty well. I did not want to go through the hassle of getting a new phone case and the suction cup really wouldn’t work in my older car. Fingers crossedUPDATE MAY ‘22 - still holding phone fine. No flopping.
5,I haven't technically used the product however I did test fit it to my vent in my vehicle and I am totally satisfied. The products fits snugly to the vent without any looseness and it holds my phone perfectly. I haven't used the suction cup portion because I really don't like anything in my windshield. Overall I am satisfied.
4,I own an iottie and have had a few of them over the years. The VICSEED is most definitely a direct competitor to the iottie brand of cell phone mounts. This product over all is built better in most area’s except for the cellphone clamp. I find that in my vehicle it takes a second more to mount the phone because you have to manually clamp the phone in place where as the iottie is spring loaded. Over all this product is fine and you will only miss out on a little extra convenience found in the iottie. You won’t be sad if you get either one.
4,This phone cradle surprised me for the $$ it costs.  I have a couple of high dollar cradles that don't hold up as well as this one has so far.  The suction cup has a gel that is VERY sticky.  Make sure it's where you want it because it's a BEAR to break the gel loose from the mounting pad they include with it.  But it has stood up to all the vibrations and bouncing that my truck and the rough highways can dish out!  My expensive cradles lose suction and fall down but this unit mounted to my dash just stays right where I put it.  I'm going to order another fairly soon for my car.
5,This purchase is my 3rd and 4th purchase of unit.  1st was for me.  2nd I referred to family member.  3rd and 4th is for other friends.  Suction is good easy to mount and install; easy adjustments.  Myself and family member have Plus phones or huge phones (Note9 and Note20).  I love how with one hand I can eject and pop out phone with a button press and how I can slide the phone into dock (with one hand).  Great unit!
5,Wonderful product and infact they provide a great customer support. Airvent holder broke after 2 months but they provided excellent customer service. They sent me replacement part as soon as I emailed them and also followed up with me if the product was working fine. This is a honest review and not influenced by the seller. This product is a clear go to product if you prefer a good quality mobile holder for your car.
5,BEST DASHBOARD HOLDER EVER! Not some cheap quality product amazing suction and STABILITY! Everything I was looking for in a good system is in this one. Did a lot of research before buying but this one is by far the best to this date.
5,This phone holder works great in out 2021 CRV in the smooth flat area about the navigation screen. Holds great. You can still see the date/time small screen if you mount to the right of the smooth area. You can have charger attached easily while in this holder.
5,I love this! I live in Arizona so it gets very hot here and I had this during summer of last year and to this day it still sticks. You just gotta be patient and follow the instructions. Overall good product if you were to Uber or do some deliveries 😊😜👍🏻
5,Purchased this in January 2021 and the adhesive already is not working. I live in NE PA so it’s not attributed to hot weather which I could’ve understood. II tried to get support but didn't hear back from them for a week and then all of a sudden I did hear from them. The customer service was excellent. They would've given me a refund if I wanted but since the product is really well made I opted for more adhesive pads. They were very apologetic and very nice.  This car mount is very nice to others that I bought for less money so I really wanted to keep it.  They suggested that I remove it when not in use so I will try that.
5,I have bought three phone holders so far and this one by far is the best. I did not use the suction part. instead I hooked it up to my vent and the fact that it has two parts to secure it makes it a better fit it is sturdy and stays in place.
5,Best holder I have used. Other phone holders have been good but not like this one.
5,Got this for my IPhone 13 Pro Max in an otter box and so far it fits perfectly. Hasn’t popped out stays suctioned onto my dash. Have only had it a couple days but so far so good. I’ll update my review after a couple months.
5,I've gone through many phone holders - this one is fantastic!  Love the easy placement and removal of the phone - holds it very securely.  I have an SUV so the phone was often flying out of the old holder.  This holder holds it incredibly securely!
4,The quality and look was great but when it didn't hold my IPhone 11 with the popup on the back it was no good for me. I found that this new phone for me was a bit slippery and large to hold and I really need to keep the popup on it so I won't be able to use this holder. I don't know why they couldn't have made the arms a little more extended. I don't think it would have taken away from the look or been in the way of anything.  Fortunately my friend needed one for her car so I gave it to her and loves it. The price was very reasonable too for the quality.
5,I got this product a few months back and loved how easy it was to use and the quality of it! I was adjusting it one day and tightened the lock nut on it too tight and it cracked…it happens! They all have their pressure thresholds. I contacted vicseed and told them what happened. They were AWESOME and sent me TWO new lock nuts free of charge! And I got them in just a few days too!
4,The car mount has worked pretty well for me and I have had no issues attaching it to my car. I mainly use it with the air vent mount and it seems pretty sturdy. My one complaint is that I feel like the mechanism that locks my phone in place is a little finicky. It sometimes feels like it is a bit loose even though I can't tighten it anymore. I spend a little time trying to adjust and then eventually give up. The phone has not fallen out or anything it just doesn't feel super secure and locked in place.
4,nice product!! the only problem is that I had a popsocket in the back of my phone and it did not hold my phone too well. My phone would pop out and fall while I drive. I suggest not to have popsocket or if you want the popsocket get something else.
5,I have a bandolier strap/case for my iphone 12 pro so it's heavy even when I don't detach the strap. This phone holder is sturdy enough to keep my phone upright and visible. I did have an issue with the adhesive coming loose on the plastic suction disc but I emailed customer service and Jenny immediately sent me a replacement that has been working well. I was very impressed with the response time and solution. Would definitely buy again from this seller.
5,I stuck this on the little side window of the driver's side of my Prius V. I run a power cable from the cigarette lighter over the steering column to the phone stand. I'm happy with this product. It is stable and holds my iPhone 12/13 securely. I can release the clamp with one hand but need a second to pull out the power cord. I would buy this again.
5,This was easy to mount on windshield and adjusts so as not to block your important view hold your model phone. It's easy to slip the phone into the holder and easily snap the sides into correct snug fit then release them to remove your phone. You can also mount on your dash.  Very pleased. :)
5,I used this first in a large rental SUV mounted on the upper corner left corner of the windshield and it was great for a long trip.  Then I moved it to my smaller car where the vent mount has worked best.  Both mounts were secure and my iPhone 13 Pro Max easily slips in/out.
5,I bought this mount to replace one I’d had for a few years. I prefer the vent mount as my old Subaru doesn’t really have a dashboard to support the suction or adhesive variety. My old one only had clips that slid onto the vent and with time the clips cracked and it kept falling off.I LOVE this one for two major reasons.First the clip that goes on the vent actually screws down tightly.Secondly the holder itself has a button to pop it open to place your phone in and you simply squeeze it together to hold the phone tightly. It has padding along the sides as as well. My old one required force to open it to put the phone in.It swivels easily depending on how tightly you screw it to the vent fin.
5,I mounted the holder using the AC vent Oliver method which worked well for me; so I can’t comment on suction/adhesion. Inserting the phone into the holder is simple and very secure. The entire assembly looks very well made and is easy to use
5,I bought this for my wife’s car after reading the reviews.  It has two options to hold your phone the dashboard mount or the fan vent.  I wasn’t very keen on the fan vent but the suction mount seems to be holding up in the California heat.  I didn’t need to use the adhesive disk that came with it.  I cleaned the dash with a alcohol pad to remove any fine dirt. Then used the suction cup to attach it to the dash. It’s been rock solid.  I like the phone clamp mechanism and it’s has fairly good adjustability. So we’re happy with it and would recommend it.
5,I have used this for my iPhone XS Max and my new iPhone 13 Pro Max.  It works beautifully on the windshield.  I have had to replace it because the windshield got too hot in the sun and warped the adhesive stuff.  As for using the holder in the air vents very shaky but it works.
5,I bought this item at the end of July and it is already broken. Needless to say I am super disappointed. I really liked it and it was working really well but now it is unusable as it will no longer hold secure to my air vent.----------EDIT: I am amending my initial review because after reaching out to VICSEED customer service my problem was handled swiftly and abundantly. The team at VICSEED sent me out a new product with expedited shipping that arrived within 2 days. Lily also extended my warranty to include lifetime coverage. They were apologetic about their broken product and wanted to make it right. Good customer service wins every time in my book. I bought the product because of it's good reviews and it has been good for me so far!!
5,Easy installation. I am using mine in the air vent. Instructions in the manual are simple. I like that once it is in the air vent you can tighten the part that clips to the vent. My previous phone holder (Beam Electronics) fell off the vent frequently. This Vicseed seems very secure. So far so good.
5,I got this holder for my Google Pixel 4a phone. I needed it for when I travel. I had it clipped on vent and it suddenly snapped off. The piece clip snapped and broke. I contacted seller and they sent me new piece. It's good for now. Hopefully it does not break again.  Otherwise besides that I like the holder. Holds phone good.
5,After submitting my original ‘disappointed’ review I was contacted by Lily with a request to be afforded the opportunity to make my experience right.  And within a very short period of time she did exactly that.  I couldn’t be happier with the mount now and was so very pleased to have received such quality customer service.  I highly recommend this product from this supplier.*******This appeared to be the perfect solution to the hands-free requirements for phone usage while driving.  Once first installed it worked just fine.  I removed the phone mount from the windshield on the first hot day of the season according to the instructions that came with the mount.  The mount no longer sticks to the windshield for longer than a few minutes or until I hit the first bump in the road.  Definitely not worth the money.
4,I really like the mounts the dash and vent mount but one the dash mount it a bit awkward maybe it’s just the way my dash is set up just feels I can’t get the perfect spot for my phone and I spend to much time adjusting the mount and my phone same with the vent mount and two the vent mount weighs down my vent and blocks it over heats my phone during the winter and makes my phone to cold in the Summer so that’s vent can no longer be used but in all I like it the way the button works that releases my phone from mount is perfect I don’t have to force my phone out and mess up my set up trying to get it out
5,Had over a year and this product is very mobile. You can swivel and adjust as need be. Suction power is awesome as it has not fall one time.
5,I bought this in May and it is still holding up well.  I am using the adapter that screws the device to my vent not the suction.  The adapter tightens down and stays snug in the vent.  The cell phone holder attaches securely to the adapter.  When I get into my car I place it in the bracket and gently squeeze the sides together until it is snug.  To remove it I depress the quick release button on the left side and out it comes.
5,Cannot go wrong with this one. I decided to buy this one after reading that it can be used either with its suction cup or clipped onto a/c because I was not sure whether the suction cup way would work because the upper part of console panel in my car is not very smooth.Turned out it worked really well pretty stable great suction power.  Pretty easy to use.Also worth to mention it comes with a sticky pad I guess you can use it to replace the suction cup if the suction cup doesnt work well in your car in this case I guess I can say you really cannot go wrong with this one. But I never have the need to use the sticky pad or clipper.
3,I hooked it to the fan levers and its seems flimsy. I haven't really gotten to use it much yet. I wanted it for travel and I haven't traveled yet. My mind may change after I do.
5,Easy to install flexible installation options and more importantly easy to use grabs phone quickly and firmly and release button works great for quick action.12/28/21: Customer service update I had an issue where the back nut that keeps the phone holder in position broke maybe after over tightening it and after contacting seller I quickly received a part replacement now the holder is fully functional again and it seems that the new nut is a better quality material
5,Good value
5,I have purchased this for the second time to add it to my second freightliner. As my fleet continues to grow I will put one of these on each truck.
5,I use this product with a Galaxy S9 phone and have found it to be solid and easy to use. I love the spring loaded release. The arm joints are super stiff - no bouncing or vibrating. Very well designed.The only issue that I had was that over the winter it feel off the dash during a cold snap and I had trouble getting it to stick back to the dashboard - may have gotten some dirt/grime in the adhesive. I emailed the vendor and they got back to me right away and sent a replacement pad which works great! Very impressive service.
5,I really love my car mount sooo much! It Has been a huge help and I’m so glad I found this one. I searched amazon for hours until I found the perfect one and my phone fits great so I’m super happy. Only thing I would suggest is more adhesion on the additional 3m plate that’s optional. I THOUGHT I needed it for my dash so I tried to use it and the adhesive on the 3m black plate was not great at all and kept falling off BUTT I’m confident no one will really need it since the adhesion on the rubber suction cup worked PERFECT and was/is stronger than I thought it would be. I tried moving the mount to test it out and see if it would budge but the suction is sooooo strong so I love my mount even more for that. Thank you! :) I’m going to buy my bf one next and I highly recommend this to everyone !
5,Perfect fit good materials i like it and recomend the product
5,I installed it on my vent and it is holding tight charging cord works great and easy to remove phone when I leave the car.  I would purchase this product again!  Thanks!
4,I love it but it seems to make my phone hot. I thought the sun was just shining directly on my phone while in the holder but I realized somehow it’s the holder that’s overheating my phone. I just take it out the hold on the long stretches where I don’t need to look at my map for a while.
5,This is the second one of these I have bought. The second one is a little different in the cradle but nothing big. These things are amazing. Great mounting power and different variations.  Look no further for a cell phone holder.
5,Perfect in every aspect of quality!
4,UPDATE;  Betty and the VicSeed team have gone WAY above & beyond to correct the issue and make sure I am a satisfied customer.  The follow-up has been AMAZING.Their A/C vent mount & the CD slot mount work very well and I am HAPPY now with the product.  They make driving safer!  I have not tried the windshield mount they said was improved and sent me.......This product had only been in my car for about 2 months and the adhesive melted stuck on my windshield leaving a mess and the actual phone holder was separated from the adhesive and flopping.  Completely useless.  Of course now it's WAY past the return date.DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!
4,It’s a good product but if it’s in direct heat from the sun for a long time. It will fall off on its own and sometimes I’d be driving using gps and it falls off!!Update:I’m now using the added mini clamp attachment for your air vent and it actually works a whole lot better. It doesn’t obscure my view nor does it fall off in the heat as the main attachment does. My air vents are vertical and they work well with it. Since the attachment can be rotated 360° I imagine it would work with common horizontal ones but I can’t give a guarantee.Update:*********Vicseed provided a type of refund and with that I’m thankful for their customer service.
5,I have an iPhone 11 Pro Max in a case in an older RX350 and this mount works like a charm. Easy to install and it holds the phone and the positions I put it in well.  It came with two install options and I chose the in install in the vent.It just works and works well.  Have waited several months to review and am happy with the quality and function.
5,I have had a number of auto phone holders in my time with mixed results. Typically they kind of work but not necessarily very well. This particular one so far is working well. I am using it with the vent clip. It seems to hold  the phone well and is adjustable so that you can put it into an optimum viewing position. So far it is one of the most effective phone holders I’ve had.
5,Great product. Easy to install. Hasn’t fell off even after several months.
5,Before I bought this phone holder I researched the word "pop socket" among other reviews and did not find anything. But I still took a risk and bought it. Unfortunately as I was afraid this phone holder didn't fit my iPhone 11 with a pop socket. The pop socket prevented the side "handles" from holding and securing the phone in. But I give this product the maximum rating for 2 reasons. The first reason is the high quality of the holder. The mount is very strong and your phone will not move once it is secured tightly. The second reason is because of the quality of customer service. I reached out to the company and told them about the problem. They offered several solutions and we were able to resolve the issue quickly.  Overall I was very impressed but be aware that if you have iPhone 11 and a pop socket it will most likely not work for you.
5,I have tried multiple cell phone holders in the car none of which lived up to my expectations.  I have a Galaxy S10 in an Otter Box case so my phone is a little bulkier and somewhat heavier than most.My granddaughter was the first to get one of these for HER car.  When I saw hers I tried my phone in it and it was great.  So I ordered one for my wife and one for me.  I installed mine upon arrival and have used it multiple times.  LOVE this product!  Easy to use easy to install great quality well worth purchasing!
5,Very good product. Mounts to your dash or ventilation louvers. I use these in all of my vehicles
4,Great holder but release button on the left would be inconvenient to press if too close to a steering wheel. If you put in the vents or on further from the wheel should be great.
4,The suction cup works great and will stick to almost any surface. My dash is curved so there is not many flat spaces that I could put it. Not a problem though because the mount adheres perfectly to a windshield provided it isn't illegal in your state. If that option doesn't work for you the ac adapter works great as a third option. All in all it's a great affordable product.
4,Awesome best one i had
5,Bought it for my daughter’s car. It was easy to install. I like that it locks in place and you can extend the arm.
5,Works wonderful I recommend it to anyone
4,Try to station this in a very "shaded" spot in the car OR get a windshield sun blocker OR gorilla glue it because the sun/heat won't allow it to stay suctioned and it will keep falling off. I glued mines problem solved!! ****
5,I generally wait a bit before providing a review on these sort of things.  The suction is really good.  It's gone through hot and cold extremes and everything else in between and it's not fallen off my windshield yet.  This is sturdy.  I would definitely buy this again.  I have an IPhone 10. It holds my phone and my phone has not fallen out of the cradle except the one time I didn't have it seated in the cradle properly but that was my bad.
4,Compared to similar devices this one has many optional settings to allow you greater flexibility on how you mount your phone.  The trade off is the size of the device and 'arm' the holds the phone is larger than expected and may look bulky on your windshield.It's not a 'spring' loaded holder but a 'clamp' with release type.  It's ok but you have to be good with one hand when mounting your phone to the cradle then compressing the clamp to hold it down.So far so good.
5,First shipment was missing the part that holds the phone. Amazon sent out a replacement order the next day. I took the defective product back to Kohl's for a painless return.The car mount works very well. There is adhesive on the bottom of the suction disk and it adheres very well to a smooth section of my dashboard (Toyota Prius). Car mount is very adjustable and will stay in virtually any position that you put it in. I have 2 6+ inch phones in cases and it holds both with zero issues. The car mount is made out of a rugged plastic that can probably take years of use (I can't measure that at this time).I would heartily recommend this car mount to all of my fellow drivers out there.
4,Makes a good rest for my Iphone. Releases easily
4,This product serves its purpose. I like that in the Georgia heat using the dashboard disc the holder stays attached. My only issue is there is a slight wiggle / vibration but this is due to the bumps in the highway.  Probably the best cell phone holder I have purchased as of late.
5,I was surprised to find it worked so well. I drive a Jeep and there is no movement. Hopefully this is the last one I buy.
5,I bought this for use in the vent and it is absolutely amazing!  My son installed it in less than 10 minutes.  I made a trip to California and it worked great in traffic and on California's windy mountain roads.  It holds the phone completely still and it doesn't slip down or tilt to far forward.  I love it and will probably buy an extra one for when this one breaks.  However it is very sturdy and well made so I'm guessing it will last a while!  I did not try the dash attachment hardware.
5,Used the suction part of it on an old Garmin plate that I'd velcro'd to my dashboard. That way when the time comes I can easily take off the velcro strips and clean it. I'm about to buy another one as I've had to transfer this one back and forth since I've been using it in the house for Zoom calls. It's been a real effort to try to take it off of the pad and transfer it.  That's good! I believe this product is very good and will buy another.
5,I got this for my mom's birthday 4 months ago I waited to write this review to to make sure what I was going to write. It's been great! She loves it! It stays where she put and  she's never had any problems with it. The suction power is amazing even when it's on a surface you think it wouldn't stick to without the extra plate they sent to help out for difficult surfaces. Her phone and case are thick and can be plugged in no problem. I've seen some that they have have to take their case off every time they put their phone in the phone holder No thanks! The've really thought of everything with this one. It will be a gift item for Christmas for others this year and I need to get me one.
3,When I first purchased this it was great! It mounted easily on my windshield adjusted easily and held its position well.Then I put it on a plastic bag to take on an airplane and when I took it out the bag got stuck to the suction cup on the mount.I pulled off most of the plastic from the bag but now it doesn't hold suction at all.Very disappointed. They should at least warn you to keep the original cover that the suction mount came with to use for travel. Then I would still be able to use it.
5,I got this to hold my phone and would you believe it it does just that. I haven’t used the suction cup but it has a grip on that vent that would make Bruce lee proud.
5,This is the first one I’ve found to work in my F-150. Since there isn’t a good place to put a phone holder I removed the mat from the storage tray on the dash and extended the arm of the holder and it works perfectly. The release button makes it easy to get your phone out of the holder as well.I used the vent holders and they were strong but there isn’t enough room between the vent and the gear shift for the phone.
5,I bought this for my husband and he loves it! He travels for work so uses it daily. He uses the vent clip attachment and unfortunately it broke after five months. I reached out to Customer Service and they immediately sent a new clip. Although I don’t feel the clip should have broken so quickly I was very impressed with the customer support I received. Five stars for that reason alone!
5,I use the vent clip instead of the suction cup. I plan on using the suction cup in the future. The vent clip is absolutely amazing!! It has a big nut that allows you to tighten down the vent clip. It works great!!! I have very narrow vertical vents in my 2012 Ford Focus. This is the 3rd vent clip that I have purchased. It is the first that actually works. The way you can tilt the actual phone is a great plus. The easy release button is PERFECT!! It has made my food delivery gigs 1000% better.
5,Overall I'm achually really impressed with this mount. Very versatile and simple at the same time very well designed and strong i plan on having it for years to come. I've use used it for about 2 hundred miles one way trip and it held up nice no shaking or vibrating the suction is strong and I can mount it in Alot of different positions to however im comfortable with it. This kind of quality for the price is unbeatable. My phone has no phone case galaxy note 9 so its a big phone I thought it would vibrate a little but nope held in place very securely. Truly a good product. I will look into other products they sell for sure.
5,These mounts are superb bc they stay put and don't keep falling off. They also have plenty of positions for different needs.
4,Simple and easy to use. Stayed suctioned without the extra adhesive till 100+ temps hit. Then it fell off.
5,I’ve been thru several of these types of dashboard mounts and far and away this one has surpassed the rest in functionality and most importantly durability/support.  I recently had a the tightening bolt crack so I thought I was SOL. But contacted support they sent me two replacement nuts delivered within 72 hours.  Amazing.I will most definitely be trying their other products
4,Overall this car mount met my needs. It allowed for three different ways to mount your phone: suction on the window adhesion to the dashboard or a clip to the vent. I opted to use the clip on the vent which seems to be working well. I tried to use the suction on the window and that did not work at all. The suction is terrible. I did not try to use the dashboard mount. My iPhone 11 Max fit well in the mount.
5,This product works very well. The best car phone holder I bought.
5,This car mount is AWESOME. It took me 5 minutes to set it up in my car including opening the box. So easy!!It is very very easy to adjust and it keeps its position well. With other car mounts I always had a problem of them drooping/slipping and not holding the positions I put them in. I was constantly having to readjust them. Not this one it really stays put.The suction is very secure. All of the adjustable features are great. No matter where you mount it you'll be able to adjust it perfectly to your satisfaction.I easily mounted it on my dashboard. It holds my phone a Galaxy S7 in a folio holder with no problem. The release button makes opening the arms to release the phone super easy.I am 100% satisfied with this car mount for my cell phone. Do I  recommend it for purchase? Yes!
4,This is the first quality phone mount I’ve bought for my car.  It’s sturdy and the adhesive on the suction cup was a lot stronger than I expected it to be.  At first I put the phone mount in the wrong place on my windshield and I was able to peel it off (with a lot of effort) and relocate it.  I’ve been driving with it for a few months now and it’s just as sturdy as the day it was installed.
5,I use the vent mount and it works really well.
4,I have just got this and havent really used it yet. It stayed on through the night at cool temps. Im only doing a review to warn my pop socket lovers to beware. Pop socket is too thick. Maybe with an ultra thin case? I even switched to my thinest case and it still wouldnt fit width wise. This is one that has glitter in it. For now im going to use this case so i can quickly take it off and on to put the naked phone in the holder.
5,Easy to mount and strong resist the sun light on the dashboard. Perfect to hold the phone on the dashboard.
3,I wanted 2 options for mounting. The flat plate didn’t adhere at all to my textured dash surface. Total loss for that option. The vent mount locks in well but has broken a vent louvre. Not too happy with that result.
5,The  VICSEED Universal Cell Phone Holder for Car is really well built.  I need a sturdy mount because of where I drive.  I've gone through 4 or 5 holders.  The Vicseed is the best one I've seen.
5,No problem is holding. Doing it’s job.
5,I'm beyond satisfied..! I was concerned when the instructions indicated - it should NOT be left mounted for prolonged periods in direct sunlight. Apparently the adhesive can be damaged by sunlight.So I built a "Sun Shield" using foil tape for A/C duct work. I discovered this "FIX" for all of my dashcams - which used to be damaged from baking in the sun.This fix allows the holder to remain attached to the windshield. I doubt the fix will work for dashboard mounting but I've always preferred mounting to glass.
4,Update: After I complained I received excellent customer service to fix the problem. I’m now satisfied with my product.- - - - - - - - - - - - - -The air vent attachment lasted for eight months until the crappy plastic clamp broke off the spring. I won’t be buying any other Vicseed products.
5,The adhesive on the clear suction DOES NOT COME OFF EASILY. Pick your spot very wisely if placing directly on dashboard. that being said this is the best phone mount I’ve owned to date. Very reliable doesn’t loosen over time and very user friendly.
5,I have a mid-size truck with nowhere to really put it without it blocking my view except on the far left side.  This actually works out great.  It's been very hot and so far the suction has held up wonderfully.  When I tried using the vents they must be weak or something because the phone was heavy enough to cause it to sway back and forth easily.  Vents aren't a good idea anyway because I don't want hot air blowing on my phone in the winter.  I would recommend this product.  Customer Service has reached out to me to make sure I'm happy and satisfied.  They seem to really care about their product and want the feedback good or negative.
4,Super easy to install. The mount keeps coming loose though. It took awhile for it to stick to my dashboard. It pops off occasionally so that is the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5. I have been using the vent clip lately.
5,I've tried various holders including vent clip magnetic  and cheap rubber band-like easily broken ones.  This one is super solid and holds my phone in a perfect angle to view and reach.  This would be great for all levels of drivers - food/package/people delivery drivers to Sunday school casual drivers.  The phone is super easy to put in and take out of holder.  I have yet to have the holder slip even between adding/removing the phone.  Buy this one!
3,I don't write reviews much but I did want others to know that this product did not work well for my VW Passat.  My dashboard is not flat and the texture is very porous. After I set it up the weight of the phone (due to physics and the leverage) kept loosening the grip of the suction.  I then tried the double sided tape provided and it also did not hold.  I ended up using the small vent clip and that is doing well.  However I'm worried that the vent blade could snap if I'm not careful or one of my kids uses too much force unintentionally.  We'll have to wait and see.In retrospect I would try another product and design if I need to get a new one.
5,Very well made product and I finally found a great location to attach to my driver's side vent window (despite being right handed) as my Prius windshield is too long and angled and the phone would've blocked dashboard displays.I didn't try using the adhesive circle on the (not perfectly smooth) dash didn't want to stick adhesive on there that might never come off.
5,Purchased this product to use in my vehicle. Decided to use the vent mount vent mount broke within first weekof use.  Then tried using the suction cup mount it will not stay on the windshield. Tried using it for an iphone 11 pro max. Folks don't waste your money.*** UPDATE ***12/1/2020... After seeing my review here on Amazon the seller reached out to me directly and took ownership of the problem with the product and without hesitation sent a replacement product to me. I received it today in the mail and have already installed it in my vehicle. This is true customer service people who stand behind their products.
5,This product was very easy to install on the air vent and holds my cell phone perfectly so I can see it while driving.  It has easy to close and release adjustable side guides to hold the phone tightly.  It also comes with an optional suction mount which I have not used.**Update:  I reached out to customer service to place a warranty claim on the air vent clamp which had cracked.  They were very responsive and immediately sent a replacement air vent clip which arrived in 3 days.  Thank you.
5,I did not try the suction unit. The attachment to the vent seems to work well. My phone held up pretty well over bumpy spots .
4,Very sturdy not easy to change adjustments but once you set it up it won't move. It comes with a dash board mounting disk. I have not mounted it yet. Will update it when I do. I bought this in the hopes of using it to use my cellphone as a dash camera. But the tilt adjustment is limited. For regular use it work great.
4,Love this! Works great in the car. However it does not stick to dash at all. No matter where I tried to install it. I habe installed it on the windshield. Adhered great and stays in place. Gave 4 stars because I am sure if you don't like extra stuff on windshield this will definitely be in your vision.....
4,Good cell phone holder it did not end up working for my vehicle the base was to big so I gave it to a friend.
5,Using it to mount my Valentine One radar detector to the screen in my Tesla Model 3.  I have been very satisfied with this mount and highly recommend it.After seven months it came off the screen and would only stay on for a few hours at a time.  I contacted VICSEED Customer Support and asked if they could send me another suction cup - and the next day I received a complete brand new mount.  Fantastic customer service.  I will continue to buy their products.
4,Had to use the connector piece because the initial peice wouldn’t stay but once I used it I had no problems!
4,I have a Toyota Tacoma.  I followed the guide precisely when installing the suction cup base.  I waited the full 3 days for the base to set. It fell off the dashboard after 1.5 hours of use.  The company sent me a replacement and guidance on how to better install it.  It now works correctly.
4,I liked it - well made and a better price than you can find in a retail store.  Had to return it though because  there wasn’t a good spot on my dash to install it.  It was obstructing my view of the infotainment system screen. Ended up getting a holder that attached to the car dashboard vents instead
4,It works great but took off a star cause I have to pull off my case every time I use it
5,Car dashboard mounted and works very well to hold your phone. Love it!
5,Had this for about a week and a half and so far it has held up well.  Bought it to use while driving for a ride sharing service so to avoid blocking part of my view.  Find out something great about it too...the part that holds the phone was compatible with another product I bought (a wireless charging base) which I now use instead.  Now I can charge the phone simultaneously or use what I used prior.  Will recommend this to other to try too but for now ordering a second one for this Ms.  One last thing before I end  this the adhesive is very very strong stuck it to one of my old base and it basically was hard to remove guess it will stay there for now though it will take effort to release.
5,This is the 2nd one that I have ordered I liked the first so well. I recommend this cell phone holder because it is well made adheres well and hold my SE securely.
4,I’ve had this product for 2 months now at the beginning it stayed on my dash really well! 10/10 I love the product just didn’t stay attached to my dash for as long as I would’ve liked. Now it doesn’t even reattach it was good while it lasted!
5,I really like my Vicseed Cell Phone Holder for the car.  They make some of the best out there.  It was reasonably priced and very well made.  There are all kinds of adjustments to make the phone sit exactly wherever you need it to.  But what really made an impression on me was their response to my mistake. The unit comes with an adhesive mounting disc and just my luck the disc slid off my leg and fell right between the seat and the console!  I could not get anything in between there to retrieve it.  I reached out to Vicseed to request another disc and they quickly sent not one but two replacements so now I have a spare. Thank you Vicseed!
5,Well made and durable. I would suggest this over the other brands.
4,It’s easy to install and very Versatile. I like that I can extend the arm down below the dash so I still maintain full vision through my windshield. Plus the AC vent keeps my phone from overheating.
5,Great product. Have been using for month and have not came off. Would definitely recommend this phone holder
5,I just received my vicseed Universal Car Phone Mound and installed it. Although I have not had the opportunity to use it on the road I don’t foresee any problems. The installation was simple I’m my case I used the provided stick on dash plate and attached the suction cup to it. It appears to be well made and although I didn’t use it the air vent clip was the nicest I’ve ever personally seen (I’ve through the corse of time have installed about ten car cell phone holders). The holder is secure to the dash and the position of the phone is rigid.
5,It actually holds an iPhone 8 with a sturdy case! I keep mine on the vent and it actually stays on the vent! I love this phone holder! I know that sounds CRAZY! But I have spent so much $$$$ on phone holders that have NOT worked THIS ONE WORKS!!!!!!!!
5,I have this attached to a vent in my Mazda cx5 and it works great.
5,I’ve had this mounted on my dash in my 2016 Silervado for over a year. It works great holds the phone securely and can use the camera while in holder. I live in Green Bay so it gets quite cold in the winter and it has never fallen off.In all honesty the mount came off one time during the summer and I cleaned it with a Lysol wipe and reapplied and zero issues since.I would 100% recommend this mount to friends and family and both my sons have actually purchased them too!
4,Really fits well on the windshield. Definitely not for the dash jumps right off. Have on the windshield a few months now sticks really well. Don't get if you want it stuck to the dash. Also don't want to break my fan vents so I did not try that connection method.
4,The clip that holds the phone is slipping. I regret getting it. Hopefully it last and I don’t have to get another in a few months.** Update**Even though I given 2 stars for the first review. I will have to give it 4 stars now. The customer service is amazing. They reached out to me after seeing the review on Amazon. I wasn’t expecting it at all and was taking the loss on this one.  They mailed out another holder at NO cost. I truly hope this one works. Again amazing custom service and really want their customer to be help with its product.
5,I attached the phone holder directly  on the dash and then maybe 3 mos later it came unstuck. I let the Vicseed customer service know and they sent me 2 replacements free of charge. You need a perfectly flat thing to stick it on so they sent me the plate that sticks better. It's great they stand behind their product. I really enjoy my phone holder especially the extendable attachment. It's been really helpful and I'm glad I came out of the dark ages and finally got one of these.
5,This product is worth the money. I used it for my roadtrip from Florida to Minnesota and it didn't even come off the dashboard at all. It's still stuck on the dashboard.
5,This is a great high quality product. I bought it awhile ago so I’ve spent some time with it. It works great. Very sturdy. Even in 100 degrees weather it held up like a pro. Never fallen. Very strong grip on window.
5,This holder is extremely high quality and adjusts to absolutely any position you want it to.  My 92 year old mother has cameras at her home and someone stays with her most of the time.  However on times when no one is available I watch her on my cell phone.  In the past I found it difficult to watch her while driving especially when she would move from room to room causing me to have to click on different buttons.  This was not safe while driving.  This holder has resolved that problem and I feel much more comfortable with being able to drive and glance over to watch her on the camera.  It is very easy to put my phone onto it and it holds it very securely. It is a quality product.
5,I needed a new holder for use in my car and have a Samsung Galaxy S9 as well as an iPhone X.  This item holds both phones securely with no movement at all.  Both phones have outer protective cases and the adjustable holder fits them both tightly.  My cupholder is on the floor of my car so the suction cup on this item was very useful making it able to mount on a shelf near the center of the car.  Keeps my phone near but out of my line of sight when driving.  Highly recommend!!!
4,I would have given it 5 stars but the mount shakes a lot driving! I use my phone as a dash cam and the video is a bit shaky! Otherwise it works well!
4,The plate used to put in the dash was absolutely terrible and suction cup had so much adhesive from the plastic peel on it... felt like it should of been the other way around. This attached to my window just fine but that wasn’t what I was looking for. I’ll buy a different suction mat for this mount.Was contacted and was sent a new Mount. That was much better then the previous one. Would like to thank the company for the support.  4 stars
4,I like that you can take it off if I want it to clip it to my vent if I want to. That it was affordable. Simple. I can adjust it forward and turn it.
5,This product worked perfect for my pontoon boat.  The suction stayed secured with no issues.  Excellent customer service from this seller.  Very quick response times and over all service!!!!
5,The best thing I got as a new driver :). It helps alot. We can adjust it accordingly. Also it's really easy to place the phone and remove it. And very easy to install. Thank you so much for the wonderful product :).
5,Just installed it today. Was easy to install...instructions were clear...works as expected. Would definitely recommend!
5,Installed this in my truck that I drive for work.  I drive over 10 hours a day and I am amazed how this has never fallen off from where I mounted it.  I mounted mine in the windshield.
5,I can't begin to count how many phone holders I have bought through the years. This moves in any direction you want. It has a very strong grip. It can stick to your window or your dash. My dash is angled so it is almost impossible to mount anything there. Thanks to the piece they give you to put on your dash I now have it on my dash and positioned it in the direction that was perfect for me. It holds tight and will hold those real wide phones like my Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. I absolutely recommend this cell phone holder.
5,For some reason Amazon rejected my original review because I gave feedback on the seller ... even though it was positive feedback.. so all I will say is I am happy with this product... I have to admit I have a large cell phone and I have not gained 100% confidence if the suction will hold but we will see in time...
5,I have an Apple XS Max and had trouble with my last holder being to small in height for my phone.  It kept tipping forward.  This one is perfect.  It seems high enough for my phone.  The release is quick and my phone stays there u til I take it out because of the bottom holder part.  It seems well made for an inexpensive phone holder.  Been using it about 5-6 weeks and am very happy.
5,I've bought many dashboard phone holders and this one is the best one that I've ever bought. Easy to use. I'm not waiting for the arms to release anymore. These arms move fast. I can get my phone released in a second and be on my way. I've never had a suction cup hold as much as this one does. If you're looking for something that holds your phone easy to install/adjust and aren't waiting for a minute for it to release your phone then I would recommend this one.
5,I had my windshield replaced and the mechanic ruined the adhesive of my car holder. I contacted Customer Support and they responded within a day and sent me a replacement device.
5,I got this because I loved that there were 3 different ways to mount in your car. I bought one for my mom for her job and she LOVES it. It was easy to mount to her dash in her Beetle and holds her phone well. I was worried that it wouldn't fit with the big Otter Box on it but it does!! Then I got myself one and it fits my Galaxy S8+ with case really well too. The suction works really well and we've been really happy with the purchase.
5,So I need to declare I do have my phone's weigh resting on the dashboard so in saying that I can tell you it has supported my phone up right and I am very happy with it.
4,Extremely nice product the description is accurate and the quality is fantastic. The problem I have is my iPhone 12 Max Pro does not fit in it with my leather case on. Nice product for people who do not use cases or have a smaller phone.
5,Item is identical to picture. Received via mail rather quick. The item fits perfectly on my windshield. I really like this item. Great item to purchase if you need a phone mont for your car.
4,Company reset me a new holder customer service I'd good replyed fast and received a new holder with in a day. Will try this one out for a week and see how this one works then will send another review person I've been texting back and forth is Kristen was on the BALL thanks for your help
5,This holder is suitable for my auto and cell phone. It is easy to install on Dashboard and air vent. It works well in both positions. And it is easy to get help from the support service by VICSEED.
5,It has been great.  I can use different phone covers and it works well with all of them
5,This product is very well made Don’t hesitate to purchase it! If you do have a problem they will fix it for you. My air vent Clip did break but I contacted them and they sent me a new Clip free of charge. I’ve had the new Clip for a few months now and no issues! I’ve Never had a problem with the suction power or adhesion of the dashboard/windshield  mount I’m able to use it on my dashboard and not  have to worry about my phone falling. Michael was very helpful when I needed a replacement Clip and make sure I was satisfied.
4,If you have a dense case or at the very least a pop socket... you may want to get a thinner case or ditch the pop socket. This thing doesn’t accommodate depth. Length and width however are great. It’s study from the arm to the suction cup. The ball joint that holds the device itself is somewhat flimsy but tighten the screw in the back once in a while and that should fix that. Not worse the price but certainly an ok product
5,Product worked great had a little adhesion problem after 1 year in the hot Florida sun but the customer service agent I dealt with went above and beyond to help me correct it
5,I bought these as a demo from my fleet vehicles.  So far they have worked great.  I have one in my car that is parked in the sun most of the day (104 the other day) and have no issued with it sticking and staying on the windshield.  It hold my phone with a case securely and has little vibration movement.  Very sturdy and the option to mount this three different was was a bit success.
5,If you follow the directions the product works well.  I  attemepted to assemble without reading the directions.  I had everything correct accept let the stand for the suction cup settle for 24hr before mounting and using.  I could not get the suction cup off the mounting stand so I let it all settle for 24hr.  After the 24hr passed the stand worked like a dream. It fits my Samsung Note 9 and my son's Iphone 12 Max Pro. I would recommend this product.
2,The mount was fine when it first came but after a while the phone mount would just completely fall off to the ground while I am driving. I would try to put it back on but it would just repeat the same motion until I just gave up and placed it away. It’s nice for a while until the suction wears off and doesn’t do it’s job anymore. I do think that this can do better and I have hope that the one I have has been defective.
4,This cell phone holder works good. It stays suctioned to my dash for the time being. Holds my Phone in a great position for me. I'm happy with my purchase.
2,This phone holder it’s very bed it’s not sticky on dashboard
5,My boyfriend and I have bought 6 phone mounts for the car in the last two years. The VICSEED is the only one we've liked. We attached it to the dash with that adhesive circle and I swear to god I'm in love with the thing. It holds up each of our phones with ease (I've got a big heavy case because I'm a klutz). It was easy to install and put together (you have to put the part that holds the phone onto the handle) and I've told all my friends to get one.
5,I purchased this primarily to use when using my phone's GPS.  I used it on a trip across 3 states and it worked great.  So far outside temps over 90 degrees F with windows up have not adversely affected the adhesive.  I have now used it to talk hands free as well.  Works great!
4,Updated review. The unit I received was defective the suction cup would not work. It would not stay in place. But  I was contacted by the manufacturer and was sent a replacement unit. The second unit works fine the suction cup stays firmly in place and I like the mount for the vents it locks in place and does not fall off. P
5,Saw the product in a friend's company truck while we were riding over some rough terrain. Having experience with the air vent clip-mount type I kept expecting it to fall off after every bump. It didn't budge. Not once. Immediately ordered one to use in my monthly rental vehicle(s) and am very happy with it.Also a disclaimer stated it is not recommended for larger phones with heavy cases. I have a iPhone 12 with a very heavy case and it works fine....
5,I love the ability to have maps up on my phone while driving to different places. This works perfectly. I've had it a year and it's still sticking to my windshield or dash
5,I have used this product about a year and a half. Still going strong. Ultra sturdy. The maneuverability is excellent. Prior to purchasing this one I had gone through at least 10. The other ones broke easily and did not have the flexibility range this one has.
4,The best part about this product is that it works on any car with any sized phone.  The only problem I have encountered is that my phone - which has a bulky credit card case attached to the back pushes the boundaries of the depth limitation and will sometimes fall off on rough roads.
5,This product didn't stick where I initially wanted it - but it was a long shot that it would work there. After it fell I moved it to a more secure spot but not my ideal location in my car. It has stayed in the second location since I put it there. It had no problem attaching the second time although I wouldn't recommend moving it. It just happened that my first spot was very unlikely that it would stick. I gave it a try anyways. holds my phone great and make it very easy to be hands free in the car!
4,Beware of this vendor. After receiving the order they emailed me directly and asked for PayPal account No. So they could send a new version to test. The item works unless your phone is in a case or has a ring or pop for on the back. Then side grips are not deep enough. The item grips well to the dash. I have also used it in multiple vehicles and there is no issue with removing and reapplying.
4,The car we just got already had the platform attached to the top of the dash so we just used the suction cup and stuck it right on there. So far its holding on great and the unit itself seems very sturdy and well made. I'm glad we spent the extra for this rather than get the usual cheap one and regret it later.
5,So far I like everything about the Universal Car Mount. I purchased two at the same time - one for my work and one for my personal car.Both of our phones have Otterboxes so the fact that these fit the larger case made this product jump to the top of my list. They were easy to install and very easy to use. The construction is solid and the suction cup works great. In my work car I am using the suction cup on plastic and in my personal car I used the adhesive disc that came with the product mounted on the side of the console and the suction cup directly to the disc. It is holding up perfectly.
5,BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! GREAT PRODUCT!VICSEED Customer Service reached out after my initial review of the dashboard mount that did not work. Customer service representative Mary offered other products to try at no additional cost. VICSEED sent me the CD Slot phone mount (again at no cost) which works perfectly!VERY satisfied with cd slot mount and even more beyond impressed with the FANTASTIC customer service received. Not only did I receive a new product better suited for my vehicle but Mary also followed up throughout including confirming the new product was received and that it worked (and was even willing to send a different product in the event that it didn't!).[Orig: 1 Star/Not worth it- doesn't stick. Followed instructions and still didn't work.]
5,I have one in my work truck Big rough no suspension but your talent through your head type of work truck like every bump you better slow down or your flying out of your seat type of truck and it never has let loose fell nothing so bought another for my personal truck a diesel so once again rough riding but smoother then the work truck. Highly recommend if you drive a Class A or B commercial truck like me.
4,I like that is deep enough to hold my cellphone with the case on. .but I have some issues with the product and now I'm updating my previous review. . since I contacted costumer service they do everything to help me and solve the problems. . .else they issued a full refund they are serious people and really Respec the warranty on their products and really take good care about costumers.. ..great experience. .and I will like to try the upgraded new products.
5,Overall the design of this is pretty nice. It's able to hold a wide range of phone sizes. We haven't tried the suction cup feature as we bought it to be used with the car vent (2019 VW Tiguan). It has fallen out twice so I can't recommend it for that. You may have different results with a different car vent.UPDATE: The seller was kind enough to send a replacement with a connector that has a "hook" to attach to my car's AC/heat vent. It works great so kudos to the seller for this solution! Check the VICSEED Amazon store to see the different options they offer.
4,Pretty solid product. I drive around town for work and use my phone for navigation. This has never fallen off of the windshield or moved it's position very much since I installed it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the release mechanism has started to not fully open. Once I press the release button I find I have to move my phone to one side to get the retention hands to spread far enough to remove my phone. Minor inconvenience in an otherwise really good product.
5,I bought this for both my and my wife's cars. It replaced 2-part phone/car specific mounts that cost twice as much. The suction is strong on the window mount. I haven't tried to dashboard mount. Phone mount is surprisingly sturdy both the base and the phone holder. They don't move at all when tightened down. Also the ability to move and adjust the height depth and angle of the holder are superior to most other mounts I've owned.
4,Works really well so far and same goes for the vent clamp. I like the extendable arm. Unfortunately if you have the pop-up finger holder in the back it will not fit and hold the phone properly. Overall I’m good with the product. I might buy it again for my old man.
5,We love this thing. Skeptical but works amazing. Would recommend.
3,Adhesive pad does not work. Waited the recommended 24 hours before applying the remainder of the mount. The adhesive only lasted for about 4 hours before completely falling off the dashboard. Now we can't remove the suction cup from the adhesive pad so the dashboard mount is useless. Thankfully the vent clip does work well so far.
5,bought two of these for our cars and they work great.
4,Seems secure to dash and phone is definitely held well but the whole mount shifts from side to side on the suction cup so that the phone moves 2 full inches back and forth.  Did not see that in the reviews.  Don't know if I want to keep this.Update:Seller replaced product free of charge with rapid delivery. New unit does not move around. Can’t find a flat surface on dash to mount suction securely so I mounted using the vent option. Holds phone firmly.
5,It's a really nice mount comes with a variety of options totally worth the money BUT does not fit if you use a pop socket and I do I have a large one which is why I needed the mount my pop socket is custom made so it doesn't fit in a pop socket holder so I got this bad baby I do recommend it holds up pretty nicely but doesn't fit my needs. Also easy to assemble very minimal assembly.
5,Was easy to mount and very sturdy. I have been through a bunch of these things and this one by far has been the best.
4,This product is a good quality.  I don’t like to block my driving views so I didn’t bother to use the dashboard mount.  I used the vent clip and it’s easy.  I like the  quick release and flexibility of 360 degree turns.  It's worth the money.
5,I wasn't sure if I wanted to use the dashboard or air vent mount but I love the dash mount! It adheres very well and I ABSOLUTELY LOVE that I can put my phone into and take it out of the holder with one hand! The button release is awesome! I also like that this came with both options as I wasn't sure I'd like the angle of the vent mount. Also happy that I went with the dash mount because as we head into winter I won't have hot air from the vent blowing on my phone.
5,Love this item and it served me well for my long trip  Virginia to Texas to Ohio and back! Never came off once held my cell snug and very minimal wobble! Which is great when you're trying to look at the GPS.
5,So overall a great product and will eventually buy again for another vehicle.  I am only using the vent clip as if right now and no problems! I had only one problem when I first bought it.  I broke it.  It was completely my fault.I reached out to VICSEED and got an amazing response.  They not only cared about me getting a replacement they cared about how the product failed.  I want to stress the product ONLY broke because of my incompetence. VICSEED customer service is outstanding! I will recommend to anyone who needs a car mount.
5,It took me a little while to find a phone hold I actually like. This one does not move once you place it. My old one used to fall off because of the weight of the phone. Once you mount this one it stays put. I like how it adjusts to whatever way you want to attach it. Definitely a good purchase.
5,Se despegó rapido y ya no tiene uso
5,This thing really sticks to the top of the dashboard and the lever holds firmly in place and can be angled and extended however you like it.The only improvement might be to make the side clamps come out farther to accommodate people (like my wife) who have wallet-style phone covers where you have to turn the cover back behind the phone. As is it too easily falls out. That's not a criticism of this particular product but a recommendation for future design.
5,I love this device it makes it so much easier to see my phone when using it for GPS.  I also can see the calls or texts coming in which I can later return when not driving.  It's so much safer than searching for my phone in my purse or on the car seat.  I had one in my previous car and when I sold it and bought a new car it was the first thing I went out and purchased again.
5,This works great!! Rediculous easy set up!! Couldn’t be happier! I highly recommend!!!!
5,Grandson is learning to drive.  Purchased to help him maneuver around town.
4,easy to install. The arms go down some times
2,Stopped sticking after a year or so.
5,I have tried other cell phone holders for my iPhone 12 Pro Max and this holder has been the only one that has been able to handle the larger heavier phone. I would highly suggest this item.
4,I have this mounted in my Tundra.  The suction pad is mounted in the misc item holder in the dash.About the only negative thing is the location of the release button to remove the phone.  It is awkward to use the button.  The button could be painted to make it stand out also.
5,Works great on the vent. I thought it would be loose but it holds nicely.
5,I love this product because it works great.  You can use it in you vent  stick on your dash board or suction it to your windshield.  I have mine on my windshield.  I have tried so many different ones in the past and this one seems to be THE ONE.  It hold my Iphone 11 with no issues.  It says on and doesn't fall off.  I have it perfectly positioned to where it's at eye level so when I'm driving I don't have to look down or look away from the road.
4,So far so good
4,Actually held my phone I have a note 9 and it has a case and stuff on back but the suction or stickiness didnt last long. Made it about a week then fell off tried it on dash instead of windshield and that didnt stay an hour... so I now have a useless phone holder.... it was hard to figure out how to open up the holder arms as well. Its tight. Nifty idea just no strength!I have been impressed with the company trying to remedy the problems.  Great company.
5,I purchased this phone holder and found it easy to use.  I initially didn't install with the adhesive circle and found I needed it.  Since I misplaced mine I reached out and the company quickly sent me a replacement.  They provide great customer service!  I fully recommend them.
5,This mount is awesome. Fits my iPhone 11 Pro perfectly and looks like it will fit several different phones. Charger fits perfectly between the bottom foot. Mount is high quality 3M Adhesive and it is solid. If you have very textured dash like my truck use the disc first and then mount to that. Basically just follow their instructions. This thing is so attractive and looks amazing. Best quality built mount I’ve had yet. Very please with this purchase and highly recommend this mount. Need to buy my wife one now. I didn’t let mine sit for 24 hrs but you should. I’m too impatient. Still holding perfectly!
5,I’m always leary about holders that attach to air vents but this one truly works!  No vibration/shaking phone doesn’t fall off stays secure from the first day of installation and going on 3 months so far.  Going to buy another one for my husband.
5,I had originally ordered a different vent-mount style phone holder.  It would not stay firmly attached so thinking a vent-mount style was no good I ordered this one with plans to mount to dashboard or windshield not realizing that it also had the option of vent mount.  When I got it one side of the phone holder wouldn't clamp onto the phone properly.  I reached out top customer service and they not only sent me a new replacement they also sent it out via 2-day shipping without requiring I return the original.  I just got their replacement and found their vent style mount works so well I don't even need to use the arm/suction mount!!  IT looks and works great and I am so happy with the product and very impressed with their excellent customer service.  Thank you VICSEED!!
5,I love it it has excellent quality and adhesive to hold my backup camera in my truck
5,Bought this item for a long road trip to use my phone as a navigation device. Installed on the dash it blocked my view so I used the vent clip that also comes in the package. It worked perfectly. Far better than any vent clip I've tried to use before. You actually crank the clip down to tighten instead of the spring clips I've used before. For the price this item is amazing
5,I bought this after finding out that my existing cellphone dash mount would not accommodate my new (larger) Galaxy S21 Ultra.  Couldn't be more pleased both with the design and the manufacturing quality.  The extending arm and the cantilever design allow me to position my (heavy) phone exactly where I want it - closer to me and level with the dashboard surface - without fear of pulling the holder off the suction mount.  Highly recommend!
5,I love everything about this. Great price & functionality. I would purchase this same holder again!!
5,I've had one in my car for about four months now and I've yet to have a single complication. It's very sturdy and holds up well (if you tighten it properly). I have already suggested it to multiple friends who say the same thing.
5,I have purchased several of these to mount on the dash of my vehicles. They work EXCELLENT.  Follow the instructions and let the dash ring fully set for 24 hrs before attaching anything to it. I travel across states for work and this thing has been a life saver for gps. You can adjust to be exactly where you need it and it won't block the road view at all. This is a definite buy.
5,I’ve had it for a month now. Works great with my iPhone 11 max. I’ve never had a problem with it.  It will even hold my phone with my loopy case on but it is not nearly as sturdy. I don’t mind taking my phone out of my case each time before I use it. I like that it comes with a platform you can install if you don’t have a flat surface to attach the suction to/don’t want to put it on the windshield.
5,Did not want to glue an irremovable disk to my dashboard so I simply use the air vent. Works fine.
5,I now have 3 in use. The suction and the adhesive is great very sturdy not like the flexible neck types.  Go well in my 18 wheeler
5,I got a bigger phone that wouldn't fit in my old dashboard holder that I had used for many years. This is an excellent replacement – an upgrade really. It adhered securely to the top of the dash in my Jeep Wrangler without the need for the extra included adhesive pad. It has enough adjustment points to allow me to position my phone exactly where I want it so it doesn't obstruct my view yet allows me to glance at my phone without taking my eyes off the road. It holds my phone securely and the button on the side allows me to release my phone easily when I get to my destination. I highly recommend it!
3,This works very well and swivels easily. However it’s so bulky it blocks your view.
5,I was skeptical to get this as it wasn't my usual cell phone holder brand but I'm really glad I did.  Not only is the suction really good and it holds my Samsung Note 10 but my favorite thing about it is the phone quick-release button on the left of the holder.  This button makes getting my phone out so quick and easy.  I just love it.  So glad I found this product.
5,After extensive research and reading reviews I decided to give this mount a try.  I've been using it about 6 months and am very pleased!  I tried both the suction and vent mounts.  Due to mounting angles and plastic surfaces I ended up going with the vent mount.  Holds phone securely even with a case on it.  Easy to get in and out of the mount.  Completely solved my problem of phone storage/charging while driving my pre-smart era vehicle!
4,It does what you expect
4,The ball from the arm seems to be not the right diameter no matter how much the adjusting nut is adjusted the phone's base moves it cannot be fixed in one position. Poor product quality worse quality control by the manufacturer.But I receive a good customer service and they fix the problem.
5,I don't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing but ... I was trying to do a test to see where it looks better and I tried to stick it to the windshield and it got stuck literally it stuck the windshield and it never came off like I tried to take it off and I just couldn't . So yeah it is now part of my windshield forever
5,I bought this to make sure I was hands free with my phone. My first use was on a road trip and it worked perfectly. I use it on the dashboard without the dashboard pad and suction cup worked great alone. The versatility of it is with the money. It is true as the instructions state do not leave in heat for an extended amount of time because it will suction.
5,This phone holder suctions to the dashboard very well they include a plate to attach it to the dashboard but I didnt need to use it.  The arm can be adjusted which is very nice and I love the quick release button.  It holds your phone steady during your drive.
4,I did not put the sun visor on and i think the heat made it fall off.  I will see in the summer.  Other than that it is very easy to use i can attach and remove the phone with one hand hardly any vibration.
5,I stuck it on my car dash and it works great!
5,I use it to hold my phone when it’s charging and have recorded while driving beautiful mountains and scenery.
5,My prongs to my car phone mount broke. I contacted VicSeed and had an upgraded part delivered to my door within 72 hours. Great company!
4,***UPDATE***After talking to after sales they refunded my purchase and sent a replacement unit to try again for free. Mary was super helpful. I would give them a second chance.***original post***Cheap plastic cradle stripped out the locking gears not worth it for me to replace. Buy cheap get cheap always remember that.
5,This holder is well made and the suction sup worked on my dash without the included disk. A slot in the lower shelf makes plugging my charger very easy. Another holder I have does not have the slot and you have to thread the cord through the hole first to plug it in. This takes care of that. I highly reccomend.
5,- Bought Jan 9 and almost a yeah in.This is hands down the best one i have had.The suction cup Still works!It gives you a  “sticker-like” part where if its uneven surface you can place it down and so the suction cup will stick. Don’t recommend putting on dashboard. If you place it on the window that thing WILL NOT MOVE. The back adjustment are stull holding up. No issues to this day.Highly highly recommend specially with the cellphone laws they have now.
5,Great product! Works great. Super impressed with the customer service. Recently i wanted to move my phone from the dash to the vent. I love that i can do that. Well while doing so I dropped the fixed nut in my car. Well when i finally got a chance to look for it was no where to be found. I was sadden cause its a very important part. Any way i contacted VICSEED to see if I can purchase one. They not only send me one but they sent me two. Amazing customer service. Thank you
4,This product does not stick to the dash board as advertised. The 3M dashboard pad is completely useless and has no sticky adhesive to it. Once taking off the protective piece to adhere to my dash it came right off. Now wont stay at all. I'm very disappointed however I need this product now as I'm traveling.Edit...upon initially sending this update the company contacted me gave a refund and was kind enough to offer a replacement. I am truly thankful for that. Great customer service and better product was received.
2,The adhesion stopped working and constantly fell off my dashboard at moments when I was in traffic.  I’m disappointed and was so frustrated I threw it away.
4,Good but I was hoping the part that holds the phone would be easier to rotate. You have to loosen the bolt attached to the ball joint in order to rotate or move it. Also it was a little too big for my LG G5 as it covered the fingerprint reader on the back. Luckily the holder from the mount I already had fit the arm on this one so I'm using that until I get a new phone.
2,For my car. Easy to assemble and use
5,This is the best phone mount I’ve ever used and I’ve used quite a few. The suction power and adhesion are outstanding - when I first mounted it I decided I wanted to move it to a different spot and it took real strength to get it off the spot it was on. Since then (about two months ago) it has stayed put in the new spot without having to be gentle with it. This is a very sturdy mount I highly recommend it.
5,Finding this case was like searching for a needle in a haystack.GREAT SUCTION. FITS LARGE PHONE WITH CASE. (fit my LG Q8 with THICK wallet case. I put this WITHOUT the extra.adhesive in front of the Back up camera. Smooth surface on slight slant).Easy to remove (click of button).I use it a lot.for GPS..Swivel arm allows for upright or horizontal position.I open the case and let the side with card holder hang down".Great price when you consider the cost of "cup holders" which inhibit use for GPS.Suggestion for manufacturer. I would.pay double the price if you could.make this in an XL version. My phone is large.It fits..but if there were an "XL" version available that would be helpful"
5,I wondered if it would really hold my cell phone and it does!!!
5,This charger was amazing! The only issue was not with the charger itself my phone case and pop socket together were too thick!The seller is amazing and reached out when I returned the item and shipped me a new one that fits my phone for free! Best customer service I’ve ever experienced!I would absolutely buy this charger it’s strong and does exactly what it says!!
2,Suction and adhesive to dash was great for only a little while since the sun’s rays beats on it through the window. Once that happened it didn’t stick anymore it fell I couldn’t reattach. The wind hands that hold the phone are too curved to hold phone with a case and any other accessories on phone(pop socket or wristlet string. Needs to be deeper to hold and accommodate accessories. Putting phones in holder on vents can cause phones to over heat if heat is on in the car or too cold in summer when AC is on so dash is the best but wasn’t able to withstand the sun.
5,I was really loving this phone holder it was much better than the previous ones I bought. The down side it broke the other day when trying to unclip it. I haven’t even had. It a year which really stinks.Edit to my previous review the company reached out to me and was extremely helpful and went above and beyond to make sure I was happy. I will definitely order from them again.
5,Love it. Mo problems.  Installation a breeze
5,This cell phone holder is easy to install and adheres well to our textured dashboard. I was worried that it might block some of my view when I drive but that has not been the case. I like having my phone right in front of me on my dashboard. It makes it easy to see your Google Maps and keep your eye on the road at the same time.  Great purchase!
5,I just bought a second one for my other truck. The supplied mount for the car vent doesn’t work great but I haven’t had any better luck with any other vent mounts. I use this on the dash with an IPhone 12 Pro Max and it works great.
5,I ordered this cell phone holder not for the suction cup but for the air vent clip.  Well my clip broke within a year.  I contacted the vendor and I fully expected to have have to purchase another carmount package.  Instead Vicseed had a replacement clip sent to me within 48 hours at no charge.  Customer service that other companies should replicate.
5,Very happy with the quality of the product. When the fixed nut broke customer service (Davis) was very quick and helpful in providing a replacement. Thanks!
5,This is a very sturdy phone holder. The suction cup stuck to the surface very well and the arm can be extended in or out to make adjustments. I didn’t read the manual so took a few minutes to figure out the mechanics of the extension and lock but it’s still pretty intuitive and you’d be okay following at the manual. The holder plate itself is also very stable and the width adjusts very well for my phone. I like the bottom cradle because I don’t need to worry about the phone accidentally slipping down. The package also comes with a clip for air vent if you wish to place the holder there as well. Overall I am happy with the purchase and would recommend.
4,I bought this mainly because I wanted to use it on my vents and is doesn't stay. Keeps popping off when phone is in it.I changed my rating because the company came through and refunded my money. They also had some something to fix the problem but I wanted a refund and they gladly gave it to me. They really want to make the customer satisfied.
5,Mount it on my car board. Easy to install and use.
5,I have tried so many different phone holders.  This is by far the most durable and steady one so far.  I would give it 4.5 stars because it doesn't easily go from horizontal to vertical easily like my last one did.  I will rebuy this one as long as they make it.Update:  a piece broke and I contacted customer service.  They got back to same day and will send out a new piece at no charge.  Great customer service so far.
5,I don’t know what took me so long to get one of these.  I love it!  I really like the quick release button and the super easy adjusting side to clamp your phone in place.  I bought a second one for my daughter for her car.
5,Makes navigating much easier with phone mounted in easy viewing range
5,I have a Pixel 4 with a very heavy hard case - it TOTALLY keeps the cell phone in place! Not once has the suction fallen off of the window! I do have to tighten the arms of the holder once in a while but it's minor. If you are a big fan of Waze and other GPS navigation apps this one is for you!
4,This works perfectly for my daughter’s iPhone 11 with a thin case plus a pop socket with a flat design. I don’t think a pop socket with a raised effect would work on this. It’s adjustable and holds the phone with no issues. She loves it.
5,I love my cell phone holder as it came with options of use the dash sticky pad was great as the vent clip would have blocked my screen when using my vehicles navigation system. I like that I can also mount it to the windshield if I want to. Very sturdy and worth the cost. I am buying my daughter one for her car before she leaves for college.
5,They weren't kidding about the suction! Decided to put it on my windshield and I can not get it back off for the life of me... Not even to adjust a smidge. Powerful stuff. Locks for all adjustments are sturdy and it hardly moves while I'm driving. Love it! Eventually I'll try sticking it to my dash with the adhesion pad; if I can ever pull it off my windshield!
5,This cell phone holder is perfect for my needs.  I have it in 3 of my cars and works exactly as intended.  One is being used with the suction and the other two are with the air vent.  Quality and function are quite good.  Couldn’t ask for a better product.If you’re hesitate don’t be.  Will make traveling easier for you as well.
5,With the texas heat it has mad the suction strong as all get out. It holds very well.
4,Holds phone solidly. Can extend out very far. Good y axis movement but I feel lacking in x axis adjustments. But holds phone really well.
5,Purchased to use with an IPhone 11 on my new Lexus 350L.  Had a problem maintaining a firm attachment to the vent and discovered that the clip had a small crack.  Sent e-mail to VicSeed customer service and received a rapid replacement with an advanced design that yields a firm fit with very easy installation. I am very pleased with this product and the company that stands behind it.
5,I used the black plate that comes with it due to dashboard not being flat. I have a Samsung S20 with pop socket and have no trouble. It has gone through off reading and daily pothole driving. You can adjust it vertical or horizontal. No more dropping Phone during calls or tangling. Just follow instructions.
5,Works great sturdy and secure. Doesn't pop off the windshield and stays in place even while hitting bumps.
3,The south Florida heat and humidity will cause the mount to Lose its suction ability over time. Mines slide off my window shield after 4 months. Try to contact the manufacturers. But website is no longer available.
5,This holder so far is the best I’ve used. I have it mounted on my dash. Was super easy to install.  Holds my iPhone firmly in place. Does not wiggle or jiggle. Just know the suction on this thing is so good that it takes a little bit of effort to unstick it from the plate it comes with. Overall it’s great
5,The VICSEED Universal Cell Phone Holder has met my expectations. Item works well have used the vent clip so far in multiple vehicles. Haven't had the need yet for the suction cup method however I'm sure it works well.
5,It is very easy to attach and has a really good grip. I like that you can turn it several different ways and it extends out some so make it easier to see. It had a button that pops she holders open so it is much easier to get in and out than other ones I’ve had. My phone case is a little thick and it still holds it well.
5,Bought this for my iPhone 11 Pro Max was with an otter box case.  This fits perfectly is secure and out of the way.  I bought their magnet phone mount which is super strong but my phone wasn’t able to be held just by a magnet.  I reached out the VICSEED and their customer service is by far the best I have come across.  They gave me suggestions on how to use the magnet first but then helped me find the perfect car mount for my phone.  I would definitely use them again.
4,It's ok
4,When I originally bought this phone holder I placed the disc it comes with on my dashboard and suctioned the holder to it. The holder would always lose suction and fall off. I messaged the seller to see if they sold replacement pats f just the suction part and they sent me a new one in the mail! I am going to try and adhere it to my windshield this time and hope the integrity holds. Thank you!
5,This seems to be super heavy duty. I previously purchased a similar windshield phone holder from a chain auto store and it literally fell apart after about 2 weeks.  So far this one is holding up nicely. Great price for an awesome windshield phone holder that comes with other adapters so that it can be installed on dash vent or windshield.
5,My brother-in-law bought this for his Suzuki "Joy Pop" van and it worked so well for him I bought one too!  I had my front window on my Daihasu Atrai van tinted so a regular windshield mount was not the best choice.  The suction cup on this mount has worked perfectly so far and it's suction cup has stuck solid onto  the vinyl dash...something my RAM mount would not do!  Because my speedometer is in kilometers it's handy to be able too use a Speedo app that lets me see my speed in mph...all thanks to this mount!
5,I have a textured dashboard and I don’t want anything impeding the airflow from the vents so I have had problems finding a good cell phone holder. The suction cup on this one has a tacky or sticky film and adheres to my dashboard surprisingly well. It is very sturdy and stays in place when you adjust it a variety of angles. I use a bulky military grade cellphone case and this still grasps it tightly. I think this is a great purchase.
2,I love the design of this phone holder but in my Ford Escape there isn't a single flat surface to be had. So I used the dashboard disk that comes with it.  Absolutely NO adhesive on that thing.  And for all the talk of how hard it would be to remove the disk it just came off the dash in my hand.  Using the holder in an air vent in Texas isn't appealing to me. I need every air vent I have. I might have tried the windshield but they've been tinted and the instruction booklet discouraged use with tinting. Plus that suction cup doesn't want to stick anyway.  So sad this didn't work!!!!
5,The facti can use this when I have my air conditioning and than switch to long mount when I have the heater on
5,My husband LOVES this cell phone holder and I do too. If I’m traveling I like to keep my eyes on the road and the cell phone in my line of vision for turns and potential traffic. This doesn’t have to suction on the windshield. We put ours right below on the dashboard and it’s perfect. I highly recommend.
5,I was not sure if this was going to be what I was looking for or even a quality product but I have been pleasantly surprised by this product. It was exactly what I wanted and so far has worked flawlessly. I have only had it a week so I will try and come back in a month or two and update this review.
3,I drive a MDX and couldn't find a good place to mount the device
5,Quality item works just as I expected.
5,This is one of the better cellphone holders in my opinion. It holds the cellphone firmly & doesn’t move from the cradle while driving. As for this company their customer service is amazing.I purchased a different cellphone holder by this company and was not happy. It wouldn’t hold my cellphone. They reached out to me via amazon email and they sent me this cellphone holder. They were very helpful & went out their way to make my customer service experience amazing.
5,Initially got this to use the dashboard feature but I was able to use the vent one instead. Unlike other vent phone holders this one allows you to tighten the closure that grips to the vent which is awesome. Keeps it from falling off easily.Update: DOES NOT WORK ON 2019 JEEP CHEROKEE VENTS (I will post pic of the type of vents when I get the chance as well as the damage it did to my vent).Because of this I ended up using the dashboard feature and it was great but it ended up coming off. I haven’t been using it at all now and put in a pop socket mount instead... :-(
5,Bought two of these for our cars.  The holding power is excellent...have not had to re-attach from loss of suction on either car (after 10 months on one car and five on the other).  Bought it for an iPhone SE 20...no issues.  Great product!
5,Bought them for all my kids and one for myself.  I have mine in the vent which is ok although I can’t get it tight enough so wobbles from side to side somewhat.  Haven’t attached the adhesive hard pad to car as of yet but it definitely would be necessary as the suction doesn’t hold directly to my dash.  A little update...received a response shortly after my post and they went over and above to offer and send replacement parts to clear up any issues!  Even sent extra pad!  I am a five Star responder from here on in!  Thank you for the great customer service!
5,This works perfect for me and once I found the best location it was an easy install I am continues to do exactly what I hoped. Well worth the money.
5,This holder is great. It is built really well feels very sturdy and the best part was that it was incredibly easy to install. I never used the adhesion pad that came with it as the suction was so powerful that it just glommed onto the dashboard practically on its own.
4,I’ve only had this for one day. I’m skeptical that any suction mount with a long arm can hold my iPhone 11 Max Pro in its case. It has so far but it’s only been a day. I’m giving this 4 stars for now because the extending arm is exactly what I need in  my Toyota Sequoia. So if you’re looking for a long reach this thing is sweet and solid. I will change this to 5 stars if it makes it a few months without crashing down into my coffee.
5,I've gone through countless poor quality car mounts that don't work well aren't adjustable and flimsy.  so far this product has been INCREDIBLE.  its super sturdy highly adjustable and easy to use.  I have to say its my favorite thus far and I'm so glad I bought it.  I am 100% going to be getting this for my other vehicles cause its sooo worth it.
5,This phone holder has worked out great for me. Space is very limited with only one cup holder I needed a secure and reliable device to hold my iPhone 12 ProMax. When you pay that much for a new phone you want a reliable and sturdy device to hold it. The suction on this device is very reliable and powerful. And I still have access to all the switches on the console. Very glad I purchased this product.
5,I held off giving a review to see how long it would hold up (bad experience with another brand melting). I've had this one for a few months now and it's lived up to its description. The only adjustment I have to make is removing my phone from its case because it's too thick for the holder... not a huge deal to me something I can live with.
5,I was a little skeptical on purchasing this item simply because there are so many different types on Amazon. Suction power of the cup is excellent and the arm stays rigid. This is mounted in my dump truck and various pieces of heavy equipment and has yet to fall off or droop. I would definitely recommend this mount. Comes with one mounting pad and a air vent mount. Very pleased.
4,Love that it allows any phone to sit comfortably. The suction didn't make it adhere until I added the included disk.  I am very pleased with the product now that it stays put with the disk.
5,Let me start by saying that this thing is well built priced and performs as advertised. I thought I could get away with this instead of buying a phone holder specifically for offroad for my jeep... and it does not work for that. I have an 11 ProMax which is pretty heavy and when I go over hard bumps like washboard it does not stay in place. BUT this is not meant for that or advertised to hence the 5 stars.
5,I have purchased and returned three other mounts at lower prices and then came this mount. I am having car troubles and getting a new vehicle soon which is not the point but I am saving the whole arm and suction mount. Using the air vent mount was easy to install and is very sturdy. There is great motion that can reach to the passenger or driver side with ease. This is defiantly worth the money.
5,This product does what’s it’s suppose to do! It actually mounted on an area I didn’t think it would be able to and it’s been holding on for 2+ days now. The combination of the suction power and adhesion makes this item heat at securing to multiple surfaces. Installation was also really easy to do. I would def buy this again later down the road if I needed to!
5,VICSEED Has the best customer service ever. I did purchased this item and didnt work on my vehicle dash board due to the surface not being flat .  But I was contacted by VICSEED customer service  ( Betty ) and she took the time to do some research and offer me options to replace this article with different VICSEED Item. was hesitating at first thinking that it wasnt going to work but for my surprise it works perfectly on my 2010 ford Edge. I really want to thank Betty for going the extra mile and doing a tremendous job on finding the correct Item that I needed.  I will definetely buy again and recomend products from VICSEED. thanks
3,Worked great until I bought a protective hardshell for my phone.Now the little arms that you squeeze to secure the phone are too small to grip it properly and tightly it keeps falling off.Something to consider if you have full hardshell case on your phone...
5,I've looked at several others like these just to find that they are cheaply make. Not this one! Well constructed! This one even comes with a clip so you can secure to your air vent in your car. Clip is well designed and strong to. I've tried hooking it up both ways. I'm very pleased with my purchase.
5,This really helps when your on a trip.
5,very sturdy looks great  just what i wanted for a gift. thanks
5,This one a tough one to review because their customer service is fantastic but the item didn’t work for me.I didn’t complain or request a refund they asked for feedback and gave it. They did their research and acknowledged that the item doesn’t work for my truck. Issued a refund on their own.They should reach others customer service skills.
5,Easy conveinient little accessories to be hands free while driving plus assists in traveling video's efforlessly without distracting me while I drive!!! An economical treasure for my small You-Tube channel! I highly reccomend this product!
5,I got this for my husband to use while on the road! He loves it
4,Muy bueno lo recomiendo
5,I bought this phone mount because I’m going on vacation soon and don’t like having to look down at my phone when I’m driving and trying to navigate traffic in an unfamiliar area. This was easy to set up and actually comes with both a vent clip mounting system as well as a auction mounting system. For my vehicle and personal preference I liked the vent system better. Nice that it includes both though so that each person can decide what works best for them and their vehicle. I have used this for about a week now and my phone has not fallen off at all. The mount is very secure and I’m really happy with my purchase!
4,The mount is great.. but the plastic wing nuts are flimsy. Should of been made with some kind of metal nut. The one nut got stripped because if you go tight it strpps the threads inside the plastic nut leaving the arm loose
5,This mount has been perfect for me. Originally during install I did not use the round smooth surface they give you if your dash has texture- big mistake. It fell right off. But after installing correctly with the smooth surface I have not had any issues
5,Best phone holder I’ve ever had. Installed one in my semi truck upside down and it hasn’t moved at all throughout the heat or the cold. Now I own one for all of my vehicles. Holds my s6 iPhone with a otter box case with no problem.
5,My first day and it seems like it's well thought out not flimsy as heck like some others I've tried.  I've had the phone holders that attach to your vents but they just got too loose and flimsy over time.  I did have to add more adhesive to the plastic disc that I applied to my dash.  My dash has little indentation dimples in it so the disc did not hardly stick so I added a few pieces of Command Strips.
5,Fácil montar y manejar
3,There were so many great reviews so we were disappointed when ours kept falling off the windshield. Within a week it fell off more than four times. Plus the sticky part got all full of carpet fuzz. Amazon was great about the return though.
5,Antes de que lo instalen tengan presente estar seguro donde lo van a colocar de verdad el poder de adherimiento la succión es tan potente que lo coloque en un lugar que no estaba tan seguro y me costo tanto quitarlo que sin mentir casi se me parten las uñas es un poder sorprendente lo recomiendo 100% compraría 1000 veces el mismo producto
4,Suction cup has a good hold. Telescopics work good. I have a galaxy note 8 with full case. Seems to heavy for it. Droops a little when in position. Nice overall.
5,I've had this for a little over a week and I have been very impressed. It is much more sturdy than other holders I have had. I normally don't care for the vent clip models but this one is pretty nice. I bought two and use one with the vent clip and one with the windshield mount. There seems to be some kid of sticky substance on the suction cup which makes it stick even better. I don't know if that will leave some kind of residue on the windshield or not.
5,I have been looking for a phone holder for my car that could hold my phone without having to take the case off of it.VICSEED Universal Car Phone Mount was perfect.  It comes with two ways to hold your phone.  One you can mount on the dashboard and the other you can clip it into the air vent.  Both ways fit perfectly!Thank you!
5,I've had it in my car for two weeks.  Stuck it to my dash without the adhesion disk just strraight to the grained vinyl.  Has not come loose once.  Very adjustable.  Holds my Galaxy S10 fine.  Love that I can have poer cord and wired ear buds plugged in and the holder doesn't interfere.  Good product and I would recommend.
4,Nice
5,And I bought quite a few phone holders for my car and this is by far the best. I now own three of them one for each of our cars. The soft sticky ring on the suction cup helps hold it in place so well that it’s a shame other manufacturers don’t use a similar design.
5,Only had a few days but the entire thing is built well not flimsy anyways.  The suction base seems to hold well also.  I have a large phone in a fairly thick case and this holder shows no signs of strain.  Haven't used the vent mount or the included sticky-back base.
5,I have bought so many of this cell phone mount items and this is the only one that has worked for me! Its a good price and ir works. Most of the ones that I have bought the suction doesn't work after 2 weeks. This was has worked great and I had it now for one month.
5,Love the option of being able to install on my dash or vent clip. Super easy installation options of how to set it on dashboard clip moves so you can set phone horizontal or vertical. Durable product and would definitely order again.
5,I didn’t use the Suction mount I used the air vent mount. It works great! I have a body glove case on my iPhone X and it holds the phone firmly in place. With the two different types of mounts you will find one that works for you. If you need this get this one.
5,Suction power is great . The cell phone holder is well made and the quality is outstanding. It’s well worth the  cost. I purchased a cheaper one first time and was disappointed so decided to invest in a better quality the second purchase. I was not sorry with this one . It’s was absolutely worth the purchase.
5,I bought this to replace my Mpow car phone holder.  After using for a month I am very satisfied of the product.  I have a Samsung Galaxy 10e with Milltary grade thick phone case.  The holder secures my phone very well..  i can charge my phone at the bottom without problem.  The holder suction is very strong and minimal vibration.  It is a little bit more expensive than other brands of car phone holders but  you got what you paid for.
5,I haven’t put this in my vehicle yet. I can say that it looks & feels very sturdy made with quality & the nicest looking phone mount I have ever had. I am extremely pleased with this product. I didn’t rate the adhesion/suction feature due to I haven’t put it in my car yet but I don’t forsee that being a problem just by looking at it & holding it.
5,I'll update this review once I try the dashboard mount but so far it has been reliable as a mount attached to my A/C vent. My phone is pretty heavy ( Samsung S21 Base with a heavy duty case ) but the phone holder keeps it steady!
5,I have used a couple older versions and they always seemed to fall off. well this thing uses a sticky pad and suction and this thing aint going nowhere. its super adjustable and holds any rectangle size phone. My son damaged my first one I bought of this and I missed it so much I made sure to buy another one.
5,I have only had this product for about a week now but it has changed my life! No longer trying to prop my phone and have it fall when I'm driving. This holds my phone securely it has a release button to remove my phone when needed. But when using Google maps I can easily and safely use my phone for directions  hands free. It requires cleaning your dash where you intend to install it  but it also comes with a clip to install it on your vents if needed. So far very pleased with this product. Great design
5,I've been searching around for a good one for a while because I didn't want to have to buy another in a few months. I liked the reviews and super glad i got it. My last one wouldn't sit right in my new car and finally gave out. This one is very adjustable and seems pretty durable. I've dropped it on the ground (by accident) and it didn't have a scratch on it! I would recommend!
5,The vent holder works great. We haven't tried the suction mount.
5,Super easy to put together and install. I have a “textured” dash and haven’t found a suction cup mount that would actually stick to it. But this one stuck right away! It even came with a 3m sticky pad just in case the suction cup didn’t work. But so far it’s amazing. Holds my iPhone 11 max pro like a charm. It also comes with a vent clip! So you have to option to use that as well.
5,I haven't tried the adhesive or the suction. The clamp is not pressure (which can loosen with time) but a screw down clamp.  That thing will NOT move from your vent even with a heavy smart phone (I have the Note 10).  It is a little tougher to access the screw with bigger hands but not impossible at all.  I've tried several others but this one is fantastic.
5,Needed something in my old car to hold my phone for GPS and to easily access my podcasts. This thing is rock solid and holds my phone even with a “thick” leather card holder on the back with three cards in it - I have iPhone 8plus.
4,The device itself is great. The instructions weren’t very clear but you should adhere the base the your dashboard and allow it to securely make contact. Lay something heavy on it for a few hours before you connect the mount to it. But overall it’s a great hands free device.
5,Many ways to utilize this gps holder.  Clip works best for me.
5,I used it for my phone.
4,This product was perfect for me. It’s a very handy tool for driving around here in Texas. I’m new to this area so I use it all the time. I’m very please with this purchase.
3,Last one lasted a couple years and melted off the winshield for some reason.This one goes on but the part thet holds the phone seems cheap and is manual.  My last one closed on the phone automatically.Time will tell.
5,The angle on my dash board is a little uneven but this product adhered and has stayed in place even during very humid weather conditions outside.  I am very pleased with the ease of placing and removing my phone without losing the grip on my dash board.  I would also like to give a shout out to Ella at VICSEED for taking care of an issue with the Amazon delivery.  I would highly recommend this product!
5,Good quality phone holder  had the same problem of the suction function not gripping on to my dash like other products. Vicseed earn the 5 stars with me because they include a disc to help with this issue. Finally I have a phone holder that says on my dash.
5,Needed this for my iPhone 8 Plus in an Otterbox case.  There isn’t much dash room in my jeep wrangler so this was perfect.  Stuck it to the windshield and it hasn’t come off since!  The size that it holds worked perfectly with my phone in the case it has a space at the bottom for the charging cable to go through and a quick release button to release the phone.
5,I bought this with the intent of using the suction mount but ended up using the vent mount instead and it works great.  I’ve had mounts in the past that are spring-loaded and clip in the front and rear of the vent fin which can be a pain.  This is a screw clamp style that quickly attaches to any vent.  Easy installation my iPhone fits nicely I really like this mount.
5,This phone mount works great. I bought it for a recent road trip and it held up really well. I chose to mount it to my windshield which was a great spot for my line of sight. The downside to mounting it to the windshield is that it's difficult to use a windshield visor (something people in warmer states will understand). But I love it and use it every time I use the GPS now.
5,I attached the cell phone holder to my windshield and it has super suction. It is easy to use and opens with a push of a button. Grips my cell phone tightly allows enough room for cord. Great buy!
5,Versatility wins! I can use the suction holder on the windshield as well as on the dashboard. With the vent mount I can also use it there. Which means i can have my phone mounted as comfortably as it can. Not to mention the vent mount is sturdy with its clip design. It can hold much bigger and heavier phone.
5,It works perfectly for my Galaxy Note 9
1,I have tried for years to find a car mount for my phone that actually works. I have yet to achieve that goal. This one does not work either. The A/C mount was the best I could hope for. When I attach it then put my phone in the slot it falls down and I cannot see the phone. Since the ball mount moves it stays in the down position. I will be sending this one back too.
5,I love it! I can set up my IPhone at eye level watch traffic and still see my route. It is much better than a cup holder level since I don't have to look down at it. It is sturdy and easily moved.
4,I did not like that it’s not removable. Once you put it on your windshield it’s there to stay. I would have like a removable suction cup. Otherwise it’s good.
5,So far so good! We live in South Florida and it hasn't gotten up to the 100's yet but so far it's been an extremely great device. I use it alongside my phone as a dash camera and for GPS. Makes it much easier to view the maps since you're basically looking at the road while you can glance at the phone.
3,3/6 Update: Someone on the customer service team reached out and expressed regret for me not being 100% satisfied with the product which was very much appreciated. They are working on an improved mount which will hold phones that have cases and/or PopSockets. Looking forward to it!The product itself is sturdy but I would’ve rated higher if there was a bit more depth to the holder. A lot of phones these days are protected with cases or have pop sockets card holders or those loop band things on the back of them. I shouldn’t have to choose between protecting my phone with a case or mounting it in my car. Make the mount deep enough to hold my phone securely even with a pop socket on the back. I can get it to grab the sides but it takes some effort and isn’t always secure.
3,Problem is my vehicle does not. Have a really flat spot to put the extra suction disk so when I put that on and then attach the suction cup it starts to unstick and tilt forward after a day or two.  Have to buy a few extra disks.  Once in place the product works great just getting it to stay there is the issue for me.
5,Sticks very good to the windshield even when I mounted it on a warmer winter day. It has the right adjustability for my Tacoma windshield.  It grabs  my iPhone good & I like the quick release when I press the button on the side. I just moved it to the left about 3” & it holds very good.
5,The original delivery came with a missing part so I gave it one star. The company read my review and worked hard to resolve the problem. Other than the missing part it looked very good so I repurchased another. The company contacted me and apologized and sent me second unit to use as a spare. This is the first time a company made this effort for me and I appreciate it very much. I put the new unit in my truck and it works great. Thank you Vicseed for your help and I recommend this unit for anyone that wasn’t a quality item with a company that stands behind their product.
5,Easy to install. I  tried the pad at first but it didn’t stick. Decided to just use the suction directly on the dash Perfect! Love how it rotates and extends per your needs. Looks like a classy new gadget.
5,Used the product in the car to hold the cell phone. I used the clip style onto the vent. Working really well.Still have the install for setting a holder on the dash board.
5,Ok what I said in below review was wrong . Customer service contacted me after reading my review and corrected the problem ASAP.The product was replaced new product works excellent again customer service A+. Do buy if product  you won’t regret  What’s a piece of junk had for about a month already button that’s release phone keeps getting stuck won’t allow me to release phone. I have to manually pull phone out of vent clip and take phone out of holder. What a piece of junk do not buy.
5,We put this in our truck and it’s great it fully articulated to any position as well as having a telescoping feature by that I mean I can pull it closer or push it back toward the dash it really is great.
4,Revised review: I initially had some serious issues with this product; however thanks to the dedication of Lily C. an excellent product support representative from the company that makes this product my problems were resolved and I ended up with a good phone mount!Give this product a try!!!
5,It doesn't adhere long...but I still us it as a prop for my phone because it's construction and clamp are so good
5,I initially bought this to do some videos as I was driving to look at properties for sale...discussing the property the scenery on the way etc.But it has proven to be much more versatile...I can glance at a google map without looking down at my phone because it is at eye level on the dashboard or it is a way for my grandkids to "watch" a movie on my phone without me losing control of the phone.Easy to install.
5,This is exactly what I was looking for.  It extends to the distance I needed and maintains it's place once you adjust the knobs.  It would be even better if it would also rotate at the base.
5,I love the support and service I got from this seller and product…. Above and beyond good !Thanks 🙏
5,I have an iPhone 10XS. Add a bulky protective cover and my phone doesn’t fit most holders. Not only does my phone fit well but through bumps and all it stays put. Definitely a good choice for me. I have it in the vent but will eventually mount it on the dash.
5,Bottom sticky part did not stick for my car. Amazon seller selling the product contacted me to make sure I was satisfied with another product that fit best for my car. 10/10 recommend using this brand. Good service always makes me want to come back to that brand ! I definitely will be looking forward to buy another car accessory from this brand.
5,This car mount is great. I've actually gone through a few because one semi-melted (but it was over 100 degrees and the car was in the sun all day not the product's fault). It's easy to mount the glue is super strong but when you take it off it doesn't leave residue. You can re-position it once or twice but then it's done. Multiple areas are adjustable making the position of your phone totally customizable. Would recommend.
5,I had one this style before I knew I like this style. This brand seems to be of better build quality and I like having the additional mounting option. I liked this one enough that I got one for a family member and she's really pleased with it as well.
5,Just what I needed given the new driving laws. Highly recommended there is a some difficulty registering the product on the vicseed website but the tech support team was easily accessible to correct the issue.A+.Update 9/28/2021: I had an issue where I could not use the car mount as originally intended due to a bad part and the owner sent me a replacement free of charge after I explained the issue
4,Suction power is good. Easy install.
5,This phone mount is very reliable easy to use and has a wide range of adjustability. I purchased this to hold my iPhone on my boat and even on the roughest days on the lake the suction cup has never broke free from its mounting surface and the adjustable clamps for the phone has never let go of my phone. Buy one you want be disappointed. Make sure you have a clean flat mounting surface...
5,This is super-versatile easy to use car mount is perfect for me. I’ve tried a couple other car mounts for my very small cabin INFINITI. I have a tiny dash and small vents and other brands didn’t fit at all. I love how you can mount this via suction on the dash or window or on a small vent. The suction is better than the vent mount (which comes a little loose with wear). The suction is strong but forgiving - it’s easy to pull it off and remount with no loss to suction. Adjustable arms tighten to “hug” your phone in place so one size fits all.
4,It attaches well to the glass with the suction cup but with the weight and heft of the Samsung GalaxyNote20 it does bounce a little more than it seems that it should...
3,This like every other suction cup phone device I have used sucks (but not in a good way). After it failed I used the vent clip but it (a) never stayed attached to the vent and (b) actually broke my vent. In frustration with having a suction cup that doesn't actually stay attached I finally cleaned it one more time attached it to the windshield then put clear silicone all the way around the edges. Hopefully that'll work (though it looks a bit ghetto)
4,I was concerned about suction power but it has not come loose. I have pushed down a few times but it has not come loose. I have enjoyed it and it is well made.
5,First the delivery was super speedy as I received it the next day- love that!I had a different car mount before that couldn't handle the weight of my iPhone SE WITH Mophie charging case suctioned to my windshield. After a week this one has held up well. Also I prefer the phone release mechanism location on the side as opposed to the back in the old one.
5,Finally this have been a long time search for me. I haven’t driven with it yet but installing it was super easy. Stuck straight onto the windshield and the suction seems very stable. Adjusting it to my phone and the level for me to see was also extremely easy and effective! Definitely a must have!
5,Broke immediately couple minutes of unpacking it. Total rip off.EDIT: the owner/ manager got in contact with me about sending a replacement for the defective mount. Love it works like a charm thinking I was just sent a defective one unknowingly or may have been harmed during shipping from poor mailman handling. I take my 1star back and now give this a 5star. What a great company they actually care about their customers to reach out and fix the issue then further ask how to improve their design. From one real reviewer to another this is the company you should buy from.
3,It’s a bit bulky but it holds my phone
5,I needed a phone holder to use when operating my trailer brake controller. When needed I need to be holding pressure on my phone when breaking through an app and this does the job. It hardly moves and offers two attachment options (window or vent).Very solidly built and high quality.I highly reccomend!Robert M.
3,Updated review - worked fine in winter months but since weather warmed up this won't stay hooked on dash.  Don't recommend.Old review - Works as advertised.  I have a bigger phone not huge but heavier with the case and this worked well.  At first I thought it may not work well but realized you need to pull the bottom part down so all the weight is distributed.I have a pretty flat dashboard and I would say that's important when using this item.  I haven't tried the vent function but it seems pretty simple to use.  I also like it has both options.
4,Second time I bought the item to give it benefit of the doubt. Broke day 1! Suction is awful and adhesive will stain your car. It sucks all I have to say.
5,I was amazed by how many adjustments this holder has!My old Mercedes has a very short dashboard and a steep windshield so almost nothing holds my phone at the right angle aside from one of those Spagehetti noodle holders - and they're not strong enough to hold the phone for any length of time. This adjusted in all the right ways and it holds my phone without movement even when cornering hard.
5,Easy to install and good looking
5,It looks very sturdy and well-built. The suction cup has a very strong pressure and looks very sturdy. I use my phone’s map app a lot so I prefer to install it on the windshield instead of the air vent. That way I don’t have to avert my gaze away from the road ahead.Will update this review after a few weeks of use.
3,Became loose behind the backplate Will not tighten it still holds the ph good
5,It is very strong and stable.
5,Me encanto de todos los que e comprado este a sido es más útil con tres formas de ponerlo según a la comodidad de la persona es como lo describen muy fácil de instalar y se ve duradero lo recomiendo al 💯 yo como realizo Uber me es muy conveniente donde lo puse tengo mayor visibilidad.
5,I have an iphone 12.  Fits just fine even with a case on.  I use the A/C vent mount. It has clips at the end that goes into the vent so when you tighten the clamp it's not going anywhere.  Hold the phone rattle free.
4,holder works really good. a lot of position options. the only bad thing  i dont like is that when i want to remove it from the windshield is really hard to do it...even though is glass!!  i dont want to imagine if i put it on the leather dashboard...i think it would ruin it
5,I ordered didn't try it for a while return period ended. Finally tried and the first one didn't work at all. Posted such and the vendor reached out. They replaced without me asking and the new one works exactly as advertised. So the review has been updated to reflect. Very happy with the effort they went through and the new phone holder I likely just got a bad unit on the first try.
5,Had a delay in shipping and was quickly contacted to fix this issue. The phone mount arrived immediately and I was also provided with clear and great instructions for the application process. I'm so excited to start using it!!
5,Works great!!
4,I like this I'm not a super fan of it being as tall as it is but my husband prefers it there so we went with it. It stays well and doesn't wobble really. we went on a pretty long gravel road the other day and it stayed put on the dash the entire way. It works great.
4,It is not going anywhere! It is very easy to use its not in the way of anything like view of road cup holder access radio etc. I do wish it was deeper as I use a wallet with phone case and I have to remove it each time I get in the car.
4,I really like this but I wish it fit on my air vent. I have it on my dash.
5,Strong holder that works great for my dash.
3,keeps losing suction occasionally
5,I have a iPhone 11 Pro and it holds it secure even with the case and shield protector. It’s easy to install (air vent). The grip holds and does not slip. Easy to retrieve with one touch release on the side. I’ve tried at lease 3 others (purchased from NEX on base).
5,Suction cup or vent installation very easy works well and easily adjustable.Nice Design and aesthetics.Wide adjustment range for phone size.  I have an iPhone 6 and iPhone 11 for work and personal.  Securing either to phone mount is easy.  The adjustable arms snugly hold both phones even in awkwardly large phone cases.Push button release of adjustable arms is easy to get to.  Cushions on adjustable arms prevents scratching/wear on phone casing.Overall a well thought out and designed product.
4,Product lost adhesion after a couple months but I contacted the vendor and they were very responsive. Promptly sent out not one but two replacement adhesive pads. This company obviously takes customer retention seriously.
5,I realized suction wasn't needed. There's adhesion to mount to the dashboard and it stuck right on and sturdy. The holder clamps to the width of your phone with or without a case.
5,I have finally found a cell phone holder for my car that really works well!! Others I have purchased have been poorly designed or very cheaply made and I have been very disappointed in them. The clamp that goes on the vent vane has a threaded "jam" nut that works perfectly when you tighten it to secure the clamp to the vent vane. I have not tried the other holder with the suction base but it appears to have been equally well manufactured. I will be ordering another one of these cell phone holders for my wife's car.
5,My phone is large with a thick protection cover that is heavy. Have tried different holders but this works well. It holds the phone quite secure. I just used the clip to mount to the air vent in the car. Highly recommend.
5,I bought four of these my family's cars. It worked great from day one. It holds the phone exactly where you need it. I'm writing this review after having used the product for a year or more. It has never come loose from the dash even through the murderous Texas Summer. I highly recommend!
5,It allows me to be able to see straight out of the dashboard with no obstructions. It securely sticks to the surface of the car without any adhesion. The only power is the suction feature is so strong that when I would need it to move it over so that I could see the rear view cam I cannot move it. I guess that's a good thing.
5,I use the vent clip and it works great. It's so nice having the GPS at eye level instead of trying to look at it in my hand. Such a game changer. It fits my Pixel 3 XL and it fits my husband's iPhone 6. The release works great.
5,Great product strong and nice looking when you mount of window stay strong and phon it is nice and stedy das nat move.
5,Had tried several others without success.  I have this one clipped onto my vent and its been there for several months.  No issues and the vent functions just fine with it attached.  Highly recommended.
5,This is a great phone holder. It sticks great to a windshield solid and extends to a good length for accessibility. Seems to be built very durable. Been using it for approximately a month now and have had no problems whatsoever. Has not lost suction on the windshield at all. Would definitely recommend this product.
4,So far product exceeds expectations.  Other mounts I've used that attach to the vents have been flimsy and disappointing.  This one is secure and stable. It came with the three telescoping stand and vent mount. I was planning on tossing the vent mount but after trying it I've chosen to utilize it on my main vehicle and mount the suction stand in my work van.  Luke do fast and plan to purchase more.
4,I did not like the first one I ordered yet the seller sent me out a different kindVery easy to install. Has two different ways to use it. I put mine on the air vent. Could also put it in the CD partI have a 8 Plus iPhone it just fits. I am able to have my phone plugged in while on this.
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Use it while driving it was very helpful
5,This is easily the best purchase I’ve made for my car. It fits my phone so well even with my hefty case. My only issue was that the dashboard pad it came with to give a flat surface was not sticky at all when I removed the covering. Luckily I have a flat dashboard anyway.
5,I love this. I have the iPhone XR. It’s larger with the heavy duty otter box and it fits. I love that it extends toward me and can rotate to be horizontal.The suction is really strong. I moved it onto my dashboard twice and the adhesive still stands well.
4,Muy bueno y practico
5,Everything I've ever wanted from a phone holder. Doesn't fall off holds the phone securely space for charging cable easy placement on the fly lots of adjustability accommodates large phones and cases. I've used this for a year in a bouncy lifted truck with no issues despite radical swings in temperature. I can't say enough good things.
5,Easy install holds well in place on my dashboard which is a flat surface.  Adhesion and lock in place keep my phone secure as I use it for GPS.  Adjusted well to my phone which is a REVVL G from T Mobile.  Getting a second one for my husband's truck.
1,The side clamps simply fail to secure a phone in position. The adjustable base slider helps but the security of the holder feels like a failed design. After using it for some month I regret not returning it.Moreover the locks mechanism to hold phone in the proper position for best viewing always feels loose and insecure. If you have different sized phones or drivers who want different viewing positions look elsewhere for something with a better design and better holding power.
4,I really like this device. It was very easy to assemble and it is holding to my windshield. I’m very satisfied.
5,This is a great  phone holder.  I use it in my ride for my work phone.  It is a little small for my note 20 ultra with an otter box case.  But my work phone fits great!  I am happy with their phone holders in fact I have two.  This one and their other larger one (for my note 20 ultra).
5,Stuck this on my windshield 3 weeks ago. It hasn’t lost its suction yet and we live in a small town with rough roads. The phone holder is rubber lined and holds my iPhone 11 perfectly. I am waiting to see if the holder open/close unit fails as its what usually quits on most phone holders. So far I love it. Will be buy another for our other car.
5,When I bought the product unfortunately the adhesive was not attached to my dashboard of my car but the owner send me a replacement that I can adjust where is the cd and is been working excellent. Thank you so much for suggesting that for me.
5,A bit difficult to install but has a lot of options during installation. Works super fine and is easy.
5,Why everyone doesn’t own one of these in our lifestyle of phone dependency is puzzling.  Any be a vehicle out there that this won’t work. Will never go without
4,It is useful in the car and keeps me from holding my phone on my lap while driving. The only feature I wish it had was a arm that stretches out to move closer. Other then that I bought two one for me and my wife.
5,I had a problem with my phone tilting down when driving but the seller got in contact and shipped out a whole new set right away. Turns out the first cell phone holder was missing a nut that holds the cell phone in place. Now my phone is steady no matter how much my car shakes when driving. I’m very happy with the gadget now and impressed with seller’s follow up service. I’ll be ordering a second one for our other car.
2,I really love this item when we got it my biggest regret is that although it does adhere to the windshield superbly the adjustment to hold the phone in a sturdy position the part that connects the phone to the stand it’s just way too difficult and too hard to tighten up to keep the phone in the constant stable position I’m a strong man but you have to have pliers to tighten this thing that tight to hold it in a usable comfortable position my suggestions Is that make sure you have a Hercules grip
5,Great product. Has great suction and adhesion. I personally have mounted it to my work van on the windshield. I have it all the way extended and I have the iPhone XS Max. It does not sag.  Does not move while driving. You can rotate it anywhere you want and you can tighten the clamp to hold it in place. Overall awesome product would buy again.
5,This is really a great car phone mount I found so far. The feature I want to have in car phone mount are stable and good suction. And both of them are in this car mount. On top of it I liked its design. It has reserve charge port multi use on dashboard and vent. Overall it is great.
5,I use this mount all the time when I'm delivering groceries. I used to hold my phone and drive with 1 hand or have my phone rest in a cup holder. It would usually fall on the floor at some point. This is easy to clip my phone in and out with 1 hand. I love how easy it is. It also has adjustable height and angles. It fits my larger phone. Overall a great product that I plan to purchase as a gift also.
5,I try a lot of phone holders in my life and this is the best .The only thing is I wish it was a little taller because the new generation of smart phones are larger but even like that this one holds any large phones like mine the I have the note 10 plus.this is great
5,I use it in my car. It holds my iPhone 11 well. So I can use and see the gps
5,I have a Samsung Note S10 with the case it makes my phone very bulky and heavy. This mount works great on my car and hold my phone upright in place. I've had other mounts in the past and they just don't hold my phone in place. Love the car phone mount.
5,Others I’ve had were not able to hold my IPhone in a case without falling on the car floor while driving.  This one holds fast!!
5,I use this with the vent clip bc in my Yukon I don’t have a good place to use the suction part without it being in the way of my gear shift handle. Vent clip works great!! Fits my iPhone XS Max perfect and doesn’t fall out of the vent nor does it tilt. Ordering one for my husbands truck right now!!
3,This was working pretty well until a couple of days ago.  It started coming off of my dash and I had to take my phone out of it.  I do like in AZ so maybe the hot dash is causing it.
2,If you have a pop socket it will not work on the holder - so I have to take my case off everytime but then it’s greatAug 2020 - the glue didn’t hold up to the heat and has fallen off -
5,This is great! Suctions well and stays put. I love the click in and release function.
5,the first out of several I tried cell phone holder that doesn't fell off all the time! Both options (dashboard and air vent) work great and the holder itself looks very sharp.
5,I use the vent holder one the most it is very convenient and a good product. Have not had any issues and I have been using it for a little over a month now.
5,I highly recommend this car phone mount!  I have a iPhone 6s+ with a thick rubber phone case and it fits perfectly.  This car phone mount come with an air vent clip and a suction mount.  I installed the suction mount on my dashboard and it feels very stable and holds my iPhone 6s+ pretty well.  You also have the option to turn this mount into different degree which allows you to position the phone into different angles. The suction cup is easy to operate which makes it easy to adjust the mount.  It is quite sturdy against the comparison and looks and feels very well built the reflects quality.  Highly recommended !
5,Its really nice one of the nicest ones I've had. Ive bought some from best buy so this one is pretty good.
5,Works great
5,I use the air vent holder only and it is super easy to clip on. Holds my phone in place while  I’m driving. Very happy with it!
5,The dash mount (clipped to air vent) worked perfect for my needs. I am still glad I have the other options available for top of dash or windshield mount. I had to laugh at a review that said 'too many parts' for reason for returning. The quality appears to be good time will tell. It looks very nice on the dash of my Mustang.
5,I had this for a year and the adhesion is perfect even I pull off and set it in other car and it is ok the best accessorie for a car
5,This is the fourth one I've purchased. They are stable great adhesive even in Florida sun.  No rattling.  Everyone who sees it wants one and has me ordering them for them.
4,Use every day holds phone well
4,This is a decent phone mount overall but where it lacks is the part that actually makes contact with the phone. I feel like the bracket isn’t very strong compared to the rest of the pieces. I was able to break passed the locking feature with ease. Vent clip is a nice bonus too so there’s that at least it’s versatile
5,Product is fine with exception to the added adhesive on the suction cup! If I would have known there would have been an added adhesive on the suction cup I would not have purchased and wasted my money. When you stick it on the windshield and then try to take it off it is almost permanently stuck on and was Almost impossible to remove from windshield.
5,I installed this about a week ago. The suction/adhesive is great. My dashboard is textured but the suction still worked without having to use the special adhesion disc that came with the mount. The optional AC mount has wings so the mount doesn’t wiggle easily when your device is attached to an air vent... a big plus but put it on a vent you don’t need to adjust constantly (otherwise you can’t move the air vent due to the wings on the mount). Satisfied so far... hope it holds up.
4,Overall this is a great product I don’t think it’s structured well for a larger phone as I have an iPhone 11 Pro Max and the vent holder is slipping off my vent.
5,We had our unit that we purchased 4 months ago and unfortunately a user that was not knowledgeable no how to release the phone damaged it.  The customer service from VICSEED replied promptly and sent me a new one within a few days.  We have another unit that we purchased 14 months ago that is still working very well.  We are very pleased overall.
5,I love it.Hopefully we can use it for long time.
5,The product works better than expected. With both a quick clip to your dashboards vent exhaust to a powerful and but simple suction it keeps the phone at easy access while driving without the annoyance of being in the way or readjusting.I'd recommend this clip to others :) it even clips well to my Samsung Galaxy S20+5G with an otterbox case.
5,I bought this as a gift for my husband.  After about 6 months it fell of of the dashboard.  When I informed the seller he immediately sent me 2 replacement mounting disks at no charge and no shipping.  Would definitely buy from this seller again!
5,I have tried multiple phone holders and none of them have been able to hold my phone. I have to have a large water and dust proof case for my job and my phone is just too heavy for other holders.The suction cup is fantastic on window or dash. Large enough for my phone and case.Have not tried the vent mount
4,Good product suction is excellent for attachment to my windshield has an arm that swivels where I need.  Hard to put phone in it but otherwise great.
5,I have only experimented with this but I like it.
2,Mounted on dashboard.  Great for 6 months and then one day the suction stopped working and phone fell in lap.  Won't hold phone anymore.
4,I bought this item so I can use the vent attachment but it lasted about a week.  The arm that sticks to the dash works but not what I wanted to use it for.update to this review. Seller contacted me and since then has sent an adapter piece which now makes the unit stable.
5,This is a well thought out design with numerous ways of using the mount in various applications. The mount seems to be well built and provides a good foundation for mobile device security while driving. Given the sturdiness of the device it is a bit heavy but still is easy to attach to the windshield dashboard or other smooth suffice.
5,I did not use the suction cup I used the clip for the vent. It was great. Easy to take my phone in and out. The arm pivots well.
3,The adhesive did not stick well at all ! I had to replace it with some two sided tape
5,Quick review - Great design can be secured anywhere - i chose to use the vent clamp instesd of the suction cup arm because it is more discreet.Works perfectly and the mechanism to secure/release the phone quickly work great! No complaints!
5,received the product on 12/30/20 very stable have not gotten a chance to use it yet like it because I needed a device to hold my phone when I use it as a GPS when not in use I like the fact that you can fold it down and even take it apart if you wish very durable
5,Since I bought a new phone with a larger battery one of those wimpy vent holders no longer would hold the phone in turns so I tried this.Pleasantly surprised and worth the little extra it costs.Phone is easy in and out phone release button is solid and ergonomic and suction to my center console has been 100% so far.It actually works well.
5,Works awesome!
5,We bought this to be able to use our phone for GPS as we went on a two-week road trip from FL to CO to LA. While the directions recommend taking it down when not in use we have not. It has stuck to our windshield constantly for the last 4 weeks and still works perfectly. I love that it can hold multiple size phones and is easily adjustable as my husband’s phone is several inches bigger than mine. I would absolutely recommend this phone holder!
3,It is not deep enough to hold a phone with it’s case on. I have to remove my phone from my case whenever using it. Other than that it works very well.
3,Lots of other products will automatically close on your phone when you place it on the stand. I did not realize this one did not come with that feature.So far this one holds my phone in place well and sticks to the dash well.
5,This cellphone mount which I can place it anywhere to hold my iPhone 11 Pro Max at front inside of my car. Beside it really ez to use with affordable price. Love it!
5,
4,My initial experience is quite satisfactory.  The Air Vent option did not work with my automobile as the openings we smaller than the product.  However the windshield option is a decent alternative thus far.  I am using an iPhone 11 Pro with a Mous case and VICSEEED Car Phone Holder easily accommodates my encased iPhone.
5,I have been using this Universal Car Phone Mount for several weeks now.  I love it!  It was easy for me to install and it does not shake like some other's I have used in the past.  We have multiple cars and all of them now have the Universal Car Phone Mount installed.  It fits many different sizes of phones.  I can also take pictures with my phone in the holder.  If I need another I will be buying this one again.
5,I gave this to my boyfriend who desperately needed a phone holder for his car. Since he drives around a lot and uses Google Maps I figured to buy this. My impression of this item in one word: WOW. Its durable the adhesion is super strong & secure and it really is worth the money. I know for a fact he will be using the car mount for many years to come and I'm so glad I bought this out of the many offered on this site.
4,This is a great product overall. The only critique is that the area where the phone charges isn't 100% compatible with a lifeproof case and flip down charging port cover. This could be easily modified but overall an "A."
4,Customer service contacted me about the problem and were able to come up with a solution.  So far so good. Mount works great now!The sticky part that attaches to the disc is no longer sticking so the whole thing with my phone falls off the dash. Only worked for 2 months.
5,I like it so comfortable
3,Didn’t last on my dash but maybe a couple of days I guess it’s too hot in my car. Kept falling down holding my iPhone 11 medium size without case. Suction wasn’t super sticky. I make car driving videos and this last only a few drives. Oh well I will look for a different one.
4,Lo que necesito
4,Very easy to install
5,I’m not using the suction parts because my husband isn’t a fan of placing permanent fixtures in our vehicles so I use the clip that goes on the air conditioning part. I love it!! It says secure and if I want to take it out there is a release button to do so. It easily fits my phone  (6S) I know it isn’t wide I don’t like the big phones but it fits snug. The company gave me a free year warranty with the product as well 👍🏻I would highly recommend this product and the service is great😊!
5,I use this in my boat with all the bouncing around my phone don't move at all !! Worth the money for sure it has a very powerful suction on it ..excellent for boaters...!!
4,I really really really wanted this to work it holds onto the glass very well and would grab the phone very well if I did not have it in my protective case which is more important.  So will have to return unfortunately. tried with three different protective phone cases that I have and it’s just not going to work other than that it’s really great.
5,Been using it daily mounted to my windshield for rideshare driving.  Very pleased after 3 weeks of use!
5,It was very easy to install and the suction seems to be working very well. I’ve only had it a few days so it’s a little early to tell how long it will adhere very well but right now it’s working beautifully. As far as the Security goes since it can be seen very easily from the window by anyone looking in I’m not sure what is meant but it does keep my phone secure during my journey.
5,Great product that works exactly as described. Easy to install and adheres firmly to the dashboard. I had to remove it to make a repair and the reattachment is as secure as the first time. Just bought my second holder for my wife’s car.
5,Love this for its strength. Easy to mount but very strong. We have two in each of our vehicles one for driver and one for passenger. Love em.
5,Have had for about a year or so and still works just as well as when I first got it! Sometimes with mounts they start becoming loose and don’t hold as tightly the more use they get. But haven’t had any problems! The suction is very good no problems with it falling or coming loose.
5,I so love this product. The installation was very easy. The suction power is very strong. It holds my Samsung Galaxy A32 5g phone which is in a case very steady. I feel very hands free when I'm driving & talking on the phone.
5,I have one in each of our cars. I don’t use the suction feature but instead use the clamp to attach to a vent. Works great.
5,So far works great I did try using the suction on the dash had no problem with the mount or suction strong enough to hold any size phone but I decided To use the vent clip instead better positioning for me.  I received a email from the seller thanking me for the purchase & informing me the phone mount has a life time guarantee if there are any problems with the mount.  If your looking for a phone mount I’d suggest you try this one you won’t be sorry.
5,I was comparing this phone holder to the type that fits in a cup holder. I chose this one for safety reasons. I want to keep my eyes on the road not down at the cup holder area. This sit firmly on my dash (out of the way) so I can keep looking forward not down. To me this was the best choice. Very well made too.
5,I'll say this.....take your time and find exactly where you want to stick it because once you do it's very difficult to take it back off. The construction overall is better than I expected and holds my phone snugly in place.
5,This phone holder is built well and fits my S21 Ultra w/Otterbox no problem. The suction cup is soft and adheres well to the dashboard but I installed the plate as sort of a central location for the mount.
4,was is to use
5,Received unit faster than I expected.  Well boxed all parts present.  EASY to install. The longest time for me was deciding where I wanted to install it for my Best use. The base is real sticky and it appears to be made real good.
4,It was easy install the clip fit securely in the air vent.
5,I am only using the vent clamp as my dash has a fabric cover.  I have a very heavy phone in a mophie case.  The Iphone 6splus.  I thought the clamp would not be able to support it.  Glad to find it works fine and I am very satisfied.
4,Great addition to my car! Adhesive wasn't what I was expecting  but once I found out I could just use the suction it has been great.
4,The product is well made but it doesn't handle a phone in the Otter Box case very well.  It will hold the phone ok but I am not happy with the grip on the side arms.  I have been in contact with the company and sent them pictures and they seem to be interested in fixing this issue.
5,Great product and love the suction cup better!  So far I had it about a Month and no problems.  Use it almost everyday.  Good setup and release option is great.  Work with my pop socket which is a plus!
5,My new car does not have a great area to hold my mobile phone.  This product holds my phone securely and it does not come off or shake.  I used the windshield suction and I have had a great experience with it.  I would buy this again and recommend to my friends.
5,Just what I needed. It came loose the first day but that was my fault for not locking the lever in the downward position. It's been over two weeks now and no problems since I learned to push the lever down to lock it in place. Adjusts easily and is just in the right place for easy viewing on my dash. I recommend this phone holder.
5,I haven't used the suction or adhesion pads. I used the Fan-mount option where it clips to the fins of your car fan. It works great. And the lock/unlock feature that holds the phone is smooth and easy. Very satisfied with this purchase.
5,Perfect fit for a RAV4. No issues to date works great.
5,Excellent phone holder.I recommend.
5,Fast setup to my car
4,I like the quality and performance of this product but the phone doesn’t quite fit if it has a case and a pop socket (which a lot of phones have). It’s a little frustrating but other than that the product is good.
5,I was really surprised how well it worked.  Took about 2 minutes to install and it is just what I was looking for. Easy to put your phone into and take it out as well and makes the phone easier to operate if I need to while I'm driving!
5,Adhesive  not that strong! Keeps coming off / follow up Review  2/16/20  just want to say this is a really nice phone mount just the adhesive wasn't as strong  but i got contacted by costumer Service and they apologized for this problem they also offered me a full refund or more adhesives if that was the problem! Just want to tank them for checking up and making sure im a happy customer  and that to me is more important.  Thank you.
5,The mount fits both my 2015 Hyundai Santa Fe and my iPhone 12 pro max exceptionally well. It's design is far superior to the Iottie that it replaced. It seems far sturdier. It swivels very smoothly and securely so taking quick photos is very easy.
5,Bought one of these to see how it performed.  Bought two more. The clip mount to the vent is awesome.  Works in my Corvette Ram 2500 and the wifes Lexus.
4,The first day I tried the product the adhesive would not stay on the dashboard of my car. The mount kept falling off. However after I washed the dashboard and the adhesive it has stayed on securely for about 2 or 3 weeks now.
5,The only dislike is the adhesion part of it  I understand the more glued the better but not practical if you want to reposition the device different or use the vicseed in other vehicles there should be an option to use a regular suction power with out the glue in it  thanks .
4,The adhesive pad works until the car sits in the heat for to long. Then the weight of the item is to much for the adhesion. Now the suction cup on the window is magnificent. Not fallen off yet.
5,I love this product! I had a vent clip by the same company - but it blocked my vent and I could not move my vent so this solved my problem!  it suctioned right to my dash!  and works great.
4,The sticky pad it came with wasn’t sticky enough to stick to my dashboard but the suction cup works just fine on any surface
5,The phone holder seems well made and I have mounted it on the dash of my Suburu Outback. An additional adhesive pad was included for dashes that may require stronger adhesion but so far I haven't had to use it. It is adjustable in extension rotation and for size of phone. From what I can tell it is a quality product and good price.
5,I had an odd place to mount one in a motor home and it worked great.
5,Have used this for about a month now. Seems very strong including strong suction cup.  There's no suitable mounting location on my dash so it's attached to my window.  Haven't tried to remove it but looks like it would be very difficult to remove without destroying the suction cup... suggest making sure the location is good before attaching.
4,I like it but getting it to stick on the dashboard was hard I ended up opting for the window because even the dashboard attachment wouldn’t help. If you want it attached to the dashboard probably get another product
3,I have an iPhoneX with a popsocket on the back and this holder was not deep enough to fit my phone so I had to return it. The arms that hold the side of the phone aren’t very deep so my phone just kept sliding out of the holder.**EDIT** This company's customer service department reached out to me multiple times even sending me another "updated design" of their holder trying to make something work for my phone. The second holder still didn't fit my phone with the popsocket on the back but their rep Lily was still very helpful.
5,I've had this a couple of months. Holding up well. Very functional. I'd buy another one if I had to.
5,we need a phone holder that allowed us to use waze as our car didn't support airplay.  This product allows us to utilize vent or standard with suction.  We had some initial problems with suction as mounting disk wouldn't stay on dash but we relocated and now works fine.  Vent clips are very secure and hold phones.
5,As a delivery driver I need a phone stand that can hold up to abuse. I can say with certainty that I would recommend this to all delivery drivers. At least those of use who use a phone for navigation.
5,Highly recommended
5,Love it
4,Works okay have to clean dash well before installing
5,I got this one because my daughter had one and I thought it would keep the reduce clutter and distraction in the car.  I mounted it on the 'air' grate.  I works great no problems at this point.
3,it works for my galaxy note with protective case but not for my wife's leather fold over case. The little arms that hold the phone are to short (not high enough) to grab and hold the phone and cover. If the arms were 1/4" longer (higher ) it would work great. Therefore the maker should list cases it will not work with or make it universal which mean "ALL".
5,Such a great phone clip and better then any I've ever had. You can adjust it many ways. Highly recommend. Placement was on my dashboard of a 2019 Cadillac Escalade ESV.
5,I've been looking for a way to securely mount my phone in the car...cup holder mounts aren't convenient in a subaru outback and the CD mount is just a joke.  This one really is amazing in it's design utility flexibility and security...never slipping out even when pressing the screen to recenter a map or switch a playlist.
5,This phone holder brings  my phone closer to me so I can not only hear the navigation direction but also see the map provided. And this reduces my stress level also.
5,Great little cell phone holder with even better customer service. Had a little trouble with the adhesive but the seller took great care to fix my problem.
5,Using this on a 2011 F250 with an iPhone 11s. It extends well but when extended the rough ride from the truck does send some vibration to the phone. This can be overcome by retracting the arm length. The tension adjustments tighten down very well to hold the phone in the desired location.
4,Nice universal mount that can be used on the windshield or dashboard.  Great concept with the separate adhesion pad for the suction to mount on.  So far its been fine...
5,Easy to install. And it adheres to the windshield really good. I bought other brands and I was never satisfied. But this one is the best. I'm buying another one for my other car.
5,I am using the air vent mount with this holder which is why I did not rate it for suction and adhesion. It was easy to install and it is easy to use. I like that it is adjustable and my phone fits well in it.
5,She loves it.  It work for her since she does not have the ability to talk on her phone through her radio.
3,Ideally a great product however it couldn’t stand up to the Texas heat. I appreciate that it can adjust to the size of your device and is an easy in/out to release and engage.
5,Finally a phone holder that doesn’t flop around with the vent mount. It is a great clam shell type clamp for the vent blades with adjustable pressure lock. It is extremely stable with the phone LOCKED-in the mount with the phone case on !  Thanks for making a Perfect Mount. I did not use the other mount system with suction / adhesive cup yet.
2,EDITED: The seller reached out to replace the whole product. I already loved it and was satisfied with the design hold strength and angles but the back screw broke off. They were very prompt in responding and diligent in sending out the new mount. I love it! It amazing! Going to order another one for my work truck and my girlfriends car!I loved it but one day I was tightening the back screw as I was adjusting the angle and it broke so now it won’t tighten and it’s just dangles downward. I’ve tried to reach their customer support but it seems like their webpage doesn’t work and there isn’t a way for me to get ahold of Vic seed to see if they could just send me a back screw to continue using. That’s the only reason I give 2 stars :(
5,Works fine the way described.  Very convenient and easy to use.
4,The only thing I don’t like is that it makes a bit of a rattle sound as I drive. Other than that it’s great!!
5,I drive a semi up and down bumpy roads all day and the suction on this has yet to fail and I've had it installed for a few months now. It has been below zero at night and the suction is still holding. I'd definitely buy this again.
1,This product was extremely disappointing. I did lots of research to decide what phone mount would work best for us. I was excited about this product but it failed very quickly.First the adhesive plate designed to stick to our dashboard didn’t hold. I followed all the steps cleaned and prepped the surface and it held until the sun came out. I’m not talking about desert sun or Florida sun or even super hot days. Just a minivan in the Midwest on a normal June day. When the sun came out and the car warmed up the adhesive stopped working and the mount fell.Second I figured “Well maybe I can try the suction cup directly on the window rather than the dashboard mounting plate.”  WRONG!  That normal average sunshine that made the adhesive ineffectual also completely melted the suction cup to the plate!  The picture attached shows me trying (unsuccessfully) to separate the two pieces with a chisel. The suction cup entirely melted and permanently attached itself to the plate.So the plate didn’t hold and now I can even separate it from the suction cup. This thing lasted about 4 days total. Absolute waste of time. Avoid avoid avoid.
1,Do not buy.The suction cup turns into goop and the whole thing will fall off as your driving.I only had it for a few months.The holder it self is grate but the suction cup is trash.
5,I love this. it was simple to set up. Holds my phone very well. Hard to remove to change to another vehicle but that's not a bad thing. I plan on purchasing more of these as gifts to my friends whom travel a lot.
4,Very well made and different options to use it. My I phone fits perfectly.
5,I love my cell phone holder. It was very easy to install and the option of vent mount or dash mount is awesome. Both work extremely well.
4,It’s very easy to assemble and it’s sturdy in my car.
5,I love that this phone holder is universal so I can continue to use it when I upgrade to a newer cell phone! Also love that I can use it at my work desk to FaceTime and it comes with a clip that I simply attached to the vent in my Jeep and can use while in my vehicle too! It is well made and comes with 20% off your next order! Thank you Vicseed!
4,Very easy to install and perfect size for my iphone 12 pro max
5,I'm currently using it with the AC vent way and so far it's been great. It feels really solid and does not feel flimsy.
4,I wrote a comment a few weeks back that I wasn't happy with my car phone holder but the problem was corrected by you and I'm please to say it works great!  I will always shop with businesses that is willing to fix a problem if there is ever one so thank you for that.  I'm loving it.
5,I was looking for a phone mount that would hold my big heavy phone. Too many times would I mount my phone only to have it crash onto the floor. This mount holds tight to the dashboard and to my phone. Even when I go over hard bumps or take fast turns it stays put. I’m so happy to FINALLY have a secure and easy to use phone mount. ❤️
3,The holder is good but I stuck it on my windshield and can't get it off.  That may sound great but I can't use the holder because the side grips and bottom holders do not stick out far enough to hold my phone with my protective cover on the phone.  My only choices are to either change my cell phone covers or remover the cover altogether. Neither choice is preferred.
3,I'll start by saying that both the build quality and adjustability seem great. However I haven't been able to enjoy those aspects because neither the suction nor the adhesive have held up for me. Maybe it's my fault but I followed the instructions and tried applying to very flat and smooth surfaces so I don't know what more I could do. I guess I'll have to buy some extra strong double sided tape elsewhere and hope that does the job.
4,So far my only complaint is the tape on the suction cup dashboard mount. I have to get some gorilla tape to make it secure in place. Vent clip works great.
5,I recently changed my phone to galaxy z fold 2 and I was looking for holder that can holds thick phone. My previous holder failed to hold z fold 2 and left few scratch and I was so upset. Now I'm really happy with my purchase. That's suction power is really good!! I will buy it again.
4,I have a 2013 GMC Sierra 1500. I placed the adhesive disk onto the dashboard per instructions and let it cure for 1 1/2 days... I then attached the device and put my phone in... I went about 3 miles and the whole thing fell off... I then attached the device to my windshield and it works prefectly.
5,I used the vent mount option and am very impressed with how it holds the phone tight no vibrations and position adjustment is good. Would recommend and would buy again.
5,This does a great job.  It holds well to the windshield and allows me to position so that it is out of the main field of vision AND out of the way of the air vents.  Allowed my multiple adjustments so I could place the phone in close to the "A" Pillar and allow ease of use and accessibility without obstruction of vision.  Holds very well.
4,Good
4,It was fairly easy to install no problem with the suction. Satisfied 👍🏽
5,It is sooooo awesome!!! Nice size for multiple cellphones sizes not heavy but just enough to hold the phone. I buy it for my husband because he is a driver and I like it so much that I will order one for me😊😁
5,Each customer will have their own needs. I purchased this unit thinking I would use the suction cup device on my dashboard. I'm an older guy who just finally threw my Garman away in a gas station garbage receptacle. When I opened the box to see the other option of the much smaller vent attachment option I was sold. It is so easy to install is very small and connects perfectly.I would recommend this to anyone who is in need of this type of product
5,I put on dashboard and it has stayed put so far. Nice and compact and I love it.
4,I don’t use the suction cup so I don’t know how well it holds up but I’m very pleased with the product! It’s easy to use and super stable!
5,I disliked the fact that the entire car mount did not stick to my dashboard but that it impressed me when I attached it to my Windshield. As of now it is still going strong through the harsh snowy and icy roads. It hasn’t fallen yet since. So far so GREAT!! ✅
2,I have a Samsung Note 10+ and this could not hold it with my case on. I ended up flipping the holder upside down and attached it to the AC vent and it worked but it's not easy to get my phone in. I wish it was slightly bigger so it could hold my Note+ without issues.
5,I tried this product after reading all instructions carefully and couldn't get it to work on either the dash or the vent. The company reached out to me and replaced the item with a new one that was better suited for my vehicle. Excellent customer service! Thank you!
5,Great product. Love how it connects to my air vents. Had a part break. Via a chat with manufacturer I was sent a replacement part (a newer better version of what broke) within 3 days without any hassles.
5,I can’t say anything in regards to the suction power or anything of that sort but it does come with a vent clip and I do use that. It’s incredible. It allows you to still move your vent however you’d like with no fuss so you still get your air and the mount stays in place while driving. All in all a great product.
5,This is a great product and in the past six months I have had no complaints!
5,Used this on my 22ft Monterey speed boat. Held the phone secure under power and even the bounce of the the big waves.  I would highly recommend this mount.
5,At first I could not get the product to stick to any surface in my car.  I left a bad review and was contacted immediately by customer support offering advice on how to make it stick and even offering to send a new product.  Impressed by their customer service. Would recommend this product and company.
5,Easy to install quality product and no issues.
5,I have attached mine to my heater vent. I love it our state just became hands free so its helpful if i forget my headset. Also its nice to be able to watch Waze on the phone with a small glance with out my eyes really leaving the road.
5,I have a Cadillac CTS and was having trouble finding a phone holder to insert in vent. My car has no flat surface. This phone holder extends enough for the curves on my car.  It holds my Samsung phone well good grip. You can adjust the holder to any angle you want. I am happy with product and price is great! It came with a second part to place on surface of car dash but I am happy with the vent part. It's nice that I have an extra part if I change my mind.
4,Three installation ways Easy to install great view of the phone
5,I changed my case to one not as big as the other & it fits in the holder. I am very pleased with Amazon offering my money back & they’re going to notify me when the newer model is available. I have some nice cases & I like being able to interchange them it’ll be nice to be able to use the holder more often without thinking you’re going to damage it. Really looking forward to the new one coming out
5,Mounts and dismounts easily. Product is very durable
5,I received this car mount a few days ago & honestly it was so worth the money. I was skeptical at first about buying one because I figured none of them would hold my huge phone but I was so wrong. The material is strong and when I put it in place on the vent it stayed in place and hasn’t moved since. It’s not wobbly and had a nice firm hold. I would definitely recommend it to those ppl who have larger phones...Now I have to buy my fiancé one because he loves mine :)
5,This product is very well-designed and well-made.  There are numerous adjustments possible when it is mounted on the dashboard or window making it easy to see the phone screen without diverting your attention away from the road.The suction cup is strong and has stayed put on the dashboard -- even in extreme heat.The phone clip is sturdy and holds my iPhone 7 steadily in place.Also this product came with a vent clip attachment -- which also works well.I would not hesitate to buy this VicSeed Universal Car Phone Mount again.
5,I work a lot from my car and I used to have to hold my phone up to follow the map. This product is very secure on my dashboard and makes it very easy to follow directions. There is a section that’s open under the holder that allows you to charge it while it’s in. The holder adjusts to any iPhone size. This has helped me so much!
5,Best purchase I have made all year.  I wanted to use my navigation on my cell phone but was hesitant because I didn't want to put an adhesive on the dashboard of my Audi.  I just use the suction without any adhesive and it has stayed in place and has survived Texas heat.  Love Love Love!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Simple set up nice boxed not damaged. Will but a second one for my other car!!! Thank you for making it so easy. Not like the last one I bought(different company)
5,UPDATE: Alice contacted me and offered to send me a new one. I was skeptical as it seemed like I would have the same problem. But the new one stuck just fine and it rotates so I can even use FaceTime when I am sitting in my car (parked). I can see Waze easily for directions! Thank you so much for your help!
5,I like the ability to move the arm and it sticks to the dash
5,I am really pleased with these phone holders! I ordered two for the dash of my Jeep one for me and one for my husband. They work great and hold our phones secure. I love that my phone stays in place and is even secure enough that I don’t worry about losing my phone when my doors are off!
5,It seems very securely mounted and keeps my iPod in easy reach.  It's also very adjustable so you can set it right where you want it.  Also comes with a vent clip which I haven't used; the dash mount works great for me.
4,So far it is working but the plastic seems kind of cheap and like it may not be very durable.EditI've had it for a while now and I'm impressed. Even the suction cup attaching it to my windshield has been good.The company's customer service has been outstanding!!! I would definitely recommend this company.
5,I am  using for my traveling  Business . easy to install and good adhesive .
4,Good so far wish it had a magnet instead of the fingers to hold it in. My mistake not seeing that
5,I have tried a lot of different phone mounts for my car and have never been fully pleased with the results. I got the Vicseed mount recently as a replacement for a car vent one that wasn't working for me. I have been nothing but satisfied with the results I've had with this mount. It is rock solid on my dash and my phone stays in place. It is by far the best mount I have tried and I highly recommend it based on my experience so far.
5,I got this for my Note 9 to mount onto my windshield and it is everything id want from a phone mount has next to no little movement even when extended out has got to be the most solid mount i have ever owned! It is very versatile and looks stylish with the carbon fiber wrap. I will definitely be buying more for my other cars thank you!
4,Provide good service
5,Amazing car mount even with the limited space I have between my dash and windshield. Beautiful and thoughtful design great suction and adhesion. I am considering purchasing a second by the end of the year for in home use!
5,5 Stars! Perfect for my Toyota Prius I using everyday without problems!
5,The strongest and best phone cradle ever fast shipping packed for protection of the item. There’s no way you could ask for more from a vendor.
5,Easy to  remove fron the cradle.
5,Originally my mother bought me this item and then my car was stolen  I miss this item most of all so when I got my new car I also bought this item  I love this phone holder.
5,I cannot rate the suction power bcause I'm using this attached to my vent. Rating that tho its really great and attaches tight.  With the release button on the side to attach or release your cell its very cool. I use a galaxy note 9 with a case and it fits great.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT AFTER SEEING ALL THAT MANY REVIEWS ! I HAVE USED MANY DIFFERENT PHONE HOLDERS AND THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST PRODUCT I THINK WALMART PHONE HOLDER IS A LOT MORE BETTER THEN THIS & ALSO LOT MORE CHEAPER..***UPDATED***THEY WENT ABOVE AND BEYOND TO RESOLVE MY ISSUE I’M MORE THEN HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT NOW THANK YOU VERY MUCH 😊🫶
5,It’s a great product  just unfortunately doesn’t work well on the Jeep Wrangler Vents very will .But the other Mount works great . It’s nice to be adjust the Mount as needed .
5,I use the vent clip. My dash gets too hot for the suction cup. It's perfect and doesn't fall off. The clip is more like a mini vice so it holds much better.
3,Fell off of my wind shield on day three. Just peeled off and fell onto my gearshift almost breaking my phone. It wasn't that it didn't adhere. It stuck really well. Almost gooey but it definitely lacks in suction power. After receiving the replacement parts I'm a little less disappointed. I hope they get the product fixed instead of making everyone wait for the parts they shouldn't have had a problem with.
5,My husband attached to air vent in my Buick Enclave for me. I like it there. Have not gone through a hot summer in Louisiana yet though. If I need the cool air from that vent we may have to change how it is mounted
5,This is one of the best mounts that I've used. I ended up using the window mount but you also get an optional dash adhesion or vent clip.  It fits my Note20 ultra with a case  perfectly with room to adjust for something even larger. Great product.
5,I've bought a few phone holders for my cars over the years this is the best made and holds the strongest on my windshield. Will be adding these to my friends and families present list going forward. Good job Vicseed team.
4,I like the adjustable arm. I am still working out the perfect placement. It is a better option for a Jeep since there is no dash area to mount.
5,This dashboard car mount works! Easy to install and really holds the phone securely. Follow the directions to assure  adhesion for  72 hours and you  are good to go.Adjustable arm allows for different positioning as needed.Very pleased thank you!
5,Great product. Its strong. It doesnt feel cheap. The parts all fit where they are supposed to. It feels heavy duty. 10 outta 10
3,Not battery pack case friendly but mock otterbox case friendly. Other than that very stable happy with my purchase i use it on my dash and so far so good just annoying to have to change my phone case to be able to use it
5,It’s really big and fits the iPhone pro max
4,I've tried so many dash suction phone holders and this is THE BEST one I've purchased! I've had it for 6 months and it's great.
5,I purchased it for my iPhone 12 that fits perfect on the mount. I just likes it.
5,So far have not had to use the additional disk on the dash board. Will be curious once it gets cold how well it holds
5,I recommend it
5,Use it in my old wrangler for a heads up weather and mapping from my iphone. It works great even with my otter box. Suction cup is great and even has an adhesive on it. Holds my phone even in very rough conditions. Easy to put the phone into and take out of. Great articulation. Would definitely recommend this to anyone.
5,Purchase for a new car and once I found the right location for the mount it has been working great. Compared with a mount we have in another car it is made of very high quality material and is much easier to use.
5,Best ever. Holds my husbands iPhone 10 with his otter box defender series with no problem. Does not move at all over bumps or move around corners. Better than the cell phone holder I bought from Verizon for more $$$.
5,I use this in a Big Truck hauling oversized loads. Some of the roads are rough as hell. This never came off and the phone never fell out.Had it for about 4 months now.
5,This is a perfect holder for my phone to keep me safe while driving.
5,Putting the holder together was easy and the instructions were actually helpful! Once installed the holder works great!  It holds the phone solidly and it is sturdy enough that the phone doesn't bounce around when the road is bumpy.
5,Very stable mount for my cell phn I drive a 1 ton and I'm off road most of the day and this has not failed once. Great product.
5,I have a large phone LG V60 with a protective case. I was concerned I would have trouble finding a phone mount that would be wide enough and strong enough to hold this phone. I am pleased with my choice. So for it is working out fantastic.
5,I have a note 9 and I have a case on it.It's fix perfect.The suction is tough.We go down gravel roads and bumps.And it doesn't move..It gives you hand free!!So I give ☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆
1,Wasn’t what I thought it was going to be….. once you place it in your car make sure it’s where you want it to be because I placed it in the wrong spot and can not get it off my window. The last mount I had easily came off and stuck back on pretty well this has the same system but this one will not move. Good thing to have but ensure it’s 100% where ton want it to be. Also doesn’t hold the phone while in the case. So if you have a case it does need to be removed. Unless you’re like me and have a life proof and outer box. Can’t take the phone out of the case
5,This is the one the only dash/window phone holder you will ever need.. I bought one and literally bought another one after I installed it.. its amazing quality and hopefully they continue making this product for a long time.
5,Great suction all dayvand night. Used in to make youtube videos in my car! I love how smooth it is for adjusting.. it even could hold my S21 Ultra plus! Amazing product.  I would buy again
3,I mean I guess it kinda works?  Just poor quality.  It does hold the phone stiff enough but it has unstuck from my dash a few times.  The WORST part is that the “carbon fiber” looking backing is bubbling up.  No moisture whatsoever and it’s hardly been anywhere near extreme temperatures in my area.  It’s an eye sore to not have my phone there at all times now and I really only got it for long drives or if I want navigational apps in front of me.Wish I’d have bought elsewhere.
4,In general it’s a good product but after a while the adhesive start to stick off even if is on a flat surface to dashboard...But still I recommend...
5,I've had this for about a month and so far I've had no issues with the adhesion to my windshield. The grip on my phone is perfect. Its never fallen off and I've been riding on some pretty messed up streets do to construction going on all over the city.
5,I’ve purchased numerous cell phone holders in past years and they’ve all failed in some way. I’ve only had this one a short time but it is doing so much better than all the others I’ve had.
5,We just purchase this for 1 car to try it out first and we loved it. We bought another one for our other car. We hooked it up to the AC vent and it is sturdy and holds our phones very well. Really impressed.
5,It securely attaches to air vents. I prefer this to using adhesion to dashboard.
5,So easy to install and to use I could not believe it.  We just stuck in on the face of the dash with suction and it stayed then you adjust it and lay your phone in and close the sides.  When you want to remove it simply push a small lever and it releases.  Would buy again for sure.
5,Does well mounted to the windshield. Suction is good and secure. Phone fits snug and does not move around in the device. I like that you have the option to change how you want to mount (windshield air vent or dashboard). Made good Christmas gifts!
5,This is a great product! Sticks on like no tomorrow and won't be knocked off and doesn't mess up your car! Super easy and convenient to use Google Maps and not have to look down. I'm becoming an UberEats Driver so this will help a ton with that too!
5,So far I've had this product for a few days and it seems solid. I am an independent contractor and I need a phone holder as I drive 5 hours a day using gps. I chose to put it on my dashboard as my jeep cherokee isnt too keen on vent holders. I did what they said- put the round plating down first for 24 hours BEFORE attaching the mount. So far so good. Very good quality !Update customer service is great and speedy at replying
5,After purchasing another mount twice which was specifically made for IPhone 8 Plus in Otterbox case which collapsed both times within an hour of installation I then purchased this Vicseed dash mount. It works perfectly supports my phone in case and seems very strong and durable. When phone is mounted and I tap keys the mount holds the phone and is very sturdy. Have a little extra room as well my phone fits easily in case and can be adjusted to vertical or horizontal position. Love this mount great item!
5,I previously had purchased another cell phone holder and it melted on my windshield. I saw this one and three days in it holds up Good. I hope it lasts. Great buy!
5,Needed a durable and affordable phone holder in my car. Having the ability to attach it to my dash or vent was a nice little added option. Dash mount is very secure no issues at all. The vent mount is a little less stable it seems my phone vibrates more however it is secure. I have a LG Stylo 4 with a case and it fits fine in this phone holder. Very pleased with this product.
5,This product met all my expectations!  Previously I had a device that attached to my air vent.  It served its purpose.  However when I used the air conditioning it definitely limited the air coming through.  This product changed all that.  It is easy to put together.  I put it right on my windshield.  It works like it is supposed to.  I couldn't be happier!  If you want something simple to have your phone nearby but hands free this is an excellent option!  Highly recommend!
5,10/10! Best one I've ever used.
4,Had to gift this away since I opened it and all just to discover my phone fits..... without the popSocket and popwallet attachment. I wasn’t taking that off everytime I get in my car so yeah.
5,I use the air vent clip and so does my wife because it’s a better position in our car. When my wife’s clip broke you folks were great and provided a new one at no cost. I’ve also bought a couple other products now to from you. Will keep looking at your new stuff.
2,I bought this product to mount to my car's dashboard. I mounted it and the suction cup only lasted for about 40 mins after which it came off. Other reviews said that the suction on it is powerful but I found it to be weak. Now to be fair I have the S21 Ultra which isn't exactly small or light. I also live in San Diego where days can get hot. But considering that I've used other car mounts and they've worked well I can't see this as a valid excuse. I found the vent mount to work well but that's not why I bought it. Everything else looks well built it's unfortunate that I can't use it.
5,Honestly this is the best phone mount I have ever used it gripped my phone like nothing else and it sticks to every surface that I put it on the car unfortunately I was able to only use it for 5 days before my car was stolen :( but I would definitely purchase again!
4,it was good for a couple months then the suction just went off. The thing that grips the AC vent thing is alot better.
4,Air vent attachment not that great unit wobbles up and down could be the skinny vents
5,Quality made product well-engineered design. You can mount on your windshield or dashboard or as I did fastened to my vent which put my phone at eye level next to my steering wheel. I could easily see for GPS navigation. Very satisfied!
5,Even after putting it on my window in this New England cold weather it has came off since the day I received it. Holds my Note 20 ultra great. Easy to remove phone and place and secure phone with one hand
5,This one has had the best features of any I have used in the past. Very well built.
5,This mount works great either on the dash on in the vent! Don't forget to use the nut to secure the mount for the phone to the base like I did! I got great customer service and they figured out what I had done wrong very quickly. They're also very friendly. It works perfectly when installed properly. :)
4,Easy to install and gives me hands free cell phone ability
4,I love the different configuragtions that you can adjust and manipulate to fit different vehicles.
5,Works perfect. Stuck to my Honda’s dashboard
5,Only had it in a few days but it's solid and I was able to adjust it for optimal positioning. Planning on getting another for the other family car. Will see this summer if there are any issues with adhesion/suction to the windshield.
5,This is the best phone mount I’ve ever had.  It comes with a glass suck plate and a air vent clip.  I never used a air vent clip before because I thought it was not solid.  I had a IPhone 7 which is pretty heavy and big with a case.  But it fits just as rock and easy to take off.  Definitely awesome mount.  Will recommend to my friends.
5,This works very well. Holds the phone good and has a slot in the bottom for the charging cord
5,I like this for the sturdiness. I have had this since may and I haven't had any problems. I would buy it again.
5,Sturdy build and very clear instructions. The mechanism to open the handle for holding the phone is well made and can support larger phone models with thick protective cases. Love the adjustable arms to fit the phone at the right angle and depth for your personal desire.
3,Returned it if your dashboard is textured it won’t sit flat. Your better off just getting something that clips to the air vent or suctions to the windshield
5,I accidentally broke a small piece on my mount. I reached out to customer service via Facebook and they fixed the problem immediately! No questions asked. I will certainly continue to do business with them and recommend them.
5,I really like these cell phone holders. In my truck or in my sports car they stay attached and don’t readily come loose. However they will not adhere to the dash of our Lexus so I chose the vent attachment for that vehicle. We now use 3 of these and they don’t disappoint.
3,Only problem with most of these cell phone  holders is with the fact they are just barely  deep enough to hold one with an additional outer protective casing (otter).Otherwise it works fine
5,Best thing I've purchased for my car. I LOVE thing holder. I don't mind putting it on the dash it offers perfect visibility. I no longer worry about losing the phone while I'm driving. Great for easy access. Suction is great and the easy release is perfect. Phone goes in and out seamlessly. I have a 10 month old so I don't have time to fumble with things getting out of the car. I would highly recommend.
5,I really like this phone holder I use it every day its very helpful. The holder is stable and doesn’t flop around like most phone holders.I ordered my mom one and will probably order another one soon. Nice to be able to safely change your music get directions and communicate on your phone and keep ur eyes on the road.
1,Had this mount for 8 months and it was working fine until the joint tightening screw broke. Everything else is well made and the suction is very good it’s just the mount will be exposed to the hot sun especially during trips and that tightening screw will crack because it’s plastic. Company claims to have a warranty but never responded when I contacted them so buyer beware if you like to leave your mount stuck to your dashboard that screw will wear down and crack.
2,mounting plate came lose and when removing it took part of my dash board with it. Glued it back on to cover up the hole it left. Get one that sticks to the inside of the windshield not this one.
5,GREAT HANDS FREE PHONE HOLDER
5,I purchased 2 of these car charger. My husband uses his at work the suction (sticking) power is great no issues at all. I use mine in my car air vent. It work great it is not in my way and very easy to turn the phone in different directions
5,I did a ton of research and am very happy with this product! We don't use the mount and only use the vent clip so far given how cars are set up and it works great. The phone doesn't move unless you want to adjust the unit and stays right in place. I am so much less distracted when driving which is a win in my book. Love this! Don't hesitate on buying it.
5,I haven't used the suction power option because the air vent option is so awesome!!! The quality of the product is great. Very well made!
3,UPDATE: The seller reached out to me after posting this review and sent me a free replacement with an additional warranty. Very friendly to work with and great customer service-----This product was great WHILE IT WORKED. It suctioned well to the glass and held the phone at the proper angle. Unfortunately two days after the return window expired it stopped working altogether. The suction was lost and the clip holding the cell phone broke. Really unfortunate we now have to throw away.
5,The unit works great in my. 2016 Ram the suction power has a firm grip on the dash. Perfect  adjustment to view maps and directions. Can also adjust to record out front windshield.
5,I really like this Phone Holder. It’s great! My only complaint is that this ring broke and without it mount is almost useless. I wish it came with 2 ring screws.
5,i use this on my iphone 11 in my 2018 chevy colorado ventilation.  It has an awesone grabber that actually works!  plus you dont lose its use for the passenger side.  great little investment if you ask me.
4,if the suction works very well. I have received good after sales service. I had my support device replaced and it works perfectly
4,10/20/19 Update- Betty reaches out and is sending me new adhesive discs. Hopefully this works out better. I do enjoy the excellent customer service so I’m updating to 4 stars at this time.Didn’t even last 2 weeks. The adhesive wore off and my iPhone and stand fell off the dashboard.
5,I have gone through many cell phone holders and all have failed. I currently have the Note 9 with an otterbox cover and pop socket wallet. All that makes my phone pretty heavy and bulky. This is the ONLY cell phone holder that has withstood the weight and bulkiness. Be sure you really think about where to put this once you stick the disk you'll need The Force to help you to remove it.
3,perfect size and ability to adjust the position. But the screw part comes loose often and I have to keep remounting it. I tightened the piece on the back and it still did the same thing.
5,I love this phone holder! It was super easy to install. The suction cup is very strong and adheres to almost any surface.
4,Good quality
4,Easy to install
4,It seems to stick on the dashboard pretty well.
5,Works as advertised
5,I got this for my daughter. I was surprised how well it was made it seems to be heavy duty like overbuilt. It's solid and was simple to install. She loves it.
5,Popped this on the window with the suction cup. Has adjusters for tightening up every connection. Been over bumps roads and it stays put. Great design and works.
5,Love it!  It’s perfect for my jeep!  I go down a lot of dirt roads it holds up great!!!
4,Looks good. Works better than my other one and sturdy.
5,Stays on windshield. Holds Samsung Note 20 Ultra 5g securely. Great for someone that doesn't have built-in navigation screen on vehicle.
5,Easy to install stays stuck to the windshield opens easily to remove my iphone and holds it in place while driving. Very happy will get one for my wife next.
5,Love that it has many adjustments! Suction cup works but not great on my dash. They do send an adhesive patch if needed.
5,I have been looking for a car phone holder for decades it seems and there is always some reason they don't work...until now. This works great on just about any car dashboard and is built well. It can be tweaked to fit just about any type of space. I am using it on a Kia Soul and it is the first one that has worked for me.
5,I love that the phone holder is so versatile. I attached it to my windshield and it’s still adjustable with the turn of a knob.
5,I will give an update on this one this is the third one I have bought but different name this one seems to hold the phone a lot better then the others I have the xsMax in an Otterbox commuter case so far good 👍🏼I’ll come back after two weeks and give an update
5,looks great really cheap feels expensive. added some spit to the suction cup and hasent knocked off once. didnt need to use the adhesive plate. looks awesome in the e36 holds my phone perfectly
5,I didn't expect this to stick well to the curved dash of my Nissan Titan but I wanted to try one anyway.I was wrong. This thing has worked way better than I thought it would. No loss of suction in more than a month  rock solid where I adjust it to but easy to adjust.I don't use the vent option so can't comment on that.Very good value for the price highly recommend.
5,It easily comes off but it worked another way so I guess it’s okay
1,I put one in a the windshield of a new car. I live in CA and it's not that hot (used to live in AZ and NV). A few week later I scheduled to have the windshield replace. When  I went to remove the holder the suctions cup had turned soft and very tacky. It's a total waste now. Good for 1 time install?
5,This was absolutely perfect for my vehicle. The suction cup was made of a soft rubber that even stuck to my textured dash. I was amazed. Install took literally a minute. Great product.
5,Ok so this is a very sturdy holder and keeps me connected safely.  I first bought this and it quickly broke and I was like whatever... i was emailed by the manufacturer a few weeks later asking how it was doing and I told them it broke. They mailed me a brand new holder for free and it's been perfect  ever since. I even bought this for other people because it's so great.
4,Works perfectly in my car!  I especially like the arm extension to make it customized for each individual.Our state just went hand free so this works great!
5,Customer service was very kind to send me a different version of this device wich makes a lot better and perform  very well I am so happy with product and recommend to buy one.
5,Fantastic value.  It has exceeded my expectations and will remain in my car.  It stays put and is easy to manipulate.  You won't regret making this purchase... I guarantee it
4,Waste of money.1/17/2020 Update: seller reached out to me to send em another mount to try. Excellent customer service someone who actually cares for those who buy their products. Raised to 4 stars until I try out the new mount.
3,The clip works fine but the little adhesive circle did not work at all. I even pressed on it for a minute and didn’t put the suction on for 24hrs🤷🏽‍♀️ I really wanted to mount this to my dashboard.
5,The cellphone holder positions the cellphone well within easy reach and holds it securely.
3,This was easy to install we used the vent clip because the suction wasn't that good but after not even 6 month the clip just snapped one day. Now its useless.
5,I had to return 2 of other cell phone holders before finding this product. It holds my iPhone 12 without any problems.
5,Used in my car. Great product. All others I have purchased did not hold my phone or the suction cap was terrible. The Vicseed phone holder was great. Everything I was hoping it would do.
5,Very easy to install although some of the joints require repeated tightening to be secure. With the first product I received I could not access the charging port on my iPhone X but the providers kindly sent me a new version which works very well with my iPhone X. I was very impressed with the provider who offered excellent service to send me a completely new unit free of charge and without me asking for it. I feel that I can now recommend this product enthusiastically.
5,Best phone stand I have ever used. It does not fall off and takes an act of god to remove which I am grateful for. It fits my iPhone XR really well and swivels and rotates to any angle very easily. I also love that this is a set so if for any reason I want to use the smaller vent clip I can.
4,I had an issue with one of two mounts that I received and Vicseed has gone way above and beyond to correct the problem and even sent me a new unit with recommendations for a more secure mount at no cost.  Excellent customer service I couldn’t recommend them more
5,This is a great product ! It helps you focus on driving safely to your destination while the product holds your phone securely. You have an option of mounting on the dashboard or securing into air vent. The seller is very responsive whenever you have a question. The initial product did not fit my car the seller was quick to email me. She also sent out a new part at no cost.
5,the car mount works great and I didn't realize that it would come with the second one that connects to the air conditioning.it holds my phone firmly and safe so that it can't fall out from the bottom like other phone holders I had in the past.
5,The real test will be 6 months from now.  I purchased March 29. My last one lasted almost a year and lost its adhesive. This one is easy to use and install.
5,Update:  I was sent out a different model by customer service and it works amazing!I really wish this would have worked.  It just did not stick in my car!  The vent one is a little better but it still has warped my air flow.
5,I love this item practical for easy access navigation display and handsfree for safety..
5,This has been one of the best things I have ever purchased.  It holds all different types of phones.  It has been put on my dash and hasn't budged at all.  Love it! great product!
4,I have mine mounted on the dashboard with the suction cup and pad combo and it’s been working well!  I like that it’s thick enough to hold my phone with both its case and pop socket.
5,Super easy to mount. The suction held it tight and the extender puts it at the perfect distance!  I appreciated the ability to try the different ways to mount (in ac vent or suction) although the ac vent connector didn’t work in the style of vent I have.
3,I never got this installed. I tested my Samsung S9 phone on it first and the back of the holder was too tall to activate the fingerprint function so I couldn't open my phone. I returned it and was given a prompt refund. If you have a taller phone it's the perfect car holder!
5,This is the second car phone holder I purchased and I will purchase this one again. It was easy to assemble and install. I like how secure the holder is to the dash and my iPhone Xs fits in its holder without any signs of it falling off. Highly recommend.
5,I got the product right away. I was very impressed at how strong the suction is. It has held my larger phone no problem and has come lose once.
5,Full time FedEx employee in MI. We have some of the worst roads in the country and the phone holds securely to the windshield of my StepVan. I've tried 6 other kinds of mounts and all have failed within a week. Thank you Vicseed for the best phone mount I have used.
5,Fit an iPhone X with an Otterbox protective case quite well.  Vertical or horizontal positions not easily interchangeable; i.e. must use one or the other.
4,Lots of variations. Will mount and hold easily. Good construction too.
5,This car holder works great. Why? Because it's easy to setup and the release latch works fine. I use it for the vent on my AC. The clamp is strong and it holds the phone well. It looks high tech too!
5,Ordered one for my wife after I got one the one that goes into the car heaters aren’t that great but the mount with suction cups is great. After I ordered mine I realized I lost the screw that came to the mount so I went online and messaged them on Facebook and customer service was awesome sent me a replacement mount in two days
5,This product is great!  Our last two phone mounts either kept falling off or letting our phones flip out.  The suction on this is excellent and it stays put!  The phone holder is ajustable and holds a verity of different size phones.  It comes with two other mounting systems!  Great buy!
5,Perfect in my motor home.  Was worried it wouldn’t stick to my textured dash but it does.  Love it.
4,Seems sturdy enough. I like the fact that it extends. Cradle itself seems a little on the cheap side but the warranty seems good.
5,Super easy to put together...I would buy another one just because it’s that good!! It sticks to the glass or dash board!! I have the iPhone 12 with a case fyi
5,Impressive holder and includes three ways to secure your device.  And each work amazingly well.  I've never had a holder work as easy and secure.
2,The horizontal and vertical rotation is pretty hard over the ball bearing and feel like you are going to break the vent clip or the vent itself by exerting more force!
5,I was a little disappointed in the plate that attaches to the dash to create a flat surface. That did not stick as well as I thought it would but so far I love it and it’s working great. I’ve had it for about a month.
5,I had some issues with the suction initially but I reached out to the seller and they gave me some suggestions. Basically there was some debris on the suction so it wasn’t working well. I rinsed it let it dry and no issues since! I’ll try to remember to follow up on how it handles the Colorado sun in the summer but so far I’m very satisfied.
5,Legit
4,I like the product and in fact i will order another
5,Holds on really well to my cars dashboard. Even off-road hitting large holes. Does vibrate a bit when on the highway but that’s probably the fault of my bad suspension not the mount.
2,I followed the directions perfectly and stuck the adhesion part to my dashboard. I pressed hard for over a minute to allow it to adhere to my dashboard as per the directions. I left it there for OVER a day (over 24 hrs) and when I went to go attach the part that holds the phone and then place my phone in it the entire mount just came undone from my car dashboard. It does not stick whatsoever. I currently use the part that attaches to the air vent however I don't like that if I need the heat on it blows hot air into my phone and I can't close the vent to it because the product while attached obviously hinder that action.
4,I've had it for less than a week. However I do like how it works in my car.
5,I like this alot I have it on windshield I keep removing it after my shift im a truck driver and when i readd i just add a little windex it re sticks just put a wax paper or something for the suction cup not to dry and your good to go
5,I was leery about this when ordering but so far this has been (with one exception) a great phone mount. The single exception is that the adhesive is a BIT strong. When trying to place it on the dash I had to use a knife to get under the suction mount because the adhesive wouldn't let go. That's not necessarily a bad thing but be aware of this if you purchase this item.
1,The adjustment screw that keeps it tight from moving cracked and it will no longer stay in place and is useless.  Material needs to be changed.  I don’t recommend this product.  There are more quality mounts available.
5,Product works great. I got the dashboard suction cup but for some reason it wouldnt stick to my dashboard. They sent a new one for cup holder which works perfect now. Very happy with this product and seller!
4,Easy to install.  Multiple easy to set positions.  Very secure.
5,So far so good. It's mounted in a concrete mixer and they ride lousy but so far it's hanging on.
5,The suction not working anymore..after 8 months
4,Easy setup. Won’t fit it you have a popsocket but if you have a otterbox it will fit.
5,I put this right on my dash and it works fine. I really do love it.
5,This car phone mount is excellent it adheres to my windshield very well and fits my Samsung Galaxy S10 plus easilyVery easy and convenient to use this mount. I highly recommend this mount.
2,The suction and adhesion only lasted about 3 weeks. I followed the instructions. Now I have to find something that will actually work.
5,Sturdy easy to mount and operate.
5,My car mount is a great device to have in my car. My car mounts suction power was not great so it was making the mount fall off. I emailed customer service and they immediately just replaced it for me. Great service great help.
5,I wasn’t satisfied with the adhesion of the product so the seller reached out to me. She sent me a new one free of charge and it definitely works better than the first one. It definitely won’t be falling off my dashboard anytime soon.
5,I believe that this product is great for the price however the value comes while dealing with this company I mean they go above and beyond when it comes to customer service. Good product Amazing company backing it up.
5,As described in the picture everything was in the box. Easy to install and I love it. The suction power to the window holds well.
5,This car phone Mount is the best one I have ever had. It’s sturdy and the suction power is the best I’ve seen. Every other car phone Mount broke within the first couple of days but not this one! I highly recommend!
5,Brought it for my daughter who is just starting to drive. I love the convenience of it and it makes me feel safer knowing she’s not looking down for the phone. It also helps for phone navigation
5,Very sturdy! Highly recommend this phone mount!!! Its been almost 100 degrees in my car and it has stayed on perfectly.
4,Nice and sturdy. Holds phone nice and tight
4,Using without 3M
4,Wish it was easier to dock or release the phone with one hand.But other than that it adheres to my windshield great and keeps my phone secure even on bumpy roads.
3,Have had this product for 4 months. Got it in February where the weather was still in the mid 40s. This product did not hold my phone weight (iphone xr with case). Made a turn once in the highway and it fell off. When it’s too hot and I mount my phone it falls off mid-ride. I’ve wiped and dried down the area that I stick the suction cup in and it still collapses. Buying a different product now
4,Worth it for the price/ not janky
5,I have a 2019 accord LX which doesn't have carplay available so I have to setup up a phone holder for my iphone 6s plus. As there is no more space in the middle center console that I have to move the cell phone holder to the left of steering sheel as shown in the pic below. I used suction cup instead of air vent clip and mount it to the lower left corner of the windshield and it can stay there quite firmly. I would highly recommend it to anyone.
5,The best mount I've ever had.
5,Solid very happy with it would definitely buy again but don’t expect I’ll have to.
5,This thing really stays stuck and makes it a bit hard to remove if you want to move it around I am loving it so much that I bought 2!
5,Works great easy to poo phone in and out. Positions any way I need. Thinking about getting one for second car.
5,So glad for it.  Secured right underneath my rear view mirror so it doesn’t block my view.  It swivels so you can view your phone in both landscape or portrait views which is helpful and your passenger can have a look as well.  I love it!
4,It's very sturdy but when I do videos the video wobbles and it shakes a lot.  I still have to hold my phone to do a video when I'm driving.
5,My dash has mainly curves so I had to use the air vent clip. I like that I can tighten the clip to the vent fin. Works great. Only downfall so far is that my phone is a 6.7 so getting to push button to release the arms is tricky.
5,This phone mount is versatile and affordable. Driving for an app this product keeps everything secure and in its place.
5,This is THE BEST phone holder I have ever bought. Like it so much I bought one for each of my other two cars. The suction power holds strong to the windshield giving me better control when touching it.
4,I used the adhesion and then the suction and it still falls.  Who knows?
5,My suction was coming off I contacted customer service  and they replied fast and helped me get a new suction ordered.  They even covered the shipping cost. Very pleased.
5,Nothing to dislike. It’s easy to use. I mostly use it attached to my air vent and it stays in place. I have an iPhone XS. Love it👍👍
5,I liked this product the minute I got it out of the box. It was sturdy and my phone sat in it good because of the adjustable lock. My phone stayed in place not like the last one I bought. My phone kept falling off dash with the old thing I had. I have my phone on bluetooth and all I have to do to use it is tap the phone I am confident with this new product. I know my phone is secure.
5,works well for my average sized phone with typical case but my husband's plus sized phone with case has to be turned sideways to be supported well.
5,To be honest this is best-built cell phone holder I have ever purchased. I use OnePlus 7 pro a heavy one but this holder holds it still. I used to buy a lot of cheap ones but change once in a while but the cost added up quickly. This holder is not cheap but will last much longer and end up saving more money for me. Highly recommended.
5,I used this holder on my vent. I have a reg. size cellphone a motorola g6 and it is perfect. Holds solid and not in my windshield view. I love it.
5,Was looking for a car mount which would give me the flexibility of both dashboard and air vent mounts.  Especially an  air vent with an easy screw knob to adjust the opening of the clip to fit the air vent and this was perfect. Very pleased with the quality and easy assembly directions.  Did not use the dashboard mount because my car is too small but would definitely save it and use it later on.
5,Love everything about this. Works wonderfully
3,Great concept but.... Wouldn't stay connected to my vent. Flip flopped all over the place.
4,Product was broken when I took out the box I need a replacement
5,Easy to install and a great little holder to hold my phone in place.
5,Should have installed it sooner. My hubby stole it and startled using it and loved it! So I had to order another one for me!is to move around if you need to!
5,We got this for long road trips but now we use it for short ones too! The suction works really well. We have tried it in a few different cars and so far its worked great in all of them!
5,Works great. Holds phone very tightly. Was tied of having to hunt for my phone on the floor after every turn i made. Great item
5,I've used this for a few months now and it works great. I had another brand similar to this and after several months of use in the Florida heat (even though my car is parked in the garage at home and at work) it didn't hold up well and had to replace it with this one. I'm hoping this one works better than the other brand I tried!
5,Update: Seller had exceptional customer service and sent replacement parts in a timely fashion. Because of this I bought another one for my girlfriend!The product works great at first but after 2 months of it being in my truck the telescoping extension fastener has broken off. The seller fixed this issue without a hassle!
5,I bought these phone holder for my car it’s super useful and nicely made you can either put it in your dashboard or on your front window it come with a nice Warranty you just gotta simply register it customer service are super sweet and helpful! Buy it ! You won’t  be regret !
5,The suction cup sticks great to the dash of a 2003 Toyota Tacoma. The adjustable holder puts the phone in the perfect spot for the driver without interference with the AC vents.
5,I like this phone holder because you have an option to mount or attach to the vent.  Living in Alabama I am using the vent mount because the adhesive is more difficult because of Alabama heat.  Looking forward to using the dash mount.
5,Used VICSEED universal  cell phone holder mount for my car. I love it was great product to where I am to get another one for my husband.
5,These were purchased to comply with hands free law in Indiana effective 7/15/20. Easy to install in 6 vehicles suction to glass worked very well tried to remove and had to go get a thin blade putty knife to remove from windshield. Great Product Well Buy Again if Need Anymore.
5,Suctions better than any other suction device I’ve previously used in 20+ years. Used in a few drastically different vehicles and the adjustability is very nice.
5,Highly recommend this car mount!!! It was so easy to install and use!!! I love it!
5,Best one yet quality above average and suction is Superb!!
5,I have it mounted on my dash and it has held very well. It was easy to install. It is very stable and holds my phone perfectly.
5,Works great! I have a thick cover on my phone and it holds it perfectly
5,This holds my iPhone 11 Pro Max with a THICK Otterbox Defender case. It is ~0.59" thick. Holds tight and stable. Does not wobble or make noise.
5,Very strong and sturdy enough adhesive suction 👍🏼👍🏼💯😍
5,It was easy to install and holds my phone great I love that it can fit my phone with an OtterBox case on it
5,Haven’t tried the window mount yet because I just got stuck on the vent clip. Love it. Super strong the release button makes it super easy to take your phone off and put it back on. I have an iPhone X max and the vent clip alone holds my phone super sturdy and I have a life proof case on it. So worth the money. And I drive a lot and been thru many many phone mounts. Best yet.
5,The area for the phone has an opening for the charging cable. There is foam padding on the sides that squeeze together to hold the phone securely. The button to release opens the side arms smoothly and stops when you release. There are no sudden popping or clicking actions and it feels like it was designed and engineered with some care. Totally unexpected at this price point.
5,I had issues with the adhesive that anchors the mount to the car. It was almost 6 months since I purchased and was not sure whether customer service will respond. Much to my surprise they responded immediately and shipped a replacement part. Was very pleasantly surprised. Great company and customer service.
5,Really like this. The telescopic affect makes your phone so accessible. Had a bit of trouble getting it on solid but once it was suctioned on it has not come off. We will see in the future. They also supply another pad in the box that can help with adhesion but I have not had to use it yet. Would recommend.
4,Does not stay on windshield in the summer heat
4,Good product I just had difficulties getting my phone fit. Also a great seller!!
5,This product has been sad table while holding my phone in place. I didn't like blocking my air vents with my other phone holder and this is great because it can be place where is best for you in the car.
5,I got this for my fiancé for his Jeep it’s great! He has an iPhone 8+ and I have the iPhone 11 and both for great. He has it clipped into the vent currently rather than the dash but for the price this is great because you have many mounting options and it holds great!
5,This is a great product. The suction cup was a little hard to use and it did not work very well however this could've been because I didnt use it correctly since the instructions were hard to understand. However this is of no consequence because it also came with a clip to the air vent which I use which works magnificently.
3,Suction and adhesion both terrible.  Car out in sun for a few hours and adhesion wore off.Tried suction but slight curve to dash made it impossible. Ended up using clip mounts.  That works better.
5,Excellent!! Have only had this a few days and love it! I had a different brand and this one is much better! Fits my Galaxy 20+ perfectly!! Definitely recommend!
4,It works great however it doesn’t stick to a curved dashboard very well. I mean it’ll stick just enough to stay put but it’s awkward.
5,It has the best phone holder I've ever had . Suction power is great adhesion is awesome and it's very easy to install
5,Bought this for my daughter and it works perfectly in her air vents to hold her phone up so she can see the screen!
5,This product works perfect in my car. I needed something to lift my phone to eye level especially when using an interactive map. It even comes with an air vent holder as an alternative way to hold if you don’t want to use the suction.
5,Very happy with the range of motion this product has and how secure it feels while holding my phone. I've had several other products and they have all failed me one way or another. I actually have two of these as I was very happy with my first purchase.
5,Espectacular…!!!!!! 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
5,Easy to attach to windshield and comes with a vent attachment which I haven't had to use yet. Much better than the last windshield mount I was using.
4,Mounted pad too weak
5,This is the best thing I have ever had for my truck not only does it look good but has performed better than expected.  Awesome
5,So fare so good.
2,Suction circle ⭕️ plate is not strong adhesive i wont hold enough to place it in dashboard
5,Attached to the vent perfect position for easy viewing.
3,Suction terrible
5,Lots and lots of adhesion / suction power almost if it is glued to the surface. Great flexibility. Good quality and good price definitely recommended product.
4,Good so far have only used the vent attachment but everything is working as expected.
5,It was really easy to Install and gives several different options you can choice from. It stays really well even right after applying. I LOVE IT
5,Works great! The suction cup comes with a plastic film on it because it is VERY gummy and sticky. I t sticks to the window fantastic and is very easy to adjust.
2,It sticks really well onto the included 3m plate but the actual phone holder flings around when driving. After using it for a while having it fully tightened down it starts to get loose and then you can’t tighten it anymore.(Update)Customer support read my review and sent me another phone mount which yet again failed to hold up my phone. I had a iPhone XR and then switched to the 12 pro max; the XR held for about a week and then started to not stay tight on the arm. I tried my new phone with the new mount they sent and it just wouldn’t stay up. The product needs to have some metal parts to it so it can handle being tightened better.
5,Overall this is a really nice mount. I didn’t use the arm and suction yet just the air vent clip. It’s really sturdy - I like the fact that you can screw the clip closed on the vent - much better than other models I’ve tried. Fits an iPhone 11 perfectly. Plenty of flexibility to change viewing angle. Overall would recommend this product.
5,This review is after over 6 months of continuous use. This is a great product! It's durable ; no wobble or shake suction is great; hasn't broken loose once since install.
5,I love this phone holder! I can do windshield dash or vent! I needed something that would adjust a little and not ne hard to get in or out of mount. You will not be disappointed.
5,Hands down the best phone mount I've EVER had.  I travel a lot and needed a mount that could hold my phone with all the bumpy back roads I often find myself driving on.  The second you stick this thing onto the window you can tell this is not coming off and your phone will not be swinging or bouncing around.  Awesome product!
4,El producto que pedí nunca yego a la dirección 1606 marblewood ave hyattsville md 20785
4,One of the arms have stopped extending when pressing the button. I’m using it on my vent and once a week I have to tighten it.EDIT: They really like their customers to be satisfied. Mine malfunctioned after having it for three weeks and they were happy replace it.
5,I would recommend its really good quality
5,It was easy to install I was impressed with the option of using adhesive to hold on to the phone mount for the extra support.
3,I did not have a good first impression with this product but their customer service contacted me right away offering to help so I can be a satisfied customer. They even sent me a new product and followed up to see if it was working well. I still did not have the best experience with the product as it could not hold my phone (I believe my phone may be too heavy) but if you use the clip that adds to the air vents that works great.
5,Had an issue with it and it wasn’t holding my phone up and left a review then the company contacted me and sent me a new one for free and it works great so far. Great customer service and great product!!
5,It comes with a flat metal disk with adhesive on the back to create a solid base for the suction cup.  Think twice before placing it.  It is strong adhesive.  Rush your placement and repent at leisure.
4,Easy to install
5,Very nice item for purchase
5,Sharing with my friends. Perfect for my traverse. Perfect spot on my windshield. Doesn't work with a pop socket. Had to Velcro my pop socket on so i can remove it to put in the bracket.  Hold the phone well and fits any size.
5,The fastener needed to be replaced possibly due to sunlight for long periods it cracked. But when I contacted the seller they immediately sent me an entire replacement which was great. This phone holder is pretty cool. I like it.
5,Exactly what we needed! We needed one for our upcoming roadtrip on our dashboard. You can tell how sturdy it is.The product itself comes with a card to register for warranty that’ll give you 18months really good customer service.
5,This was so helpful and convenient.
5,This cell phone holder has been awesome! I’ve moved it around several times and it’s still holding up wonderfully! I love it!
5,It was Avery easy to install and works great it is the best cell phone holder that I have had and have had many!!!  Thank you for making a great product!!!
5,Got this for my truck. I've had similar before but the suction never holds that well or the suction holds but the holder it self kinda bounces a little while driving.  This not only has great suction but also doesnt budge at all. I've got a bigger phone with a thick case it it fits securely
5,Love this thought It might be to bulky or not fit with my case but works perfect and supports my phone great
5,I have bought several car mounts before all of them have had some type of issue within a week of purchase. They don't come with warranties and you can tell right off the bat they are poor quality. I love this car mount! My phone is secure and doesn't wobble around fall out or anything! I am so happy w this purchase and would absolutely buy this product again.
5,Solid versatile and well designed. Very happy with the product. Just bought one for my daughter-in-law.
5,Works great and is totally adjustable for big phones. I also like the vent clip it gives you options if you have the right kind of vents I bought 2 for my wife and I.
4,This phone holder sticks excellent on my dash because my windscreen is too far way. Lots of Flexibility to set it up where & how you want it
5,UPDATEcompany reached out and sent me replace parts!!! I have had no issues since then  sometimes suction gets dirty!Fell off windshield within 1 week tried to clean suction cup no luck used the suction base it came with no luck.. just a pain and now looking for another product..
5,Doesn’t work well with textured surfy
5,Great product . I have bought several car phone holders  and they are  never was wide enough to hold my Stylo 5 with a case or strong  enough .  This is the best I ever had .The suction plate holds the suction cup nice and sturdy.
5,I really like that it is easy to install and holds the phone in place well. I also like the quick release button to retrieve the phone.
5,Great fit great suction and holds my phone in tight !
5,This is the perfect phone holder!! Very adjustable and holds your phone securely without being an annoying vice-grip once it's time to remove!!
5,Seems strong. I put mine on the windshield and it's been on there for a couple weeks. Doesn't bounce when I drive.
4,very sturdy and strong.
5,Attached it to my windshield when I'm using my GPS and it's awesome. Holds the phone firmly (I have an IPhone 12 Pro Max) and doesn't pop off the windshield. Very satisfied.
5,So far this has stayed put on my windshield. Hasn’t gotten hot yet so not sure how it’ll work then but it’s great so far.
5,Great! I ended up liking the vet clip holder better but they both work well. It comes with both a suction cup and a way to put it in the air vent.
5,I did a lot of research before purchasing this product.  It came with all the necessary accessories to mount it on the dash windshield or air vent.  I choose to attach it to my car air vent.  The phone stays in place and flexible enough so that it can be viewed from a number of different positions.  I'm very happy with this purchase.
5,There are two ways to use this car phone holder. I clipped it to my vent a few days ago and it seems to be working great. It isn’t out too far from the vent nor is it too close to the vent. I am very pleased with it. Very sturdy!!
5,Very easy to use. My suction cup had a little problem sticking so I contacted the company and they actually sent me an entire new holder
5,Product is really good. And the suction power wow.
5,Love it! Easy instructions. Had no problem with holding my Samsung S21+. Stays put!!
5,I just received this phone mount on September 15th 2020. I highly recommend this product because it does exactly what it says it does. So far so good and I hope it continues well over the warranty date which is 12 months.
5,Love this! The adjustable arm swivel and turn features offer so much flexibility regarding where you can put it in the car.
5,Initially I had an issue with the adhesion to the dashboard. But Andrew reached out to resolve the issue as soon as possible. Quick response time and a commitment to solving the problem!
1,The mount started dangling and making noise after a month and of course my return window is closed…..
5,I used it when driving long distance which kept my hands freer
5,This mount is very versatile. So many different positions and easy to install. I highly recommend it!
5,Fácil de instalar
4,This is a fine product and I'm going to blame Louisiana's sun for this but when it gets to warm in the car it keeps losing suction.
5,I have tried several different products and to say I'm thrilled with this one is a huge relief. As a ride share operator having this tool is critical. Extremely stable secure and does not interfer with my sightline or fall apart while driving. You will not be disappointed.
4,So far so good. Has a little too much movement for me but overall good product
4,Did not hold my phone  it kept falling!They did reach out to me and sent me a new one and this one seems to be working better time will tell
1,This product is made of sturdy material. However the portion which actually holds the cell phone no matter how tight I tighten it keeps moving downward due to the weight of the phone. Therefore I have to keep readjusting it back to the standard position so that I can see the phone. Also I do not use the mounting plate provided with he mount but the windshield instead because I move the mount to different vehicles. Sadly the unit keeps detaching from the windshield falling to the dashboard. It is a real disappointment. Unfortunately I purchased two of these mounts before I realized that they don’t work (at least how I use them) leaving one in the States and taking the other overseas where I live full-time. By the time I realized my mistake it was too late to return them. They ask in their advertisement to contact their customer service department is a customer has any issues which I did but there was no response. This is why I am now giving this review.
5,Fits great on my windshield. Has strong hold and the option to adjust is a huge plus since phones come in so many sizes now.  I have an iphone 6s with a bulky case and it holds very well.
2,Sadly I was disappointed to see that it keeps falling off due to the suction not being strong enough it comes with a pad and the pads its self is stronger than the suction of the mount itself. the arms that holds the phone is fine it works good but the fact that the suction on the arm does not work at all makes the purchase worthless I was certain that it was going to work but to my disappointment and my own experience with it it continues to fall and never be able to hold its own regardless how hard I press on the suction to the pad or the surface alone as well as having it suction to either the pad or the surface
5,It is exactly what I was looking for. I'm able to put my phone where it can be viewed if needed. It is very easy to install as well.
5,My husband purchased one 2 years ago still in same place he put it I had a problem with mine I contacted customer service they were so Accommodating and told me they would send me a new one great customer service it was my fault I didn’t do it right I still have the product absolutely love it
5,The window suction works great. The mount is sturdy I will buy again. The adhesive for the dash didn’t stick have to reinforced with adhesive. Other than this was a good buy
4,Just received and have not installed yet but looks very promising.
5,Works great I use the vent clip just because of preference. Will probably only use the suction for long road trips. It fits my S20 ultra with a regular case and a popsocket.
4,I mounted my phone on the dashboard of my suv. It does well but it’s quite bulky.
5,This cellphone car holder is great! I like the fact you can use it on your dash and on the vent. Makes it easier to rotate as well if need to.
4,I like it
5,Very good
5,Strong suction easy install and high quality. Strongly recommend everyone.
3,Not what the picture showed! It works but none the less not the same head if you are looking for model# UV 450 26 with the led lights your better off checking on the Shark website or calling shark
4,I like it works well
4,It does the job and I'm pleased with it.
5,This is a great product!  In my travels across the country for my photography business I’m confident that this product will be secure where I place it.
5,I have used a lot of phone holders and this one has so far been great.  It's easy to install and use.  The best bonus is that it has both dash mount and vent mount options.  If I am traveling on hot days I like to keep my phone on the vent so the AC can keep it cool.  Both dash and vent hold great.  Using with a Samsung Galaxy S8
5,Very pleased with the versatility of this phone holder. I wound up using the vent clip which was very easy to install.
3,While this is very easy to install and can be handy it wasn’t quite as sturdy and strong as expected. Unfortunately there aren’t many flat surfaces on our dash so we had to rig it a little to make it useful.
5,Used on a 14 hr road trip worked great.  Only drawback was that I was unable to use the vent clip because none of my vents are stationary.  Every time I turned the wheel the weight of the phone caused the vent to move making the phone slam into the side of the dash.  But the suction cup worked fine even in hours of direct sun.
5,Purchased several months ago and it’s holding up well. First one I’ve had that actually worked! I like the quick release option and that it adjusts easily.
5,This mount is solid. I use it both with vent mount and with suction on adhesive surface (depending on what location I want my phone in at the time) and both work perfect. Make sure to use the bottom or lowest slot on the vent. I use this with my note 8 in an otterbox defender case and it fits perfectly with room to boot.
5,It’s a great product! It holds very well when fastened correctly and it’s very convenient! It does wobble a little bit at highway speeds but that could also be my car shaking a little and not just the mount. Overall great product highly recommend!
5,This is a perfect phone holder. Sticks nicely and super durable. A must have if you drive a lot
4,Works well. Adheres perfectly so far on even on a curved surface.Only issue is the release button is on the left so it some how feels awkward when releasing the phone.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I used the hard plastic puck and mounted to my dashboard. The first five months it worked well no complaints. Now for the last month see video the arm is swinging back and forth. There is ZERO ways to tighten this up and now it will NOT release from the plastic puck I put on my dashboard. I'm in Florida and if this thing turns to junk over the winter no way it would last through a Florida summer.It literally swings side to side unless you're on perfectly flat roads doing 35mph. ANY bumps changing lanes at highway speeds this thing is moving. Utterly worthless now.
5,The holder can be positioned a lot of angles so when I'm driving I can point it at passenger or my self. Seems to be made very well. I use it for my I phone 7 but my sons iPhone 7 Plus fit fine also. Just can't have a bulky case on 7 Plus
5,Took me maybe a minute to install! Used the clip feature for an air vent! So easy and securely held my phone! 🙌🏼
5,Loved that it expands to fit your phone even with a bulky phone case
5,I love this this product has so many functions and methods for mounting. I prefer to use the windshield mount to keep from possible damaging the material on my dash. Its been a great convenience during for navigation while driving.
5,Can't recommend this cheaper mobile mount enough. The ball joint approach with extending arm works very well.  Suction strength is pretty decent so far. The best is the vent clip mount.  Usually these are flimsy or easily rattle or pop out of the car air vent when hitting a good bump. This uses a mechanical dial tightening system to close a decent single aluminum clip on the vent. Thing is SOLID.
4,Very easy to install and use.
5,Just installed this. Pretty easy to install. Seems stable and easy to use. Will update this review after I've used it for a month or so.
4,Good to have multiple options to mount in the car. Relatively low cost.
5,I have purchased many car mounts and this one is by far one of the better made units. Don’t hesitate to give them a try you won’t regret it!
5,I've not used the suction but I love the vent clip!  Easy to place & remove my phone. Feels secure.
3,Product was easy to install and adheres well.  I have a pop up button on the back of my cell which makes it difficult for the phone holder to hold the phone securely.  I have to fiddle with it; sometimes take it out of the protective case so it fits securely. Once secure it works great easy to adjust.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Very good product hold suction very well as you can see in the video that was on I was driving hold in place very great definitely would recommend it
5,Phone Mount appears to be of good quality. Holds phone well suction cup mount stays in place well.
5,Love it just got it today and it’s amazing I’m glad I don’t have to put my iPhone 11 Pro in the center counsel anymore!
5,The product received ahead of schedule delivery date. Very good quality for lesser price compare to other similar product.  Very easy to assemble and adjusts to your  needs of view.Thanks.
5,It arrived on time and was easy to install. The suction was amazing. I changed the phone holder section with a power charging dock! I’m loving it.
5,Only one that stays in place well. Has never fell off vent fin! Great price. Great for GPS phone use.
5,My original review rated this product as two stars however a representative of the company reached out and helped me get everything working correctly. It was an awesome moment of customer service. Well done.
5,The twin stick on the pad provided didn't hold kept falling off but the sellers was very helpful  and sent a replacement immediately.
5,The power suction power was good. Just read your instructions the adhesion have a good grip on it the security features are good keeps your phone on a good lock.
5,I love the options for adjustments...tall short wide view zoom etc. we got you covered. Worked for me!
5,This phone holder is a great product. It fits great on the dashboard of my car holds my phone securely in place has great suction power so my phone doesn’t fall off. I highly recommend it.
4,Great product but side holder clips not deep enough for wallet cases.
5,Great buy strong hold Z Fold with huge case like nothing. Worth the buy.
5,Very stable.  Mounts easily.  Easily adjustable. -- works both with my thin case and my husband's thicker Otterbox.  Grips phone tightly.  Does not work with PopSocket on your phone.
5,Works exactly as advertised.  Easy to install.  Great product.
5,I like everything about this phone holder. It stays put believe my excited grandson on that!  It holds it steady while driving. I like the release button design. In fact I go to put my phone in it and my Husband has stolen first!! Thanks for a great design I'm very satisfied!
5,Works very well.  This hold my phone securely and mounts securely to either a smooth surface or a vent.  The release button is well located and works well .
2,The suction feature did not work at all with my car. It was actually more like sticky and gooey rather than suction. I would drive and it would fly off my dash with my phone or when I got in my car it would be unattached from the dash.I do like the vent attachment but sad the suction one didn't work at all. It may have been because it's hot in Houston and I drive a small car so my dash is rounded. But even with the flat additional attachment circle it wouldn't stay. So no idea.
4,Suction left a mark on my dash!!!
4,Easy to install
5,We Love this product it is so easy to install we are amazed by its "adjustable" features it can be easily adjusted to the position to fit your view while holding the phone tight and secure.  There are so many ways to use the product other than 3 ways to use as a car mount I also like to use it as a nice phone stand at home.
4,nice quality. if needed in the future I will buy it again !
5,First the product comes with everything you'll need including a special pad that can be used if the suction cup isn't working well. I didn't need it because the cup held very well. Solid build not cheap plastic. Very durable. Deep holder holds phone case and popsocket on the back. I am impressed with the product.
5,I bought this for someone else and decided I need one to for every one of my vehicles it's amazing!
5,Finally a phone holder that does what it says. Stays firmly in place even over the bumpiest road in a stiff suspension truck!
5,Really love this mount! I show dogs and rabbits and travel alot so we use GPS on our phones. It holds up great and I still have my eyes on the road while driving!
5,I bought this rather than pay the cost of installing an updated bluetooth.  It was simple worked exactly as it was supposed to and I have no complaints at all
5,I love love love this mount. I have it mounted to my dash. I have never had one that works as well as this. I go over a lot of bumpy roads and I haven't had a problem yet. My phone is fairly large so it is hard to find a quality mount that will hold. 5 Stars all around. PS- I just ordered 2 more to give as gifts.
5,I did have a problem this product but they have graciously taking care of it so that I am happy now
5,While I couldn’t use it on the vent (can’t tighten it enough to hold the weight of the phone) it works great with the suction option. Higher quality than expected arm stays put even over bumps.
5,Easy to install works great stays attached to the windshield
4,Buen agarre del cell y puede ponerse en distintos angulos. Solo que la adhesion no es muy buena
5,Very easy to put together and works great. I have not tried the suction part yet since the clip on the vent was so easy. Holds two different phone sizes quite easily
4,The dashmount adhesive gave after a month but I was provided with two replacement adhesive pads.  The new adhesive has been holding strong for over a month.  Other than my adhesive the mount works well.
1,Lo compre para mi carro... solo estuvo pegado un mes luego perdió la pega no lo pude usar mas. no se adhiere bien...
5,Have tried a couple different car mounting solutions and this is by far the most solid for the money. Very robust and the grabbing element ratchets effectively and snaps open cleanly when it’s time to remove my device. Buying another one for my other vehicle.
5,Haven't used the dash one but I really liked the way the vent one tightens in the vent to make it secure
5,Most suction cups just have plastic. Do suction cup also comes with a adhesive which makes it stick much better.
5,Compre lo que solicité y las características son tal cual lo especificado en las características del producto. Me llegó super-rápido.
5,I personally searched for a long time to buy the right car mount since I have an iPhone 11 max pro and this one fits perfect. It has a good suction cup and it’s very sturdy so that it doesn’t move while I drive.
5,This is definitely better than most products you get at your local retailers. Its very sturdy and it gets the job done. I would definitely repurchase this for my other cars as well.
5,The product arrived within 2 days and its great no issues so far easy to install and it’s strong. The have a I phone 8 plus so it’s a big phone. I will get another 😁
5,This thing is solid comes right out of the box with perfectly clear instructions easy to install lifetimes better than my previous car phone holder. Thanks Vicseed together we achieve victory!!!
5,I am using this phone holder on my desk to hold my phone. It stick to flat surfaces firmly and the back is grippy. I can't complain.
5,Great loving it stays firm and it can be move how ever you want it fits my note 9 and my iPhone 6
5,Pro truck driver here....like this phone mount so much that I bought a 2nd one for my personal vehicle. Good price excellent quality.
3,Good phone holder if using vent clip or suction. Adhesive pad is not very strong. Gave out within a week time. Registered the holder and was able to get another adhesive pad.
5,I drive all over the place daily and I use my phone for GPS. No more having to hold it and drive. Love the flexibility of dash mount since I hate stuff on my windshield.  Comes with a vent mount also but I doubt I will use that. If I did it would be an easy swap from one to the other without having to unmount the stand.
2,I liked this product at first until the adhesive lost its grip.  Followed the instructions which are straight forward.  Works great until the adhesion wears off can’t find the same adhesive stickers with the proper thickness anywhere.  So you end up wasting money.  So disappointing for a potentially great product.  Come on Vicseed hook it up don’t fail your customers.
5,This is a great little phone mouth with a wide variety of adjustability options. The only thing that would have made it better would be an automatic closing feature when the phone is placed into the cradle.  Over all it is very convenient and solves the one problem that every driver needs which is a place to put their cell phone. This even fit my extra large Galaxy S9 plus
5,Second one I've purchased. This one is for a gift for Christmas. Its super well made and holds any phone pretty much perfectly. 10 out of 10 would recommend this product
4,Found that is securely holds phone in place without bouncing around like other ones that I bought. I have a Note 10+ and it fits great. Love the vent mount even more than the dash mount
4,Does what it advertises. No real complaints. Just make sure and check phone size. Some phones with a large “otterbox” style case could be a tight fit.
5,This was super easy right out of the box! Easy to install and works great in my car! I look forward to how it stands up to the 100+ degree heat we are experiencing right now in northern California.
5,Exactly what I needed. Holds my large iPhone and although it’s only been a week I can tell it’s going to continue to be a great purchase. Would recommend!
5,Been on my windshield for about a month and no issues.  This handles my iphone XS Max with an Otter Box on it well.  I could expand it so I can view Waze in Landscape mode and it remains stable.
4,Even when securely fastened to windshield mount holder allows phone to rotate a bit making it a little difficult to manipulate when tapping screen or trying to remove phone
5,I bought 2 of these and let me tell you best investment ever. I am daily driver this thing has not faiked me at all going over speed bumps or whatever just love it.
5,Suction power is great. Easy to install and remove our phones. Liked that it was stable and did not bounce around while driving.
5,When trying to attach to my vent in the car it tilts over no matter how much i tighten it... But will try the new clip the seller sent me got that one real fast and is pleased with the feed back from seller he made it right for me thank you very much...
1,Loved the holder itself and the fact that I can use it 1 handed. However it won't stick to my dash... I tried using the suction cup directly on my dash first and it stayed for about a day before falling off. Then I used the 3M disc that came with it thats supposed to work on textured dashboards. Followed the directions exactly...washed the spot let it dry fully then attached the disc and let it sit for a full 48 hours before attaching the phone mount. It seemed to be working great for about a week then suddenly the 3M disc detached and the mount with my phone in it flew to the floorboard. The 3M disc isn't reusable so I'm pretty much SOL at this point. Extremely dissapointed that I basically wasted $25 on this thing. I could use the vent clip but the whole reason I got this mount was to replace my old mount that clipped to the vent. Don't bother wasting you money on this one.
5,Absolutely love this. I can't believe I've been driving around with my phone rolling all over my lap or passenger seat
5,I love this car mount. My phone fits nice and snug. It doesn’t move around and it’s sturdy. It’s very easy to install. I recommend it.
1,Great item at first. Built well. But suction does not work anymore on all surfaces (glass plastic). Only used it for 3 months.
5,So we'll made and easy to install either on fan or glass or in the board. Long arm and heavy duty materials loving it🥰
5,I have Vicseed ph holder on my windshield for months.  It has never fallen off!Awesome job Vicseed👊🏻
3,If dashboard gets too hot or too cold it falls off. Yes followed all directions to a T.
5,Has only worked itself loose once since installing and that was because it wasn't placed on a completely flat surface. Otherwise no complaints whatsoever.
5,I like how this AC/heater vent actually clings to the vent vertically and horizontally #gamechanger!
5,I am really happy with this purchase. It’s sturdy and worth the money. I love that I can put my large Iphone in it without taking it out of the case.
5,This item works well with make of my car I love the ability to adjust the extension so the phone can be as close up or as far back as needed it has great grip quality and a convenient  release button that allows you to easily retrieve your device
5,Product arrived and time and even through the plastic seal on the suction cup held to the windshield
5,Worked so well i got a second one for my car. I have samsung GF has an iphone. Finally got her off the phone while driving
4,I thought it was going to be flimsy but it isn't. The suction could be stronger but it will do. Got my money’s worth.
5,Drivers are happy with these very sturdy & stay in place
5,Well made  Not cheap plastic crap.  These people have been absolutely wonderful to deal with  Had a slight problem  Probably because of my doing and without hesitation problem was fixed  No questions asked . Customer service is IMPECCABLE....
4,A great product however it doesn’t work very well with a thick case AND pop sockets. My phone didn’t fit the best and kept popping out
5,I ordered this for our golf cart. The mount attached securely to the front windshield. No problems with vibration of the cart as we roll along over bumps. Holds iPhone X very securely and I like the slot that allows you to connect a power cable.
5,I bought it as a gift for my husband and he liked it very much
5,Very happy with this phone holder. Very sturdy and you can position it in any direction. Highly recommend!
5,I would definitely recommend this product.  I bought a different brand and it was flimsy and wouldn't stay secure.  This is well made and fits most devices.  Try it and see for yourself!
5,A rock solid quality built unit. I’ve had several and this one is my favorite. I’m buying 2 more for my other vehicles.
5,Use it in my boat and it’s never fell out of the holdster good product
5,This holder would work great in a car! Worked great in my ATV for about 20 miles of a 30 mile rough ride!😀 A couple of screws in the base solved expected problem! Nice holder with adequate adjustments!
5,I had problems with the one I bought but the seller reached out to me and sent me a replacement one and all is working great now. Would buy again
5,Un un producto muy bueno y cómodo para el uso del teléfono en el carro lo recomiendo
5,My car need to use better adhesion to the console and Lily from customer service help me 3 times to find the right product for me she work with me and provide the best customer service support.
4,Not bad for the price.
5,Had to take my phone out of the case to use this but it grips the phone well and locked into place in a vent with no problem. Like the gap on the lower tab that lets me use a charger on my Moto phone while driving.
5,This is perfect for use on our boat! Very handy fits my phone perfectly and the suction is great.
5,Although the suction could use some work the rest of the product is built with high quality material. Would recommend!
5,Works exactly as advertised I use it everytime I drive
5,It worked for my RAM and Chevy Malibu I have been using it for two months and it works great.
4,This product is alright . Some noise is made when driving and so far it has only fallen off once .
5,I only just started using the car mount but it worked great on my recent road trip. So far have been quite happy with the purchase. The mount seems sturdy and fits perfectly with my iPhone 7.
5,This thing is rock-steady on the road. WAY better than other similar models or gooseneck types I've used. HIGHLY recommend this one!
5,I was looking for a non-vent car phone holder. I wasn't sure this would work because of the texture on my dashboard but it holds like a champ. I'm very pleased.
3,For the price it should charge my phone but it doesn't.  It is just a phone holder.
5,Perfect for windshield mount or dash mount
5,Great product. Have used suction cup and clamp. Like attachment for a/c vent. Helps me in my navigation thanks!
5,Used this this weekend and it held up really nicely for my trip. I used the vent part and not the suction part. It staid in place and wasn't to heavy for my vent.
5,I like this mount. It has stayed on the dash no matter what the driving conditions are. The grip is strong and releases with a push of a button. The only thing is I wish the side brackets were a little bigger to hold the phone with a stand on the back of the case.
5,Best on I have ever purchased!  Suction is great! Adjust really well!
5,It’s a great holder but I failed to realize it is not for my iphone8+.  My fault for not checking. It still works so I’ll use it for now until I get another. My phone is a bit large for it but it still holds.
5,Easy installation fits a variety of sizes and the suction is great like "its not going anywhere" great.
5,Easy to understand instructions and flexible installation options. I chose to suction it to my windshield and it is very very stable. Love it so far.
5,I’ve had about 10 different car phone mounts and none have lasted longer than a month. This one is sturdy and will last a long time. It makes me unnecessarily happy lol.
4,Tape on mounting pad gave way on first warm sunny day. So much for all the great reviews. Would not buy again
5,This is the best!Comes with a sticky plate to stick to a not so smooth surface. The suction itself is great. Adjusting the positioning is easy and it locks in place very tight.The phone holder itself is high quality the squeeze to hold and button press release are very smooth
5,Very nice product.  They might want to make it more clear that the sticky gel on the suction cup is not adhesive and the phone holder can be removed without destroying the gel.  I bought one for my wife as well after she saw mine in action.
5,This one is my favorite. It remains fixed in place for months and the arm does not get loose.
5,Easy to install with several options. Easy to use.
5,I really like this phone mount because it holds my card case and is made for bigger phones too! It fit perfectly on my dash and has stayed securely in place ever since I put it on! Really impressed!
5,The suction power on this is super very easy to install took me less then a minute and im in love !!
1,At the bottom of the suction cup they add adhesive. Seemed like a good idea when I first got it but now I can't even get it to stick for more then 15 seconds. This product is a waste of $$ I now use my cupholder to hold my phone over this because my cupholder is more reliable.
5,Everything about this mount is easy - from assembling it to installing it to using it.  I like it so much more that my old one.  I surely recommend this mount.  Buy it and enjoy!
2,It is falling like a London Bridge.
4,Used with an iPhone8 max and iPhone11 pro.  Holds phones securely and easy to remove. I usually plug in phone while it’s in the mount.
5,I have a Nissan Murano and I found with the way the vents are over the gps those clip into the vents did not work. Got this and love it. Highly recommend.
5,Great product
4,The first three days it would not suction/stick to any surface longer than a couple hours.I have however had it suctioned for a solid 6 days now.
3,I like it it does it's job. Sadly the suction isn't too great it falls almost every week or so. Also it heats up a lot and makes it hard to put my phone in it without it over heating my phone even when I have a windshield shade.
5,I can't believe the suction on this thing. One of the best phone holders I ever had. Definitely will recommend this product to friends.
5,Quality product.  Easy to use on windshield or vent clip.  Fits my Galaxy Note 10 Plus well.
5,Works great for my Android. Holds to window strong
1,I read the reviews before I bought this product so I knew it would have trouble sticking to windshields when its in direct sunlight.  However I didn't realize it is essentially designed to ONLY stick to windows.  It needs a completely flat smooth surface so most of the spots where you could use this like a dashboard won't work.  Also the extendable arm will ONLY move in and out you cannot rotate the direction it aims the phone so if you want to be able to readjust your phone to deal with glare you can't.  this is now just a pile of junk that is sitting un-usable in my car.  very disappointingEDIT: after I posted this review I was contacted by the seller who offered a refund. They also asked me repeatedly to delete my negative review. I’m glad I got a refund but am not ok with being asked to delete my honest review simply because it impacts their rating.
4,Good long reachSolid feelHolds in place
5,It wouldn't stick to the dash it fell off after about three days I followed the directions to a T also so I ended up using silicon. I like the style that's about it. After working with the manufacturer they were very understanding and we solved any And all issues they are a great company to work with and solved all issuesRob Winick
5,Love it! Very useful :)
5,I set my phone in this thing and drove for four hours on one of the the bumpiest mountain roads Colorado has to offer. I was  surprised this thing held on. It is still going strong.
5,I was worried this would fall off easily but after two months it's still attached!
5,I bought so many phone mounts in the past. By far the best I’ve owned
5,Product adheres to the surface very well easy to set up and install. I used the car window mount.
5,This holds my phone very well. It’s also very adjustable
5,Easy to put on or take off.  Has never fallen off on its own.
5,It is perfect! Doesn't fall off and unsuction like the other one I had. Easy to use great for in my car!
5,The directions were clear. Easy to install.
5,This is by far the best mount I've ever had. I've tried a lot of different ones and this one keeps my phone the most steady and secure while maintaining the ability to access the charging port.My only regret is I didn't buy it sooner.Thank you for a great product!
5,Havent used the suction mount feature opting instead for the vent mount. This holds my phone securely. Very pleased with this phone holder.
5,Love it! It’s been sitting on my dash now for four days (in the HOT Florida sun) and it’s holding well! Thankfully! I love the button to release the phone from the holder as well. Quick and easy.
5,Perfect solution to hold the phone in the vehicle would recommend to others without hesitation.
5,This is has to be the best mount I've ordered. It does exactly what it's suppose to do. I would have no problems ordering from here again. Great product at a great price.
5,I love this holder.  I've had several different types and this one is by far the best!
5,Stays put even when off roading over harsh  terrain
5,I really like this phone holder. It holds up very well. I will warn you when mounted hanging from the windshield it won't hold in the hot Alabama summer sun if you leave your phone in it! I don't think any holder will. But mounted on the dash it works perfectly. I recommend it and the seller from whom I purchased it!
5,Beat one I have had! Hold my phone perfectly and does not fall. Highly recommend!
5,This was a Christmas present for my sister. It's very nice and everything I was looking for. She loves it. I would order again.
5,Looks like a well built product and exactly what I needed. Multiple options for connecting to my car.
5,Good price good product.
5,Very stable with easy adjustments that allow applications at various locations with ease of use.
5,Best phone mount hands down. So sturdy it’s unreal. Highly recommend. No problems. Holds phone tightly.
5,This is the best phone holder super light and not too bulky.
5,my boyfriend loves it! better than holding the phone in hand while driving..🙃
5,It doesn't stick on my dashboard after 24hours
5,Exactly delivered what was expected. No complaints if you need a strong durable phone holder for your iPhone this is the one.
5,easy to install but the adhesive only lasted about 6 months but I called the customer service and they sent me a brand new car mount
2,Poorly constructed the suction power was not adequate to hold the product
5,works amazing well. I drive a construction truck that has terrible suspention and it holds my phone perfect
5,Excellent product. Suction to dash is solid even without the stick on pad. The extendable arm helps a lot to get to the ideal position. I added a 3D printed spacer to move my LG V40 up 1/8" to allow access to the finger print reader. Spacer of course not needed for all phones but good to know that that modification can help customize it.
5,Connects to my vent very well and I'd quite sturdy. I'll be buying another for my hubby's van.
5,My other jumped around on rough roads and my phone would fall out. This one is solid never jumps.
5,Definitely great to install. Definitely recommend to buy it it holds my phone great.
1,Extremely difficult to try to figure out how to put together
5,Travwled 300 miles with the motorhome i have the bracket suctioned too and adheted with no issues. The security features of holding the movable parts is superb.
4,Item won’t stay mounted.
5,Loved this got the husband can hold phone he always dropping his have to search for it.  Just they thing for him
5,As a truck driver this thing is on God the best thing when it comes to sturdiness and staying on the windshield. Also doesn't shake like crazy when going down the road
4,Versatile easy application strong hold - just what I was looking for.
4,The product is of great quality but I have a 2018 Toyota and it doesn't fit sturdy on the dash or in the air vents.
5,Had this a couple of weeks now. Have it suctioned to the bottom corner of my windshield. It has not moved! It works great for google maps easy to see yet out of my driving line. So far so good.
5,Very durable great product!
1,I had high-hopes for this item; however it did not work for my iPhone.  I kept toppling over when my phone was placed in the holder.  I return this item and would not recommend.
5,Works very well and an added bonus it looks nice as well. Glad I found this product and highly recommend it.
5,Easy to install and it works very well good price
5,I love this product. I’ve tried a bunch of different car mounts for my phone and this one is by far the best. Normally I have difficulty getting the suction to hold when it’s hot but this one has held up really well in these brutal Georgia summers.
5,Suction cup has not come loose once since I’ve owned it. Holds my iPhone 7+ in an otter box case securely. So far I’m pleased with this purchase.
4,Works well just not quite what I thought! I am using the vent clip. Fast delivery good product.
5,I tried so many different kinds of phone holders and this one by far is the best!
5,Perfect for my dashboard..super steady and durable..fits on any kind of phone.
5,Had a slight problem with the 1st unit.  Customer service was fast and excellent.  This product does exactly what it designed to do.  Adjusts to everything you would ever want.
5,Bought 2 of them for my daughters.  Good quality easy to install and suction cup was pretty strong.
5,I’ve had this on about a week now and so far so good. I had to use the disc that comes with it to mount to my dash but I really like having my phone right where I can see it.
4,Horrible. Do not buy this!!!! It did not suction to my dashboard at all. But I was refunded for purchasing this. Great customer service
5,This is a truly great product - I ordered one extra but the family member ordered one too!
5,Great! Very sturdy. Dropped it on my way to the car on concrete and didn’t even scratch.
1,This was great in the beginning but now I have to move it and the suction cup has melted into the glass and is not able to be used again.Look elsewhere because for $30 I wouldn’t expect it
5,Well made vehicle phone mount
5,I love this cell phone holder. I wish I had bought this a long time ago.
3,I was going to try to use the suction cup attachment however for my car the prime placement would have interfered with either sightlines or dash functions. The weight of the item closed the vent without the phone in place and attaching it to the passenger vent put the phone too far away. I suppose it would work for a different car.
2,Bought this in Jan 2021. Worked GREAT…for 5 months until the Georgia sun worked its might and the holder “suction” let go of the window. Have tried unsuccessfully to get it to reattach to the windshield but it won’t stay on for even an hour before peeling off. The silicone (?) still feels gummy but I think the lever just doesn’t pull enough suction to really grip. Guess I’ll be on the hunt for a better device.
5,Great product !
4,Overall a nice mount not perfect for my car (Hyundai Sport) but not bad. I like the extension and turning ability. Overall not bad.
5,Just what I needed
5,Quite possibly THE BEST iPhone holder ever! The clip for use on the air louvre is the tightest and holds my iPhone very securely.
5,Easy to install
5,Love the options and the telescopic option.  Very pleased and sturdy
5,Car mount works great! I use it everyday on my air vents and it holds amazing! Everyone at  VICSEED are super helpful and really nice they answer any question that I have right away would recommend for sure!
5,Because I have a Samsung Note9 with an Otterbox case it is really heavy. I have tried several different car mounts but none were strong enough to hold it. With this mount once I attached the enclosed pad the suction holds really great. Really happy I found this one...
5,Works well easy to use
5,Easy to put together right price and great because has an adjustable fit for your phone.
5,Easy to install great powerful suction
5,Best car mount I've had!
5,We used this on a boat and it never budged no matter how fast we were going or how rough the waters were.
5,Perfect! I am always on the road with work trying to find peoples houses for meetings my phone I  my lap was frankly not safe this has solved all of my concerns made things safer and is the perfect solution!!
5,This mount works perfectly in my car. I have it suctioned to the windshield and it stays put without bouncing all over the place. I have not used the vent attachment or the adhesive pad but they seem durable.
5,I didn't use the suction cup.  I hanged it by the left air vent and works perfectly.
5,I've only had it a day but it seems very sturdy. My S20+ is one of the heaviest phones especially with a case and it didn't move at all. There are places to tighten each of the axes. Good deal!
5,It’s got various ways to mount it. I did the mount to windshield one. Figuring out where I wanted it was the hard part. There’s a release on the side and cushion mounts for the phone. Readily pops out. Just stein holder and squeeze sides to secure. Very easy to use.
5,The product is very Efficient and Flexible!
5,Great item purchased for my work truck. I will order another one for my personal Vehicle
5,Only thing is it is big and in the way of vision for some things but car windshields are so flat & small these days anything would be big there.
5,It’s a solid phone holder the suction is so powerful if you attach it to smooth surface. My dashboard surface was rough (leather) so it didn’t work for me. How ever seller kindly offer me for full refund even without returning the merchand. Thank you.
5,Great product- no issues sticking or staying in place even after putting my rather large phone in it every day for the past 6 months! The mechanism for optimal placement for visibility and utility in my car.
3,The adhesion didn’t work and fell off after a day.
5,I really like the construction of the mount.  What sold me on it was the use of the 3M adhesion pad.  I wanted the mount to stay put.
5,Holds my IPhone X in a case very well even while going over large bumps. The adjustability is great.
5,Just purchased. Very easy installation. Great suction with sturdy connection on dashboard that is not perfectly smooth. Very well constructed. Only time will tell but so far so good.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This is awesome phone mount it has sticker on the package so you can stick on the car anywhere you want don’t have to worry if your car are leather. It’s so easy that you put the phone up there and driving makes the more safety when I drive on the road and don’t have to look down to see the google map.
1,Didn't work and only one time try.  Phone didn't fit
5,This is a well made product. It holds my phone right there in front of me at my desired angle. It holds super steady even on bad roads. Well done!
5,Strong hold great suction and still easy removal. Great extension so I could see and work with my phone. I would buy this one again!!
5,hi y'allThis works to hold the phone at the vent level.Wish the clip was more wedge shaped so could adapt to different vent fins.
5,Good suction has not fallen or shifted. My daughter bought one then I did and recently my niece did. Easy install and durable.
5,I love this phone stand and have had others but it. Sticks great rather warm or cold. Holds phone secure and easy to use. I love it.
5,Easy install easy to use awesome price bought 2 plan on buying more
5,The suction power is great and I love that I can turn my phone horizontal if I want to also!
5,Had for a few months nowUsed adhesive pad on dashboardHolding up great!
5,sticks well to a vertical smooth surface on the dash
5,Handy
4,Works as described.Quality construction.Holds to dash firmly.Holds phone in place with worry.
5,I've had MANY phone mounts this is the first one that's actually effective.
5,Excellent.
5,I absolutely love it! My iPhone XR is heavy with a very durable case. The fact that the mount can support its weight is amazing. I’m also impressed that the stand can do a complete 360.
5,This is a must have great vent holder and sucction cup. Im using the vent holder because it has a screw down holder to the vent. Some don't have that and they fall off. Very nice holder for my note 10 plus.
5,Best car mount I’ve purchased hands down!The mechanism does not get stuck when you release or secure your phone. The length from the base of the mount to where your phone can actually be positioned is amazing! It’s now at the tip of my fingertips. No more leaning over. 10/10
5,Very convenient and easy to install
5,I didn't think it would stick to my dashboard since it isn't very smooth but it sticks great! It swivels and your phone can be viewed in any direction.
5,Love it! I use it for viewing calls while I'm driving and listening to music. And making social media videos.
5,Our state just went to hands free driving. This fits the bill and seems very adaptable. Not sure what else to expect. Some flexibility makes it nice as well.
5,Does the job accordingly
5,These guys are top notch! Great customer service and communication! Superb product! We even bought a second one for our other vehicle. Strongly suggest doing business with them!
5,Inevitably most have the suction cup fail at some point.  It hasn’t been long but it seems to be working well so far...
5,I really like the vent clip.  It's the first one that I've actually used.  I usually attach phone mounts to my dashboard because the vent clips are always too hard to deal with or get stuck in the vent.  This one DOES NOT do that!  :-) I would definitely recommend.
5,Using on my boat and hold force of suction and phone holder are great
5,Absolutely love it . doesn't bounce around has good angles and keeps my phone secure where I want it
5,This phone holder for the car is exactly what I needed. My phone is no longer dropping to the floor. We have it attached to the air vent which works well for us. Glad we purchased it.
5,I can't say anything negative about this product it has held my phone regardless of how bad the roadways have been. The costs vs quality ratio are also excellent it feels sturdy and holds my phone very well.
5,Easy to install
5,I had previously purchased a similar cheaper model from Staples and it only lasted a month.  This one seems much better made.  I used the feature where you attach it to the A/C vent and this has served the purpose very well and I am happy with it.
5,Mounts easily to either the dash windshield and vent; holds the cellphone securely. Customer service was responsive and helpful as well.
2,I thought it was great at first. I'm short and it was perfect for my minivan dashboard because it extends. Then the sun came out warmed up the dashboard and the damn thing falls right off the pad that holds it to the dash. The 2nd one for the vent cant hold the weight the my Galaxy s8 with a case on it and I constantly am looking for my phone on the floor.
5,Just purchased and only used a few days but so far it’s preformed as advertised
5,The only reason I returned it is because it was to big for my window.  it is meant for a SUV or a truck
5,I use this product for my car and it is amazing suction power is great and the adhesion as well. Stays steady on the road.
5,Product arrived and didnt stick to my dashboard properly. I sent an email to VicSeed and Lucy resolved my problem. Another suction was sent and now works great. Thank you and appreciate it very much.
5,I highly recommend this device.  I purchased one from Bestbuy and it broke within a month and the suction stopped working.  This one has a much better suction and I love the vent clip.  The ball in the back makes the device more secure and stays where I want it.
5,Good product I like the vent clip mount the suction mount doesn’t work well on leather but it comes with a sticker pad. Very supportive customer services.
5,A VERY high-quality product!  Very sturdy construction and very easy to mount and use.  Comes with all the components needed to be windshield mounted dash mounted or vent mounted.  And when you push the quick-release button the sides expand automatically so it's truly one-handed operation!
5,Bought two sets one for work and one for personal. Great adjustability securely holds my phone while it is in a heavy case.
5,I reccomend this item good price and excellent quality. Excellent suction power and adhesion. Very safe and easy to install it. Customer service has a very professional representatives.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
5,The kit was extremely useful and easy to use.  The suction was strong enough to support the iPhone with ease and the additional vent adapter will be great for use in other vehicles that we use (if suction is not an option).
5,Really like the ability to extend and move this to where I want so that my phone is easily reachable while navigating. Well made!!
5,Easy instructions erythromycin very sturdy and so far so good in that its sticking very well even in 100 car heat. Been a few weeks but I think its a winner!
5,Great adhesion to my vehicle and very easy to set up. Holds my big phone great (Galaxy Note 9).
5,Loved that it came with two options to hold the phone. The suction option doesn't stay put if you have a big phone. I cleaned the dash and the seal didnt support the phone. Ended up using the vent option which works better.
5,I had problems with the original mount that was sent to me but ViCSEED sent me a replacement right away and it works much better.  I appreciate their excellent customer service.
5,it was special
5,This is exactly what I wanted and I'm so happy with this unit.  I bought another one that didn't work but this is the best!  Great quality.  Highly recommend.  Thank you!
5,Good product
5,After trying out 3 other car phone holders this one is really well made.  It holds tight to my air vents. LOVE IT
5,I bought this for my husband and he loves it.  His car does not have a lot of storage so this works great.
5,Excelente poder de succión y adhesión muy fácil de instalar
5,The best dashboard holder I've ever bought/used. Very durable. I have not used the vent holder yet.
5,I really like the design of this and securely holds my phone in place.
5,Love it very sturdy in my car ! Stays stuck to windshield perfectly
5,Worked perfectly on my dashboard and didn't even need thr circle sticky thing.
5,The phone holder sticks to the 3M disk very well.  The disk however didn't work on my dashboard as there were no flat surfaces.  I used 3M double sided tape to help the disk adapt to the curved surface and the whole assembly has been working perfectly for several months.
5,Holder holds phone very stable with on slight shake will driving
5,Great product everything I thought it would be
4,Suction cup works very well. The clamping jaws could be a little longer they barely hold a Kyocera pro 2
5,I use the clip-onto-vent option. I love that I can just glance over and confirm where I'm going.
5,Update: the company reached out and sent me their newer model. Works great so far.  Broke after a month. Doesn’t hold phones that are in phone cases very well.
5,Love it. Well worth the money!!
5,Good product easy to use and holds my S 21+ easily
5,Best cellphone holder. Easy to install nice adjusting mechanism.
5,Increible ya habia comprado 3 de otras marcas y diseños diferentes o parecidos y nada funcionaba siempre se caían pero este producto es a genial de verdad hace un super trabajo.
5,
5,Super easy to use
5,This product contains two different bases for installation. Very considerate design! You may install the product on the dashboard or near the AC outlet. It also includes a round mat in case the base cannot fixed on the dashboard firmly. The ball connection is easy to switch between two different bases and there is a nut for tightening.
5,Highly recommend  easy to install  made of good quality material.
4,Bought it for my niece she love it Fits right where she likes it.
3,Not as strong as the Vanmass one I just had.  Spend the couple extra dollars on theirs.
5,sticky part works great without having to use the adhesive mount base.  Solid product
5,Very strong and fit good
5,Sturdy and sticks well to dashboard! Love it
5,This product works very well for what I needed it for. It's in my jeep and works great!
5,This is the best phone mount you can get. Very sturdy and great product. Hold the phone very firmly and doesnt move around. Great product again.
5,It didn’t stick at first but after a few try’s it was fine. I’d recommend it.
5,It holds up as discribed but in direct direct sunlight it will weaken the suction and cause it to fail but once it cools it’s back to business as usual
5,This is exactly what I expected to receive based on the descriptions and photos. The suction cup didn’t stick to textured dash (which directions said is likely) so they provide a 3M sticky pad for mounting. I chose to mount to windshield. This piece is so versatile.
5,Excellent product! Easy to use and works extremely well! Seems like a solid built product!
3,It's ok
4,Better then the last one I bought in the store and it cost more.
5,Been through a ton of these and this one finally works for our cars.
5,Inexpensive and does the job. It's my first car mount and happy with the purchase. Considering buying a second for my partner. Of course there's pricey and higher end ones but this does the trick too. Fits my Samsung S10e with an otter box case.
5,Much thicker plastic than my first one with snake arm. Plastic had broken at socket. Happy with quality for sure.
5,Good quality not cheaply made at all! More than great for the price! Fits my new pro max & my boyfriends galaxy a20e:)
5,Un producto muy bueno exelente fuerte.Sos tiene el telefono muy fijo  la estabilidadMe encata. Lo recomiendo  asi selo recomende a migos. Y familia.  Muchas. Gracias.Vicseed
5,Most of the time these things are made cheap but this one holds up and comes with a 1 year warranty
5,I ordered 1 for myself installed it on my dashboard and it works very well! Decided to purchase a 2nd one for my boyfriends truck! Highly recommend!
5,Had it for about a week now. Works great. No complaints
5,Used several mounts and this is the best!! Very sturdy and versatile. Comes with suction plate and additional vent clip to fit any application.
5,Perfect!  Very sturdy…exceeded expectations!
5,Very handy for hands free bluetooth features and GPS on my smartphone. Holds my XL phone in a bulky case.
5,Very good
5,Works great for my needs. I have a Galaxy S10 plus with a Spigen case and it fits my phone perfect. Have had it since August 2019 in my Kia Optima and it has not fallen off yet.
5,I was extremely reluctant to try the vent adaptor. I have a Note 9 in a durable case and it fits and works well. Definitely satisfied since I did a lot of research and was worried it wouldn't hold on to my cell in a case.
3,The base pad had absolutely no stickiness after peeling away the red paper backing. I have not yet tried the suction portion. I will update review once I do.
2,Adhesive for suction cup ended up melting after 1 year mounted to windshield.Suction cup will not hold without adhesive.
5,Wow what a great phone holder I have tried a couple different ones but by far the best one. Sticks in place and it works great in my motorhome.
5,Product works very well on my truck. I’m very happy with this phone holder.
5,Very happy with this car phone mount which is sturdy and has lots of mounting options
5,Flexibility in attachment strength of hold to phone quality!!! All great
5,I upgraded to an iPhone XR and realized that my old car mount wasn’t suitable.  This one is large and holds the hold iPhone in stable way. It was easy to mount and usable right away. It’s helpful to get the air vent grip as well although I doubt I’ll use it
4,I like how I can turn the phone side waysBut it is heavy on my vent
3,When mounted to the dash the phone holder keeps slowly drooping downward when used with iphone 7 plus. I’ve tightened the ball joint to the max but it remains loose enough to reposition without much resistance. Otherwise it’s pretty good.
5,Easy to install and definitely fit my iPhone XS with a bulky case
5,Bigger than expected Very sturdy and quality material. I like it
5,Worked well and supportive
5,The best thing is u can either adjust in air vent or in dashboard. The suction is perfect and can hold in rough way. It's grip is awesome and design is fabulous. I wish I will buy more from this brand shortly.
3,I have an iPhone 11 with a standard case.  It wont fit need to remove the phone from the case when using this in the car.
5,My son purchased this product and was having problems to install it on windshield. It did not work for me either soI used Garmin  Friction (bean) Mount from my old COSTCO GPS.  Works Great!
5,Very well built.  However the suction cup is very hard to remove when vehicle is not in use.  I have not seen a suction cup on anything that sticks like this one.
5,This car holder stays exactly where I put it and does not jiggle around while I'm driving! It did fall off once but that was soon after I put it on and the surface may have been wet. Since then it's stayed with no problems!
5,Highly Recommended!
5,Work great
3,I did not like my original purchase due to suction not holding. However I was contacted by customer service and they replaced the unit and kept in touch to make sure I was happy. New unit works great. Be sure to contact the company if you have any issues they want you happy.
5,Fits all phones rotates adhesion/suction great.
5,It works great. Love it. Only issue I have is the suction is sticky.  Don’t know how difficult it will be to remove. Besides that all is good. Now my husband wants one.
5,I liked it was easy to install suction was good unless u move again.
4,Good
5,Good quality product
5,Product works as advertised.  Being that I have a heavier phone than most Note 10+ with Samsung's rugged case I have to be a bit gentler with placing my phone on the holder because it will tilt out of place.
5,This mount is excellent. Holds my iPhone 11 Pro with Otterbox Commuter case with no problem. Very easy to take phone out with quick release button on the side of the mount. Currently mounted to windshield have not tried vent clip.
5,Price quality and security  best ever..
5,Love it. I do have to take off my case which can be annoying. But other wise it's awesome
5,This is a strong product holds the phone very well.
1,literally wouldn’t stick to my dash and was missing a few parts. Returned the next day
5,The unit securely holds my S10-Note with case pretty well.Only use with suction direct to dash and has held well in cornering and braking.Easy on/off placement and access to charging cord.Would buy again!
5,This item is working quite well compared to the device I had beforehand. Strong grip even during heated nights. I would recommend
5,It 8s so helpful and easy to use and install
5,Quality and price of vicseed phone car mount  are the best. Very easy to use. Great product.
3,The base was too large for where I wanted to place it in my car.The suction cup didn't work so we and to use the adhesive.
5,Best car mount I had for my car
3,All plastic don't twist knobs to tightDid like the quick release holding the cell
5,Put this in my boat and it’s amazing. Never moves and hold my phone perfectly . Buy this
5,Great product I currently use the vent clip but I'm glad I have the ability to switch to suction. Works great!
3,It worked really well until the glue  wear off in only 5 weeks!
5,At first I had got a defective mount but I was reached out to and they offered to send me another mount and it works perfect as expected
5,Well made strong and very functional. Phone is securely mounted in holder. Removing the phone is quick and easy. Very happy with this purchase...
5,Excellent fit
5,Very happy with the VICSEED Car Phone Holder.  Very well made and sturdy.  Was able to place on my dashboard although the surface is not smooth.  Really like the lip on the bottom of the holder which supports the phone. Glad I purchased.
5,Great product sturdy easy to mount nice design!
5,Es fuerte y de buena calidad .
5,I attached my device to the AC vent. State law requires hands free phone use. I find it easier to use the phone while on this device. Recommend it.
5,Finally a phone holder that works
4,Gave this as a gift and haven't heard any comments from recipient
5,This product replaced one that was broke after about 6 months of use. This accommodates the larger iPhone XR that overwhelmed the older device. Installation was easy and device holds the phone well but did have it pop out once so subtracted one star for security.
5,I love this product I'm a truck driver that drive on  bumpy roads. My phone mount stay on firm and  secure. Great product 👌
5,Happy with this purchase. Recommended for sure!
5,I liked the durability of the product. I used it in my car for my phone. It's an awesome product.
5,Like the option to have both air vent or suction mount. packaging and design seem great so far after a little less than a week f use.
5,Hold my phone really well. Easy to install and well constructed.
5,Very easy to install. Absolutely love it.
5,Works great! Buying my second one. I work in construction and go down alot of bumpy roads I have never had it lose suction or my phone fall out.
5,I bought this because my job frequently requires me to travel and I use my phone for GPS. The mount supports a heavy iPhone and also stays in place when going around curves and on winding roads. Very happy overall with my purchase
5,Pretty secure car mount. I like that you can tighten the mount in the position you want. Works a lot better then previous ones I’ve bought.
5,I would recommend this car mount to anyone looking to go hands free.  The mount is easy to assemble and install in the car with 3 options for installation.
5,I but this for every car LOL. I love it
5,So far so good. It works like it should.
5,Very easy to use my mom loves it
3,This was a good unit until about 11 months of usage. The suction cup degraded and does not adhere anymore.
5,Awesome simple and easy! Holds my phone no problem and the quick release is clutch!
5,Quick delivery exactly as described.  Good quality materials and easy to use and put together.  Will recommend to anyone.
5,I like the phone car mount because it’s holds well no movement and you can mount it different ways. I am very happy with this purchase.
5,It is a cell phone holder for my pickup that I've been looking for for a long time this one meets what I require I even bought a second one for my grandson because he liked it so well
5,I have only used the air vent clip. It fits snugly my Hyundai Santa Fe perfectly. Sets just to the right of the steering wheel so that I can view the map on my phone with a glance and keep my focus on the road.
3,This is the second suction/adhesion mount I got (two different brands) that fell off my dash when the weather got too hot. The AC mount works fine but I don't have near the control of my phone that I'd like.
5,I’ve been wanting one of these for a long time and I’m so happy that this works! I didn’t try the mounting one for the dash board part but the vent mount one is just want I wanted!
5,Great Phone Holder very sturdy Wel made product. I will buy again and again 👌
5,Holds phone tight. Finally found a product that works perfect. Love it!
5,Works great has held up on the windshield for 3 months now.
5,Bought for my husbands truck. Then he wanted 2 more for his tractors. Now he wants a few more for the other tractors.
5,So happy with my new Vicseed phone car mount I just received! It's sturdy well made and looks great! It's going to work great in my car to keep my hands free!
5,I started with the vent clip first love it. It works!
5,This product is AMAZINGLY crafted durable and has a great look. It is very sturdy and does EXACTLY what I need it to do!
5,durable love the easy phone release and adjustable
5,Wonderful! Tough grip! Love this product.
5,This is pretty awesome
5,Very easy to put together and it stays put! It is not moving at all like others I’ve tried.
5,I use this when i take my car to the track.  It is easy/flexible enough to adjust right where i need it and stays put under heavy G's!!
4,Buy it.
5,I think it's pretty cool for how much it is
5,It’s work great
5,Might have to work to get it stuck to windshield other than that works great. It also fits my phones case as well.
5,Good for the money . It holds my phone good..
5,Suction cup works great! Perfect spot for seeing GPS.
3,Its just not a strong enough hold for the phone and I have a very light phone its not sturdy enough
5,My iPhone 8 Plus fits but when I turn it I feel like it need more support at the top besides that it’s perfect
5,I have wasted so much money on these types of phone holders. But this one is by FAR THE BEST ONE EVER!!!! I am ordering another one for my husband cuz again wasted money on cheap ones. These are great !!!
5,Love this phone mount! Holds onto the phone great and has the ability to tilt it in different directions so I can see it. Doesn’t bounce around on the road and is big enough for my iPhone 11 max.
5,It was easy to install and set perfect for big phones
5,the item as not fallen off my window since it has been installed.  I have been using it for a month.
5,Love it
5,I love it and it’s still stuck on my dash
5,This suctions great and it is easy to put my phone in place and remove it.  Works perfect!
5,This is literally the most steady car phone mount I have ever used. Highly recommended! At first I was a bit hesitated about the price (I usually like to spend under $10 for these types of things) but this turned out the be a good buy and definitely worth it!
5,Made right came home good condition I am proud of what I got it’s awesome  it’s great and it’s cool
5,Holds my phone well and is very flexible. It is just what I needed
5,I have Tried several car holders and this is the first one I found that works as advertised
5,Highly recommend buying this phone mount! It holds my large S10+ without a problem!!
5,Best one I have had with this florida heat.
5,So the product is really good but the original part dosen't stick on the dashboard. However whats good about them is they add an extra piece for you to attach it to stick better n it worked.
5,It's awesome 2 in 1 Id highly recommend this product☺️
5,It works fine. If you have a larger or heavier phone however it tilts downwards so you can’t really see the gps screen while driving. But otherwise good.
5,Very good quality
1,Loved it until it broke.
5,I have a dash that is not smooth.  This works great.  I do not like the idea of clipping to the air vent. Then it gets in the way of air flow for the air conditioning.  Even worse is when you need the heater.
5,Sticks great to my dash no issues
5,I like this a lot because of how it extends and it holds well cause my last one blocked my view but this one i can have it lower and closer so im not reaching for it
5,They said this this will stick anywhere - boy does it! Awesome to have in my BMW X3!!!
5,I can’t believe how great is this car-phone holder. I have an iPhone X with a heavy case and previous holders will break or move and drop my phone while I was driving. I’m an Uber driver so having a reliable phone holder is a must.I’m so happy with my purchase !!!!
5,I love this. My old one fell off my dash all the time so I wanted to buy a good one. This works wonderfully. It turns 360 degrees also when your phone is in the slots.
5,Awesome!!!!!
5,Works as advertised.  Plan to order different models for my various cars.
5,They deliver was on time and I am enjoying my new car phone mount.
5,Fantastic product I've had others but this is the best!!!
4,Overall I'm happy with the product but the dashboard mount did not hold the phone mount and it didnt stick properly
5,I've been using this phone car mount and very happy with it. It holds the phone very well and stay very stable. So far tried it with iPhone 7 plus iPhone 11 pro max  and Samsung S9 all works great
5,To secure my phone within my car
5,Great product
5,I'm impressed on how well designed is the product.  Love that they even have an instruction manual in different languages.
4,first one didn’t work well.  They immediately replaced it.  The second one works great.  Great customer service
5,Easy to install and use. Well worth the cost
5,The stability of this phone mount is the best I have ever experienced. Once it was set-up I tugged on it a bit and there’s no movement. It has only been a day with this one so far but the suction is much more stable the. Any air vent mount
5,Got this for my dad’s boat. He loves it!
5,It works with all of our different car vent configurations and all the iPhone sizes we have (3) plus for rental cars we can use the window suction or vent. This is a great product!!
5,This is a strong phone holder! It sticks really well on cars and also windows! We drove from Tennessee to Atlanta and it never once fell off for the 4 hour drive. Definitely would recommend everyone to get this!
5,I like that it holds really good
3,Love the mount and the extendable arm but it’s really shaky while driving. As if is not supported enough
5,stays on tight so far
4,Works ok
5,I love them.  Hols phone great
5,Best car phone cradle .... bought 3 more
5,The product is made outstanding and very durable.  The extended arm is a fantastic feature!  I'm super happy with this purchase!
5,Super sturdy and able to fit my Stylo in it with a case. Hasnt budged at all while driving and there's a lot of adjustability to it. Great phone holder!
3,Clamps too short
5,Todo
5,Had an issue with the first version . the company took care of it and sent me something that worked out great!
5,Good price. Strong product. Long arm makes placement of base easier. Easy to take phone in and out quickly.
5,Look no further ... mounting kit solves any mounting challenges ... solid strong no shake construction ... 1st class looks
5,Suction power easy to install
5,Holds my phone .
5,It stays in place even with my heavy phone and it’s case I love it
5,My daughter loved it
5,It works great !
5,Super easy to mount and use!! Love it!!
5,I really love the way it mounted to the dashboard and the way it holds my phone even with the case on.
4,Very easy to install in my dashboard...just not real easy to get phone out if you are in a hurry.
5,Suction so good I thought it was my girlfriend
2,I like the idea of this product and I think it would be great but the suction didn’t last long I had it for maybe three months I have an iPhone 11 and it did not take the weight of my phone after three months
5,Very good quality just as advertised
5,the suction cup works great the adhesive pad not so much.
5,Its perfect mase of great material Strong sturdy doesnt budge a bit perfect suction power! Absolutly love it!
5,Excellent purchase.  No issues good grip. I’d buy it again.
4,works good
5,Works great!
1,Fell off not stick
3,Wish the black adhesive holder were stronger but over all really like
5,This product is definitely top of the line
5,Been using it on the air vent & have had no problems. Holds fine even on bumpy roads. Very easy to use.
5,The most I've spent on a phone mount but the extra bucks were well worth it. I have bought different kinds and this one has been the best one.
5,Great for all phones . Holds without losing grip
5,Feels pretty sturdy. Definitely a step up from the bendy arm holders that end up going to pieces.
5,I love it. It extends so I can have it down that way I can see through my window. It’s holds great. My phone is a plus and it fits it well.  So worth it.
4,It's all good. For the cops to leave you alone.
5,Me gusto lo sencillo que fue montar el equipo y la calidad en el material. Excelente producto.
5,10/10 the best phone holder
5,I had an issue with the suction cup. I was contacted by customer service and was provided with a replacement. Amazing customer service!!! They made sure I was happy with the product and it’s been working well. Highly recommend.
5,Very happy with this phone holder!! Got to use for lil bit and now husband want it for his car. Gotta order me one again. 😊
5,We bought a new car and it was almost ridiculous getting it off the windshield.
5,I like the way it look and how it sits on the dashboard.
5,Great product. Had one small issue and customer service was WONDERFUL!  Very responsive and helpful. Super happy!!!  Suction is super strong.
5,I have the Google Pixel 3 XL and have no problem with this product holding up my phone. I liked it so much I bought two more. It's a great product as described And I will definitely recommend this to other people.
5,Pros: fit my iphone 11 with case. Performed as advertisedCon: my wife did not know it would not turn so she broke the adhesive. Difficult getting it to stay after
5,I use it in my boat.  Good suction but I wish it would hold my phone a little securer.
2,Broke within 2 days
5,Mounted in 1999 Ford F-150 with 230k...daughter can now use iPhone gps safely...
5,I've  had many vent-mounted ones that fell apart easily.  This one has a suction cup that grips the dash-mounted disc so well and does not let go.  Perfect for my iPhone X that has a thick case and card-slot on the back.
5,Very happy with this mount had a different one before this one and I think this one will hold up 10x better and last.Took on road road for 12+ hours and worked flawlessly. Used only the suction on the windshield.
5,👍
5,I'm extremally happy with this purchase.I works great.
5,Love it everyone buy it
5,Easy to install to windscreen very sturdy I like the easy release button on left side. Holds my iPhone 8 Plus which has a pop socket on just holds it in place.
5,Fits in vent for easy viewing of phone. Holds phone securely.
5,I really like this because it comes with many different ways to keep your phone locked down and you can adjust the phone holder to any size phone!
5,Solid and works well.
5,After spending a month on-and-off checking out mobile phone mounts I purchased this one for a Porsche 911 and couldn’t be happier. It’s sturdy enough to hold an iPhone 11 Pro Max.
5,Easy to install and out together.
5,The product works well and my iPhone stays in place.  Protects me against a $500 fine in Indiana.
5,Fantastic product. Just hoping it does not lose it's suction when it is hot.
5,Falls off.Updated 6-9-20 their customer service is awesome! They contacted me and sent me a new one. It works great! Great customer service is a huge plus! Highly recommend!
5,It is super stable easy to install and it does not obstruct my vision while driving.
5,Attached my One Plus 7 Pro to it using the vent clips. No issues.
5,Works just it says!No longer have to hold or hunt down phone.
5,It fits perfect even with a phone case and pop socket.
5,I did not use the suction cup system in the Smart car.  I used the vent holder and it works great!  It is secure and stable even on rough roads.
3,Am not happy with this phone holders. I put it on my dash  but it didn't work  Stick to it I try and try but without  stick.
5,Good product serves me need
5,Quality product.great stick .easy to move around you can feel the quality.ran over bumps does not move.holds great.best part sticks great.this is the best one I bought. Did not need the sticker pad..holds very well in vent also.glass good to .glad I bought.
5,Works perfectly for a mount for my old cellphone security camera on an inside window. Coupled with an app called Alfred Camera.
5,Well made car mount. Easy to use and accommodates older and newer iphone sizes.
5,Exactly what I needed. Stays put on my dashboard.
5,Super secure suction means no more dealing with my phone falling out whenever I drive over a mild bump.  I’ve gotten a few compliments on it from passengers that all wanted to know where I got it. I recommend!
5,Loved the product. Seems really sturdy and to stick well. Just got it today.

5,Easy to install
5,Looks great and feels great!
5,Easy to install and fits my larger phone.
5,Great holder over had 🤩
5,Works great!
5,Been using this for a couple of months hasn't come off the windshield yet.great Holder for my iPhone 11Pro.  in and out of the holder quick I like that.
3,I changed my review and star rating because the vent clip Keeps falling out with phone in it.
2,I have taken long to write the review due to other pressing matters but I wasn't able to use this product for more than 2 days after purchase. Finally trying via air vent reluctantly...No form of suction didn't work: a) trying to use the suction cap with the windshield (cleaned in advance) b) trying to use the suction cap with the base fixed via sticker to the dashboard. I wouldn't purchase this only if used via air vent. Not a great purchase...
5,Does the job. I used the air-vent option.
5,Easy to adjust great for height placement.
5,Great Product Easy Set Up
2,This was one of my worst purchases EVER!!! I got this because I’ve never been a fan of the vent clips and I wanted something to stick to my dash. I cleaned down the surface found a flat spot and stuck the suction down. It fell within seconds. I then used the little disc that was included. It fell within seconds again. Now I have to use the vent clip which still can barely hold up my phone and it continues to fall down on the rotating part. DO NOT BUY. Waste of money.
5,Exactly as described m well made and very quick turn around for the order.
5,Appears to be well built and the warranty is great!!
4,One week in no issues so far
5,great product!  easy to position........works as advertised...easy to follow instructions...sturdy
5,I like the fact that this unit is adjustible. No cons for this product.  So far it's really great!
5,so far so good. nice to be able to move so I can see it
5,Awesome product good price solid mount
5,Nothing to dislike it works great fir me.
5,Works great. Positions my phone high enough without being on the front dash. It also includes optional vent attachment that locks onto vent baffles. Adhesive plate seems to be holding tight. Recommend.
4,Family liked it.
5,Works great built really solid it seems really like the extendable arm great product for the money
5,Very simple and easy to use
5,Great purchase I have used in multiple configurations. Highly recommended.
5,This product works as advertised have attached to the dash in my car and won't come loose even with going over rough roads.
2,I live in Florida so it gets really hot. As soon as the heat of the day kicked in it melted off and never stuck on for more than 5 minutes after that. Really disappointed.
5,Works great
5,Well made and very sturdy. Fit my note 20 ultra with an otter box on!
5,Had about a week and so far so good. Phone doesn’t move and easy to put in and take out
5,Sticks to my dashboard well.  I like that it expands for my wide Note phone then goes back to normal if I use another device.
5,Brilliant and sturdy. Best mount for the air vent. You can tighten the mount to hold firmly. Very easy to release the phone and best of all the a cutout for the charger at the bottom which doubles to all larger phones.
2,Removed and reinstalled numerous times to clean my windshield then one time trying to remove discovered it melted to the glass. Pain in the ass to scrape the residue off....beware!
5,works perfect and delivered on time thank you will buy again!...
5,Love it! Suction power is sturdy & adhesion is reliable..
4,To see the directions when driving to a new place......
5,I am pleasantly surprised by how well this stays where you put it and the numerous ways you can adjust it.  I recommend this for anyone who doesn’t have the ability to link up with your vehicle
3,The suction cup was okay I needed to clean it to get it to work but the company gave me a new one immediately.
5,Perfect
5,Easy to use and install. I just installed today and so far I am very happy with it
5,Super easy to install and with option to place in dash or vent. Good product at great price!
5,Easy to put any where you want to
5,Easy to install strong suction holds phone securely.
5,Stays on my car dashboard and holds my phone instead of the heating fan (which would heat up my phone to a boiling point).
5,It was easy to assemble and install
5,Update on the previous review contacted the company and they had sent me multiple dude in Houston and after applying them where they needed to go have had no issues and work very well would recommend the product since I have 2 ...
5,It hasn’t fallen off yet love it perfect the best one ever yet and I bought many and lost money and broke many hopefully this one sticks around lol

5,Great!
5,Very easy to use and great customer service!
5,Very sturdy. Easy to use. Good quality
5,Love it
5,Great product
1,The suction powr/adhesive was terrible ! It wouldn’t stick on my bumpy dashed board what so ever . In the instructions it did mention for bumpy dash board it may not stick just to wipe it down make sure it’s clean & dry but It didn’t show any stickiness at all ! it does come with another Option to install  and that is your vents. I didn’t want that because it blocks a vent for my heat & warms up my phone super bad so I can only use my heat towards my feet or on windows . Other than that It does hold my phone even with the case on it & it’s easy to rotate the phone around if you need moving it to an angle . Not terrible butNot the best either!
5,The product is multifunctional. I can stick it to the front window insert it in to air vent and also put it below the window. Very stable and it is easy to use by one hand. I strongly recommend it.
5,Bought this for my husband and he loves how adjustable it is. Great hold as well.
5,It works I didn't dislike
5,Works greatHolds my note 10+With a lifeproofNo shaking whilendriving
3,I can put different sizes on it. But the little part that goes on the airport got broke already that’s too soon.
5,The suctioned would not stick to my dash but fits great on my vent. The vender heard my complaint returned my money and sent me another that works for my car.  Great vendor and trustworthy
5,Extremely easy to install and great for me whos a beginner driver that wants to be safe’
5,This is the first product that actually stays on my vent clips.  I bought it to switch over to the suction cup on the windshield but the optional vent clips actually hold tight and I prefer that location.
5,The product was  easy and fast to install!! Suction  power is amazing!!
5,Gave as a gift and she loves it!
5,Holds phone like glue had to move suction was so strong almost couldn't get it off...highly recommended
5,The mount works well and the company provides above and beyond customer service which was much appreciated.
5,Actually like the vent  attachment the best Doesn't fall off!!!!
5,I like the way this product fits on my windshield It's firm and can easily adjust to my viewing experience.
5,Fits the iPhone 11 fine suction works well easy to mount and un-mount the iPhone 11. Works on the dashboard of a 2010 Honda Civic
5,Works great big enough for note 10 plus
4,It shakes even after secured
5,I love it 😀
5,Very handy tool
5,Muy buen producto
5,Looks good hold phone well and has multiple mounting options
5,Works good. Multiple ways and angles to attach. Good deal for money.
5,Product is working great so far.
5,Fast delivery and fits perfectly in my car
5,Really like this product. I only use the clip that holds the phone to the vent. It puts it at just the right angle and in reach of the charger.
5,The mount works good if it’s tightened if any problems the seller will fix your issue for u
5,I absolutely love this product! Had many other products and WITHIN weeks they failed.  This here by far is the best! Great quality and good looking! Highly recommend! Thank you!
5,The quality is actually quite good! You can use it on your windshield air vent or dash board. Easy to setup and secure. Used it all day today with no issues.
5,It was easy to assemble and i am going to use it regularly. Great product
5,Variety of angles available and adjustment provisions are good.  Quality made product.
1,Absolutely terrible. I don't understand why the rating is so high. It ruined the dashboard on my tesla and now I'll have to pay hundreds to repair it. The grip on the phone curls too far and obstructs the screen. What a piece of trash. Also the suction cup has a literal adhesive coating - not a "nonstick coating" like everyone else but a literal adhesive which makes it difficult to remove and leaves residue. If your dashbord is anything besides plastic like mine then it'll be ruined. It's really a piece of crap and it's the top product on amazon's search result. I'm questioning if I should keep using amazon because problems like this keep happening.
5,easy to use and works well
5,Totally worth the buy!
5,works better than 3 other holders i have tried
5,I drive w/Uber and so I'm constantly taking my phone off. I've had this for over 2 months now and haven't had any problems. It stays clipped on till I take it off.
4,It's easy to install
5,Will buy again
5,Nice product
5,Great!
5,Very easy and clear instructions. This car mount is very sturdy and secure. I love the easy release button on the side.
5,Very happy with this purchase as it has adjustable control on what position perfectly works with you especially when driving. Suction is very strong and doesn’t fall off as I have in the past. Highly recommended!!!
5,I really like this item.  It holds my phone securely
5,Super.
5,I love it
4,Great product 👍
5,It hold the phone really good
5,This device holds my phone in place as I drive no complaints
5,Purchased for my Extreme Trail Jeep - It performed amazingly well on the window shield and dash mount systems - however I did not try the vent mount - Bought two more - Get several ... AMAZING !!!!
3,The suction isn't all that good but it holds my phone in very tight.
5,easy to install
5,I am very happy with all the features of this phone holder so much so that I just ordered another one for our other car!

5,Very well made works great!!!
5,It's amazing. It's very sticky no more worry about my phone will fall down while driving. And I can even use this stander to watch TV on the desk. Easy to clean.
5,The vicseed car phone holder met my need.
5,We love these car mounts. I use the air vent attachment and my husband uses the suction cup on the dash. They are both awesome! I would buy them again in a heartbeat
5,Perfect for my iPhone 11 Pro . So many different ways to mount it .
5,Very sturdy product holds my cheap Samsung J3 with a battery phone case in a rough riding suv while wet outside and system vibrating away.
5,I have not tested the suction/adhesive features since I bought this specifically to attach to the heat/air vent. It works great and I am pleased!
5,The car phone holder is easy to install and feels good quality. The delivery is pretty in time. Bought as a gift for family. Would recommend for easy use.
5,Easy to install and easy to use. Excellent product.
4,Infinitely adjustable.
5,Love it
5,What as said
5,Great item
5,So far so good.  Hasn't fallen off as with other products.  Will see how it holds up in the summer heat.
5,I actually really like this. I bought it the go on my dashboard but it would like stick to the dashboard. Instead I attached it to the window and it works perfectly.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Good Quality
5,Have only used the vent installation so far but gave five stars for quality and ease of placement.Very satisfied!!Love having the choice of installing two different ways.
5,Excellent product well made and easy to use
5,I’ve had it for over a month and my windshield has been through multiple temperatures and it’s still sticking tightly. Would recommend.
5,Works perfectly for me
5,I used the phone holder for a long trip to hold my cellular. I like this device
5,Perfect!
5,Great product. Simple and easy to install.
5,It's wonderful item I have tried different mount but never satisfied. Strongly recommend it.
5,Works ok with iPhone 6s Plus. Got a new phone soon after. Too heavy. Use it for my iPod touch now
5,Nothing
5,I love this phone mount. It isn’t like other cheap ones I’ve purchased. The adhesive is strong. Definitely will buy again for my other cars.
5,Love it works good in my truck
5,I love it! It works with my iPhone 11 that has a thick case. Suction power is so good. I definitely recommend this
5,Extra ordinary!!!
5,Multiple options. Easy to install.
5,Was delivered early. When I'm easily except for where the phone once again realize there was a button to push so I almost broke it but I didn't thank goodness. Works well driving around stays word should.
5,Work perfect for me
5,Love this product it exceeded my expectation
5,Great! easy to use it was very easy to install. Holds the phone every tight. Stays how you position it does not move at all.
5,Product works great and I have not had any issues with it falling off my dash.  The adjustment comes in handy when switching from my larger iPhone to my husbands smaller iPhone. I would definitely recommend!
5,Works great. Be sure to follow instructions exactly. Let pad sit for 24 hours So it sticks good. I have it on my dash which is slightly textured and it’s holding like a charm.
5,Easy to install and use. Works great in any vehicle.
5,Great Product
5,My phone is safe and perfectly within view when needed for GPS. It attached securely to my windshield and has a strong lock to hold my phone in place when using as a dash cam or for GPS. I highly recommend this product!
5,Easy to install
5,I have it in the vent at the moment.  Will try the suction to the window at some point. Very pleased with the product
5,Exactly what I was looking for.  Fit perfectly without compromising your dashboard glueing things. Stays strong and holds my phone with case.
5,Extra detail in the mount makes it solid this will last a long time.
2,I bought this mount for recording my races. The mount doesn’t keep the phone stable. The suction cup has some play in it. Next the ring that clamps the ball socket broke on me after about 4 weeks. The product need some more development.
5,Works!
5,Is very nice
5,Perfect
2,You better commit to where you place this. Once you try and move it it will never suction again.It is a sticky suction cups and falls.
5,This phone holder came very quickly and has exceeded my expectations. Well-made and very versatile.
5,Nice product
5,Just installed it but it seems very good. Easy to install and seems very stable.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Poor suction
5,Very good
5,Very nice ! Works perfectly!
5,Bought this for my husband for Christmas. It keeps his phone in place so he can use his navigation. It holds his phone safely and securely.
3,Haven't tried suction as our car doesn't really have a good setup for it.
5,By far the best car mount I purchased finally one that worked. I recommend this one guys perfect.
5,Very nice loved it!!
5,Excellent products
5,Works great
5,Super sturdy
5,It makes driving easier and I can still communicate with plp
5,Very happy with my purchase....It was the right price and does exactly what I need!!
5,Muy buen articulo eficas y cumple con su dever!
5,It has lots of options works great!!
5,I love it
5,Good
2,I purchased this product based off of the good reviews. However after 3 months the suction is no longer strong; rendering this product useless. I have a fairly small phone too Google pixel 3a and 4a. I'm very dissatisfied and I tried to contact the Visceed company which lead to no resolution.
5,excellent product
5,Really good took a 6000 mile trip worked fantastic.
5,Liked it
5,Item as described
5,👍
3,The clip broke in less than a month its cheaply made  save your money
5,Worth the money
5,Just as described
5,Also included air vent clip!
5,LOVE!!!
5,This thing is solid. I put it on my jeep window and it held my note 8 through some rough trails. Used it for about 6 hours of trail riding and it never came lose
5,Strong
5,I’ve only had it for about 2 weeks and my question is just how long will it last?  My previous iPhone holder was very similar but it didn’t last more than 6 months.
5,This phone holder has lots of suction - holding tight BUT not to tight.The arm is moveable in all directions and will move out to fit perfect eye vision.
4,Very nice.
5,Awesome!
5,N/A
5,For my cell phone and I like it
5,Love it
5,Very well made product will get a lot of use
1,Would not stay attached even without phone in it. Returned.
5,Love it! The optional vent clip is life! Please don’t ever stop making these. I thought I would never find a good phone mount until I found you. 5 stars will keep coming back!
5,Very good
3,Don’t use the dashboard protector. It doesn’t work.
5,Great product
5,Excellent
5,actually works
5,Given s a gift. My boyfriend loves it
5,This is a great product. Works well and phone feels secure. Have now used the vent product as the weight of the phone and holder will mess up my cars vents.
5,This is not like the cheaper versions you typically see. I liked the one I bought so much I just purchased two more!!!
2,The mounting pad doesn't stick at all on the dashboard like the instructions stated even after over night application. Otherwise the phone mount holds my phone and has great reach for easy access.  Might return for another that will stick better to my dashboard.The vent clip is too close to the vent and makes my phone hot.
5,Easily viewed and positioned
5,Excelente
5,Great product! Love the extension and the padding for the holder.
4,Ok
5,The holder holds well to my visor. The air vent is to unsteady to hold my phone. I Love it!!
5,Fácil de instalar
1,Because of the design the weight of my phone points the screen down out of vision while I drive. I've tried tightening the joint in question but since it is a ball bearing joint it's designed to be flexible and in this case floppy. I regret not trying it out in time to return. Buyer be warned.
5,Great buy. Very strong and sturdy.
5,The best phone holder..you won't regret it
5,Prompt delivery we are pleased with this product
5,Very good product
5,I liked the product because it was simple to install. And it was also reasonably priced.
5,solid features. versatile orientation - stable and secure -
5,After writing that one of the arms wouldn’t move when I received mine the seller contacted me and refunded my money and also sent me a new one immediately!!  Very impressed!  New one works beautifully!
5,I've had this installed on my dash for a month. I did't even clean the flat plastic surface and it has remained in tact.
5,it's solid unlike others I've tried.  I use the air vent attachment and it tightens down for a great fit.
5,I have the iPhone 11 and it fit perfectly
5,I like the ease of taking it in and off the vents because I drive a different truck every day for work and need to bring my phone with me.
5,Works perfectly in my Explorer holds my phone securely.
4,Really good !
5,Very sturdy! Cool how button releases your phone
5,I love it. It is well-designed and works as advertised.
5,Looks good and functions as described. Used both with the vent clip and mounted on the dash both ways offer enough adjustments to position the phone where needed. The grip is very secure.
2,It worked perfectly for about 24 hours and then the adhesive holding the dash plate in place gave and the whole thing came down mid-drive. It won’t restick I tried removing it from the base and the adhesive on the mount itself won’t stick either. I’d previously had an iOttie car mount and chose this one as a replacement based on the reviews. Big mistake I should have just gotten another iOttie mount and stuck with the brand that had already proven itself.
4,Not bad
5,Muy buena compra. Lo recomiendo.
1,Does not stick to the dash in my daughters Kia sol
5,It is very good quality and very adjustable!
5,Ok
5,Stays mounted very well useful a life saver really
5,it works like its suppose to
5,Easy to install and very sturdy!
5,Very nice product
5,Awesome product! As described sticks well to dashboard with 3m helper!! Must buy!!
5,Works as was indicated and works well!Very happy with product
3,Has to be tightened every other day.Even when it’s tightened the mount is always very loose.
1,Didn't arrive with the vent mount.  Completely useless for what I needed it for.
5,Itás working perfectly untill  now !!
5,Love it. Has the most suction and holding power of any holder I have ever had. Holds my note 10 plus easily and securely.
5,Great item
1,Everything
5,I love this product. I recommend this 100%. It holds the phone steady.  No more falling with bumps from the roads.
5,Works great for my car. I use the vent clip since I don't want the adhesive on my dashboard. Well worth the money.
2,I cannot get it to stick to my dash or suction! The attachment for putting it on the vent is awful! I will be driving and it falls off the vent with my phone! I have tried a million different ways and CANNOT get this thing to work! Up to you if you want to waste your money!
5,I have bought 4 of these this is the best the suction thing works it moves to the perfect position I will be buying one for each of my cars - jeff
5,Very nice for the money! Just as described.
5,This is a quality product. Better than any other mount I’ve tried.
4,Strong. Overall I'd recommend it I just wish the adhesive was better.
2,This thing is a waste of money. The suction cup has no actual suction and if it does it’s not noticeable. The adhesive on the cup is crap as well. I placed it on my dash and window (without my phone in it) and the weight of the shaft was so much that the suction cup came off without me touching it. Please buy something else don’t waste your money.
5,Sturdy and reliable; useful for using Google Maps.
5,Very good phone mount. I really like it.
5,Impressive product - easy to install and use - well made.
5,Best phone mount I have ever had. Its sturdy and very adjustable...
5,Amazing. Works great for my iPhone 11 Pro Max!!
2,The part that can clamp to the vent works really well however the suction cup would fall over and over from the very beginning of me buying it and I kept putting warm to hot water for it to get sticky again per the instructions and it failed over and over. I only kept this item because of the clamp that can be attached to the vent.
5,The girlfriend loves this! She does Lyft and doesn't have a problem like the other ones she's had. It was suppose to be mine
5,Use it in my car to hold cell phone. It's perfect!
5,Buen soporte
5,Will buy again
5,Works perfect!
5,The mount Holds my note10+ in it's case firmly and securely even on rough terrain.
2,Quality and Design of the Cradle itself is very good. However the vent clamps failed after 8 months of use. The foam pads compressed and lost any grab they had.
4,So far so good
5,excellent
5,Love it. Hold great.  Can barely get to the finger scanner on my S9+ but I can so works grear.
5,Happy with product glad that I didn’t have to attach anything to my phone in order for it to hold.
5,Arrived when expected and is an excellent product
5,I bought this product as a gift.  They loved it.  It sticks well and is easy to use
5,Great product now I have 1 for each car!! Highly recommend
5,Good product
5,Buy it...I will buy another one for my wife's car.
5,Had done quite a bit of research to find the right phone holder. Bought this and installed yesterday and we are already in love we bought another for our other car.
5,Haven’t used the suction to the dash or windshield yet. I have used the vent clip & it is amazing. Everything  have been looking for! Great product! Highly recommend & would definitely purchase again!
3,The suction cup is not strong enough. My phone keeps falling off with the stand. Not even lasted a day.
5,Ive been through a lot of phone holders for the car... this is the best! Im buying another for my husbands car too
5,Worth the price and works as it lists in the description.
5,Great addition for my IPhone 11 Max Pro.  First time using a mount I’ve been missing out!  Thanks
4,Great love it!
5,Great product
5,Great product and easy to use!! And it arrived very quickly!! A perfect valentines gift for my hubby!!
5,It doesn’t get tighter enough.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 It’s good.

5,So far I've only used the clip on the vent. I have a 2013 Honda CRV. Works great. Ill try the adhesive option this week and update my review :)
5,Got this for my mom. It works well
5,After 3 different types of mounts this is the one i should have gotten first. Easy to use and place
5,This is the best phone holder I have been used. Because you can adjust your phone in 3 ways. And it is very safe
5,Bought for a gift
5,Great product exactly as described
2,The suction on this thing is awesome!!! I live where the potholes outnumber the people and it's STILL stuck to my dash!!! Ordered another for the passenger side.UPDATE**** HOLDER WON'T KEEP SUCTION AFTER REPEAT CLEANING WON'T HOLD PHONE WITHOUT FALLING OFF DASH
5,Best mount I have ever used. Stays in place easy to put the phone in and take it out. Love it!
3,this was a gift
5,This is the third one I’ve bought. They are perfect and fit in more then one spot in vehicles. The suction is great!!
5,The best mount i ever baught ...Definitely recomend this product... may be price seems a little high but you won't regret buying it..
5,It met my expectations. But no more.
5,I went through a number of phone holders before I found one this one that works.Very well made.
5,Hook

5,I liked this enough i bought another one for another vehicle. it is simple it works well and is at a good price point at the time i bought it.
5,Cost is good great features.
5,Easy set up. Easy to move into countless positions.
5,Cool
5,Works great. Finally found one that’s perfect.
5,I secured it to my dash a few months ago and it has held solid ever since.
1,I had a cheap car mount for my phone I got for like 5 dollars from Marshall’s and figured I would upgrade and get a nicer one since I liked having it so much. Well this was a waste of money. Followed all the directions and the 3m didn’t stick AT ALL and thought maybe it would work with just the suction.. about 5 minutes down the road and it came flying off. Totally unsafe and a WASTE of money. Go get yourself one from Marshall’s and don’t waste your time. Will be returning.
5,Does what my wife needed it to do when she had me order it. Good quality.
5,Super reliable very stable and secure.
2,I bought for my new car but was so excited to try it! I put it in my old car big mistake! Now the adhesive wont stick in my new car. Very disappointing! Stuck good at first unable to reuse after that.
5,Suction power is good. It is little squeaky while moving. It is a good mount.
2,We bought 2 of these when we were moving. One got messed up when we went to switch it from moving truck to car and we had to throw it away.  The other one broke after 2 months using it!Would not reccommend
2,Followed the instructions. Did not stick long. Truly disappointed. Wasted $25.I do not recommend.
5,Love it works perfect!!
5,Love that the suction cup sticks directly on a textured dashboard - per suggestion remove and reattach periodically.
5,its great
5,This is the first one I found that truly holds it place and phone wonderful deal.
5,Product is well made and very adjustable can be mounted on dash windshield or vent
5,Awesome Product!!!
5,Good product
5,This is a SERIOUSLY good car mount
5,I like that it has the button to release the phone secure mounting
5,fits my cell phone great
5,Thanks a bunch!! Quick and speedy shipping and everything looks great! I know my friend will like it! :)
2,It was easy to install. It was used every day for about 1 hour holding an iPhone 12 mini. Suction and adhesion stopped after 8 months. Left a bunch of glue on my windshield. It was a mess to clean off.
5,this holder is amazing. I think the texture of this holder is very good after I take it and it also feels very convenient after a period of time.
5,This is very well built will by another
5,Very easy assembly I like it
5,Great product! Met all my expectations
5,I love it!! Its strong and it hold my phone. Its what i have been looking for. I recoomend this item.
5,Vey well made. Sticks to the window very strong and does not fall off.
5,I like that I can have it mounted on the ac vent. It hold my iPhone 11 Pro just fine.
5,Holds tight solid grasp of my S9+. Very happy with it!
5,Loved it for my sister that I went and bought 3 more
5,Great product simple to install
1,100% the phone holder looks really nice. But the suction legit sucks. I am disappointed in the fact that the suction did not work at all. I bought it for that main reason to use it on my dashboard. I used the little disk provided for the dashboard and It didn’t stick on the dashboard either. I am disappointed that it doesn’t stick to my dashboard and I feel like it was a complete waste of money. I read the reviews and everything. I thought I was well informed. But nope it turned out to be a waste. The air vent holder works fine it’s a bit of a hassle to put on but it’s alright. If you want to use this product for your dashboard **DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!
5,easy installation  Firm and reliable ～I think this is the biggest requirement for the phone holder.This product works best at least in all my cell phone holders.
5,Completely worth the money. Works great. Love the dual mounting. Completely satisfied.
5,Very versatile fits my Galaxy 10+ perfectly.  Have recommended it to two friends and they love it as well.
5,Its really stable and will hold my Note10 perfectly.
5,Quality construction
5,I use mine with the vent mount. It stays secure and adjust to fit any phone. It even has a slot cutout for your charger cord.
5,First time ever buying a phone mount and this one by far exceeded my expectations. A must buy!
5,Suction
5,Very nice
5,Just as described
5,Good quality and holds the phone in place.
5,Succion power.
5,Easy to install and really strong.
5,Amazed on how well it holds up.  I will recommend this product to friends and family.
5,Great buy and is much needed
5,Awesome .and a good price
5,Great product
5,PERFECT FOR CAR — GREAT GRIP. — ROTATES —
5,Very happy with VICSEED universal car phone mount. Very sturdy attractive and versatile. Highly recommend it!
5,It worked great for my Lexus NX200t which has very limited areas for phone mounting. The vent clip worked perfectly and didn’t hide anything from view.
1,I had this mounted to my dashboard for several months. It was very easy to install and I had no issues with it. Then I had to move it slightly to the right. It never stuck again.I ended up using duct tape to try and secure it because it kept falling off the dashboard with my phone while I was driving. The adhesion of the suction cup seems to be a one-and-done type of thing so if you purchase this item be aware that you can't mount it more than once
5,work very well
5,Good
5,Product is good no problems
5,It is perfect for my jeep.  I use it for my samsung phone
5,Great range for dashes that are higher and far away and no room on the face of the dash. Love it!
5,Great price
5,Well made product
5,Great product that holds your phone stable
5,Awesome product! Love my phone holder :)
5,Great everyday use
5,Works well. Makes driving less destractful
5,As advertised. Sturdy can’t beat it for price. Better to put on windshield or dash. Heavier phone on a/c went might be too heavy
5,Really liked the adjustable options on the product. Use in personal vehicle.
5,Works perfect and hold my iPhone pro max with Otto case without a problem . Good customer service .
1,broke my vent clip after having it on for only around a week for light use with my iphone 8. Beware of this product. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR with this device. Suction is middle of the line and so is the adhesion.
5,very durable product
5,I think I finally found the one Inwant after ever
5,I bought this for my wife and she loves it.Works just like it says.
5,Works great.
5,I don't use suction/adhesion. I use the air vent attachment. It works great! Love it!
1,It broke INSTANTLY. It’s was still usable but one of the arms stopped moving immediately after trying to put my phone in it. With a wonky arm the SUPER shallow grips weren’t able to grab my phone at all. This is NOT meant for phones with thick/ sturdy cases AT ALL. My phone has a lifeproof case which proved to be about the max limit for what the car mount could take. When I added a small adhesive wallet to the back of my phone the mount stopped working completely. The arms broke further from me trying to force them closed over my phone. Any time I sped up slowed down or hit a turn my phone would fly off the car mount.
5,Easy to use.
5,Great item!
5,Great
5,Great cell phone mount and now buying another for my son.
5,Fit well on our vertical vents.  Sturdy and will fit pretty much any phone.
5,I finally found one i love. a little bulky but very sturdy and well built for the price
5,Great products it absolutely worth purchasing. Fit my car perfectly. Seller shipped the product fast great communication.
3,Directions are not clear and I had to buy additional parts to make this work.I felt like I was doing surgery!
5,This was very easy to install.
5,Works great.  No problems at all.  It’s secure and easily released.  Would purchase again.
5,If and when this whenever breaks or wears out I will buy another one.
5,Love it easy to install and use.
5,Works for me.  I add the vent clip. Nice to have options.
5,This suctions to my car very well without even needing the sticky pad. I love this.
5,Excelente producto  tamaño perfecto.
5,Me encanto quedo perfecto en mi vehículo.
5,Well made and secure. I love it!
1,It’s to fragile
5,I like this item but it works better with horizontal vents....my thought only.
5,This is the best car phone mount I’ve bought. Stays on the dash and has several swivel options.
5,Easy to assemble  works great for dash
5,Está perfecto y para mi es muy útil
5,Second one purchased. Great quality.
5,Very easy to install
5,Works well
5,This phone holder is perfect. Easy to install and very easy to use.
2,I bought this for my boyfriend and we liked it so much that I got my own. We both loved them until they both broke in the same spot only two weeks after installing them. We unfortunately can only use the vent clip but since they break so easily I will not be getting a new one.
5,Easy to operate and install.
5,Easy installation and secure suction👍🏻
5,So adjustable!  Fits any angle or distance.
5,Loved it
5,Very well designed and holds the phone in place
5,Excellent
5,It seem very strong.
2,I love the design and look of the product however it does not stay on my dashboard.  It is therefore useless.  When I am driving and I have my GPS on I want to see it but it falls off and lands on the floor.
5,Works great one of the best I've purchased.
5,🥰
5,It’s great and easy to use. Love that it has different options
5,Arrived in perfect shape and in time! Use it everyday. Will recommend
5,Trabajar
5,Amazing for the price. Don’t get a really expensive one this one is great
2,I installed on the air vent. No matter how much I tightened the knob it still would come off. Will reinstall using either double stick tape or a coupla dabs of silicone adhesive.
5,El agarre que tiene evita que el teléfono se caiga
2,Unfortunately after one day it stopped sticking to the included dashboard pad. I don't think it can handle the summer heat that the interior of the car  reaches.
5,Don't let negative reviews turn you away this thing is worth the money
5,Love the product use it everyday simple and easy fit to the dashboard.
5,Worked like a charm on my truck window. Easy to install. Strong and durable.
2,This worked great for about a month. Now my phone will not stay in it. Falls out constantly....
3,no matter what I try I cannot mount it to Honda CRV ...tried all kinds of Adhesives
3,I wish it was more wide for people who have credit card holders at the back of their cellphones.
5,Works great. Bought a 2nd for my son. Quality product versatile and definately makes for a safer drive.
1,Wouldn't hold my phone it kept dropping it.  Too late to return it now.
2,Not really a whole lot to say other than I am disappointed by this. I have a phone mount that goes in a cup holder and was hoping to free up the cup holder after buying this one. However it just would not stick to the windshield. I made sure to clean it properly and let it dry before attaching it. However it just kept falling off hours later.
5,Got it on time. Very nice phone holder
5,It's ok
5,Works for me perfectly
5,Happy with the quality so far.
5,What a Great Seller A+ Wonderful Thank You.
5,Simple durable mounts like a stud! Love this phone mount I highly recommend purchasing this!
2,The suction cup does not hold phone in place - I would say it isn’t designed for larger cell phones when you have it extended half or more.
1,Didn’t hold suction to dash and not practical to support the weight of a phone.  Better suited for a desk then a car
1,This does not stay on the dashboard. Falls I don’t like going the hassle of returning things really want to return this because it doesn’t work since it doesn’t stay. It’s fine as long as your phone is not in it which defeatthe purpose.
5,Good solid product
5,I love mine
5,no longer sticks
5,Was very easy to put on dash of car. Love this product.
5,This is a good cell phone holder or use it in the air vent it holds it’s flexible it works
2,Easy to put into place. Does not hold after a day or two no matter how much it is tightened.
5,Love it
5,They’re great and durable
2,Living in Florida temp in car prevents it from sticking to glass or dashboard. My car is 2009 focus and slanted dash makes it difficult also.
1,Product did not stick well to dashboard.  Plastic components poorly made break apart within a week
5,I have had this for several weeks now. The suction has not worn off and it is easy to adjust.
1,Vino incompleto esto no sirve no lo recomiendo 👎
5,Very good quality  several different way to use. Perfect for my car. Recommend.
5,Holds phone at all times...love this
5,Very sturdy and works great in my Ford Edge.
5,Very easy to set up. Suction so far holds in very cold weather.
5,Prop handled well. 5 stars
2,The product does well to extend out BUT the swivel in the end is limited to just about 45 degrees. That limits the versatility of the extension that I was depending on to fit in a crampy dashboard. Returned since it didn't work for me....
5,Excellent piece. Exactly what I wanted/needed. Very satisfied.
3,Nice phone mount with strong hold... just has small phone area so my phone didn't fit in it (iphone xr).. thinking about returning
5,Good suction on dashboard/windshield. Easy to place remove phone.
5,MORE than Fair price for a great little devise.
5,No complaints what so ever. Easy to adjust if needed
5,very good product excellent suction will buy again i have on a iphone 8 plus
5,This product was well worth it!!!
5,Easy to install and durable
5,Works great
5,The most durable and sturdy cell mount I’ve ever used
5,Excellent product
5,Mounted on my skid steer loader front window and doesn't move!
3,This is the second product like this that I purchased and they don’t stay on the car
5,I’d highly recommend.
5,Recomiendo este producto
5,Love this. Worth every penny
5,I clip this item onto the air vent (rather than use suction/adhesion) and it works well
5,Very steady and easy to use.
5,Works great! Very sturdy and able to be moved in different positions.
5,Had issues with first one but company was very rezpinsive and sent me another.
5,Ordered 2.  They work great!
2,Lasted about a month and fell of the dash. Adhesive is terrible and would not stay mounted. Tried to contact manufacturer but website does not work. Do not buy!
2,Suction doesn't stay. Won't hold phone over bumps bc I have it in a (very thin) case so if you have any case at all on your phone this probably won't hold.
5,Surprised by how powerful the suction is. Great price and product!
5,made the right choice for purchasing it
5,Works great!
5,Very nice phone mount works well
5,Works great well worth the money
5,Nice product
5,Works great
5,stuck perfectly easy to adjust buying a second one for the second car
5,Love it it's all it said to be
5,Gave for giftsShipping was fast and it was just as described
5,Works perfectly.
5,Easy to install
5,The 3m sticky thing came undone so no longer able to use the unit on my dashboard
5,Easy to install. Held well.
5,Works as expected
1,Bought this in Oct of 2021 and by April22 it didn’t have enough suction and fell off!!! Useless!
5,First one didn’t work correctly but they rushed out a replacement and it works! Thank u!
5,Nice
5,Excellent product at decent price & sturdy!!  I would buy this product again & again.
5,I bought this for my son for Christmas and he loves it
2,Doesn’t stick well at all!  I placed in my car panel last night and this morning I see it on the car floor... the only useful part now is to place it on the aircon.... for this price and half the product doesn’t work... unbelievable...
3,Not sturdy enough to handle galaxy note 10 plus that has a simple clear acralyc cover.
5,Made out of nice quality material and functions well. Very happy with it
5,Works great! A gift for my son on his long drive!
2,When the arm is fully extended the unit becomes very flimsy and bounces around making it hard to read the phone.  Also there is too much play in the base so that the arm rotates noticeably left and right constantly and there is no way of tightening it down.
5,I use this the the clip on one of my vents.  Works well.  Would recommend.
5,It sticks!! And stays stuck.. Omg I love this phone holder
5,Very easy to install and so far so good. I would buy again!
1,This product was actually really nice! I liked how it had the extended arm on it. The suction was kinda annoying because u can't use it right away the suction haa to sit for 24 hrs before its at its best suction. Also you cannot use this phone holder if u have a popsocket on your phn so that was a deal breaker for me because I have to have my pop socket. Other then that its a nice product just not for me
5,Love and works perfect. I plan on buying a second one soon!
5,This product allows so muchore placement options than standard holders due to its multi-position functions and extension.  Love it
5,It fit my phone which has a wallet case on it.
5,Easy to set up and a very stable platform
5,Perfect for what we need it for!
5,Sturdy & holds phone very well.
5,Hands free driving
5,So far so good. Very sturdy and holds an iPhone X perfectly. No wiggle or looseness
5,I got exactly what I thought I was getting. Works great. I use it to Uber
5,A life saving product at a great price.
5,Received on time it’s solid it does it’s job well.
5,excellent products
5,The Phone holder works great. Happy with the product
5,Nice product
5,Great on the dash so I can see when using my GPS
5,Works great with the iPhone 7 Plus
5,I like the way it stay on never move.
5,Great product would buy again
1,the moment ipulled it out of the box the 'locks' didn't work but that wasn't important because they mostly stayed in place anyways. the major disappointment of this is the adhesion- or the lack of it. the gelpad on the bottom doesn't stick to my dashboard at all. I tried so many different tricks to get it on (including the lighter trick) and it just keeps falling off. absolutely no suction power no adhesion not worth your money
5,the best. little bit expensive but it worths more
5,I had a problem and the customer  service was outstanding  i would recomend then to anyone
5,Very well made & easy to use.
1,I was very much looking to having this product for my iPhone 11.  Sadly the adhesive stopped working within days.  I followed all of the rules clean and dry surface before adding the adhesive to dashboard.  I also waited the 24 hour period to add the mount to the adhesive so that it was as strong as possible.  Unfortunately after a couple days the adhesive back lifted up.  I would have preferred to reach out to their customer service as it says "If for any reason on our product is not satisfying please Let us know to get a prompt and fast solution." but don't see a way in which to do so.
5,Working very good still! I'm always breaking phone holders
5,This is the greatest of those that I what i got
5,This product is so good
5,Perfectgood quality 👍
2,Doesn't fit with a pop socket on the back and the circle thing on the back broke the secondI put the sucker together.
5,Great product
5,Nice product!
5,Nice
5,its perfect
5,Works great. Very sturdy!
5,I like it. Does the job. Great price.
2,I used this for a little bit then the part that sticks broke and will not reconnect so now im forced to use the vent mount which blocks a lot of the air flow in my car.
5,Very versatile! Great price excellent quality!
2,Been using the feauture to connect to AC vent during the summer months. It keeps falling off despite trying several angles clamp tightness and gently adjusting position. Very frustrating. Hoping the suction feature on dashboard works in the cooler months or I'll be shopping again.
5,I love this car mount it sticks very well and adjust very well.
5,Great worth couns
1,Update********** The company contacted me and  offered to replace any defective parts or refund me in full The customer service was fast and friendly. *********  My iPhone plus seems to be too heavy and so the phone rotates and turns upside down when using .. Tried contacting the link for tech support and I get an error message with Chinese writing … I’m just past my return date so my loss.
5,This car phone holder is awesome. Glad I bought. No issues Super stable very useful. Glad I bought two.
5,so far I like the way the product works
5,I drive a truck and this works perfectly for me I will definitely buy another one for my car.
5,Great product!
5,Great
5,Great idea but does not stick very well
5,Great product.
5,Love this product. Use it everyday. Easy instillation!
5,Great product.  Functions perfectly.
5,Easy to use navigation
5,I very much like this  so far working great
5,Better than expected... Highly recommended
5,Very pleased with this phone holder
5,I’ve had a number of phone holders - This one is by far the best!
3,Had a tough time at first for it to stick
5,Excellent product easy to install!!
5,Sturdy works great!
5,Love this. Definitely a great buy
1,The only thing that worked on my car was the AC vent holder and surprisingly its holding up well except for the fact that that vent is constantly tilted down because of the weight. The base didn’t want to adhere to my dashboard even though it’s not that textured and the suction cup that attaches to the base was not sturdy and I didn’t feel safe driving with my phone attached to it. I do like the little button that releases the arms and for now its a fine enough set up. Once summer sets in I might need to purchase something different cause I need all my vents working to combat the 100+ weather.
5,This is great! Bought 2
5,Great Product very comfortable
5,I love this model so far!!!
2,Title says.
5,Gits great on my wife's dashboard. Great product!
5,I have all ready for a couple weeks since i purchase and no problem at all.
1,This product is useless for Boston winters even mild ones where the dashboard is cold. The adhesive isn't enough to stick to the surface and will come out easily. Very disappointed with this purchase.
5,This suction cup car mount works great. It holds my iPhone XR in place. Rock solid.
1,I have a 2017 Kia Sportage and I couldn't get this darn thing to stick to the dashboard.  I currently have the one where you clip it to your vents but I am afraid of breaking my vent.  I have tried so many of these car mounts that I am just ready to put my hands up.  The quality of the product is good it just doesn't stick.
5,So far so good holds my note 10 plus extremely well.
5,Elegant safe and easy to use
2,The metal pad does not stick and the arm is not strong enough to continuously hold a dual screen LG ThinQ v60.
5,Works well.  Have had other phone mounts that just didn't provide the functionality that I needed.
2,Unfortunately it broke as soon as I started using it.poor quality now i have to buy another one.
5,I have a weird dashboard and this fit perfectly on my dash.
3,the product is ok but too big on screen.
5,Great quality at a great price!
5,I travel for work and this has made it so much nicer than even my cars GPS.
5,good and nice
5,Used in son’s car and works very well.
5,Easy to install and easy to use.
5,This product is of good qualityI am happy with it.
2,It was ok to use until the glue on the base dried out. I like in Florida where the sun can be brutal once the base losses its suction ability the gadget becomes useless.
5,Love it! Works perfectly
5,Used it for the first time. Worked great! Stayed in place
2,Suction doesn't really work the small clip that is included works nicely for attaching to the A/C vent but I purchased this to attach to my dash or windshield and this does not do the trick (iPhone X)
2,It Kept falling of. I drive a semi truck and with every bump on the road it would fall.
1,Garbage!!! Period!!
5,Perfect for samsung 10 plus
2,I cleaned my dash just as was recommended and it only lasted two weeks before it fell off. When it was working it was great. I will be contacting the company to see what my options are.
5,Multi usable phone holder. Love it
5,Perfect product
5,It is easy to install and works well
5,Works awesome and looks good! Auctioned just fine and easy to install! Overall 5 stars!
5,Good quality product for my 2020 STI
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Mounting system not working as expected
5,Great product my husband loves it.
2,At first the adhesive and suction was strong but over time (within 2 months)  especially during hot days the adhesive would start pulling off from the base when the phone was mounted.  I ended up buying a different phone mount.
5,Works perfect
5,The release button gets stuck but holds the phone well
5,Easy to use and very sturdy
5,It worked perfectly in my pick up truck
5,Can’t move it after it’s mounted
5,My delivery drivers love this!
5,Works great ease to use and see
5,STURDY and seems to be quality material I'm really happy with this purchase.
5,Love it one that finally does what says
5,At last a mount that works!!!
1,After all the fantastic reviews I bought this and am utterly disappointed. Everything was fine until I set my phone in it causing it to be too top heavy pulling the adhesive up from the dash. Yes I cleaned and dried the dashboard prior to adhering the mount. Yes I adhered it to a flat portion of the dash. Yes I adjusted the arms. I am glad so many people have had good luck with this but it was a waste of money for me and a big disappointment.
5,ALL.  EXSELENTE.
5,Awesome product for the price.
5,Great product very happy with it
5,Finally! A phone holder that works!
5,Great job!
2,The nut to fasten the cell phone holder is weakit cracks
5,It’s a great product
5,Works well. I purchased a second one for my other car.
5,The company has been great with communication and the product is working very well.
1,We tried to use this but the suction cup didn’t stick to my husbands dashboard and it just fell off and stopped working. Not worth the money.
5,👌
5,Its just the perfect one thats all i can say.
5,Easy to use! Makes the hands free law in Georgia a breeze!
5,If your car has a flat place to suction it to this works great.
5,Absolutely great love it
5,Strong mount
5,Very good
2,I want to love this product. But the top part always comes off when I put my phone in it. I wish there was something to hold that part in securely. The bottom part stays beautifully someone tell me how to get the top part from falling off.
5,Phone is hands free calls and easy to access if necessary.
2,I bought this is February and five months later it is already coming off of the dash. My car is mostly kept in a garage and the adhesion that keeps the round disc mounted is already halfway off.
5,Love it!!!!
5,Great product
5,Great thing to have in yourI love it.
5,Good job guys
5,Perfect
1,I installed this on my car and it lasted a about a year and three months.  The “suction cup” is more of an adhesive disc and let go from the windshield. Contacted the company through Amazon for some help but there was never a reply from them.
5,Awesome product & best mount I’ve purchased. Buy it!!!!!
5,I recommend.
5,My son loves it.
5,I was quite surprised it is really a good car mount... very pleased
3,Wouldn't stay on dash...fell right off
5,This is amazing and works wonderfully
5,Really good product
5,Easy to use.
2,I had to return this because it could not support the weight of my phone. I even tried taping it down but it still fell off.
2,I installed it when the temperature was in the 60s and held for awhile until the temps started to rise in the 70s and 80s an then the suction cup and adhesive would not hold anymore!Would not recommend!
2,It holds onto my vent in the car ok and did not fall off for a while but broken after a few months. I hope to find a more sturdy one.
5,Best one I’ve every used.
5,Steady and nice 👍
1,i bought two and both were defective. the adhesive came off with the heat on the first one and the second one just doesn’t work. seller won’t give a refund or let me return this stupid thing. 0/10 would NOT recommend its literally monkey balls
1,I purchased this item back in March and installed it on my car's AC vent.  For all the time I used it my Samsung Galaxy S21 either kept falling off of the cradle or pivoted downward because the ball's socket was too loose.  My phone isn't heavy by any means.
2,It fell apart
5,BEST I'VE USED
1,The clippy thingy used to fasten this to the air vent broke. Looking at it further it isn't well engineering in that area. Pity because the holder itself is nice. The suction cup didn't work as there wasn't a large enough smooth surface and any of my vehicles to allow for that.
5,Es muy fuerte durara mucho
5,Good!
5,Outstanding.
5,Best mount I have purchased.  Very convenient
1,The suction cup doesn't grip on a slightly curved windshield or on a textured dash. It worked great on my vent until it slipped a little. I tried to reinstall it and one of  the gripper fins broke. Now it's in a landfill. Replaced it with the Komoi. I love it. It grips well and costs 1/3 the price. I give it 5⭐s.
5,Good
5,You need to get one of these absolutely perfect.
2,The cell phone holder has nice components and holds the phone super steady however that is a moot point because the suction cup doesn't work. The phone continually falls over. Don't waste your money.
2,This think stinks. The suction cup is useless so I now try to connect it to the ac vents. This lasts about 20 mins and then it collapses to the floor. Piece of junk.
5,Works great for hands free
5,I like that it is easy to install and very versatile
1,I had such high hopes for this product. I cleaned my dashboard and let the adhesive set for over 24 hours per the instructions. It couldn’t handle the weight of my iPhone 13. So disappointing!
1,Will not work on my dash only the windshield
5,It stays in place. Stable.
5,Worked as advertised.
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 hum I feel like we just should've bought another one or just put it onto our dashboard with a sticky side.
5,Great product works very well stick to any slick surface
5,Very good product. Holds phone securely. Well built product.
5,I’m using this on the dashboard and it works great.
5,This works perfectly for me
5,Great item very good suction.
2,Suction lasted less than three months before complete failure. The vent mount seems to work okay.
2,The mount kept falling off my dashboard when driving. Will need to try the air vent mount and see if that works better.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             The plastic nut on the back of the holder for the phone has cracked making it virtually impossible to secure the phone tightly. Maybe you should make a metal nut with plastic threads that may help. Hopefully you can send me another replacement.
5,Needed it for my cardoesn’t block view easy to install
2,The adhesion is very bad. The thing fall off third day I used it
1,The issue about not sticking to a dashboard did not materialize.  However the compression bushing that holds the phone holder in place cracked after only 3 months and now it is a useless piece of plastic.  Never again.  Do NOT recommend
5,Excellent product. Great value.
5,Great product. Sticks really well.
1,We continued to try to get this gadget to stay on the dashboard but was not successful. It would work for a while and then let go. Unfortunately I waited too long to return it and have now passed the date for that. If you purchase this and it doesn't work be aware and don't wait to return it.
1,I was driving and just heard a crack and the nut just cracked!! Not even 3 months of usage and they state is sturdy! What a  Joke!!
5,My husband liked it
1,I like how stable the mount was but the nut that holds it in place was very cheap. I only had this two weeks and when I was switching the position from straight up and down to horizontal the nut split. This is when I was loosening it too.
1,I tried this several times and the suction did not work very long at all.  I then tried with the stick button and it still didn't work. A waste of money.
5,love it
1,This product will NOT adhere to any surface in my car! This product has ABSOLUTELY ZERO suction power. This product is NOT easy to install. You can't install this product because it DOESN'T stick to ANYTHING! Plus if you install this product by clipping it into your AC vent this DOESN'T WORK EITHER! The weight of your phone tips it down. Don't buy this.
5,Works well as promised.
5,Works great!
5,Easy install great quality and stable easy to use
2,The part that attaches to the air vent broke after a couple weeks  cant find out how i can get in touch with the seller
5,Love that you can use this multiple ways.
5,well made
5,Just what I was looking for.
5,Works great
2,Will not stay stuck on dashboard
2,cleaned surface first. suction doesn’t hold well. wouldn’t recommend.
5,Really versatile
5,It’s perfect!
1,I have a Ford F-150 doesn’t suction to the dash and doesn’t fit on the fan terrible purchase
5,Works great as it says in the description
5,Easy to use for work truck and personal vehicle
5,Great product
1,Suction power is great. Just the mounting system is not good. It broke within few days. Returned it and got another mount from another company and its great.
5,I like it a lot.
5,Great product.Great packaging
5,I like it it is really very fit.
5,Fast delivery and good quality product.
5,Easy to use
5,Perfect
5,Great product!
5,Professional driver here great price great product!
1,Unfortunately the product's adhesive surface didnt last long and when I asked for a replacement they just never sent it... after saying they would ship one over. At this point I'm pissed but it is what it is
3,Not recommended
5,None
5,Excellent product.
5,Works perfect!!
5,really stable and easy to mount
1,My 2nd try at this product. Maybe because of the Heat.. it doesn't work. For the first few days..I was happy...then it just fell off and continues to do the same. Wish I could return for my money back.
1,I followed the installation instructions to the letter (clean surface let it sit for 24 hours before using etc) and the unit came off of my dashboard after an hour of smooth driving.  A complete waste of money.
5,Versatile ggood quality as advertised
5,Great
2,The adhesive peeled off within two days. The suction didn’t hold for more than an hour even with no phone in the holder. Completely disappointed.
5,Good feet and carbon
5,works great!
1,There is no “suction power” the suction cup only works by the adhesive on cup. The adhesive doesn’t work either my drive to work is about 45 minutes and 20 minutes in it falls off my windshield. When I come back to my car after leaving it overnight it has fallen off as well. Do not buy this garbage. I would have returned it if I hadn’t tossed the box.
5,Super easy to install and to use.
1,Just leave this in the package for a long time before installing si se I was getting  a new car. Didn’t work for. I don’t really know if it’s because the adhesive it’s not strong enough or my car front it’s not flat overall.
2,Would not fit large phone
5,Awesome customer service! Love my replacement..
5,Thanks
5,Good product.
5,Perfect
5,Works great!!
5,Great for my work van
1,Absolutely terrible. Ball joint is too loose so the phone rattled around when attached to the dash. Suction cup didn’t last long at all. Randomly fell off dash and fell apart in the middle of a drive. Very big distraction.  Overall not worth the money.
5,Think it’s great
5,Great product!
5,Love it. works very well.Highly recommend!
5,It is perfect fit in vents
5,good
2,Stop working after 2 months of use. Wouldn't buy again .
5,Works great
1,The clap that goes into the air vent broke on the first use. It had to be broken when shipped. Just purchased this phone holder like within the last few days and already got issues. I am not sure if there is a flaw in the design or what. I would definitely like a replacement. I am going to say it was just this car holder but not a representation of all. How do I receive a replacement?
5,Awesome
1,Suction did not work. Did everything accordinf to manual and the very first day I put my cellphone on it it fell.
5,Robust holder at a reasonable price
5,Love it
1,The suction power was super weak and barely lasted. One day I get in my car and it's hanging down about to fall. I tried to put it back but the suction was already gone from putting it the first time.
5,Excellent
2,It dont stick at all.
2,Does not hold my phone for long.
1,Looked great paid a big price for it. Took me a while to use it and it lasted about a month. Plastic parts crack when you try to tighten  Broken product!😡
2,Does not stick very well
1,The ball joint broke the back after 30 days.
5,Sturdy good quality product.
1,No matter where I mounted it the weight of the phone would pull the suction cup free. I tried using the dashboard disk and that didn't help either. After a few minutes the unit falls to the floor.
1,It does not work if heat or sunlight hits your dashboard. The thing just melted off of my dashboard.
5,Love
3,Good
2,This seller was not happy with this review so she has harassed me to take it down I did but my sone told me not to let her pressure me to do that. This product was noteworthy the money.
1,This is great until your vehicle gets hot inside and then it doesn't stick or hold anymore and will not hold a heavy phone. Also I now have a round circle indent on my dash that will not come out.
5,No
1,I could not get the suction cup to stay in place on either the flat part of the dashboard or on the window.  The assisting pad with the adhesive side did not work either. The pad's adhesive was either really weak or non-existent.  Also to add to the problems with the suction cup not staying put the holder was the heaviest part of the device which caused an uneven weight dispersion.
2,It won’t stick to anything
1,This did not stay mounted during the extremely hot summer days not to dashboard or the window. After it fell off a few time the adhesive is no longer useful.
1,El adhesivo no es suficiente fuerte  se despega y al poner mi celular se cae 😏 lo compre porque supuestamente el adhesivo era fuerte  y cero que ver  tuve que agregar pegamento para poder usarlo
1,I purchased this product in October . Unfortunately I did not install in my car until this month and passed the return policy.Waste of money I purchased 2 and I gifted the other one ! Please don’t buy this ! This donot stick in my car dashboard!
5,Works good
5,Love it
2,The suction cup didn't hold at all. Ended up having to super glue it to the base otherwise it fell right over. Wouldn't buy again in the future.
5,Muy bueno
5,Very good product
1,Muy mala calidad se rompió el segundo día la de aguantar se partio
1,I installed it with the initial suction and then with the heavy duty sticker and it would not hold up.  I’m trying to return it as I do not want to use it as a clip on my vent system.  Would not recommend this product as it appears it cannot hold the weight of an iPhone.
1,The mount doesn’t expand to fit iPhone 12 Pro Max. Not sure if I received a defective item or what.Nonetheless this mount does NOT fit an iPhone 12 Pro Max!
5,Best product ever
1,Don’t buy this. It stuck to my windshield for about 2 days and now it won’t stick at all. It’s flimsy and cheap. I followed all of the instructions to make it last and it failed. DONT BUY
5,Great product
1,Only lasted two months. Release button freezes up and can’t get phone out of holder. Have to take off car and work on it to get it to release. After having to do this three times I gave up on it. Too late to return it as well. Also keeps falling off the vent slot no matter how tight i make it
5,Holds all sizes
1,Used the vent clip not the suction cup to mount. The vent clip broke today after about 8 months of use. If you want a vent clip phone holder I recommend looking at other options.
5,Muy practico
1,For a few months it worked fine but then the suction cup attached to the base that is placed on the dashboard loses suction power no matter what I do in a few minutes it falls back even without having any phone on it. I do not recommend unless every short time you trash the item and have to buy a new one.
5,Great product
5,Works great
2,Too many pieces for my liking. Had to get another the next day.
5,I like it
5,Excellent
1,I purchased this product a month ago and it only worked well for a few weeks. Followed all directions tried to clean and reapply and it won’t stick!! Too bad!!
1,Mostly everyone these days has a pop socket or phone holder on the back of their phones. The holding clip is too short to hold the phone still... they need to be longer. Very annoying.
1,It didn't work for me it doesn't stick to the dashboard.
2,The clip portion of this does not hold well to my vents.  Even though it is adjustable when I move it from the round ball it comes off.
1,Super disappointed. It doesn’t suction. Like at all. Completely useless. I would return it but it’s too late now. Save your money and buy something else. I don’t know how this thing has so many good reviews?
1,Cellphone holder.
1,I got in my car after installing this on my dashboard and it had fallen off after less than 24 hours and has left a permanent ring sunk into my dashboard? I didn't even get to use it. Absolutely horrible and can't return it now
1,When I attempted to install it it did not adhere to the dashboard well and I could not place it in an area where it would be my field of view.
5,Works Great!!!
1,This product didn't last at all. Even worse it broker 2 days after I could return it.The suction cup can be glued on tight but the plastic lever used to clamp down is made of a cheap plastic that broke and now the mount wobbles while driving. Never buying this brand again.
1,I wouldn’t recommend this cell phone holder to anybody the suction cup keeps falling off my windshield there is no way to totally tighten down the swivel on it so it’s constantly moving when you put your phone in the first one I purchased came broken the second one I don’t know if I can return it or not I’ve tried but I get no answer from the company
2,Loosens a little bit every day and has to be reattached on a weekly basis. Do not recommend if you want something you don’t have to constantly fiddle with.
1,It breaks off and does not stick.  Wash it off and try to stick it back on NOT STICKING AT ALL.WATHANA
2,The adhesive did not stick.
2,Would not stick to my dash even with the adhesive. Once the adhesive was put on there was no way to attach it to my mirror. Didn't last a day.
1,this mount fell off and cracked my phone probably 12 hours after i installed it on my car for doordash. i’ll edit this review if seller reaches out
2,Cleaned the surface and tried without and with the adhesive pad. Neither worked.
1,Would be nice if the suction cup lasted. It won’t stick anymore. And the adhesive is terrible. Wouldn’t recommend if you were planning on using it for awhile. Mine lasted about a week.
1,When I opened the box and took out the unit the round plastic bottom was sticky. There was no protective layer and I thought that was a poor package design.  I placed it in my car and it would not stick.  It keeps tipping over without the phone on it.  I must have received a defective product.
1,this didn’t stick to my car so upset!! the thing that fits in the vents works thankfully so i didn’t waste all of my money but still i wanted it to stick to my car.
1,Cool design over-all but the circular piece that allows you to lock in the angle you need broke. Would not recommend.
5,Good
1,It doesn’t stick to my windshield or my dashboard. Not sure what I’m doing wrong. It stays for a few seconds then just falls off. Sigh... the search for a phone mount continues
1,I’ve had the cell phone holder for about 5 months and I will not stick to my window or dash and it will not hold and iPhone 12
1,The rig was wiggly from the beginning and over time became unstuck from the dash. Lasted less than 2 months. Would not recommend.
1,It didn’t do what I needed it to do
1,Despite following the recommendations from the manufacturer’s instructions this would not adhere to surface and it broke after 4 days of use.
1,It broke in less than a year.
1,very weak I think something happened with this product not recommended
1,I had this for three months when the southern summer sun defeated the adhesion. I wish I would have known that it wouldn’t last.
1,THE WORST. almost got into an accident because it refused to stick to a smooth surface on my car. It kept falling and sliding around.I even tried to clip it to the vent and even that fell.do not buy this- i have an iphone 11 pro. it’s not that heavy.
1,Total waste of money. Suction did not work at all even using the disc. Could not attach to dashboard. Could not use vent clip either.
2,Never stayed on window for more then a hour. Would eventually fall and almost broke my screen because of that. Needs better suction.
1,Works good. Only problem is I live in California and the sun melted the plastic. Very unhappy with the design. Won’t hold the phone anymore with the melted plastic. You would think it wouldn’t melt bring attached to the windshield. Will be contacting the suppler.
5,If you are looking for the best option as a car support... and one that adapts perfectly to your vehicle... without a doubt your best option will be this... or any other product from the vicseed team... they are excellent quality products... their support and firmness is top-notch material Made of plastic it is quite firm and resistant… the suction power is super strong… but what fills me the most when purchasing this product is its incredible work team. You can contact them for any questions they advise you quickly to find the best product that suits your needs or your vehicle or telephone... they respond immediately... in my case I was able to communicate with Miss Alice who is part of the vicseed team and her recommendation effective efficiency and good treatment towards me was first class... Thank you very much to all this team and I hope you have a great experience with this team you are the best…
2,Little disappointed it didn’t work on my truck dashboard
2,Would not STAY PUT!!@
5,I bought this it arrived quickly the directions were clear and it was easy to install. But once I installed it: no adjustment knob. I contacted the company and they were immediately responsive. Imagine my embarrassment when I found the adjustment knob on the dark floor of the car. When I wrote to let them know they were very gracious and told me not to hesitate to reach out again. Meanwhile this little device is a game-changer. It’s so handy holds my iPhone 13 Pro (in its case) and doesn’t block any part of the windshield. I love the quick release. And I feel confident that this company will stand behind their product.
1,Tightening nut cracked  split after month of use. Not even super glue could keep it together
1,The suction cup did hold my iPhone. No matter where I put it. I followed the directions. Very disappointed bc I have tried so many that also did not work
1,Didn’t stay stuck on dash.  It kept coming off as I was driving causing a driving hazard.
1,I have a 2012 Honda CRV.  With this car phone mount I am unable to find a flat surface to use the adhesion and/or Suction power.  I have to use the air vents.  When I ride over the potholes and bumps in Cleveland Ohio the Mount falls from the air vents.
1,The vent attachment works great but would not stick to the dash at all.
1,Definitely not strong or won’tHold my phone on the dash. Definitely not going to super flue it. Save your money!
1,Suction worked well but the holder broke within a month. Wouldn't hold the phone any longer
1,Would not adhere to dashboard.Refund denied past 30 days.
1,The black round surface adhesion did not stick and I left it there for 24 hours as instructed….trash
1,The clip would not hold my phone up.  I wound up having to trash the item.
2,Fell off after a few months
1,Didn’t fit
1,Does not stick to all surfaces. The ring behind the phone hosted broke. It has a hair line crack in it.
2,suction power
1,Adhesive part is useless. It doesn’t stick to the dashboard by anyway. Cleaned the dashboard as instructed but the poor quality of the adhesive part continues to fail!Less than one star
1,Poor quality all around. The adhesive is weak and downs not adhere to the textured dash of my 2018 4Runner. Don’t waste your money on this item.
1,This phone holder is useless and completely worthless. It won't stick to any surface and continues to fall off. VERY annoying!!!
2,Suction doesnt work in hot cars.useless
1,It started falling apart from Day 2. The actual phone holder broke within a few months. Total loss.
1,Does not stick therefore does not work!
5,Got this as an alternative to the mirror version that wouldn’t work with our large rearview mirror. Works perfect and allows us to charge the phone while it’s mounted.
1,I have a note 10+ and no matter how I tighten the ball socket it couldn't hold the phone. I tried it with my iPhone 7 and it was the same result. Windshield got hot and the entire holder fell off
1,I used the air vent mount and it has broken within a month of owning.It fell off yesterday while I was driving and the vent mount part wasn’t closing evenly. I tried taking the thing apart and it fell apart.
1,Despite following the instructions the adhesive still isn’t strong enough to stick to my dash. Throughout the time I had it it sometimes came loose but today is when it wouldn't even stick anymore. I also can't even return it anymore and I'm stuck with it
1,Did not stick. Fell off during the road trip despite following instructions. Very disappointed.
1,Item did not stick and immediately fell off dash. Can’t get onto the customer support website to ask for a refund.
1,Well made and worked fine until hot weather where adhesion disc separated from dashboard. Contacted company for a new adhesion disk but after a runaround (send order number send photo etc.) they just ignored me. Item useless without ability to mount.
2,Will never buy again.
1,It went on easy but it came off after a few weeks. When I tried to put it back on it did not stick.
1,I returned this on July 4th as it doesn't fit my vents. I selected Amazon credit for my refund as I was planning on getting a different type that would fit. It's July 20th and I still haven't received my refund.
1,Adhesive failed after 1 month in summer. Very disappointing.
1,It doesn’t stick falls over everywhere in the car. Please send new one
1,Will not hold over thicker cases. Do jot buy this garbage.
1,I did like the telescoping feature but I did not feel the device held my phone secure enough. It felt like the release mechanism was cheap and would break easily. Returned without using
1,Will not grip to dash only to the window. Not pleased with this product.
1,Not portable.  base glued to a surface (dashboard or glass) and then it hard to remove.
1,It was a complete wast of money! It worked for about a week. Now It will not stay attached to the car in anyway. The whole thing fell off while I was driving. It’s dangerous and presents a big safety issue
1,I do not like this item. It has NO suction power. It keeps falling off my dashboard. It doesn't hold my phone correctly. I am not happy with this product. Is there anyway I can return it for a full refund please?
1,So far it was easiest to attach to vent. As a result I haven't attached to dashboard.
1,Terrible and doesn’t stick to anything for very long. Clip arms are also too shallow for a wallet case.
1,This will eventually peel away from the dashboard.  I would not buy again.
1,Easy to install
1,This only lasted about 3 months before falling off the dashboard and not working. Definitely not worth the $22 dollars. A real piece of crap.
1,The provided sticky pad is not good.
1,The wing nut broke after 3 days was cheap plastic
1,I would not recommend this unit if you are using an iPhone 11. Suction will not hold to windshield. Try several times followed their recommendations. Fell off before I left the garage.
1,This didn’t stay adhered to my dash for even one full day.
1,It’s broken really easy from adjusting  knob
1,Very unhappy of product mount would not hold to dash .  Vent clamp will hold ok.  Would not recommend.
2,Suction didn't last long.
1,This holder will not sit on the dash.  Cleaned dash stuck it on & it fell.  Tried 3 times without phone & fell off all 3 times.  Piece of junk in my option.
1,Money wasted
1,The suction cup does not work properly..it comes off. I would not recommend this product
1,just after 3 months it broke.
1,Fell off after a week. The suction isnt strong
1,I bought it for my car for map quest.
1,Did not stick on dash even when I wet the adhesion
1,No stick whatsoever. It was a waste of money I was so upset
1,Don’t stick to car.
1,It fell apart after only one month
1,Once this thing is mounted in a vehicle that's it.  Don't try to move it to another car.  POS. Would ask for my money back but it's been too long.
1,3M adhesive did not stick at all. Suction fell off after 10 minutes
1,always fail and falls.not a good suction
1,Does not fit iPhone 8 Plus
1,
2,It doesn't work for me
1,Did not like at all. It’s in the garage now. Wasted money. Put it on one afternoon the next morning it was on the dashboard
1,Can someone contact me to give me tips to get this to stick better. It keeps coming off.
1,I didn't like the product from the first use.  It did not stick to any surface including the windshield. I bought a completely different one at Walmart for 5 bucks and it works 100 times better.
1,Did nothing it claimed. This product is totally worthless.Better off using chewing gum.
1,This car mount broke within the first week of me installing it. Cool design but not durable or dependable. Clearly mine was faulty. Don’t know how it has this many good reviews.
1,I wish I could give zero stars  very poor suction  it worked for less than 2 days . Going to the garbage  don’t waste your money get something else .
1,It lasted about a week before the adhesions wore out and it started falling off.
1,Vent clamp broke after one week cheap plastic.
1,This product didn’t work out in my 2020 Toyota CamryI was very disappointed
1,I followed the directions exactly and this phone holder simply would not stay adhered to either my windshield or dash using the provided glass base. It is a waste of money. Trash. Do NOT BUY!!
1,There is absolutely nothing I like about this product.  It will not stick to dash pad will not hold the weight of the clamp let alone clamp plus phone..
1,Did not stick or suction properly waste of money
1,Complicated set up.  Doesn't hold phone properly.
1,Cheap quality product. It wouldnt even jokingly stick to any surface for a second. Had to get additional glue to help keep it in place and now it sticks.
1,The suction/adhesive part leaves a nasty residue and the part that hold the phone broke rather quickly. Disappointing.
1,Product is sturdy but mount itself dosen't stick.
1,Es fácil de instalar pero no se ardiere al carro. Es una lástima.
1,Use another brand
1,Only used 2 weeks and the suction came off my car.  Will not reattach.
1,The product falls very easily. I have it to my son and he said it was a POS. Enough said.
1,This phone holder no hold my phoneAnd no hold as a part in the top of my car
1,the way they make suction is like glue not plastic so if you remove it then you can't reuse it or glue it back to the windshield
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Failed 2 months into the use.

4,It's an excellent phone holder overall. The reason I gave only 1 star for suction power & adhesion of that it's not a suction cup but a glue cup! It does grip exceptionally well but when you try to remove it you'll need a paint scraper or some other sharp flat blade to get under the cup & pry it off.
5,Had the product for 2 years. Loved it! While warranty is 1 year Mary from customer service sent out upgraded replacement free of charge! Highly recommend the product and the company which stands behind its products!!! The best!
4,This phone mount really sucks...to the pad provided and wont let go. Also works very well on the windshield. The vent clamp is limited only by the strength of your vents and their ability to hold weight. The ease of adjustment as well as different ways to adjust make this mount very convenient for whatever your needs...as long as you stay on the road. If you plan on using this off-road make sure your device has a rubber case. The clamps provided will likely not hold a phone otherwise as they are not tight enough nor provide enough material to hold a phone without a case. Personally I would not recommend using the provided pad. The suction of the mount is MUCH stronger than the adhesive so the pad will come off of the dash relatively easy. If you are using this on the roads and either on glass or the vent then I would highly recommend this product. If you are looking for something for some off-road use you may get a trip or two out of this in a bind but there are better options available elsewhere that provide more security and permanence.
5,I have a 2019 Toyota Yaris and needed a phone holder. So I purchased the Vicseed 2021 Upgraded Auto Clamp Cell Phone Holder with Strong Grip Air Vent Mount. It looked to be the right application with my circular air vents. But when I tried to install it the air vent clip just was a little too big to fit in between the fins of my air vent. I worked with Zoe from Vicseed and she patiently tried to help me with the installation by sharing photos of a similar circular air vent and providing me with additional mounting instructions. She assured me that if it still didn’t work that she would continue to find a solution for me. Well unfortunately for me it didn’t work. But Vicseed upheld their promise and promptly sent me a new dash mounted phone holder that works great. The installation was very easy and the phone holder works great! I have an iPhone 11 with a case and it fits just fine. I like that I can easily place the phone in the holder and it automatically locks the phone in place. Releasing the phone is just as easy by squeezing on the two levers with just one hand. This is a really good product and Vicseed’s customer service is excellent! Highly recommended!
5,I got this car mount as a gift and I love it! I use the clip on my air vent (which is angled) and I haven’t had an issue with it falling like some car mount clips do. This one is adjustable in every way! Easy to install. Super sturdy even with bumps in the road. Now I have to get one for mom lol
5,I really like the holder! I have an iPhone X and it fits perfectly and I am able to use it on my 2021 RAV4. The vents in the SUV are designed weirdly and so having a huge phone and holder on it didn’t work for me. I had to use the suction pad included with this holder to ensure the holder stayed in place. The holder itself can be adjusted in many ways which makes it versatile to fit in other places in the car. My recommendation is to ask the company to see if the holder will fit your car’s model—the customer service desk is great.
4,Easy to install
4,Great product
5,Love mine works very well
5,Sticks well to the windshield and fits my phone perfectly. Easy to adjust and easy to install in my Toyota Highlander. The one I had prior fell down frequently was hard to adjust and mount my phone and eventually it broke; this one here isn't going anywhere.
3,Purchased this phone mount on Jan 2020 now the arms to grasp the phone doesn’t close all the way. Was not worth the price but lasted for while.
5,After reading all the reviews.. I decided to go with this product. It’s an awesome product; however after awhile it would not tighten anymore and it would not stay up. I contacted the seller and explained to her what was going on. The seller quickly responded back to me and informed me that she was going to send me another out with no expense to me.  Now how’s that for awesome customer service.  Great product and great customer service.  Who could ask for more. I would definitely recommend this product.
5,I received my new phone mount in June. This phone mount is what I have been waiting for. I have tried many but each one left me trying to get my phone off of the floor of my car. This one has strong suction and with the disc that cones with it - is very hard to even try to remove.In August we had some really hot days and one day in particular I did not crack my window. When I got in the car I realized the sticky tape on the bottom of the plastic disc which the mount was suctioned to had started to melt in the heat and it was hanging off of my dashboard. I contacted Vicseed and customer service was incredible!  They contacted me by messenger after hours to try and help figure out my problem. I received the replacement part within two days!  Not only did I get the replacement part but they sent a brand new mount!  I highly recommend this product and this company. Excellent service!! Five stars!
4,Adhesion against dashboard should be improved. Styling and quality of material is remarkable. Air vent fastener option is very good
5,Helps me travel easier!
5,Love this product because of the versatility of the phone moves. I like the way  the screen protector doesn't scratch.  Give it two thumbs up.  O bubbles on the screen.
5,Worked great for awhile.  Then vent clip started slipping. I contacted customer service and they replaced clip no charge. Excellent service!  All good again.  Lily took good care of issues.  Sent parts quickly!Second vent clip started slipping again about 7-8 months after first replacement sent.  They did redesign the clip and it does appear they have a winner now.  Each side of clip has a single opposing hook to the back of the clip that essentially grabs the back edge of any vent slat on your car and once locked on won't slide off again !Again over the top customer service and same people remembered my first incident s much easier .  Looks like another winner.  Also can't go wrong with their whole care team. Outstanding Help!
5,For the record my review is based solely upon the vent clip attachment. I tried the suction cup and it seemed pretty powerful but I don’t want things stuck on my window or dashboard.I ordered a different model for my car (09 Chrysler 300). It didn’t fit my galaxy s-10. I stated that in my review and Mary (the most awesome customer service rep ever) contacted me. They sent me this model which almost works perfect. It holds a galaxy s-10+ with the beefy otter box on it perfectly. It could even go a bit bigger if need be. The rubberish grips really keep the phone in place. There are no issues using my headphone or charging cord.It would be nice if the vent clips were longer to really grasp onto the back of the fins. It does work perfectly in my wife’s Equinox with the new Note. Maybe I’m just being too picky. I asked Mary if there was a model with longer clips and she said there is. Will try that one. Their customer service is on point!
5,I had originally ordered the smaller version of this phone case. After having it about a week I had gotten an Email from Tommy asking how I was liking the product and if there was anything they could do for me. I let them know that the phone holder was a little small and didn’t quite hold my phone into place so securely and he offered to send me this one to try for free and he would cover the shipping costs! I had this new one in only a couple of days and Tommy has had contact with me the entire time. This has been the best customer service experience I’ve had on amazon and this phone holder is amazing. I only use the vent clip not the stick mount but it is tight and secure!
4,My I phone Xs did not fit well on it. It does not work well when you have a ring holder to the back of your phone. Suction power is strong but the adhesion bottom plate is not as strong (almost came off when I pulled the suction.
5,I first ordered another mount from this seller for my 2015 Equinox that didn't work due to the slat design of the vents being tapered. I asked for a refund but instead they sent me this one and told me to keep the old one.  The product was boxed nicely and packed carefully. You can tell that they definitely took their time to design this product! The dash mount suction cup has excellent adhesion and I love the fact that you can clamp this down for added protection. What is even more amazing is the fact that not only does the phone carrier part rotate but the arm extends and there is even a vertical adjustment. Their customer service is outstanding and so is their product! I highly recommend the company and their products!
5,I really love this product! I've used and seen other phone holders and none compare to this one. I never have to worry about my thicccc phone falling out of the holder when I hit big bumps even. My phone is an iPhone XR and it has an otterbox case on it and two credit cards on the back of it and guess what... it fits wonderfully without any finagling needed. Easy setup too.
5,I bought many car mounts in the past that just didn't last as long as I would've wanted them to. This car mount I've had for quite a while and it's a very well put together mount. The suction cup grips very nicely. The sides of the mount hug the phone with enough space leftover even as big as my phone case is. The arm has some nice length to be able to clear the dashboard nicely although this depends how deep you install the mount on the dashboard  but it does have quite some length. I've found that this mount does not wobble like other mounts Ive had. It is very steady. I'd recommend this mount!
5,This phone mount has been a life changer for me. I knew I needed some type of phone mount in my car but didn't know how to make it work with my vehicle until I found this. I did have it fall off my dashboard after about 1 year of use. The sticky gel pad that sticks to the dashboard was no longer sticky probably after long hours in the Texas sun. I contacted the company through their website and they sent me 2 new dashboard discs. I highly recommend this product.
5,Fantastic product with outstanding customer service! The suction on this phone mount is the best I have had. This product has many options for me to choose from. I have a Jeep that has a very narrow dash and able to use all of the available features. The extended arm and movement of the phone holder allows me to position my phone exactly the way I want it. I registered the product and the personal customer service/connection and extended warranty is why shopping with small business is highly recommended.  Without reservation I highly recommend this product!
5,Very easy to install and very versatile for fulfilling many needs.
5,Was able to install just to the right of my dash in my Honda Fit. Sticks very well and puts my phone in a great position for navigation.
5,I was skeptical about purchasing this after having wasted money on other products.  It has been fantastic.  It doesn't move/wobble no matter the road surface.  Recommended it to several friends who are also satisfied
5,A vicseed rep reached out immediately after my initial complaint for a minor issue and resolved it immediately. Like I originally mentioned this is a really nice car phone mount and is ergonomically satisfying. I had one small error with the disc plate and was offered new disc plates or a new phone mount of my choice. I did not expect this level of customer service and can’t thank you enough for being so sincere and resolving my issue.
5,So easy to use and made with great quality durable materials. Bought this as a gift for someone else and it works so well that I'll be buying another one for my car. I also love that you can choose whether you want to use the suction cup or dashboard mount. I would highly recommend this holder and it is a steal at this price point!
1,Came off after one month and peeled part of my dash with it.
5,Got this as a replacement to another one that wasn't working for my car. This one works well. Like that you can extend it so that the phone is closer to you and the various up/down angles. Happy with it.
5,I have been using this product for about a month now and I really dig it! I haven't used the suction feature of the product but instead have been attaching it to one of the vents for my AC. It's really sturdy and holds my phone up very nicely.
5,The new product features makes the car phone holder great.. The suction cap plus the adhesion helps to keep the car phone in place even in a rough trail. This product makes my phone calls easier. Safe driving is my top priority and it is a violation to use or have phone calls while driving but in a real world we can’t avoid to receive or make phones calls having a good quality car phone holder makes a big difference. You can receive and makes phone calls without holding your phone. And the price is affordable.
5,You need to get this phone mount. Absolutely loved it! Seriously stays firm the whole time and just with a click of a button the arms open by itself so you don’t have to hassle in opening it yourself
5,This is a great car mount very solid
5,Product is sturdy and adjust well to fit my phone securely all for a great price.
5,I use this on my air vent and it is perfectly positioned in my Nissan murano.
5,Holds even my bulky phone and case. Responsive customer service.
5,My first phone mount didn’t last long before it was dragging on my dash and tipping my phone out. VICSEED sent me an upgraded version and this is 100% better than the first. They did not disappoint and their customer service is beyond what I ever could have expected. Great service great product total win! I’ll definitely be ordering these again for the other vehicles at my home.
5,This product fits my iPhone 11 max pro perfectly. I had a great experience with the seller helping me with the product. I highly recommend this great product from this amazing seller based on my outstanding experience.
5,I recommend it!
3,I really liked this for the time it worked. The adhesive is coming lose in the back. I have the arm extended and I guess the weight of the phone is too much pressure??
5,I love the suction and security of this mount it holds my Note 10 plus PERFECTLY!
5,We had issues finding an air vent holder that would hold my husband's Note 10+.  They helped me find the right one and fix the issue I was having after ordering one that didn't fit his phone.  The stand seems sturdy - no complaints from the hubby!  Better yet it fits!
5,Is good product I like it is very helpful when I’m driving
5,Just works great! Just what I was looking for for my F150
5,I use the vent holder and love it. Have a Galaxy S9 and it fits great with alot of extra room adjustable and easily releases with the push of a button (favorite part). Buying another one for the 2nd vehicle so I dont have to move back n forth.
5,My first order ended up with a chip and after contacting Vicseed they sent me a brand new one. Their customer service is great and have referred my friends to buy their product. The new car mount fits perfect with my iphone 10 Max
5,Just installed it so not sure yet as to functionbut it seems very sturdy and high quality.  I really like the features. DEB G
5,It is as described
5,I used this one with the clip and it is working well. Good quality product and they have great customer service. Highly recommend!
1,This product is impossible to tighten enough for it to stay without harming the plastic and causing the entire mount to come loose. This product had to be tightened very tight to stay then begun to slowly break and eventually fell right off my vent as I was driving.
5,Just like described and even better! Holds on to the car dashboard well
5,the product was excellent very durable it give you a choice either mount it on the dashboard on the window or mount it on air vent . whatever you did it is awesome.
5,Very nice phone holder....made well....works well with thick and thin phones....five stars *****
5,Very solid and sturdy product. It cane with several metal plates for use on various phones/cases.
5,Will I’ll be honest I had a hard time with other products but Lily helped me find the perfect one.  I love it. Works great.
2,I wouldn’t buy again. Suction and adhesion great however it won’t keep phone upright.
5,this car mount is awesome ! very sturdy . 10/10 would recommend
5,This car mount fis my iPhone 8 Plus and easy to install.
5,I have it for a while already. So far so good.
5,Was sent out a new mount works as described.Awesome product.
5,Good quality!
1,I just got this but the back holder mount broke already and I can’t get a replacement parts.  I can’t see anything here in Amazon.  This mounting device quality is not that good.
1,Suction power and adhesion were non-existent after two months. Pixel 4A is a small phone. This Vicseed holder couldn’t hold this phone. Cannot recommend it.
1,Gave this to my girlfriend because I didn’t want her fiddling with her phone while driving. Less than a month the mount fell off window as the adhesive didn’t stay.  Not sure if it was the hot summer heat causing the adhesive to fail but I’d expect it to last more than a month. Unfortunately I missed the return window by a week and can’t return it.
1,This is a totally useless product.  It does not stick to the dashboard.  The weight of the phone makes it tip over.  Can not find a way to return it either.  Very frustrating!  Don't buy this product save your money!
2,It is not able to suck on leader. The phone fell off when I have a big turn.
2,Spring probably too cheap.
1,Well i bought 2 but the cell is too heavy and it keeps falling so i still have the other one new we try it on my daughter's car and it didn't stay ☹
1,I ordered this item in summer and it worked fine attached to lower windshield above dash temporarily.When the first cold day in October it lost its hold and never would "suck up" to any surface again. Had to throw it and my money away. Very disappointed and no warranty coverage. So unless you live where there is no temp variance greater than 40 degrees...well you make the choice.
1,Terrible not enough suction or length for 06 grand prix
1,I tried both the stick and the vent holder.. both couldnt hold my iphone 11 with a clear case that isnt heavy at all.
1,The media could not be loaded.
5,I have 3 of these.They do not shakeor move when attached. I have one where i needed to use metal plate and it is locked down to the dash.Then I have 2 in my Ram 2500 HD Mega cab 4x4 one for me and one for my wife when where on the road.I love these .I have had 8 different kinds dash clips or mounts they all broke or lose strength over time.If you want a mount that will last this is the ONE!!!
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Yeah uh how exactly is this supposed to be handy when the ball joint phone holder part can't be tightened? The phone holder is constantly either hanging downwards or flopping all over the place. Not sure how yall could have possibly thought that was a good design choice especially when we are at a time when phones are heavy.
5,I should start by saying I only used the air vent holder my car setup wouldn't work with the suction cup part. The holder is great the air vent clamp is super strong stronger than others I've used. Biggest thing I want to share is how great the customer service is on this product. The plastic bolt cracked that holds the vent phone holder steady after a couple months of use. Not sure if I tightened it too hard or what. I contacted the seller Vicseed they responded immediately and sent me two new bolts in one day. They paid for the shipping and checked in to see that I was happy. Not many sellers on Amazon respond let alone respond right away and are very nice and helpful. Definitely would recommend.
1,So far the product is sticking to the dash however I'd like to see how it holds up in a few months.  I like that it's very adjustable and I like the way the clamps on the side expand and adjust.  Definitely easier than trying to find my phone in the center console.7/1/20Update:  I needed to move the mount on the dash to allow a compartment to open and unfortunately the rubber on the item no longer sticks.  It looks like it should still suction and feels sticky but now it constantly falls off the dash with or without the phone on it unless I constantly push down on the adhesive part of the stand.  If this would've had the ability to stick after re-adjustment I'd still really like it.  Now it seems like a waste since it won't stay put so it's basically useless.  So I would NOT recommend ever moving it once it's placed.
5,I've been a windshield mount user for years now but with my 2000 F350 I value overall visibility to phone mounting so I decided to give the vent mount a go.  First impressions were that it was a LOT lower profile than any other vent mount I have tried and that it is WAY more secure too as it has clamping jaws as opposed to spring loaded sliding clips.  I have a Note 20 Ultra with a case on it and there is PLENTY of room for the phone and once it's in it doesn't move and I don't feel like it will lose grip and let the phone fall out at all.  Even the customer service is top notch as the clip had broken after about a month of installing it and with a couple messages back and forth and pictures of what failed (looked like the spring holder) there is a new vent clip on the way.  I get it sometimes unforeseen things happen with products and if it wasn't for the customer service experience I had with Cindy I'm sure this could have gone a lot more different than it is now.  BUT if you're on the fence about vent clips or even the suction mount both of them are great quality and the vent clip is the lowest profile most secure easiest attaching clip that I have ever used.  If the time comes and I decide to swap out the suction mounts in my other vehicles I will be buying more of these mounts without hesitation.  If you've made it this far stop reading and just buy one already you will not be disappointed!!!
5,Works great with any size phone and stays in place even under rough road conditions definitely recommend
5,The VICSEED universal mobile phone holder is a great product but what's even better is that the service is thoughtful and thoughtful. The seller is willing to help us solve our problems in every possible way. This is a great experience. Thank you
5,Honestly wasn’t expecting much cause every one I’ve ever bought never worked right but this one sticks great to the windshield. My truck doesn’t have a flat spot on the dash so I knew that wouldn’t work for me from reading reviews but if I had to buy another one for whatever reason I would definitely buy this one again
5,This mounting set is excellent. It comes with all the types of adapters you need. I personally used the vent adapter and my experience using it has been amazing for my commute and for long drives. I didn't need to read the instructions because It was so easy to install and adjust it. It stays firmly in place on the vent and the phone is secure as well. I really like the quick release button on the side when I'm ready to get out of my car. Very satisfied with this purchase.
5,This is a really great holder for a cell phone in all the ways it needs to be it was easy to put together and sticks really well to the dashboard very easy to adjust and remove the phone. The only problem I have and unfortunately it’s a big one is that my phone overheats in it. As a delivery driver I need to have a several gps apps running at once and the phone warms up from a combination of the sun and it needing to be constantly plugged in. I originally had a small vent holder and I got this to be able to keep the vent clear for AC but the backing seems to soak in the heat from the sun as well as from the phone which is causing the phone to overheat and slow down. Otherwise I love everything else about it. Just wish there was a way to keep the phone cool.7/1 I need to update my review. I got a new phone now and the overheating problem has lessened greatly. I attached the mount a second time and was surprised to see that after the second attachment it still sticks good to the dashboard. The sellers contacted me be email to replace it with a different mount with no cost which I really appreciate. I think I will keep the original as it seems to be working good now with the new phone and it is easy to detach and reattach the phone. The thick black backing which heats with the sun also allows me to better access my phone while on deliveries. It seems as long as you have a newer phone the overheating becomes less of an issue. I also really appreciate the customer service.
5,let me tell you guys about the seller. He/she is giving amazing customer service. i order this product for my jeep wrangler 2015 but unfortunatliy it didnt fit my jeep vent i return this stuff and the seller reach up to me and told me we will fix this . so he send me the other similar product but its for cup holder stand for the phone and guys that fit perfect and im soooooo happy with this product .......... i wish i can give 10 star thank you soooooo much
1,I bought this twice. The first order was great. I bought a second one and it is missing parts! I cannot contact the seller. The support website doesn’t work. Hoping for a response and then I will change my review accordingly.
5,Very happy with the product great quality strong suction power and so easy to install. Outstanding cellphone holder 10/10.
5,You should know where to put it because it’s really strong and hard to move around. I use it many times for making videos at the car. I have a big camera so I need a steady and strong stuff to hold my iPhone pro max 12.
5,Very stable and adjustable product which is made up of sturdy material. Well build and packed. Realiable and trustworthy to hold your all day smart friend...Smartphone.
5,No negatives so far! My car has a steeply slopped windshield and sits far ahead of the driver so a mount with an extending arm and powerful suction is a must and this delivers in both respects. The suction cup is tacky and holds firm while the extending arm provides solid stability with no noticeable shake while driving.The bonus was when we made good use of the included vent clip. I rented a car for a few days and didn't want to remove the VERY grippy suction cup from the daily driver. I tried the vent clamp and easily swapped over the mount "head" that holds the phone so the suction cup could remain in the original car. The vent clamp also turned out to be a VERY impressive accessory because it doesn't just slot into the vent or operate on a loose hinge clamp like some cheap vent mounts do. This particular clamp hand-screws open or shut so you can place the clamp where you need it and then tighten it down until it's clamped on tight. Once it's tight it's not coming off until you unscrew it so no chance of losing your phone over a bump.
5,The product has incredible suction power on my car window. Because of the type of car I have the adhesion didn’t work for me. My car interior has a rough texture on the dashboard so that didn’t work. But I’d really like to say that the customer service for the seller was impeccable. They reached out to me to see if the product worked well and when I informed them about the adhesive stickers not working they searched to see what type of vehicle I had so that they could fix the problem. They realized the surface of my dashboard was rough so they did refund me a partial amount because that part didn’t work for me. They were extremely informative and helpful by providing tips on how to secure the mount and I thought that was just great. I would definitely recommend this product because even though the adhesive part didn’t work for me the suction is amazing and won’t come off the window at all. Oh and lastly I love how the mount extends and twists if you need it to be further forward or in a different direction.
5,Works great
5,I know when you buy a phone mount that it's really finding the right one to fit your car. I drive a 2013 Hyundai Veloster and have a Samsung Galaxy S10e with an Otterbox Commuter case and a PopSocket and this has been the only one to work! I had previously bought 3 other ones and they all either lost adhesion or just did not work with my car. I also really like this one because it came with a car vent phone holder that also works great and several adhesion options. This brand really took the effort to make sure you have everything you need to efficiently use this product. I definitely recommend this product 👌🏻
5,Very nice.  Sturdy easy to use.  Excellent purchase.
1,A friend of mine recommended this holder for my teenage daughter’s car. It worked well for about a month before it lost its suction power. My daughter never moved around in her car we mounted it and left it in the same spot. It cannot hold the weight of a cell phone without falling shortly after you start driving. When this became a serious issue we try to move it to a different spot but the suction just does not work. This thing is useless so into the trash it goes.
5,I recently bought a newer car and with that I lost the previous magnetic cell phone holder that was in the other car. This holder comes with a smooth plate that attaches with adhesive to the dash if needed however I did not! The suction part has an adhesive also that’s not as damaging to the car if it needs to be moved and this works perfectly in the flat area above the screen in my 2017 Subaru Impreza!!
5,No problems after 1 year of use.
5,I have tried other car mounts and they have never been able to hold my phone securely while I am driving long distances or on bumpy terrain but this one does and it does it so well! I usually never leave reviews but I really have to say this mount is worth the money and it works on my textured dashboard! The product itself is very well made and sturdy! I have been recommending it to anyone who is looking for a good high quality car mount!
5,To start this off I am not going to throw shade towards this company just giving my opinion. When I first bought this product I loved it. It was a budget friendly option as well as came with multiple ways to mount that was good. Vent clip and suction. Anyhow when I tried mounting the suction cut part it seemed to not work as well as I would hope and it might be because I’m rocking the 13 pro max which is a heavy-ish phone. But whenever I would leave my parking spot after mounting it it would just pop off from the top and fall off. That’s is the main problem that I have had with this product. The vent clip one works well for me at least so no comment on that.*edit to present day 01/20/22 they were super helpful on assisting me on making sure we fixed what was wrong with my experience and assisted me on making a better selection. Thanks you very much Maylene from VICSEED for the help*
5,This is a great phone holder.  I drive a Ford Fusion and I didn't even have to use the adhesive pad the suction cup alone holds it in place.  I use Waze every day to and from work so this keeps my phone close to eye level and I don't notice any vibration or shaking when driving down the highway.  If you are looking for a phone holder for your car I think you will be happy with this one.
5,This car mount is AWESOME. It took me 5 minutes to set it up in my car including opening the box. So easy!!It is very very easy to adjust and it keeps its position well. With other car mounts I always had a problem of them drooping/slipping and not holding the positions I put them in. I was constantly having to readjust them. Not this one it really stays put.The suction is very secure. All of the adjustable features are great. No matter where you mount it you'll be able to adjust it perfectly to your satisfaction.I easily mounted it on my dashboard. It holds my phone iPhone 11 in a folio holder with no problem. The release button makes opening the arms to release the phone super easy.I am 100% satisfied with this car mount for my cell phone. Do I recommend it for purchase? Yes!
4,Really nicely made and functionable didn't use the vent clip only complaint was it will not stay on my dash. Fell off twice got dirt all over the sticky part luckily it washed off well with just water and is sticky again. Ended up having to use my window seems to be staying there. Not really much for suction just sticky.
5,I've had this product for a few weeks now. I wanted to wait and see if it worked/didn't work. I am amazed!! I love the extension arm that allowed me to place it right at arms reach. And the suction cup is unbelievable. I didn't have to use the optional dashboard pad. I did however clean the spot where I placed it with alcohol to make sure it would grab and it has held with no problem!! I love having my phone right where I can see it and not take my eyes off the road for too long. Driving over bumps and such was no problem for this phone holder. My Iphone 11 with a case is held securely.  The pamphlet states that if it's used frequently in high temperature the suction force will not stick as firm. I've been placing a small white cloth over it since the hot Florida sun hits it and I'm not about to remove it and attach it every day. So far so good. Haven't tried the vent clip as having it on the dashboard was how I intended to use it. It's being used on a 2014 Kia Sorento which has in the middle of the dashboard a pretty smooth and flat surface that it's attached to.
5,The suction power is great. The adhesive unfortunately did not work on my dash even though I foowed proper cleaning instructions. I like that that at least I have the vent clip option as well as the windshield option.
5,I like this car mount. It is versatile and serves all of my various needs. It comfortably seats my large phone. Vertical. Horizontal. Side. Tilted. Mounted on A/C Vent or Windshield.Also I had the pleasure working with Rep. Jenny Customer Service w/Vicseed on acquiring a part. She was prompt with attention to detail and provided excellent customer service.  I plan to purchase additional products from Vicseed because of customer service alone.
5,I liked it a lot. However I am just using the pinch to adapt in the air ventilation. The other portion that arm is not too long and my car is a large Van so didn’t really work out. That’s the o my think I was not happy about.The instructions are clear and easy to follow the holder is super comfortable and I love how it actually Grip the phone.
5,I've had this product for 3 months now and have driven over 6000 miles. This product is flexible durable and easy to use. I would highly recommend this to anyone needing to take long trips with GPS and for those who are techsavy and use their phone as a dashcam the back part is supportive but low enough for you to get full view of the area in front of your vhicle.
5,Kudos to the designer
1,Would not stick on windshield. Upon reading that mount to dashboard using disc included may damage surface I boxed it up and returned. Unwilling to take risk.
5,I drive a lot for work and needed a better holder for my phone.  This one seemed popular on Amazon so I gave it a try.  After a couple of weeks I can say it's rock-solid.  I'm using the suction cup directly on the windshield and even though we've had some 90+ degree days the suction cup holds in full sunlight.  I like that it was easy to position my phone exactly where I wanted it.  The extension feature brings the phone to within easy reach of my right hand.  Small things done well are a joy and this small thing is done very well.
5,It is a very well manufactured item. I returned it because it is not fit into my car vent and the cellphone covers the driving vision. If the cellphone holder bottom part was longer it would fit but it is small.
5,It arrived quickly.I have not used the suction pad I clipped this to my car vent and it holds real good. I have driven over bumpy roads and it still holds.
5,I didn’t use the adhesion/suction part so I cannot provide feedback on that. I used the clip apparatus. It worked well never came loose. I’m very pleased with the purchase.
5,I was able to use this with just the suction cup feature.  It was incredibly easy to install.  Would highly recomment this to anyone.
1,This is a very dangerous product. The suction cup can't stick to the dashboard at all. When I was passing a speed bump it fell from the dashboard and got stuck under the brake preventing me from braking. This is a very dangerous product and can cause very serious traffic accidents. Recommend Amazon to delete it immediately!!!
5,I really like this phone holder. I’ve been using it for almost a month now. It works great for my iPhone. It stays put the entire ride even through our battered city streets. I did not try the suction part yet. I am currently using the other piece that hooks onto the air vent.
5,finally I found a good quality car mount! stuck it to my car window and works excellent! I love that it comes with adhesive to mount to dashboard as well as car vent.
5,Installed easy and allows you to adjust up and down angle as well as the length. You can’t ask for anything more. My only complaint is that the button for opening the clamp is on the bottom left. I am right handed and have to use my thumb but if the button was on the bottom right then I could push it with my index finger. It’s a bit awkward but I’ll live with it.
2,It would've been great if the adhesive part stuck I did clean off the area and let it dry before applying.
5,Great suction power. Easy to use and very durable. Convenient for everyday use. It also adjust to your liking.
5,Bought this to hold my phone for GPS as I drove across the country. Stuck to my windshield just fine. It has many options for adjustments to get the placement just right.
5,***<EDITED REVIEW!>***So I ordered this item and you can read my original review below but immediately after returning it their customer service emailed me asking me if they could send me a free replacement. I explained that the product simply would not work for me because of my reasons given below however the customer service rep offered me a different style that mounts into the CD player. I accepted her offer and I'm glad I did. I must add that throughout the process the same customer service rep kept me notified throughout the whole shipping process and even followed up after receiving it to make sure I was happy with it. Well done!!!!Original review- The adhesive on the suction cup side was crappy didn't stick for more than 4 seconds. So I decided to use it in the less desirable option for mounting clamped to my vent. Bad idea. From the weight of the phone/case it broke my vent piece fell and broke the plastic clasp that clips to the vent. Not impressed overall. Returned it for a refund.
5,We lease our car we didn't want to use the suction or adhesive by using the clip into the air vent it will work for our purposes.
5,Comes with two mounting types.  One for vent or suction base for dash.  Holds phone securely and easy to adjust for your conditions.  I purchased two for different vehicles.  So far so good.  Seems to be quality materials.......
5,Absolutely love it. The only issues I have are minor. When the car gets too hot in the sun the adhesive part of suction cup will loosen up weather it is on the windshield or the black circle plate. The other issue is the plastic nut that you tighten behind the phone occasionally loosens after lots of travel especially in bumpy roads. I’ve head to deal with both issues only once in the few months that I’ve had it and they are minor issues so I would recommend this still.
5,This goes well with my radar detector on my Tesla it perfectly fits there and stays there. Although the wire does rotate the mount rightwards easily but I'll be resolving this with a longer wire (I hope!).
5,Finally a holder that actually works as intended. Thank you! Excellent product.
5,Using this product for a while working perfect. It’s one of mostly durable cell phone holder that I ever try!
5,Finally one that stays!  Easy to install as well and very adjustable.
5,Its wonderful i bought it for my parents it arrived on time its great thanks
5,Great price and car phone mount. Easy and convenient to use and staying on the windshield on hot sunny days
5,Like the way it stays well secured. Goes on and off easily!👍🏼👍🏼
1,Twice bitten – very disappointing product  I have purchased this product twice now in the past six months. The mounting instructions has seen on YouTube were very easy. The phone fit nicely in the holder. Good dashboard visibility. However during the summer a screw came loose flew somewhere through the car and the entire mounting arm fell never to be able to be repositioned. I was passed the return. So I bought another one. This one had inadequate suction and adhesion capability. Nowhere was I able to find a contact of the company to call and get a resolution. I have now spent nearly $60 on two of these and neither one has worked think twice before you consider purchasing it
5,Great Product
5,Difficult to assemble at first.  Watched video it wat a snap
5,Our new phone did not fit in the phone slot in our semi truck mounted it to the dash. It works great.
5,Just what I needed to support my iPhone while driving.
5,Works well with the phone
5,We use this in the wife’s car and she loves it.
5,Just moved to a new city and needed something like this to help me get around. Its adjustable and did everything I  needed!
5,Guys this is a solid product! Very nicely engineered sturdy and attractive. Lots of adjustment features. We've all seen an awful lot of flimsy products out there. This is not one of them. If you're anything like me you pick a product that you think will fit your needs and hope for the best. This product actually exceeded my wildest expectations.In fact if I could give this 6 stars I would.
5,Perfect!!!
5,I got this for my husband as a Father’s Day present since he needed a new car mount for his phone. It was easy to install and stays in place. I highly recommend this product especially for such a low price.
5,Un éxito
5,Stuck it in my 2016 f150. Perfect location. The suction is ridiculously strong. First trip was 2000 miles and it didn't even flinch. Been on there for over 2 months in freezing weather and 80 degree weather. It still hasn't moved.. The vent clip didn't really work on my particular truck so I ditched that.  Would highly recommend!
5,Fits my fiat 500! Easy to use. Just make sure you press down real hard on the adhesive circle so it’s secure.
5,Very cool ! Wanted an easy moderately cheap stand and this one simply works. It’s nice compatible sturdy good looking and has an arm and vent stand. It easily unattached and I don’t see why it wouldn’t work with all phone. Goodluck! Buy it!
5,As soon as this clip came in my hubby ran out to the car to install it. It took him longer to clean and dry my dashboard than it did to install it.Also my hubby likes to really test things out so he took an old non functioning phone put it in the clip and spun it dropped it and tried everything "car possible" to make it fall out of the clip. It stayed firm the whole time.If anything changes I'll update my review.
5,I bought this for my boyfriend who likes to have his phone eye level to follow his navigation whilst driving. It gets the job done!
5,I can NEVER find a car mount that is sturdy (I do not like the little popsocket looking magnet ones) and will also hold my Note 10+ with my Otterbox Defender case on it. Not only does this one hold my phone it stays put on the dash and holds my somewhat heavy phone pretty still. I have re-stuck it a few times and it still sticks great. I am very impressed and happy.
5,The only thing I did not like was the little pad that came with it I didn't understand what it was needed for
1,Will hold the phone up the phone will not stay in place it falls down you can't tighten it enough for it stay in place.
4,I have had it for almost a month and so far so good.  It is rather bulky and large but it holds my Samsung S10 with hybrid case well.  It has stuck securely on a flat smooth part of my dashboard (no texture).  The multiple ways to adjust the arm works well for my purposes keeping the phone easily accessible and in view without blocking my view. Occasionally the release button does not fully "pop" which affects locking and securing the side grips the next time  but a simple repress of the button does the trick.  I'm not sure how it will hold up in the Texas summer heat yet.
5,I had this for a few months suctioned onto my windshield; however after a few months the suction cup would not remain adhered to the windshield.  I even tried to secure it with gorilla glue heavy duty tape & it was not successful.Still - I feel inclined to offer a 5 star review as the service provided by Davis & the VICSEED team was great!!!  I sent an email with my concerns to the customer service email available on the website.  In less than a few hours I had an immediate response & they quickly actioned to get the right info & issue a full replacement.  It was delivered in less than 2 days for free!I LOVE companies that provide excellent customer service & follow thru on their commitments... this is one of them!I haven't been using the replacement holder for long but it has been working great!
5,I was looking for a car mount for a phone with a large case.  I have had trouble with mounts sticking to my dash because it is textures but this works perfectly.  The release is a little awkward to get to when I need it but that is minor.  Very happy with the functions and the holder.
5,So far it's holding in the heat here in Tucson. Love it as now I can text and drive using the voice recognition system while I'm driving......hope it continues to hold.
5,I bought this for my son-in-law for Christmas and he absolutely loves it! Suction power is amazing!
3,Received the item on time. Overall the product is okay more of plastic components but sticks tightly to the windshield. The only thing that I was less satisfied was the holder- it doesn't tightens/grips firmly the phone in one go but I have to make sure and squeeze the arm hands more and more until the phone is secured tight.
5,Es muy bueno!. Esta hecho con buenos materiales muy resistente el chupon (aguanta mi Note 10 con forro). Tiene varias opciones para montarlo!. Recomendado 100%
5,I’ve used Scosche before and it would come off during really hot days because of my textured dash. The VICSEED car mount works great with the 3M pad it creates a smooth surface and my phone stays put in the holder. Excellent product! Extremely recommend it!
5,This product was very easy to assemble and install in my car. It’s very easy to use and adjust to whatever height you’d like it to be.
4,The first mount I received would not stay connected to the car.  After leaving a negative review the merchant contacted me with the option to have a newer item shipped at no cost.  I am waiting to see how the newer item works.
2,Avoid curved grips!  Go with flat because if you have a thin ring or anything on the back of the phone it will be outside of the grip.  Awful design because it means you have NOWHERES near half an inch for gripping and more like .2 or .3 of an inch at most.I plan to return this and purchase one with a flat grip.
5,Holder mounts firmly to my air vents and holds my phone right where I need it.  I do not have navigation in my car but this works great to keep my Google maps right there at eye level.
3,Good product will update if it stops working soon. Came in an open box though it looks like everything is there but idk.
5,This has all of the features I was looking for but the depth is not enough if you have a PopSocket on your phone.  Suction was secure adjustability was great but my phone was too thick to be held by the short arms.Lily reachedout to me to send me money to buy a different product that works with Pop Soickets.  Above and beyond customer service!
5,IF I COULD GIVE THIS MORE THAN 5 STARS I WOULD..I LOVEEEEE THIS THINGI HAVE AN IPHONE XS AND A HEAVY DUTY CASE.IVE HAVE MANY PREVIOUS PURCHASES WITH NO LUCK IN HOLDING IT WITHOUT FALLING OR BREAKING OFF...THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST THING EVERRRR..I ORIGINALLY BOUGHT IT FOR MY HUSBAND AS A BIRTHDAY GIFT BUT ONCE I SAW HIW GOOD IT WAS (he has a iphone xsmax with a heavy case also)...I HAD TO GET ONE FOR MYSELF:))))
5,Well made and strong ...
5,It's works great! Love that i can out it anywhere dislike puting phone holder in the vent and this one is perfect
4,The bottom support has space to allow a charger to plug in but gets in the way of the aux cord port on my Samsung galaxy. Other than that I have no complaints. Mounts well on my vent very sturdy and well made. Worth every penny.
5,When I first got this my air vents didn't work with the holder.  After I was emailed by the customer about how it was working I let her know it was not working.  She then sent me an air vent that worked in my car it now fits snug and very tight!!!  This will not disappoint I wish all companies cared about their customers as this one did.
5,Se la compré a mi esposo y el es difícil de complacer le gusto mucho y la utiliza diariamente soporta bastante peso ( el celular de mi esposo tiene un protector grande y pesado y aún así se mantiene en su lugar) la recomiendo.
5,High quality. Suction is very strong and holds phone securely. Especially like all the adjustments. Would definitely purchase again.
5,I've gone through many car phone mounts with both the suction cups and vent clips. Many of them are not strong enough or can accommodate a phone with a phone protector. VICSEED has found the way to comfortably place your phone on for Dashboard or your air vent. Not only will your phone stay in place with a phone protector but the clip and suction are strong enough to resist any speed bump or quick turns you may make on the road. I highly recommend this product.
5,So far so good. I’ve had this mount for about 3 months and so far it has been great. It holds my iPhone 11 with otter box securely with no issues.
1,The clip broke yesterday as I was fastening it and the suction piece never stuck. So both pieces aren’t usable.
5,This is a great product I only had an issue the Air Vent clip didn't come in the box like it shows in the picture but I got in contact with the seller and they sent me a replacement but they get the 5 stars any way they deserve more for fixing the problem so quick and hustle free.  Thank you and hope this helps keep up the great work.
5,Finally a phone mount that works!
4,No me gusto que el aparato que succiona solo lo puedes colocar en un mismo lugar (error mio por no leer bien). Pero igual me gusto el producto en general.
5,Overall I think this is a good product don’t use the disc they send with it to help get a flat surface that it’s self doesn’t stick at all just use the suction cup on whatever clean surface you got and stick to that I drive a Subaru 2005 and it is a softer not flat surface and it stuck pretty good!
5,Awesome.  Didn't realize it came with a vent mount as well. I decided to use the vent mount option. Fits perfectly. Holds iPhone XR securely.  Has a nice swivel. Delivery was 2hrs..
1,Couldn't hook to dash
4,I guess I have to get used to it 🤷 but only summer will tell if this is well made since the heat usually ends up destroying the adhesives ill keep you guys updated
5,Seams sturdy and has many mounting and positioning abilities. So far like the product does what is needed very well. Thank you
5,Fast delivery and works great
5,Easy to install without adhesive or suction.  Bought as a gift and installed on vent.  The recipient loves it for the IPhone 8+. Great quality and value. Saved the additional parts for mounting should they be needed for different vehicle in the future. Nice that it comes with mounting options and necessary hardware.
4,I really like this! The only thing is that I wish the little arm was longer so it could extend more. It also doesn’t fit with my PopSocket which is disappointing.
5,The suction power on this is definitely legit! This is the best windshield phone holder I've had. Works great!
5,Holds phone securely. Easy to install.  Good value.
5,So far great experience! Feels solid and holds phone well. I am using it for iPhoneX. Will update if my experience is otherwise over the coming months.
4,Worked great except for base plate kept coming off due to heat . I mounted mine in center console so used 1 small screw to keep in place
5,EXCELLENT 100% RECOMMENDED
5,I’ve tried way too many car mounts for my iPhone and finally I’ve found the one. I’m very impressed by the suction and the ability to hold the phone and not let it move at all. Highly recommend this product.
5,Really like this works well. We use the vent clip more but that’s our preference. Holds well.
5,Best purchase ever!!! So tired of holding my phone in my hand when using GPS. The first thing I do is put my phone in the holder.
5,Absolutely LOVE this cell phone holder. The stance is fierce and it’s sturdy as all get out!
3,It work but the phone my sister uses It is heavy for it but my phone is not
5,Great product
5,I have gone through so many car phone mounts. So far this one seems promising. I like that it comes with the various parts so can mount it on my dash or window. I'm always hesitant about using the vent clip cause the phone is usually too heavy.  But this 1 was actually sturdy.
5,--
5,I love it!0
5,Very excellent. Got every penny worth from this product.  Need one more for my other car
5,Very strong and it Stays in place not like some other product that keep falling out
5,BEST PHONE MOUNT I HAVE EVER OWNED AND I HAVE HAD SEVERAL...EASY TO INSTALL...EASY TO CLOSE ON PHONE AND HOLDS IT NICE AND NUG AND IS EASY TO RELEASE...ADJUSTS TO VARIOUS ANGLES...At....
4,Okay product. The suction didn’t work on my windshield or the attachment they provided. It does stay put on using the vent clip attachment. Now I use it every day and love it!
1,Not wide enough to accommodate my pop socket. My phone falls and won't secure in holder
5,The adhesion suction power and installation was better than expected. The function and features is what originally lead me to purchase the product. Money well spent and would but it again.
5,The reason I bought another one in two days is because the one I put in my work vehicle works and sticks great to the windshield... So I bought the other one for my car... 5 stars
5,Had this product for 5 days and loving it. No issues of phone falling out or suction cup letting loose.
5,I live this!!! Stays put. Easy to get my phone in and out. Perfect!
5,Much more sturdily built than expected.  Appears to be well made of good materials.  Feels much more solid than the other unrelated phone mount it replaced.  I would definitely recommend.
5,Great
5,Although the vent clip was defective and broke on the first one I got they have excellent customer service and happily sent me a replacement. I would buy more products from Vicseed since their prices are also really good!
4,Evselente
5,I used the portion that fit into my air vent and it works perfect
1,This product did not work as expected.  The glue didn’t stick even though I waited 3 days to use.  I will be returning for something different.
5,Installed quickly and smoothly!  Feels durable!  If it holds when the weather gets warmer I’ll be a happy camper!  Nice product!
5,This was an Excellent and Awesome follow up and Great Customer Service. I just reported the problem with the Product and the customer service was Top notch and able to resolve the issue immediately. A+ seller and AA++ Customer Rating
5,Very easy to install and very durable. I would highly recommend
5,I have owned other similar devices and this one tops them all. Easier to install and better built. Highly recommend it.
5,I put this in my suv and have been very pleased with it.  Suctioned tight to windshield and adjusted for easy use and view.  Price was good h shipped quickly.
5,This is the best phone holder ever. I've had a few others one more expensive and one cheaper but this VICSEED is the best. I have great visibility driving and can also safely view Waze.
5,I bought this for my dad earlier in the year and this is all he raves about. The suction is really good and is very sturdy. I’m finally getting one myself after he convinced me lol
5,Me agrado que tiene tres formas para utilizarlo ya sea pegado al cristal pegado al dash o pinchado en uno de los conductor del aire
5,Great quality and easy to install it.
5,very easy to install. I used the vent clamp they also supplied a suction cup. Simple to operate and works well
5,I operate heavy equipment & usually go through these holders pretty quickly. They usually fall off or break from me constantly Readjusting from constant shaking But this thing is STUCK 😂! Seriously I'm actually worried I won't be able to remove from the glass. Very impressed after 3 weeks of use & not a problem. Ordering another for my vehicle.
5,Exactly what I was looking for. It can move so many ways and no matter what holds my phone. It’s definitely worth it.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Very easy to intall. Easy access adjustable
5,Love this phone holder well made and true from what they say it is! Truly recommend this is you need your phone visible when you drive.
5,I use my phone a lot in my car and I appreciate having my VICSEED Universal Car Phone Mount. It works great. It was easy to apply and it stays put!
5,I am very happy I bought this one is worth the money!!
5,Product is easy to install with adequate suction power to hold my phone. Good aesthetics.
5,Easy installation.  Good quality product.  Works just as I wanted.  What more could I ask!?
5,This is a solid quality product that will serve everyone well. I use the suction cup mount for my RV.
5,No QI charging but otherwise everything is solid and sharp. Good value
5,I was so excited to have this work for maybe 3 weeks...now if phone is placed in it it falls. So disappointing
4,I have tried about 8 different versions of phone holders for my car and this is by far the best one!The suction didnt hold to my upholstery but as soon as I put this disc pad down it has been sold and holding and is still flexible and usable!Love It!!
5,Good product only case to hold my s21 ultra
5,Great product
5,Great phone holder! Love how close it sits by the steering wheel. Makes it super convenient to navigate!
5,Does what it should do at a cheap price Florida heat doesn't really give me peace of mind as i've seen people mention that summer heat ruins the adhesion and suction power....
5,Works perfect for my Dodge pickup sits perfect on dash nice viewing angle nice and stable I love the easy release button to.
5,so the mount was like facing down but eventually it was working great and still is
5,very sturdy phone holder. does not come off easily//great suction ! I use it every day. I'm happy with it.
5,Easy to install. The adhesion is strong.  This thing isn't going anywhere.
5,Exactly what I was looking for

5,This holder made it through ALL the potholes in Houston Amazing
5,Good suction powerreccomendHigh quality product
5,Just loved it. Perfect

4,Very study my girlfriend loves it in my opinion it worth the price and will buy it again if needed.
5,One of the best cell phone holders for my car I found so far
5,brilliant way to design this device for Tesla drivers!quality product but need adjustable feature for the various width of cell phones.

5,Excellent product recommend 💯
4,This product is good overall but I wouldn't say it's amazing. For what you pay it seems like a fair trade off. It's good enough to get job done.
4,Great product  value for your money.
5,I’ve only had it a few days so we’ll see how it holds up but compared to the vent clip phone holder I had before it’s 100x more sturdy!
5,This is my third holder. The previous two were junk. This one is perfect. Great product.
5,Solid buy suction power is good and nice design.
5,Very solid
5,I am very happy with your product. It performs like I expected it to and I really like the placement of the release button compared to another product I have in another car.

5,Installed easy and works with my phone with a leather case/cover so I am good with this. The holder is stable. What else do you need?

5,Thanks ...Works perfectly!
5,Best phone holder ever !!!!!!
5,So far it seems really sturdy
5,Awesome phone mount. Works better than others I have used in past. Best so far.
5,It is just as described works great and has great suction and is very sturdy and durable
5,Best phone holder!
5,Very easy to install! Great product will recommend
5,Works great
5,I bought it to dash mount and ended up preferring the vent mount option.  Vent mount very secure and does not look like it will do any damage.
5,Great product and great customer service along with it. Jenny in service was professional and proficient. Product works great for my dads iPhone 7 Plus. Strong and sturdy.
5,Love it
5,It’s strong and nice.
5,Easy to install works perfectly
5,Well built
5,This unit really holds my android cell.  Other units that I have tried the phone comes right off when you go over a bump. I give them Six Star. Piervito from Brooklyn NY
5,Great for my Yukon I’ve used it on the windshield and dashboard so far no issues. All without the base they sent. Grip is good and steady. Totally recommend
5,This phone holder is strong and it has great options for phone positioning and it extends! Have been using this product for over 6 months and continue to use it.
5,Very sturdy. Fits my galaxy s9 great. It would be able to fit just about any phone. The grip is great.
5,Phone was great for traveling fit really snug to my iPhone easy installation
5,It's very good product!
5,I love that this product comes with different ways to mount your phone. For me the one that fastens to the vent works the best in placement. It is sturdy and has an easy quick release to get your phone in and out!  I highly recommend!
5,Best
5,Been looking forna device to hold my phone.  Have had several cold daya and has remained in place so far. We'll see how it does come summer.
5,Much better than phone holders I have purchased before. Sturdy construction.
5,Works great. This holder does not vibrate like other holders. It has an easy to use release which makes it easy to put your phone in and easy to remove. Also comes with different mounts so you can choose how and where to mount it.
5,Well made and versatile. Easily fits phones with a case but if you have a phone case with an additional credit card wallet like my daughter does this holder will probably not work. The credit card holder caused the overall thickness of the phone to be too thick for the phone holder. Aside from that it's a good holder.
5,I did not mount this yet. It works perfectly on air cent
1,Used it once!!! It stayed on a couple days then fell off and won’t reattached.
5,Neat gadget for the car or truck. Holds phone securely.
5,Great product
5,We didn’t want it to stick to the dash but it fit the vent perfectly.
5,Super strong holds my iPhone 12 Pro Max in place which if you own it you know it's heavy for a phone. Sturdy and versatile I would definitely recommend it.
5,Great suction
4,This is a really sturdy well-built phone mount.  It's pretty easily adjustable but it might take a minute before you figure out exactly where you need to place it as some of the 'joints' range of motion can be a little limited.  Also if you have a ring grip or a pop socket that doesn't lay completely flat on the back of your phone you may or may not be able to use this.  Because the side arms kind of curve inward if your phone is fatter/thicker than the gripper arm they probably won't hold on to your phone very well.
5,lOVED IT
4,All the pieces were in the box. Seems well built let me try it in different configurations to see how it will work best for me.
5,I have had this going on 2 years and it has never broken never fallen never dropped my phone not once. It is the best phone holder there is I am sure of it because I have been using it nonstop the entire time. I installed mine using the adhesive. In Colorado summers can have temperatures in the 90’s but the adhesive has had no issues. And obviously we have cold winters. Again no issues. Since I have used this so long and love it I now consider it a perfect gift! And once I contacted the seller with a question and received an immediate same day reply! That is great customer service! I realized that I hadn’t yet reviewed it when I came gift shopping so I wanted to let others know what a great experience I have had with it.
4,Works great only reason I didn’t give it a 5 is it was a gift so but was told it works great!
5,I ordered this product and emailed to activate the warranty from the card inside to which I heard back right away. I then tried the product to see that the swivel was defective. I started the return process on Amazon and then immediately contacted Alice at Vicseed via email. She was very responsive and sent out a new one that arrived in 2 days free of charge. This one works perfectly.It's not often that you get personal contact to a seller on Amazon Vicseed went above and beyond what is normal on Amazon and solved my issues very quickly. This is the kind of customer attention we so often miss in e-commerce and on Amazon. It was refreshing to have such great customer service for that reason alone I will buy from this seller again when I have use for one of their products!Keep up the good work.
5,What a great gift! When clipped to the vent to the right of the wheel it is the perfect distance for easy use. The suction didn’t work on my dash so it’s great it comes with an alternate means to attach it. Well-made and solid; accommodates all sizes of phones.
5,Very Cool!
5,Great customer service! Even before setting up the phone mount I was able to get a lifetime warranty on my product. This was incredibly important to me since other phone holders I previously had weren’t stable enough.
5,Works perfect. Just had to remove my phone case so my phone could fit.
5,I purchased the VICSEED Universal Cell Phone Holder and I love it!  It was so easy to install and is very strong and durable!  The suction power and adhesion is very strong. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great cell phone holder. I will be purchasing more for all my other vehicles!!
5,I am sooo happy with this product I can not describe. I spent hundreds if not thousands for similar products all garbage. This is IT !!! Amazing product great suction good grip easy rotation system...and pretty affordable. Highly recommend it !!!!!
5,Like everything about it!!!
5,Very versatile and easy to use holder no issues so far..
5,My spouse bought many car mounts. But none worked for her. Then I bought Vicseed car mount it's the best. My spouse really like it. Now her phone does not drop while driving the car. Best investment.  After sales customer service is excellent.  I would recommend it My friends and families.
5,Worked great for what I needed.
5,As a trucker driver-having a strong sturdy reliable phone mount is nearly 100% necessary. It truly is helpful. Finding one that won’t fall off is hard. This vicseed mount- it is the one to get. When I changed  trucks- the adhesive mount not come off- i am truly impressed because all these big named cell phone mounts would always fall- even the garmin gps i still use falls off- but this one does not!! I will happily be buying more.
5,This car mount is very easy to use. I have had mine for over a year. I did not use the suction or adhesion and opted to clamp it on my air vent. Make sure it is on tight and it will not be going anywhere. The gap at the bottom makes it easy to charge your phone while driving which is nice for long road trips.
5,Excellent quality with 2 options mount : window mount & AC mount  the width fits my IPhone12 pro max perfectly and extra
5,This is by far the best phone holder! I'd buy again if anything ever happens to the on I bought. Holds my phone no issues was able to charge my phone while mounted. Buy it you will love it like I do!
5,Great! Love it! Super easy to put together thanks Amazon!
5,Had a couple of these ordering one for each vehicle cause they work so well
5,It was better then i exspected
5,Nice cell phone car mount. Easy to install. Holds well.
5,Much better than expected. I’ve never had a cell holder worth a darn. I’ve tried them all. This one like the added parts you wish had been on your last one. Anyway  Try it
5,Best windshield mount so far.  Solid suction does not slip or move rock solid.  Highly recommend.
5,Holds my husbands iPhone and really sticks to the windshield.  We tried to move it and can’t get it off!
5,Easy to adjust
5,Like the everything about it easy to install. Well great product
5,This thing does exactly what the description says it does
5,Excelente
5,Fits perfectly on top of dashboard still maintains low profile not blocking vision.love the articulation.
5,I like it.
5,Bought this for my new car. Easy to use.  I like that it clamps down on my phone to hold secure and is easy to release with just pressing a button. Study but about once a month I have to make sure the suction is secure. I has only slightly lifted in the back but has never come off completely
5,Highly recommend as a relationship aid
2,Description says it’s a suction cup. Nope. The “suction cup” is sticky but it doesn’t stay stuck
1,Did not work at ALL....adhesive does not stick. The clips for car air vent does not hold and the rotation ball isn't strong enough to keep my LG phone in position.Phone drops.....every time. Its really frustrating. I've tried sooooo many companies!:(
5,So useful great to have in a car.
5,Ohh id sooo good you can talk easy and loudy
5,After many tries we finally found a phone holder that works in our van. It actually stays on the dashboard. We love it.
5,Nice and sturdy easy instructions and even comes with warranty how awesome it that didn't even expect that
5,It’s easy to connect and used. Convenient.
5,Awesome phone holder for anyone who spends a lot of time in their car traveling.
5,This product is excellently manufactured.  It comes with the suction device for the window of course and another for the dash should the window install be impractical.  The suction cup is extremely adhesive and doesn’t look like it’s going anywhere even in this desert heat!  The phone cradle moves every which way is wide enough to accommodate an iPhone 11 Pro Max and has a space for a power cord beneath.  You can adjust the angle of the phone off of the suction cup which is nice but what really sold me is the extender arm can be moved in our out about 4-5” giving you greater flexibility on how you install the phone.  It also comes with a clip for the air vents should you decide to go that route.  My phone is so heavy though it would probably pull the fragile vent out of the duct.
4,Gets the job done and works for my 03!Update: I had a car accident flipped four times and my car went airborne but guess what didn’t! My phone stayed put so I DEFINITELY recommend.
5,I like this much better than the ones that attach to the air vents. It’s a lot more stable. It’s a great value.
5,I mounted this in my log truck I  do some intense off highway driving rough roads. I mounted both vent clip and the suction cup (with 3M plate) both methods worked great. Would I recommend this product?  Oh yes whole heartedly. Would I recommend this seller?  Very much so.
5,Very well made great materials holds my cell phone very securely very adjustable to many different configuration and very easy to instal I highly recommend this product and is a very good value to cost ratio very happy !
3,Update 6-6-22:Lasted about 3years. Last week we hit 90s heat and the adhesive melted and came off. No longer sticks.Original review:I am loving this so far! I cannot tell you how frustrated I have been with the air vent holders. My iPhone was too large for those and needed something more sturdy. This holder is attached to my windshield and the holder doesn’t budge. My phone is secure.
5,My dashboard is not conducive to the adhesive plate but the suction cup is great on the window.
5,excelente
5,Excellent value for the money.  Solid build above average adhesion not wobbly lots of adjustments holds phone securely.  Works absolutely fine as-is but I'd suggest design changes:  make the bottom supports adjustable as I have a right angle cable and make the holding arms longer to accommodate a popper on the back of the phone (or hollow out some of the back support to make room).  Summary:  big improvement on my old wobbly vent mount that required a rubber band to secure the phone.
5,I got it for my sister as a Christmas present; looks lovely in her car and has no issues.
5,It was easy to install I'm happy with it but its shorter that what I thought I was going to get I have a 2002 Cadillac Escalade and have it mounted on the dash. It holds my galaxy note 9 with an otter box in it and that's ontop of my phone being heavy so no complaints.
5,Literally my favorite new thing in my car only wish I had gotten it earlier! Put it in my vent and stays perfectly!
5,Bought this for my husband's truck. Didn't work based on placement of vents so he put it in my car. Works great for me! Easy to adjust and view. i don't use the suction feature so can't comment on that.
5,I like that it has several articulating sections to get the right angle and distance.
5,Buen uso
5,First of all the holder and stand are fantastic! I have nothing but praises for it including the following:1) Very sturdy with no loose or delicate parts2) With my fairly heavy phone (Pixel 6 Pro) it does not budge at all! Even when going over bumpy roads the phone and the stand stay well-balanced and unmoving throughout. This was one of the biggest improvements over my previous stands3) Very easy one handed use both to dock the phone and undock it. The mechanism is smooth with no sudden or sharp clamping. Soft press of the latch releases the arms smoothly and pressing them gently from both sides clamps the phone softly yet strongly! No more worrying about the arm squeezing my phone's edges (or even case) too hard!4) The adhesion is pretty strong with no melting so far. Although it's winter time here so perhaps a longer usage duration is needed to confirm the longevity.5) FANTASTIC customer support! They honor their terms and go above and beyond! I had some issue installing the base plate on my car and on asking for some input they promptly sent me multiple new base plates and asked for insight on any issues along with seeking my feedback! Very fast turnaround time and quality items.So far I've been very happy to do business with them and even happier about the fantastic phone holder for my new phone :)
4,The Vicseed Cell Phone holder seems to be solid and pretty flexible. The reason for 3 stars is that the suction cup came covered with stickum. I didn't realize it when I first used it and put it on the included suction pad when I tried to separate them they would only come apart with significant force pulling the pad off of my dash even though I tried to hold it in place. I have been trying to remove the stickum with alcohol but not having much success. Okay after spending more time researching I see that just about all of these have the 3M pad I just find this to be overkill. I suppose better that than having it fall off the windshield.
5,I didn't like that it would stick on my dash. The adhesion pad with the flat top for the dash didn't even work.. So it's on my windshield. It works well on there.
5,I've had several of these type mounts and this is the first one that has not fallen off or completely broke within a month. Seems well built and fits my Galaxy Note 9 with Otterbox like a glove.
5,Easy to maunting.
5,Bought a similar one months back.. It was another brand Worked great but wasn’t as Rugged or Rigid as this one… HIGHLY RECOMMEND for bigger phones and phones with cases!! Suction cup was powerful 3M TAPE ADHERED to dash board without a problem looks great but most importantly works even better!!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!
5,Good suction and adjustable length.
5,It was very easy to install no Hasell
5,Súper efectivo lo catálogo de 5 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
5,Super easy to install and it actually STAYS. I used the vent clip for a while til I needed to feel all my ac so now I use the suction and I haven’t had any issues. The suction is awesome and its super flexible
5,Good thing is easy to install like as mentioned. Didn't get off from the place .I personally really like it
5,This product worked as advertised. I would recommend
5,I really really like this phone holder!
5,Best hands free car phone holder. Solid suction cup and easy adjustment. Safe driving tool worth buying. Highly recommended 👍👍
5,I got this holder because it gives you both options suction and clipping n the ventsI am very pleased so far it’s easy to put it on and easy to take it offI decided to go with the clip on the vents because in Los Angeles is getting hot and it will come off eventually
5,I was surprised that the suction cup would stick to the dashboard and support the arm and my phone. But it works. I'll still have to wait and see when I hit a pot hole.
5,I bought one for my husband so he wouldn't hold his phone while driving and liked it so I got one for myself when I use it for navigation.  I attached it to my dash and he is using it on his window.
5,It stuck well and adjusts easily and holds firmly in my boat.
5,Follow the instructions and it will work great! Put the clear sticky part and waited 3 days. Added the suction and worked great! I love that It can fit any size phone easily press a button to release it. Adjustable it’s nice to have something to hold phone for music or navigation!
5,This thing really sucks.  And I mean that in a good way.  The clamp that holds your phone feels flimbsy but it holds it well.
5,I’m giving it 5 stars bc the product itself is greatBUT be verrryyyy careful bc it will rip off a piece of your dash.
5,Been using the suction on the window with a couple of months and has held so far.
5,I liked the options of using the car vent. Easy to install
5,Love this mount.  Holds my android phone well. It can adjust to any size or brand phone. I placed on my Ac vent and I have no issues. It's stays on and easy to move at any angle. Love it. Thanks
4,The only thing I would change is the extension arm needs to go another 1/2 inch.
5,Like the option of using on vent windshield or dash.  I set it up on the dash and it was an easy install.  Easy to operate one handed.  Only time will tell if the AZ heat will cause the mount to fail but I believe it will be fine.
5,easy to install just perfect
5,I have a ram 1500 and am happy with how the suction power holds it to my dash
5,Update 07/01/2022 Had some issues installing in my vehicle customer service went beyond the call of duty in helping me! Vent clip wasn’t a good match for my vehicle I decided to use the suction cup instead but Valerie was helpful in satisfying my needs! I would definitely recommend buying from this company they stand behind their products!
5,Had to install mine in my car vent due to my phone being so big. Works perfectly nice little device for the money.
5,I travel a lot for my job and I use my cell phone for GPS/directions. I’ve tried a few different cell phone holders (suction and vent clip) and have been less than impressed. But I didn’t give up. I knew there was a product out there that could work 🤞🏻I found this one. HOORAY 🥳I use the suction on the windshield instead of my dash so I can’t comment on dash usage but it holds GREAT on the windshield. Very sturdy with the option of an extended arm.They’ve thought of everything and have multiple adjustment points to stabilize the phone.It’s nice that this company includes so much. You are getting multiple options for just one product! They include the extra surface sticker if you need to reinforce the suction for the dash. Again I’m not using that but it’s nice to know I have the option to try!As well as sending a vent clip so you can switch out the phone holder to use on that if you prefer. It adjusts and tightens as well!! So no more falling out of the vent due to weight! They thought about the issue with your typical clips and fixed it 🥳Lastly their customer service. I contacted them after registering my product to ask questions/request something. They/Jane responded within a few hours and not only answered my questions but immediately shipped the small plastic piece I requested so I have an extra.You get a lot of options with just one product that is made well and easy to use. And their customer service is quick to respond and help anyway they can. I highly recommend this purchase and will be getting another one for the family car 🤗
5,Excellent product two fittings comes handy if we need to switch this between our cars! Thank you!
5,I like it it was OK for the car
5,I bought the product for hands free and using maps on iphone SE works great
4,DOES WHAT IS EXPECTED.
5,Didn't take me long to figure out how to install on my car dashboard. So helpful and has not come close to falling off once (it's been six months so far). Love that it's adjustable and easy to remove the phone after using.
5,I recommend this product very much.Everything about it is great.I mounted it on the windshield the suction power is great and it is very steady.I tried many mobile holders before this is the best.
5,Mounting system is really nice.
4,It was not easy to figure out how to put pieces together...the instructions were incomplete. After 2 days having the arm falls forward 8 finally figured out how to secure the case.
4,Very good quailty. Very pleased with this iteam.
5,Handy and great 👍🏼
2,Looked great when I first got it. 2 days later it didn’t wanna open when pushing the button so I returned it and went the MagSafe route. Best thing I’ve done so far
3,Not what I expected. Really big. Huge actually.
5,best non magnetic that i had so far
5,Great product
5,Attached to my power boat windshield to use my iPhone GPS and BT music on the water. Sticks well with suction cup and easy to remove phone from side clamps.
5,I am so happy with this purchase.  I use it in the air vent.  I was pleased to see that it allowed me to change position of the phone turning the phone more toward me in the driver's seat--not just straight ahead only.  I could also install the phone in landscape or portrait mode.  I am also happy that I have multiple ways that I can install this phone holder in my car.
5,Purchase this product and had some concerns. I contacted the seller through Amazon. Within hours I had someone from Vicseed contact me and solved all the concerns I had. The product is very sturdy and easily mounted in your vehicle.
1,If you have a ring on your phone case this will not work!! It doesn't stay in the holder with a ring on the phone/phone case!!!
5,This is perfect. Put it on a flat surface and it works well. Very impressed with how sturdy it is. A great buy if you drive for Uber Door dash or Instacart.
5,It started to give me problem like a week after I bought it and threw it away a month later. Due to the weight of the phone the mount kept falling and unsticking. Not a good purchase.
5,👍🏻
5,I like the secure mount also the one finger release.
5,My dashboard was too curved for the suction or the adhesive approach but it fit easily into the air conditioning vents for the alternative mounting system that comes with it.
5,Easy
5,Fácil de instalar y múltiples usos.
5,All good
5,My husband bought one said it was great and I wanted one for my car and our Explorer (the dogmobile). I used the vent clip in my Mazda and the suction cup in my Explorer. I sent a note to the company asking if I could buy just the cellphone holder piece so I didn't have to swap it between vehicles. Although they were unable to sell parts separately they were willing to give me a discount on a full set. They replied to my request unexpectedly quickly and even though I was disappointed that I couldn't get just the one part I was very pleased with the offer of a discount and I will keep the extra parts as backups in case of any future breakages. So far the product is great and the customer service is fantastic!
5,I have a vehicle that is not Apple car play compatible. I looked into getting a new stereo so I could have Apple car play and it was going to cost me an arm and a leg to have done. So I did the next best thing… a phone mount! Packaging is super nice and sleek. Super easy install and it’s the perfect addition to my vehicle! Makes using my GPS so much easier when around town or in new places
5,best phone holder on the market have a big phone with a thick heavy otterbox double case this vent holder and cup holder handles it with no issues good quality definitely worth it
5,We have had problems with other models/brands but so far this one is working well. It has a solid feel is highly adjustable and most important has a more complex and thus far more solid adhesion system. Instead of just using suction to attach to your dashboard you first adhere this separate disk wait overnight and then use suction to attached to that disk. As I say works well so far. (I guess it also comes with a vent mount but we haven't tried that.)
5,The only thing is that when I sold my truck I could not get it off so I had to buy another one. I was happy to do so as it worked well.
5,I love it! I had one cell phone holder prior to this one it but it wouldn't stay in my windshield.  I looked on Amazon and liked what I read about this phone holder so I ordered it and I love it. I told my sister about it she just ordered her one the other day
5,I’m really loving the phone holder! First it was really easy to instill second it’s very durable! I have an iPhone 11 and I’m glad I don’t have to worry about putting my phone on the stand it falling down a little because the holder really stays in place!
5,Everything was good
5,Oh boy this is a good one! Location Location Location is crucial. No vibration no complaints.excellent choice for my 2000 Tundra mounted in a perfect spot with a little patience. Nice product.
5,Sturdy holds large otter box case doesn’t fall off with Fl heat
5,I installed it in my Jeep. It has been banged around and still no problems . The only thing I do not like is the release button is hid down and back behind the holder
5,I really really like this phone mount. I drive a little car so creature comforts are limited. This phone mount has made a big difference for me. I managed to mount it in a handy spot  on the dash and putting the phone on the stand and taking it off is a one-handed operation. That is so nice. Previously I used a magnet set up but the phone covered the whole vent and since I live in AZ I need that air conditioning blowing on my hot face. This mount allows the phone to be away from the vent but still in a handy position. I think it is fabulous.
5,Super suction great size sturdy
5,I bought this to with stand the hardship of lease roads and vibrations that come with oilfield activities. It vibrates a very small amount the grip is great and the release button is in a well thought position. It's super sturdy with a sticky suction cup that sticks to just about any surface. It telescopes and locks in position if u need to extend a fair amount. The locking mechanisms are sturdy and well designed. The design itself is at perfect angles for just about any applications. It came with a vent clip that's just as durable with an interesting engineering approach to hold the weight of phones I use a s21 ultra. I had no problem fitting it in the clamps.
5,Exactly what I was looking for
5,Sturdy right now we are using the clip portion. Haven’t tried the suction
5,Just a good all around hands-free device
5,Easy to assemble and has super suction power. The only potential problem I see is if I try to move it to my other car. The suction cup works so well it might be a little tricky.
5,Very happy with the purchase! The adhesive/suction of the mount’s gel pad is great and my phone is cradled securely on my dashboard. I definitely recommend!
5,It’s very good!!! Buy it
5,I really liked this product and it’s very easy to install.
4,this device definitely grips your phone and holds it in place i'd get me another one if i had another car...! the only thing that stood out was the additional pad that was meant in the unlikely event the already provided suction cup didn't take to your windshield or dashboard... its not a very aggressive kind of adhesive definitely needs to be stronger
1,When latched down the suction cup is loose.  This useless thing bounced up and down .  Total junk.
5,Used air vent Mount only. Design is Sturdy. Well built
5,It works well especially adhered to the window.
5,great phone holder. The suction cup work right away & it holds like glue. You get two holders for the price of one one for your dashboard & one for the A/C vents. Highly recommended!

5,Love it don't have to worry about it falling from my winshield.
5,It does the job
5,Very nice
4,I like the two ways of using in a kar would also like a cd player slot option. Everything works. The renault clio 3 is not made for the suction cup it just does not stay put so used the airvent perfect there!
5,Muy bueno y su calidad es superior a la de otros artículos.
5,Christmas gift for my husband that wanted a mount that was sturdy and vent mounted. He is really happy with this item. Phone is very secure. Vent mount works great. Ease of releasing phone a plus. Great product happy hubby
5,I needed a phone mount but handlebar mounted ones would not fit my large bars. I found this and it is exactly what I needed. I took her for a ride down the interstate and my normal speeds and my phone didn't even move. The suction cup has an extra adhesive in it to help which may hurt the paint over time but I plan to remove the mount every once in awhile and wax. I couldn't be happier with this purchase.
5,Love it
5,This is a high end product for a low price. Met my need in a difficult mount situation.I’ll order another for my motor home.
5,Perfect fit for my iPhone 12 Pro Max with Case. Good quality product. Easy to install. Easy to adjust for many position.
3,If you don't have a place to mount it on the windshield that makes your phone reachable and doesn't block your vision I suggest you don't want this. The adhesive installation is almost useless unless you have a flat smooth dashboard. Any pebbling at all and you won't like the way it "sticks."
5,See above comment
5,Muy bueno de verdad
5,I tried a couple of holders before I bought this one and this was the one for me. It works perfectly in my car!
5,This has been on our car for a year. Never once had an issue with mounting although it's is mounted with the sticky pad. We live in the Northern part of the US with cold weather and warm Summers. The mount stayed on. The charge port had access for multiple cell phones. Very happy with this mount.
5,My mother took my cell phone holder for her car so I had to purchase another one. I could have purchase from a different company but this cell phone holder is very sturdy and it last through the summer last year (90 degree weather). We live in th country and you knowost country roads ar horrible. My phone never falls it shift. No complaints here.
5,Good !
5,Need something to hold my phone on the pontoon boat and keep it out of the sun. This works perfect.No complaints!
4,It took me a while to figure out how I was going to get this to mount on my car. I have a rav4. And it has a lot of uneven surfaces and textured surfaces. I finally figured out how to maneuver the thing to stick to the windshield and be perfect for my use. The pictures attached will show you exactly how I mounted it and it works fantastic!
3,This car mount works well. It stays put on the dashboard the holder is fantastic for my 2021 Moto Stylus and bulky case. But this does not work for my car. I reached out to the seller asking which model works for my car (provided year make and model). Sadly the vent holder is too short. The dashboard arm extension does not extend far enough. The piece that holds the phone is great but my preference is a holder that locks when I place the phone instead of squeezing the tabs to hold it in place. So for these few options that don't work despite the seller recommendation I give it 3 stars

5,Overall sturdy product that works well and the open and close mechanism to grab the phone works really well compared to other ones I have used.
5,I bought the first version of this with a spring loaded thing in the middle. It was a horrible design. This just makes everything way better. Threw out the old one and now I use this every day. Great mount.
5,Really firm and sturdy. Has great grip on the phone
5,Perfect for holding your phone
5,Purchased one and loved it! It started falling off and I contacted the seller and they sent me a replacement. Great customer service! This was the only phone holder that actually works.
1,Do not recommend
5,Holds to dash extended arm a big plus
5,Love love this!
5,I love this one it holds the phone in place and its very durable. The best i bought so far. It hokds good for truck drivers.
5,I originally experienced poor suction with this device as it didn't stay in place especially after it was relocated to another car just once.The Vendor reached out to me to correct the problem.  They sent a new device which rectified the problem as the replacement device works extremely.Vicseed customer service was extremely responsive and followed up multiple time to ensure the problem was corrected and I was extremely happy.I would purchase this product again in the future.
3,The suction cup fell off the second day. The tightening bolts come loose during regular driving. Maybe mine was faulty but I was disappointed with it and will be looking for something else. UPDATE— the company did reach out to me to try to send a new one or a different option. I had already bought a different kind but they tried to make it right.
5,Good to have options to mount on dashboard windshield or to vent fans.
5,Awesome mount but if you have a pop socket it won’t fit into the mount holder
4,Works good in auto
5,This is the one to buy. Good quality great price good seller.
5,really like the mount works well adjusts easily to many different positions. The nut that tightens mount to the arm cracked cause I over tightened it. contacted VICSEED they got me a replacement nut right away with no hassles. great product and awesome customer service.
5,Super fast deliver got in 2 days! First one was defective but they were quick to get me a new one and fix the issue!!! Highly recommend and I’m super happy now
5,I installed the mount on the driver's side door window glass just in front of the view of the rear view mirror.  It is easily accessed and the speakerphone makes it all hands free.  Also the phone is not under the windshield getting baked by the sun.  The gripper system holds the phone nicely and has a quick-release button to make the phone easy to remove from the mount.  I would buy this again.
5,I love this holder and the way the grip works!
5,This thing sticks to any/every thing.  You need to watch where you put it down because it will latch on in an instant.  It's actually a very nice product.  Materials are good and build quality is good as well.
5,Super easy to install and use. Is holding up well.
5,No problems with this after several months
5,good
5,i was going to return this because I didn’t think it suctioned to my dashboard then I found the lever you have to pull to get it to suction. So far I love it and it holds my heavy iPhone plus with card holder case on! No complaints here
5,Exceeded all expectations
4,I received the cellphone holder and it looks very nice it feels well made not cheaply made. The extension arm is a nice feature allows me to extend the carrier to a convenient location for me. I cannot review its durability as I just installed it and I have not used it yet. We will see if the adhesive holds and if the holder actually holds my phone in place when I most need it to as in real time traffic and trips. For the money it seems very well made and it does look kool on my dashboard.
5,This so far has been a great mount for my phone. I like that I can push the sides in and the curved side grips will hold my phone in well. Without having to tighten it against my phone I am free to take it in and out with little effort. The cut out at the bottom is nice so I can have it plugged in while it is in the holder.I would purchase this again without hesitation.
5,Well made solid product.  If you need your phone to be stable and easy to remove this is the best choice.  I have used other products and thoroughly read the reviews of others.  The ability to move extend and rotate the arm is the best feature.  If you watch the video on the product images section you can see how many positions you can adjust it to.Don't hesitate.
5,Great product overall! Very easy to assemble install and use.
5,Good stuff
5,This car phone mount is amazing! I used the suction mount on the dash. It is perfect and holds my phone very securely. I have have a galaxy note 9 with a pop socket. It's a heavy phone and this mount holds it very securely. I love the easy click release. Very adjustable which is also very nice.
5,Nice and handy
5,Bought this for my mom's car. She has an iphone 8 plus & it fits perfectly & it's very secure.
5,I've tried 5 other devices and nothing compared to this easy to use multiple positions to accommodate any user.
5,I bought this item a while back and I LOVE IT! I love that it comes with two options a suction cup or a vent clip. I use the vent clip most of the time but I'm always happy to have a second option just in case I need a more stable stat for longer trips.Unfortunately the vent clip broke but the product comes with a warranty. So I was able to contact the seller by replying back to their email and they were ON TOP of it. They replied back in a couple hours and was able to send me the part I needed. It only took less than a week to receive.BUY THIS PRODUCT! Totally Worth it.
5,This product is great! I bought 3 one for each car and is so easy to install and so durable. Also I can use my cell phone with cover and all fits great. I'm in love with it!
5,its nice and holds up well on the window. its all plastic but for the price its quite nice!
5,have yet to try the adhesion aspect but the clip to the vent works great.  I really like the feature to close in on your phone
5,Suction pretty good. Adhesive is good too.
5,The phone holder is sturdy well made and does not shake and vibrate like others do.
5,Good one..This was a perfect fit in my car's air vent.I had been searching for a good one since a long time and am completely happy with this product.
5,Me encanta es súper comodo fácil de manejar tenia uno anterior con iman pero este es mejor no hay miedo de que se vaya a caer…
5,works so good on my car it does not move and holds my iphone 11
5,Holds phone securely and in place while working pretty sturdy on a desk setup
5,Works great! My husband uses in the semi!
5,This item works great! Very durable and easy set up
5,Finally! Found a car mount that really works. Suction and long arm positioning is great!
