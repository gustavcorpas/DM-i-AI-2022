1,Incorrect information charges very slow
3,This charger gets very very hot. It is sold as apple certified along with the cords. I cannot find any apple certifications marked on either the chargers or the cords. I will take to apple store to see if they are certified before I return them. I could not confirm the apple certification so I did end up returning the item for a refund. I got some at Walgreens that were certified.
5,Great product - came with 2 power blocks also
5,Just as expected works great!
5,Good quality!
5,I bought a new IPhone which come without charging cable. So i bought this cable which is not original Apple cable but the cable is working great. Its not different with the original  cable. Also it come with two cable so i can put one for my car too. its a nice deal.
5,Great value for 2 chargers! Compared along side with iPhone charge this head size has the same length slightly wider surface(to be honest can't tell any differences). The longer cord just made my life so much convenient imagine you can move around with your phone on charge. So far so good does what it should.
5,It does not cost money and it is strong. It can be twisted and used without affecting the charging of the mobile phone. The quality is also durable. The joints are also very strong which is very good.
5,I like the quick charging plus the length was a little more than my old cord which made this even more easy to use in my home. Itâ€™s a perfect

5,Overall quality is nice
5,So far so good. I was impressed with the price for a 2-pack of these that include everything you need; both the ports and the wires. Wires are 6 feet long. Charges devices quickly. I appreciate that the company offers a 6 month guarantee

5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                Â Great chargers to have on hand that work fast!  We are always needing to charge phones so I like to have cords in all our rooms and these were a good value.  Nice quality and ends stay inserted well.  Happy with how they work and glad they are Apple certified.
5,6 feet charging cable is long enough itâ€™s very convenient for me.
5,The 2 ok cords both come with a header and the cords are long 'charges fast great
5,Wow this iPhone/iPod/iPad charger is so convenient! I was so sick of using my Ipad tablet with those standard chargers it comes with since the outlets in my living room and bedroom area in an uncomfortable spot and it forces me to be stuck within a few feet out of the outlet. This 6-inch USB is compatible with all of Apple's products so now I can use it for all my apple electronics.It also comes with 2 chargers and lightning cables (white color) which is super nice so I can have one of my own for my iPhone 13 and my son can use it for his iPhone 11. No arguments and fights since now this charger is the hot commodity in the household.
5,Charging my iPhone and iPad super fast. I bought others chargers for even more price than this one and after 1 day of use broke. So far so good thanks seller
5,Fast charger and flexible to move around while charging.
