5,Needed to adapt my headphone to an older jack. This item worked.
5,It's an adapter and it does its job well. That's all you really need to know. I have an old keyboard that needs 1/4 inch jacks in order to use headphones but now I can use any set of headphones that plug into a smartphone or computer.
4,works
5,Warning: If you're trying to adapt a 1/4" male jack (like the cables that Sennheiser on-ear cans come with) to plug into a cell phone or other 1/8" female jack look for a 1/4 inch female to 1/8 inch male adapter instead. This one is not what you need.I don't know why I had such a hard time getting that straight.That said these seem like solid sturdy adapters for converting a 1/8" jack to a 1/4" one in order to plug into amps keyboards and the like. Unfortunately I got the input/output backwards so they're useless for my needs.
5,If you're a musician or do anything with audio you know how frustrating it can be to loose your adapter or not have one at all. Don't let that be the case ever again! These feel sturdy. & as far as I can tell don't impart anything upon the sound. The quality is comparable to anything i've gotten previously from brands like Sony. I use these with synthesizers instruments various headphones amplifiers etc. You'll always find use for these bad boys & for the price why not pick up some extras.
5,Does the job and the connections are reliable. In long-term use others often corrode slightly and become unreliable; but not gold. All metal and short means hard to break.
5,Turns out it wasn’t what I needed so I gave them to my son in law who uses amps for his guitars and they work very well! He is pleased with them!
3,nothing special about these... good for the price... gets the job done
5,Used on keyboard
5,These are great at any price.
5,Needed it so I could plug into my guitar pedal with some headphones.  It does the trick.  Also works for my sound receiver so I can listen to the vinyl that I'm playing through it.  No issues and definitely gets the job done for me. I'm satisfied.
5,I realized a little while back that the reason my headphones plugged into my audio interface were cutting in and out was because of the adapter. I searched high and low for the best value (shipped) for an adapter like this and found these. These did the trick at a good price.
5,Just exactly what I needed for a good price.  I'm not a professional but my kids needed these for their piano lessons which are done on electric pianos and with covid had to bring their own headphones for group lessons.  I'm not really sure why they still refuse to put 3.5mm jacks on pianos but thats a different story.  These adapters work very well.
5,The product simply works. That is what makes it great.
4,It IS NOT compatible with beyerdynamic 990 pro or 770 pro (will not screw in) HOWEVER it does at least sort of lock onto the jack end so it won’t randomly disconnect with use. Also got stereo too
5,They work great on my audio amp.
5,It works recommend
5,Works very well
5,I lost mine and really needed it for a recording session and I got two for a good price and they work really well very happy with it
5,The sound quality is great! I also really liked how they gave you two as these can get lost easily.
5,I was given a sound system that wasn't up to date. I was able to use these and make the party!
5,It works as intended and it doesn't look like it'll have any vulnerabilities to immediate wear also.
5,Works like it's supposed to
5,These work well and fit the keyboard headphone jack so my kids don't disturb the whole house while they jam away on it.
5,We have two devices in our house that require this adapter. But we only had one adapter and sometimes we couldn't find it. So we purchased this small bunch of adaptors. Problem solved.They work perfectly.
5,These do the job! Sound is great!
4,Value for money. Not the best sound quality but for the purposes i was looking this was more than adequate
5,Needed this for my K Zed in ear monitors. Works as described. Get em’!
5,solid connection great conduction. been working for months.
5,I used it for my headphones. works great
5,Works well for my daughters amp
5,Sturdy construction.  Got here fast.
5,Works just like it should
5,Did the job and we'll made. Why pay more?
5,They do the thing they are designed to do
5,Is good for connectioning
5,Instant success. Beautiful.
5,Works as expected
5,As expected
5,It works... It does what it was purchased to do which is allow me to listen to 3.5mm jacked headphones on my Schiit Hel DAC/Amp.
4,I use these with an A/V receiver and wireless headphones.  Excellent sound quality and no problems.
4,Doesn’t need that much but hopefully it is worth it to keep extra ones.
5,I work at a commercial radio station in Greenville SC WFBC-FM. There are only a couple of headphones used in our business with any regularity. The really old folks use these 10 pound Koss headphones that are ludicrously heavy and have terrible earpieces that start to shrink and crumple. But they do sound good.All of us YOUNGUNS (Under 60 years old) tend to use Sony V-6 or some variant of those headphones. The Sony's have a weak link (besides that their earpieces start to shed black flakes and begin to fall apart after years of seven day a week use and abuse) and that is the headphone jack.Sony wanted to be able to plug these awesome headphones into a walkman or other portable music player back when they first started to become popular. So they gave the V6 and 7506 a 1/8th inch audio jack with a 1/4 inch jack - like the ones in this listing.They screw on - which is great and should mean that you never lose them. But... in a radio station where people show up late for their shift and for some reason did not bring their adapter a lot of "BORROWING" goes on and they tend to disappear. It is the subject of MANY arguments and fights over the years.Enter the Amazonbasics Gold Plated 6.35mm 1/4 Male to 3.5mm 1/8 Female Stereo Headphone Adapter - 5-Pack - for very little money you can ALWAYS have a spare adapter in your pocket. This is very valuable because it means that:A. You don't have to loan out your OEM screw on adapter;B. If you have been the subject of disappearing adapter syndrome you can quickly rectify the situation by popping one of these babies in and going on your merry way.The only downside being that you have lost the screw on capability.But that's where the review comes in:These Amazonbasics Gold Plated 6.35mm 1/4 Male to 3.5mm 1/8 Female Stereo Headphone Adapter - 5-Pack are excellent replacements for factory adapters and with five to a pack you should be able to economically afford to have plenty of extras for those times when you need them.I feel like King Solomon at the radio station when people start yelling about a lost or stolen adapter and I can just reach into my pocket and pull one of these out and offer it to the person who is upset about their missing adapter and they smile and the problem is solved. I'm even going to order some more. There aren't many opportunities to make people so happy for so little $ in life.The short version is this: These are great headphone adapters. They are plated in gold which should keep them from oxidizing and building up any unexpected resistance. They fit well and I have not noticed any sloppiness or unintended falling out. They are reasonably priced and fairly affordable. I would recommend them without reservation to my friends and family as a great replacement to the factory adapters that came with the headphones except that they do not have the screw on connection. But that isn't a big problem.If you have any other questions please reach out and I will try to answer them as quickly as possible. Thank you and I hope you found my review to be helpful.
1,Broke within 5 weeks of receiving
4,I needed some adapters to do a bit of studio recording. Hooking up synths and cassettes decks and all sorts of audio equipment together is common for me and I can never have enough adapters. These particular ones are not the absolute highest quality but they get the job done.Audio is quality is as good as you can get. In general unless you really truly screw up the manufacturing process any adapter will get the job done and no one will notice any difference in the signal passing through any adapter unless you're measuring with scientific equipment or something. So the best way to rate these are based on the build quality how well the connections work and the aesthetic appeal.The build quality on these is average. They claim to be gold plated and there's no reason to doubt this claim but they are very light and feel like they're made of mostly aluminum or a similarly light metal. This means that if they take a beating they may dent. That said you'd probably have to hit them pretty hard to damage them but it's not unheard of. I dented a quarter inch connecter on a Moog expression pedal that was made of similar material.The connection is solid. Any 3.5mm mono or stereo jack will fit snugly. A weird thing about these is that there seems to be threads on the inside but there aren't jacks in existence that would screw into the adapter because the threads are right where the jack plug is supposed to be secured. In any case the connection is solid and well fitted.They look nice too. They look like solid metal. It's only when you pick them up that you become slightly disappointed because they're much lighter than they look.Overall they're a good value considering that every adapter does the same job and buying the expensive stuff is really a waste of money.
5,I work full time as an audio engineer and teach audio at a local college and these are a great staple to buy if you're in a studio! With headphones for example pro gear often comes with 1/4 inch headphone jacks whereas our laptops etc come with 1/8 inch headphone jacks. So we often need adapters like this to bring our headphones back and forth between the two. I have to get these fairly frequently because with students and clients coming and going through the studio these tend to accidentally walk away.I look for two main things when purchasing these adapters and these check both boxes:1. It's important to know that the two lines on these make them TRS which means they're stereo so they're good to use with stereo headphones and a stereo signal.and:2. Some adapters like this are made to fit threaded headphones/devices (see photos I have the end of a pair of headphones with the ability to use a screw on adapter in there). It seems like this would be good since it might avoid the adapter falling off and running away but I find that's rarely the case. The snap-on adapters like these don't seem to fall off and you can use them on threaded devices like I have pictured here. However you can't use the screw on adapters on many standard devices (ones without the threading). So I avoid the threaded adapters because I can't use them with all my devices. Ones like these are much more versatile.Overall these are a great staple they're reliable and seem to be well made. Would definitely recommend!
4,While the 1/8” mini plug has largely become the standard for analog connections in portable audio gear there are still occasions when you need to convert between 1/8” and 1/4”. Case in point: the other day I wanted to connect the audio output of my iPad (1/8”) into the AUX input of my Roland cube 30 guitar amp (1/4”). What to do? I didn’t have a 1/8” to 1/4” stereo cable. One of these would have allowed me to adapt a 1/8” cable.These plugs aren’t exactly audiophile quality- finish is a bit rough and they have the thinnest gold plating I’ve ever seen not that it makes a difference in sound. But they do work and with 5 in your kit you should manage to hang on to one or two for many years or at least until the next audio interconnect format comes along.

5,I am always either giving away or losing this type of adapter piece. It's the kind of part that i always think i have more than i do so i make myself order these often and in a multi pack option.Amazonbasics has done it in again in relation to musical equipment and accessories with this reliable gold plated 6.35 to 3.5 end adapter. I am very happy with this and for several reason. First it fits snug into the areas i tried it out such as a mixer which is shown in one of the the photos i included. I also used it to connect to a quarter inch to 3.5 cable - adding the end piece to form a guitar type of cable that has the 2 quarter inch ends.When using it as an adapter that has a quarter inch ends already you need a sturdy and well made piece such as this one so it does not jiggle around hence causing static or other interference.In conclusion this is a great cable that stands the test of time and usage. I recommend it.
5,These work very well I got the 5 pack so I'd have some extras. They are a bit pricey but well worth. Amazon Basics is some of the most well priced things you can buy!
5,I like that Amazon has its AmazonBasics brand and that it has moved into the audio/music category - most of us musicians are generally lacking in the funding department so any help is sometimes necessary. Even things like these simple adapters make it easier for us with such a value and good functionality. I use Tascam headphones for monitoring when I am recording and they have a 3.5mm (1/8”) jack. This adapter allows me to use my beloved Tascam headphones with my Zoom L-12 board. Having several of these adapters is also nice because many in-ear monitors have 3.5mm jacks just like my Westones but the input of many personal monitoring systems is 1/4” (why do they do that?) - so you have to either have a cord that adapts to both ends or an adapter. I think adapters are often the best option because cords so easily break. This is highly recommended.
5,I had been looking for a headphone jack adapter and decided to give this a try!  I am glad that I did.  Here's what I like about it:- It works!  I have a large speaker that accepts the larger audio adapter (1/4") but not the smaller type (that you used with headphones).  With this adapter I can easily send music from my cell phone to the speaker!- Seems to be high-quality and well-built with a solid feel to it.- Five adapters are included so if you accidentally lose one here and there it's not a huge crisis.Overall I am very pleased!  :-)
4,What can I say this product does exactly what it's intended to do. The connection between the 3.5 mm headphone into the adapter feels secure and never left me worrying about loose connections. A good buy that does what you expect from this type of product.
5,I have a set of Tascam TH-200X headphones but I misplaced the screw-on adapter that came with it.  It'll turn up in a box somewhere or under a piece of furniture.  These don't screw on like that one did but they still fit and function as advertised.  The description erroneously says that it's a 1/4" to 1/8" adapter with the latter being the plug but this is reversed.  The listing for this 5-pack was taken down so I can't report this error.  I actually just noticed it right before writing this review having gone by the photos to select this 5-pk.  The photos are correct though.
4,Basically packaged for a basic product. No money spent on fancy packing.  Just the  product fully functional and just as shown.  Good product for the price
4,These adapters seem durable like they will last. A must have in a studio; well built and no scratchy audio or metal tarnishing evident (oxidation). Will probably last awhile; pretty common item. Nothing stands out as an issue with them.
5,We use the adapters in our home studio in which there are a lot of devices and wires headphones and mics. and sometimes we need a bit of help getting an old connection or mismatched wires to match. it's helpful to have some extra "bits and bobs" on hand to help with this. A quick test and these "matured" headphones are able to plug into a MOTU M2 2x2 USB-C Audio Interface from Amazon. Would definitely recommend.
5,If you're like me you probably have numerous headphone sets for various uses. The problem comes when you need a 6.35mm plug for a stereo or if you're a musician your Focusrite or studio interface. This is your easy and affordable fix. These gold adapters snap-in snug and secure and there is no sound quality loss or crackling.These appear to be durable. The last set we had have lasted a long time and I suspect these will too.Overall a good product for a nominal price.
5,Great! We finally have a solution for the nuisance of our desktop computer headphones situation. It used to be that to plug in or take out headphones one had to spin or tip over the monitor and plug them in at the back (kids are pretty terrible at this sort of maneuver) but now we can plug them in at the front of the stereo without any peril to the monitor! Yeay!
4,These are well-made and very handy to have around if you work with audio equipment. I tested each adapter and they all worked properly. No complaints.
5,They work they do what they are supposed to do I use these on a soundboard at my church to convert a 1/8 inch audio plug item to a 1/4 inch audio I have them setting next to the soundboard for when they are needed.
5,Simple to use and work great. These stereo headphones were just what I needed for a fraction of the price of other brands. Highly recommend
5,Amazon Basics gold plated ¼ male to 1/8 female audio line adapters are all metal gold plated professional quality plugs that can be used to connect the common smaller adapters to a variety of older and higher end audio equipment. I was extremely pleased with the quality of these adapters. Recommended for the best quality sound.
5,These are exactly what you'd expect 3.5mm to 1/4in stereo adapters. They snap on and off satisfyingly and tightly but not too tight and feel/look well built - no overly sharp corners or casting lines.The packaging is simple and wastes very little. There's nothing bad I can say about these; they're simple devices but they get the job done perfectly.
5,Excellent headphone adapters because the jack area is flat so any 3.5mm plug will fit. Some have the jack recessed with threads to fit certain brands but these will work with all. AmazonBasics audio and video cables and adapters are really well made especially the DVI and HDMI cables.
5,This plugs into my stereo receiver so that I can plug in a standard 3.5mm headphone jack Bluetooth transmitter and listen to my TV with Bluetooth headphones.  Sound quality is great.  Highly recommend.
5,For a low costs these were a life saver. Used a different microphone with mandolin kalimba and open pick-up on sweet potato. Got a better microphone and things sort of changed but these will still come in handy!
5,These adapters feel very well made and sturdy. I did not have any issues using them and the connection was perfect.There isn't really anything to complain about. Does what I need and works perfectly.
5,These have worked flawlessly. Secure fit easy to connect and clear sound.
5,We have a keyboard that only has the big hole for the sound output.  We wanted to plug in regular headphones.  This worked perfectly.  The quality was just fine for what we needed.
5,I would recommend. Good quality product
5,Does the jorb as expected
5,Had no issues with either one. Adapters fit nicely.
5,The Adaptation is superb!
5,If your headphones fit in your cellphone or computer (3.5mm or 1/8")  and you want to use them in your audio interface (1/4") this is exactly what you need. If your headphones have a mic and the cable is a single TRRS connector this will still work too.
5,Nothing much to say does the job
5,I lost my extension plug and these work just great with my headphones. Great sound as well.
5,I have bought several of these over the years and they hold up well. I have not had any connection or noise issues.
