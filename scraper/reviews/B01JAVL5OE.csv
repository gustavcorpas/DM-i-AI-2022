5,I used it to upgrade my home from the older CAT5. this is copper and not the Copper Clad Aluminum (CCA)  which people should stay away from IMHO
5,I have used this cable for security cameras. The length at times has been right at 300‚Äô with no issues. The conductors are good quality and size they fit well in the slide through connectors.
5,I just ran 2000ft of this in my house. The cable is very sturdy but flexible enough to bend around when needed. I kept bends to loose 90s or less and had no issues. It pulled very easily through the walls including walls with insulation. I used stud J hooks in the attic and cable pulled over it easily as well. I never terminated with keystones before but did them at both ends and was easy enough once I practiced on a couple with spare wire first. Overall highly recommended although the price seems a bit high. I would not use this to make patch cables as it is solid copper and not flexible enough for most applications.
3,This is great cable for the money.  Well worth a few bucks more than cheapo brands with broken English in the description.  Trust me those cables are going to be just as terrible as you think.  This cable is better than Tripp Lite Belkin and many other more known brands.  Way better than monoprice and you-never-heard-of-it brands.Now on to the bad news.  For some beancounter or unknown reason they started attempting to send these via USPS.  They will be about 50% on successful delivery.  No really!  If you need 4 boxes for a job order 8 because 4 won't show up or will be damaged beyond use.  Nobody thats shipped something important before would think USPS could handle a box like this.Once you get a good box or if you are lucky enough to get it delivered by Amazon directly you will love TrueCable products but you don't get 5 stars with boneheaded shipping decisions.  I picked a Prime item because i need it ASAP and nobody thinks of the post office when they think ASAP...
5,Good quality product. Easy to handle and work with. Markings showing feet of length every 2 ft.--handy feature for measuring.
5,BLUF: This is really good cable and it installs well. It is durable and the copper is decent (i.e. not super soft or thin for its rating). Thank you....
5,If you want true SOLID cable this is it....but expect box of 1000ft to be HEAVY. Is what it is but worth the struggle. :)
5,Our company TECHPROSOFT Technology Services does a lot of Networking and Cybersecurity and test all kinds of products. Compared to most of the other brand Cat 6 we use this product is amazingly superior to most: sturdy doesn‚Äôt get tangled up and super easy to terminate since the wires are solid. We highly recommend this product!
5,Well let me start with how good the quality of the cable is : Pure Cooper Good inner core and cladding Jacket strength is impeccable.Overall impressive!Little pricy thoüòè
5,I am certainly no networking professional and I have very little ability with electronics but I have a better than average understanding of computeres.  We recently combined several townhouses to make one large house and we needed a way to get a good internet signal throughout 6500 square feet so while the contractors worked on opening up the walls and combining the townhouses I used this cable to do 4 runs from my router to Ubiquiti Wi-Fi antennas  (which are great by the way).  I taught myself how to put the  ends on the CAT-6 cable (see I'm such an amateur I don't even know what they're called) and using this cable I managed to create an excellent wi-fi signal through the  entire fairly large house.  While I am not a pro I did rely on the many pros that have posted reviews about the many many different types of CAT6 cable available which led me to this particular cable.  It's certainly not the cheaperst but it's also not the most expensiver and it suited my purposes perfectly (as evidenced by a household full of wifi usesrs that so far have no complaints).
4,***UPDATE (6/2020)***I'm lowering this to 4 stars because of stock issues. It's one thing if the problem were covid-related but I had been having stock and ordering problems before that hit. I order this cable all the time and still love it but unfortunately I don't have much lead time for my jobs which requires me to use Prime shipping for any cable I order. This cable goes in and out of Prime availability all the time with some or all of them losing Prime shipping options.The other stock issue I've had is sort of a silly one. My favorite color is the purple cable. I like that it's unique and makes my wire stand out among the rest of the house wiring. But that color is only available about a third of the time. And not just sold out either they completely remove it from this listing. It's annoying.I hope they fix their stock and Prime issues because this cable really is the best. I've had to switch to the shielded version of this cable but it's another $50 more the cable is thicker and harder to work with.***ORIGINAL REVIEW (sometime 2019?)I run low voltage for new homes and office build-outs. This cable has been a pleasure to work with! I ran 500' in a new home yesterday and didn't have a single kink.
5,Great Price & Delivery Method
5,Good quality for video over IP installs.
4,It's a great price only issue is some of the twisted pairs are more twisted than others.  Honestly it probably deserves 5 stars at the price.  Works well no issues.
5,I used all 1000 ft over the course of 4 days to wire up my house.  It didn't get tangled and pulling 6 cables through a 3/4 in drilled hole in the attic went smoothly.  It was a lot of work and the attic was cramped but was well worth the effort after all was said and done.
5,Nice product good color choice
5,I got a quote for a company to install a wired Cat6 network in my house. I only wanted 3 total drops. $2600. I said nope - will learn and do it myself. Since I have a 1GB internet connection I wanted a network that could utilize it. I settled on this cable after some quick research. I completed the 3 drops using a total of about 250ft of cable and didn't have a single fault within any of that cable. All the wired connections are delivering 850MB/s+ so all in all I'm really happy with this cable!
5,Ran cable from 2nd floor router down to my basement. I was not sure the exact length so went with the box. Used just under 100ft but well worth it. The stuff solid core cable is not as flexible. Running the cable outside of the house make it easier to keep up with the with home internet as available speed keeps going up. With my 1 gb speed service I am getting just over 980mbs via ookla and speedtest. The marking of length on the cable itself is super helpful.
5,Give that person a raise.  It was EXTREMELY helpful when lining a commercial building 70X42 ft. long.Novice cable cutter here.  After going down a sizeable rabbit hole installing security cameras I came across the cable and decided to go for it.  Could not be happier.  By getting the bulk length it made for an educational process without worrying about whether I'd run out of cable or not.  Just always be sure to have your cable wires lined correctly and seated properly!  I bought a cable tester just to double check.  And also be careful of not tearing or ripping cable otherwise it is a great product.
5,I bought this product mainly because I wanted the green color to separate my computer wiring from my video surveillance wiring. When it arrived we installed it the next day. The cable is pretty flexible compared to some of the other CAT6 cables I've used. The ez payout box worked great with no tangles at all! Termination was a breeze and the wire stripped easily and cleanly.
5,Delivered as advertised.  Wire has plastic spleen in center to separate the 4 pairs and a rip cord.  Hugeeee ++++ is that they placed a SQUARE MARKER every two feet on the cable where the specs are.  This is great when measuring the distance of the runs you need to make.  Image of cable showing 4 pairs rip cord and inner spline.WELL BUILT !Hope this Helps !
5,This works well but I have to replace it with shielded outdoor-rated cable. By my own mistake I wasn't careful about these 2 when I bought it. However it works fine. Don't know how long it would last with outdoor use in cold conditions. I like the fact that the cable is marked at 2 feet intervals which is quite helpful. It is is a pain to actually measure them; so this labelling is clearly praiseworthy. I have indoor cabling with this too and it works flawlessly.
5,Granted I've only used 2 boxes of CAT6 (I just run my own lines at home) but this cable is so much better than the first one I had. I needed to run a temporary line from my office where my telecom rack is to the middle of the basement. Not thinking about it I set the box in my office chair and started walking the line out. The last box I had would have pulled the chair across the room and through the door but this stuff (with a wide exit hole) didn't even budge the chair. Additionally crimping it was easier than the other stuff too. I found my new favorite CAT6 Supplier. I will be returning for the CAT7 I need later!
5,Worked right out of the box with no Knicks or shorts.
5,I recently wired an office with this cable.  This is solid copper wire.  The cable was great.  My only negative report was the rip cord didn't really cut the outer casing easily but this might just be that I am not as strong as I used to be.  At the end of the day it didn't matter that the rip cord didn't actually rip so I didn't bother deducting any stars.  For the price this is great cat6 cableand I would use it again.
5,This is the first bulk cable I‚Äôve purchased and very happy with the quality. Very easy to use and very well marked cable which shows how much left in the box.I would definitely recommend others to buy this product and I‚Äôll buy again when needed.
5,This is my second 1000ft spool from TrueCable and once again I'm really impressed with the quality. The last spool I bought was direct burial and I ran 3-400ft of it for 3 PoE cams and that's been solid for over a year. I just used 350ft of this CMR spool for 4 PoE cams and no trouble so far. Pulls easily feels good in the hands. Terminating splined CMR with RJ45 connectors is kind of a pain maybe there's a trick but this is probably common with all splined cable.
5,I install a lot of cameras and PTP radios. I like True Cable because I don't have to worry about whether the cable will be able to handle the job. Whether it's POE or just data I use this cable because it is solid copper and not copper coated aluminium. I don't trust the other stuff. It may be easier to crimp an end on but to carry 12-24 volts DC I want my customers to not have to worry about the the product I install. That's just peace of mind for an contractor.
5,I bought 2 boxes (1000ft) because the quality of the cables looks and feels really good and most of after installing all the wall drops I tested every single port and I get my speeds.
5,We're getting ready for AT&T fiber and I'm replacing the CAT 5e cable to this CAT 6. I spent a lot of time considering CCA or full copper wire and decided to spend the money and not worry about getting the benefits of the 1 G Fiber to the home.The thicker wire gauge and the internal plastic wire separator makes this cable bundle a little thicker - but we are very pleased with the connectivity CAT6 features and the PoE power capability (important for PoE phones and cameras).With all the time spent re-pulling wire - the extra cost for full copper seems very small at this point. I'm happy we decided to re-wire with this cable.
5,Easy to work with but I suggest getting the correct wire gauge RJ45 ends. I was trying to use a smaller size and it wasn‚Äôt easy! Once we got the right size it was super easy!
5,I purchased this cable to add Ethernet wiring in the house as part of an addition we were doing.  I also took the opportunity to upgrade our CAT 5e to CAT 6 in the entire house.  I ended up pulling around 11 lines to various locations in the house using quite a portion of the 1000 ft roll.  I used some to make shorter cables to connect up the computer server router switches etc.  Everything seems to work very well and there is a noticeable speed improvement moving data around.  I'm very satisfied with the price and performance.
5,Muy buena calidad y perfecto la primera vez que hago una instalacion de camaras de seguridad en el peque√±o negocio y todo trajo muy bien al finalizar.
5,Ok product. The box needs to have tape put on the area that opens to get access to wire. The box was not closed and the wire was hanging out and which caused some issues getting wire out of the pull hole. Please put tape on box to prevent wire from bunching up.
5,Like other reviewers I ended up buying this after having to return multiple cheaper options that were listed as 23 AWG Cat 6 but were 24 AWG (or even Cat 6 twist) when arrived.This is the real thing solid copper micrometer measured just under 23 AWG (I'll give them the benefit of a doubt from deformation during untwisting) and looks like the correct twist rate (I didn't measure that).  Cable is actually marked unlike some no-names.This is even cheaper by the foot than one of the no-name unmarked fake 23 AWG I had to return.
5,I purchased this cable (purchased a total of 3 boxes) to run Cat6 through my new house during the build process and to make my own patch cables. I have tested every connection (26 total runs) and all have tested at 1 Gb through my switch and patch panel with no errors. Most runs were under 50' but there are a few that run nearly 100' and I have had no issues so far. I did not run anything external to my house so all of these are through the attic/walls of a house built in 2018.
5,Very nicely made cat6 cabling. Easy to work with and the cables are separated nicely and of high quality.
5,Received in a timely manner and was well packaged.  Both things you come to expect from Amazon.As for the cable it panned out of the box perfectly w/o a single snag.  Ive run cable for years ranging from 2 pair to cat5e....cables always snag up in the box.  This is the first box of wire not to.Highly recommend!
5,This was exactly what I wanted for a good price.  Building a house and wanted to run cables for internet and security cameras.  This was received timely and was easy to run straight from the box.
5,I needed to run some cat6 up through newly finished construction.  Through inside walls attic and soffits.  Worked great.  No breaks.  Signal quality and PoE impedance was excellent.
5,Ran this CAT6 though our entire house.  12 Ethernet ports in total.  After all punch downs were completed every connection was solid and fast.  Very satisfied with this purchase and will look to trueCABLE again if the need ever arises in the future.
5,Great cable with a good feel and smooth feed box. Excellent value - beating many other manufacturers while still maintaining quality.I will update this review after I've finished my install but so far it's been great!The only con I've seen was that the plastic ring that helps aid in feeding out the cable was not installed in the box when I received it (though shipping my have dislodged it). The box also seemed a little flimsy until I added some packing tape to hold it better in shape.
5,It is easy to pull and not too stiff. So far it gets the expected network speed.
5,Flexible 23 AWG comes in multiple colors.  Most importantly (for me) - foot markers every 2ft.
5,I just ran this cable a new house construction and it seems to be great cable. Feels good and durable and not the cheap aluminum clad that is flimsy and breaks.Very nice
5,I fitted a 1700s church with this cable running through 2 modern buildings. We had no issues the product is of good quality and is worth the extra money
4,Ok
5,This cable is easy to work with as it has a braided reinforcement inside rather than single strands. The single strands are hard on the skin as it is usually fiberglass which is picky. This product does not contain that crap so it is much nicer to work with.  Being a bit more solid makes it easier to fish
5,The biggest hassle with any cable is twists and resulting kinks.  I pulled this cable for 16 runs through my home without a hitch.
5,Don't change a thing and keep this quality cable available to your customers! Surprising how many cheap and junk options are available. This is great cable and for the price... can't be beat. Let's hope that "make it cheaper and raise the price" is not in  this companies plans. It would be a real shame.
5,Works as intended. I am getting the speeds I hoped for without a problem over medium length runs (100-150 feet).
5,Comes out super easy easy into the clips/keystones just great! I would warn anyone who wants to make a bunch of short frequent use cables this is solid and not stranded cable so it's best for wiring stuff into walls and what not and leaving it be. That said I've come across no dead zones no cheap knockoff crap and Cat6 speed/reliability. There's just no reason to pay more when the quality is as good as can be with this.
5,Need a good quality Cat6 for my camera system
5,No Headaches No Frills No Issues.. It just works and works well. Pulls easy from the box and has a good cable twist center divider and pull string.I've used half the spool so far and haven't encountered any issues. I fluke tested all my terminations and have yet to see any issues. Should last a long time
5,I have made 3 runs (60 40 and 40 ft) with this cable going through walls and vertically. Pulled with no issues or damage to jacket.Cable is a little thicker than previous older Cat6 but still fit in pass-through connectors (rated for 23AWG).
5,First let me say I bought another brand and had to send it back.  When this cable came in I noticed it came off the spool with ease.  The sheath is tight and strong.  It has a nylon thread that makes stripping it back smooth and easy.  I had no problems attaching RJ45 connectors.  End of story it works great and I would buy it again.
4,If I had to do it again I'd have just got the 5e. way cheaper and realistically I'll not need the cat6 for my use case.  It's a bit more difficult to wire these with rj-45 clips because you have to cut away the insulation that runs down the center.
5,Cable looks great on visual appearance. Since current installation is not ready for actual certification testing I cannot rate actual field performance.  I have seen nothing that would give me any concern.  I like that it is full 23 AWG not the thinner wire often sold as Cat 6.  I will be buying more.
5,Was exactly what was in the description of the wire.
5,Way better than generic blue cat6 sold at home depot.  Getting the other cat6 to negotiate to 1000FDX on my switch was rare this stuff fixed that issue on the first pass.
5,Does what it's supposed to. Good quality solid copper pairs. My only complaint is that the box is prone to opening so I tend to slap some duct tape where the flaps join and have no issues. Ran several thousand feet with a lot of runs with multiple 90 degree turns with no snags from the box. Great CMR cable for the money.
5,Fantastic cable high speed low latency. Overall it performs well!
5,Good quality.. very pleased
5,We had to rewire our offices. Getting VOIP and needed to separate the internal office network from the phone system. We debated on buying the alum cable clad with copper (it was cheaper) but after reading reviews we decided we would be money ahead on buying this product. So far we are satisfied with our results
5,Running this through my house and haven‚Äôt had a bad stretch yet. We‚Äôll see over time. Great cable!
4,Easy to pull out of box. Cable is flexible and easy to use. 100% copper.
5,Bought this to wire up all of the ‚Äúneed for speed‚Äù devices. Easy to pull and great wire. Got 996Mbps on gig service!!!
5,The product rolled out without any problems..
5,Great Cable pulled easily stripped easily just make sure you know how to strip wires so you don't cut through the copper too.  I used ITBEBE Gold-Plated Pass Through RJ45 Cat6 3-Prong Connectors and Cable Strain Relief Kit to terminate and they worked great.
5,I have ordered 2.5 boxes of this stuff.  Have half of it used.  I keep it at various sites that I work at.  The quality is outstanding on it.  It actually feels like it's a higher quality than some of my outdoor wiring that I have.
5,Recommended.
5,I don‚Äôt have a $5000 Fluke to do proper testing but it looks and feels like good quality cable. Crimps well plastic separator and rip cord are present. Colors on individual cables are nice and bright easy to tell apart. I‚Äôm happy with this purchase.
5,High quality excellent materials.
5,Shipment came on time.  Quality of the cable looks to be very good.  The box allows for easy pull of the cable.Still to early to know the quality of the signal through the cable.... but I‚Äôm very hopeful.
5,Good quality cord and the value is great since it is a large roll!
5,Ordered the same CAT6 product in BLUE and YELLOW; however the yellow pulled without a kink in it and never showed twisting. I haven‚Äôt terminated the ends which will be the real test of its value.
5,Easy to pull out of the box. Rip cord works great. This cable was shipped within the estimated time and came as described without any damage. Very happy with overall experience and will be ordering from them again when I need more.
5,Ran over 1500 ft worth of cable in my home with no bad drops.  Cable is well made and color markings are bold and easily distinguishable.  Trust rates seem accurate and sturdy.  Solid copper for sure.  Cables long over 1gb on home network.
5,The important fact to note is this is solid copper cable providing us the best connectivity for our purpose.  If you want cheaper you probably are not getting solid copper.  For us it didn't make sense to run 10000 ft of wire if it wasn't solid copper.
5,In fact I asked my engineer to compare with other brand since the price higher the engineer insists for this model since it is softer than others it is much easy to work on cables. It is why I purchase again
5,Excellent product.  New wiring job to add two new data ports to 6 offices.  Product works as expected on a long run that is even a few feet longer then recommended.  Service is still excellent at the extended length.
5,The cable arrived quickly and is everything as described in product description. Very nice quality & it rolls out of the box extremely well! I would like to see this company offer indoor cat6 at well and maybe in smaller quantities. Many Thanks!
5,I really like this cable. I have used cables from around 8-9 different manufacturers. This seems to have been my go-to for a lot of the networking I do. I haven't had any issues with it yet.
5,The main challenge with running long lengths of wound up cable is it keeps curling on itself making it hard to pull. This true Cable dispensing box works really well at straightening out the cable when you pull it out.
5,Good quality cable. I use this extensively at a factory for their networking. Have not had any problems with it.
4,Cable Quality is Excellent!  It's very easy to work with and terminate.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the box is a little flimsy!
5,I just bought a new house and a first project was to get Cat6 distributed through the house.Happy with this cable felt like a good value and gave me plenty for my project
5,I recently wired the entire house for a home network. I got this wire based on the good reviews and it did not disappoint. Built with high quality materials strong easy to work with overall a good product.
5,True solid conductor cable.  It is the best.
5,The cable/box is sturdy and actually more convenient to use than other boxes i have used. Didn't expect the plastic divider within the covering but it does make it very sturdy and not easy to accidentally twist bend etc.
5,Great quality cat6 reminder that now all cat6 are created equal very happy with this
5,I bought this product to rewire our church. Our system had been pieced together through a number of expansions and we wanted to rewire the whole system. This product fit our needs both in cost and quality.
5,Used product for a small business project and worked great.
5,This cable is top A-1 quality.  So happy I did not go with the less expensive stuff.  Only want to do this job once.
5,We ran 1000+ feet of this wire for a camera system.  Had no troubles with any of it and all is still up and running with no issues.
5,Cable held up great during install and after. Connection continues solid.
5,this is what I needed! I am using this for camera wire enter net wire and believe it or not for running cable or hdmi video. in my house. love it! saves time and headache!
5,It's 1000ft of pink Cat6. It's all I could ask for.
5,Strong cable and easy to pull. Also had the distance remaining on the cable. No foil shielding  but didn't need for this application
5,Seems to work solid connection. We'll see if the other runs work out. Fit into the cat6 plugs snug looks about right.
5,Just pulled a couple of runs and it never kinked. Also punched easily into 110 blocks.
5,Best Cat 6 cable all the way around!
5,Liked the quality ease of use and good price.
5,Great price for quality wire. Insulation is decent. Plastic divider and full copper. Getting gigabit speeds and I have more wire left over than I know what to do with.
5,I wired up my house and made loads of cables for my office and all around the house. Never tangled always smooth out of the box great speeds everything worked great.
5,Arrived timely.  Box wasn't too heavy to handle.  Cable seems to work accordingly and is exactly what we ordered.
5,I installed one box for rooms and for POE cameras. So far all is working great. No issues installing I have purchased a second box to finish.
5,Good Cat 6 cable
5,I pulled 600 ft for PoE cameras and couldn‚Äôt be happier with the quality of the cable or the ease of tangle free pulling out of the box
5,Made my CAT 6 cables using the latest tools for CAT 6.
5,I have run several 100-foot lengths in my home; works great no problems with performance or attachment of cat-6 RJ-45 connectors.  Would buy again.
5,Liked the price and fast shipping. Using it for security camera system time will tell how good the cable is.
5,one of the best cable to use for inwall run.
5,Good cable.
5,The cable is super easy to work with. Much better than the ones from lowes!
5,Works great easy pulling
5,Excellent speeds.  This is the real deal.  None of that aluminum junk.  Its worht the extra money.
5,Great cable. Getting Gigabit speeds in my internal network on my fiber Internet connection across long cable runs in my house.
5,Cable was high quality and what I expected. Good buy
5,Cable is dispensed nicely.  No tangled or bound wires.  Found all wire to be of great quality.
5,Just started working with it. will need more time to determine longevity. Looks like good quality and pulls easy from container.
5,Pulls easily from the box and feels like good quality cable. Haven't made any connections or hooked anything up yet.
5,Very good quality cable.
5,Just pulled 6 boxes pulled really easy.  Can't  speak to quality but seems like good stuff.  So far I would definitely buy again.
4,Cable arrived on time and was everything expected of a box if Cat6 cable
5,Great product cheaper than everywhere else you can find. Worked perfect for the stuff I did in my house. Great and fast delivery.
5,new security camera system
5,Nice cable no issue so far with operation. Seemed to be built in good quality. I'm happy with the purchase.
5,Great cables top of the line. Would recommend for commercial or home.
5,Just installed it today good quality wire for a good price. Would purchase from them again in the future
5,Good cable for the price. I install networks in high end residential occupancies. I will buy this product again.
5,High quality product...perfect for all ethernet requirements.
5,Great product. Exactly as described. Just what i needed for my project in my house.
5,Great cable and easy to work with.  Hopefully it last as long as the quality looks.
5,Pulls good directly from box.
5,Good quality!
5,Over 12 boxes purchased never a single issue. Pulls smooth no kinks or tangles. Terminates easily.
5,Worked great!
5,Price was right shipping was lightning fast.  Will buy more cable from them in the future.

5,great
5,Awesome
5,Works great!
5,thanks.
1,Had to buy  another box because about 2/3 of the way through the box mid run a large piece of jacket was missing......
5,No kinks when pulling the cable.  Everything ran at 1 gig when terminated.
1,After running all 10 box‚Äôs and then testing the cable they cert tester says it‚Äôs cat5 customer made me rerun all the lines with different wire
1,Was reviewing the cable with a network installer & the internal wires are thinner & lighter weight than other Cat 6 cables on the market.
1,multi point short circuit in the middle of the wire. Waste my material and time.Needs to use short circuit finder to locate the short circuit or open circuit location .
1,I tossed the whole 1000 ft. Something was seriously wrong with the brown wire tensile strength.
5,The cable is awesome. It weighs more than the standard CCA type of cable but that's ok. It is very easy to pull out of the box. I did not have any kinks in it with the initial length of cable. Other CAT6 cable that I have purchased (the CCA type) have been difficult to pull from the box causing sharp bends and kinks in the cable which resulted in me wasting cable. This cable was much easier to pull and work with.It appears to be a high quality cable and works great for me. I had been having network issues with another brand of CAT6. I was only getting a 100 Mbps connection instead of a 1 Gbps connection. I removed the old cable and pulled this new cable and a solid 1 Gbps connection and what appears to be better performance.I used to skimp and buy the cheaper cable but that bit me in the butt now. I spent less but had a TON of headaches with the cheaper quality cable. I'm sold on buying higher quality cable now and will be purchasing more trueCABLE branded cable in the future if I need more than my 1000ft spool.
5,Not only do the TrueCable guys offer great products at good prices but their customer service is terrific.  UPS did what UPS dose and lost a package.  John from TrueCable was all over it and worked with UPS to open a claim and replaced my package.  Great communication and really help solve my frustrations with the shipper.  Definitely recommend this one stop shop.  Thanks again!
5,High quality. High recommend.
5,This cable very strong and easy to work with.  The colors are very distinguishable from one another.
5,Exactly as advertised. Pull through no coiling up after.
2,This wire is not UL listed. In the amazon description it is but its not on the box or wire jacket.
5,Great quality cable especially for the price and delivered to my door! I have been adding security cameras around my property and this cable is easy to handle and maneuver in tight spaces. It‚Äôs ‚Äúfluke tested‚Äù and I have not had any issues with the signal or throughput.I‚Äôll be purchasing more in the different colors but I wanted to make sure it was good quality so I only purchased one box which is plenty of cable for most jobs. I like to use different colors for my networks so I‚Äôll be getting these in every color!
5,I haven't done any testing on the data speed and it's length threshold but feels like a solid cable and fits my needs perfectly.
5,Excellent product and vendor.  Have used them many times.
5,Good
5,Great price! Fast shipping!!! Thank you!
5,Used to install cameras
5,No substantial drop in data transfer speeds over my 125' run. Cable is difficult to maneuver due to it being solid core. That's normal! It can still bend and make turns but just be aware that it *can* be more difficult than using a non-solid core. Solid cable all around! I'll be buying more should I run out of my last 300'.
5,I updated my home wiring for CAT6 capability and completed about 300' of wiring.  Pulling the cable from the box was really easy with no hang-ups.  The quality and consistency of the wires as well as shielding was top notch.  Adding connectors was not a problem as I successfully tested the wire continuity and ethernet connectivity working without any issues.  I would recommend this CAT6 cable as reliable and with excellent build quality.I will update this review after I complete 500' more of my CAT6 home wiring project.
5,The best thing I love about this product is the way it‚Äôs package that it will not tangle when pulling the cable. There‚Äôs no effort while pulling it. I‚Äôve had plenty of bulk cable that gets all tangled up in the box and it just sucks to untangle. And the last thing you want to do in a hot attic is untangling cable.The construction of the cable is high quality.It is Solid Copper Construction and not CCA.
5,This cable is exactly what it is supposed to be
5,Very timely delivery. Needed quickly for job.  Good cable.  Good value
5,I've gone thru several "Cat6" cables - the cheaper stuff on here - 24AWG usually. Southwire (which should be the best) has no seperator but I think it may make up for this with extra-thick wire insulation but makes for a high percentage of failed crimps with needed staggered connectors for the thick insulation.I was pleased to find a cable that meets the TRUE CAT6 spec - seperator true 23AWG gauge. I guaged the wire and it is infact 23AWG just a hair under. The colors are clear the twist rate is spot on and it works correctly with every connector i've tried it with. It's also rated up to Cat6a bandwidth which is a nice addition so it's good stuff.
5,It was absolutely the best spool of wire that I have ever worked with!
5,Very good cable
5,Yet to use it at first glance the cable appears of good quality.
5,Quality cable with high visibility markings. Significantly better than what you get retail at the box stores and not much more cost. Absolutely worth it. I bought a box to swap out some cat 6 as a result of the rack being moved. I used the existing cat6 wire to pull through the new trucable and the difference in quality was immediately obvious.
5,Quality Network Cabling...Cable Team loved it
5,I ran about 15 lines long-distance lines in my house all worked without a hitch - great cable!
5,Wanted to increase speed of my WiFi connection - currently 100 mbpsFios informed me the only way to do this is to run a Cat 5/6 line from the box to the router.The problem .... my router is on another floor of my house and needs to run one Fios "One" box- so moving it is not a solution.I was quoted by a contractor $2000 to run 1000 ft through walls and ceilings to the router.I purchased a Cat 6 line from Amazon and my son and I ran the line for the cost of the line ($180)The tech came back and installed ethernet connections and switched to ethernet connection-now I am enjoying 1G from 100mbsp WiFi.The Tech also informed me the next generation of routers will only work with ethernet connection -due largely impart of Fios conversion to 5G.
5,My current supplier for wire is SnapAV but I was looking for other options and came across this brand. I really like wire and think it compares favorably to SnapAV. On one point though I would like to see an improvement. If you look at the wire(see picture) you can see that the white/colors can be quite hard to tell apart vs SnapAV which had a colored line swirl around so as to always be visible from all sides. Pls implement an improvement in this regard.
5,Solid copper and seems to be very good quality.  The copper is very tolerate bending a single wire 180 degrees 34 times or more before it breaks. So there should be zero concern for being brittle. I would have no issues buying and using again.
