5,I‚Äôve been so frustrated with the high cost of ink cartridges for my Canon printer.  I finally decided to give an ‚Äúoff brand@ a try and am so glad I did.  The cartridge pack was much cheaper and the quality is just as good. I‚Äôll be buying more for sure.
5,I received the product very quickly the cost was 1/2 what I priced at a local retail store and my documents print clearly whether for color or black and white. It is excellent quality with low cost and speedy delivery.  I will definitely use this vendor for my future printer ink.
5,I was skeptical about buying ink that was not named Canon. I tried it and I am very happy. So much more affordable than the name brand ink.

3,Read the product description very carefully.  Although similar packaging these ink replacement cartridges are NOT genuine Canon but non-OEM replacement.  At this point I don't know if the ink cartridge replacements will function properly but I would have ordered genuine Canon cartridges if I hadn't been misled by the package.
2,Printer accepted one so far but they leak which Canon"s never did. Not sure about print quality yet.
1,Deceptive! The picture shows a product that APPEARS to be Canon OEM BUT it's NOT! Come in a different box. Returned and refunded.
1,This is not what is shown in the picture before the description.  I am not happy.  Although I am sure it says somewhere right there what it is it is misleading from the picture.  Thanks but no thanks
1,Desciption says Canon ink but it's not and it will ruin your printer and void your parinter warranty.
5,Timely delivery. Product was actually better than what I anticipated (XL Black cartridge)‚Ä¶will purchase again!
5,The color printing of this product is similar to the original. I can't see any difference.
5,I love this ink. The quality is a 10/10 and not only do the papers appear to be very clear but the ink also lasts you for months!
1,Despite the picture this is not genuine Canon ink. I have no idea how it works because I never put generic ink in my printer. Bad experiences in the past.
5,This product not only a money saver but bright colors definitely worth it
5,Sharp colors! Works well and easy to install! Just what we needed
1,This company uses deceptive visuals on the website to make it look exactly like the Canon product and makes you think you are buying actual Canon ink when in fact it is just generic ink.
