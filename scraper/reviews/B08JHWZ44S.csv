5,I have several ring lights and they all get the job done. This one is very light weight and great for transporting in a backpack or a tote bag. I had to figure out the way to elevate the ring light by twisting the layers. That was a new way that I had never seen before. But it's very easy. My phone is on the larger side and it held it up pretty well without me having to continue to readjust it up.Overall I am very pleased and I would recommend this for someone who shoots content especially with the options to change the lighting plus the remote is an extremely easy pairing and works great!!
4,The product has tons of attachments which for the price was a great perk. The ring has great brightness and the different filters are solid. The remote I can’t comment on because I haven’t used that feature. I purchased this ring because I’m an online teacher and I made lots of instructional videos for my students and classes and needed better lighting. That said what I had hoped was that this little pod could sit behind my laptop in my desk to provide that light but it’s just too big. also the ring can get wobbly. Last con- it does come with tons of attachments but it seems like there is a piece missing to make the majority of the attachments functional. Like I said I don’t care because I just need the ring light. But for those considering the product because of the multi-use attachments look closely and be sure.
4,I’ve purchased a few ring lights and this one is my least favorite. It’s bright but not as bright as others. The phone attachement is perfect - this is why I purchased it. I like that it bends however you please and there are several attachements for it. This doesn’t come with a cord that plugs into a socket. It has a USB  end and you need a wall attachment to add in order to plug it in. It’s not very sturdy;  I find that twisting the base doesn’t always keep the stand up - whereas other stands have clips to hold them in but it stays majority of the time. All in all it’s a good ring light but not the best on the market.
5,This ring light is so much better than my old previous one I got 5 years ago and for double the money. I could not pass up the price and reviews. It's very sturdy like super sturdy.it will not tip over with your phone on it. Very easy to assemble and figure out. Ring light is top teir quality it's bright and dims perfectly. On top of all that the accessories it comes with is beyond what I expected. So many attachments for all different needs. And it becomes a selfish stick. All while being much taller than me. I'm 5ft 3 and it goes inches above me!Definitely worth it and feels like it's one of those $100 ones!
4,I just received this item and haven’t used it yet so we’ll see. It is light weight so that’s a plus. But light weight means it is rather cheap in its materials. What would you expect for the price? Yes you do get quite a bit for the price. I’ll be treating this item like it might break anytime because of the lightweight plastic. What helped me decide to get this light was the selfie stick. At first when I opened the box I didn’t see the selfie stick. I contacted the seller and they told me it was part of the tripod. I watched the included product video which shows how to detach the selfie stick. Cudos to product support. I didn’t know about the remote so that was a plus. I’ll have to use it before I’ll know if the light is bright enough. It’s pretty easy to assemble. The telescoping selfie stick/stand is a bit flimsy in that it might not stay locked when fully extended so being careful to make sure it’s locked especially before adding your phone. I’ll say also that due to how lightweight the stand is after adding the light ring and the weight of the phone could cause the whole thing to topple over it’ll be a good idea to lay something weighted over the base to prevent it from falling over. I’m a professional makeup artist and recently dropped my old light so I needed a new light in a hurry. I think this light will do the job for the time being. I’ll see how well it holds up.
5,My niece who just turned 10 wanted to dabble with taking photographs during family affairs and special occasions. She only uses my old iPhone picture quality was decent but she needed some good solid lighting to make the photos pop! Come in the SELFIE RING-RING LIGHT! I was a sinch to assemble (with my help) and to operate. The ring light with its many colors and blight led light really made a difference with the photos that she took. The phone holder and usb charging and remote was a bonus at an affordable price. Was a good buy overall!
4,Everything needed to create your digital content whether using your phone camera or both at once. Two camera clips are included and can be used at the same time. Light colors are white yellow and pink plus are dimmable. The stand works great at adjustable heights and stick can also be removed from the base to function as a selfie stick. Oh I almost forgot the remote. It paired with my phone immediately and works great for when you need to be hands-free. Works great for my needs.
5,This is a wonderful item that made my zoom meetings look more professional. It lits up the face pretty well and makes the face more visible. It also have 3 different light modes and various lighting brightness levels that makes the light throw blend in with the room lighting to provide a soothing ambience. I recommend this light to anyone who wants to make the virtual meetings more enjoyable for the audience.As for gaming experience in terms of live streaming. The lighting is superior honestly. The overall sturdyiness compatability and mere options given this product deserves 10/10. 5 stars is not enough.
5,My husband and I did not have a photographer for our wedding so I purchased this product for because it came with a remote control and I thought was genius! Unfortunately we did not get to use it but I use it for taking videos and my children playing and it’s great for family photos you can do them yourself. As you can see in the pictures uploaded you can get a wide view. It also allows different angles and it can be turned into a selfie stick. I would definitely recommend this product it has many different uses. I hooked my iPhone up to it and the remote works with my iPhone videos and pictures!
4,This tripod was the best thing I ever did for my photos! It was a little confusing to assemble at first but once I did it once it was easy to remember and do it later in other circumstances. I loved the flexibility of the ring light part so you can angle your phone any way you could imagine. However it is a bit flimsy and the stand has now broken with only a few uses. I wish I was still able to use it.
5,I didn’t know which to get because so many out there but my son is in college for production/directing and he picked this one out of the bunch I gave him to choose from.  He stated the specs were good for what I wanted (I want this to record me cooking & a new platform I want to try) . He was RIGHT!  Tripod great quality (love how it collapses for easy carrying. Many different holders for you to choose from for your electronic devices (I.e. phone camera) the light is great quality and the remote is so convenient!  I recommend!!
5,I bought this one day when I was bored and it wasn’t as expensive as the other ones so I wasn’t sure if it would be great quality but I love it! I set it up at my job and we had so much taking pics with it. The lighting was perfect! I loved. How it made my pictures look. It was such a great buy!
4,The light is bright and even it has many attachments that work with several different types of mounts.  One of the attachments seemed lower quality and fell apart while I was trying to figure out what it was and how it worked but that particular one wasn't needed for my setup.My one complaint is that for my setup the shortest height for the tripod was slightly taller than I'd prefer but I've been able to make it work and now I swear by this thing!
4,The lighting on the selfie ring is amazing! There are three different settings you can choose from to decide which light you want. The remote is a nice touch as well. However if you have a heavier phone (I have an iPhone 12 Pro Max) the ring light is not strong enough to hold up the phone no matter how hard you try to tighten the adjustment.
5,Comes with all the right pieces that you will need.  Its not too big but not too small either. I purchased just to be able to apply make up but my niece had found it useful for all the things that 22 year olds like to do.  She was surprised at all of the attachments so now I guess I know what she will get for Christmas.
5,I got this ring light because I was doing a maturnity photo shoot with my phone and needed extra lighting. It was amazing and got the job done. I love that it has severak attachment for the different ways it can be used. It was easy to assemble. Love the remoto control as well.Didnt like that the light had to be plugged in but i think  i havent figured out that well yet.  But all in all I would recommend buying.
5,I really love that this item was lightweight and easy to pack up and take with you. My kids love it. They take it all over the house inside and outside taking pictures all of the time. This was a great affordable investment. I bought it to take pictures for my business. I was not disappointed. Great buy!
4,It's lightweight but fairly sturdy.  Adjustable height adjustable brightness. Remote work fine with Bluetooth. How the light ring is attached could be a little more sturdy as well as a couple of the gadgets that hold your phone but overall it works well for my needs. I treat it as I do any other delicate piece of camera equipment.
4,I am happy with my purchase especially considering the price for all the different light settings stand length and remote control. The stand is a little unsteady but that may be due to error on my assembly skills. Still a very good buy!
4,The ring light is definitely a deal for the price! It comes with a tall tripod (tho a little wonky) and phone holder. It’s on the smaller side but really bright with 3 different style of lighting. Overall it’s a great buy!
5,I was a bit apprehensive about buying a light online sometimes you get the greatest thing ever sometimes you get the “swing-and-miss”version. This light was really worth the money I paid for it. Not only is the height adjustable perfect for both my laptop and desktop settings. But the different colors really make me stand out in meetings. rather than looking on natural this light makes me pop and not only zoom but team meetings.
4,I gave it 4 stars because it doesn't remain tight I have to keep screwing the phone holder & light in order for it not to keep moving. Other than that I love it! The lighting is bright and love the different settings.
5,This ring light is a perfect start for my photography.  Everything worked like it is supposed to.  the only issue is with build quality but for the price this is to be expected.  The tightening clamp for the ring light doesn't tighten enough for my liking and moves easily when it is tightened down.
5,I love how bright and easy it is to use. It comes with a lot of accessories to use. I set it up in my room and it’s great for pictures videos etc. The remote control is quite small I do tend to lose it haha but it’s fairly easy and quick to the point.
4,Everything works fine for me except the remote. I have an android phone and instead of snapping a photo the remote controls the volume on the phone I don't know may be user error
5,I bought this to take pictures of my products I sell on my website. I am a new business owner so I do have a budget. I love the quality and how ease it is to assemble carry around and use everyday <3
5,I loved the way the buttons was so simple to use and they easily control the brightness and the cool tone on the ring light. The quality is very good i would definitely recommend 10/10 this ring light makes my pictures pop! I absolutely love it also it has a height adjustment on it so it's very useful!
5,This is one of the brightest ring lights that I own and is a very high quality but affordable light on the market. 4.9 out of 5 stars only becuase the light remote control is a little small but that is the only downside to this product.
5,This is a good ringlight especially for the price. I had some issues with the first one I ordered but I contacted their customer service and they were so nice and I was able to get it replaced. The light is was bright. My favorite thing thought was that camera clicker it comes with I’m obsessed
5,Product was easy to set up and start using immediately. It comes with many attachments and the cord was fairly long. The ring had good brightness for the at home lay down pictures I tried to take and needed extra lighting. Easy to disassemble and store away too!
5,I love that this holds my phone steady for taking product pictures and making videos. They look so much better now that I’m not trying to video without shaking. I will be ordering another one so I don’t have to move this one around from room to room.
5,I use my selfie light for tiktok.  It's my 3rd one and best so far. The lights are bright.  The stand is tall and sturdy. I like the remote control so I can compare which lighting is best and the price was great. I recommend this light for something basic like tiktok.
5,I really love this ring light. I bought it because it has so many adjustable features to it. The tripod and the different phone/camera holders it very useful. I love the different light settings sometimes I put my mirror behind it so I can put my make up on👍🏽 I’m also using it for recording painting other art works and my pet photos!
5,I am doing some early Christmas shopping. The ring light was delivered on time and everything inside is accounted for. I know that this will come in handy for my daughter and her business. Once she actually uses it we will add to our review. Thanks.
5,I bought this product for my daughter as a birthday gift.  She not only uses it for social media but also to take pics to display and sell prints of her art work.  She loves the versatility and various options this set came with.
4,I needed to improve the brightness of the lighting in my office for video calls and this ring light was the perfect addition. The multiple mounting attachments that were included are quite useful for other activities involving taking pictures and videos with my iPhone (and the Bluetooth remote control works great). My 12-year-old daughter is now jealous and wants one for herself!
5,We are a small business and like to capture headshots of staff on their first day. We have a decent lighting and backdrop setting but needed something to help brighten the face. This was a perfect solution.
5,This ring light really works. It has different types of light you can take photos from your phone and look super nitid. It has an adequate size and is super light. I loved it definitely works and it is very comfortable to use/transport!
4,This stand helped me take my own professional headshots the brightness feature was very useful. I will be using again in the fire for filming.Thank you!

5,This ring light is just perfect. Super easy to set up and use! I use it right on my vanity to do my makeup.  I like how the cord is long enough to reach too!
4,Quality of lighting combined with natural or room lighting worked perfect for videos and virtual meeting spaces; even handy for regular pics!
4,Definitely can't beat the price it's well worth it!! The different brightness is more than adequate. The remote is handy for the perfect selfies! Would recommend it for sure!
5,No issues with this purchase. Bought a different brand for a little cheaper and it broke. This one is durable with better options. Glad the old one broke because this one was better.
4,Good item. Great price. Locks on the stand for height adjustment go be tighter. Over all works well.
5,For an inexpensive ring light this works really well. Lots of ways to adjust the height and angles. Includes a remote and some accessories. Definitely does the trick for taking product photos.
4,The besssst ring light I’ve ever had . Just be careful with the cord . It rips fast

5,This is a perfect ring light! Comes with a Bluetooth remote to take your pictures! It’s easy to set up! Love everything about it! 100% recommend for a nice cheap ring light!
5,I liked how sturdy it is. It stands really tall. And also can go really low for a low perspective. It’s the ultimate selfie stick or just a stand for shooting photos of video. The light has very bright to semi bright
5,I love this ring light most out of all of them! It came with so many different accessories and ways to use it. It’s super easy to put together and use!

5,I’ve purchased a lot of lights for filming and this one is by far the best value! It’s bright east to adjust and very easy to use. It’s also easy to store since everything all the stands/sticks can collapse

4,I bought this project to use on a video project for school. The brightness and lighting options were great and the controls were easy to use. I didn’t use to the remote control because I could control my phone from my Apple Watch but it was a nice feature to include. I only used the ring stand and have not had the chance to use some of the other accessories but the ring stand was sturdy and adaptable enough what what I was using it for. My one issue with this product was that the goose neck on the phone holder was not as flexible as I would like. It was kind of difficult for me to get my phone in the correct position of have the right angle for how I wanted to shoot the video and then it seemed like it wanted to hold my phone crooked. I was afraid I was going to break the holder as I tried to push it into the right position but it didn’t break and I was able to line everything up.Overall I would buy this product again for the price.
5,Very good product and affordable. The delivery was fast and everything works just as described. Very helpful when you need to record a video or take a picture by yourself.

4,I liked that it was easy to use for my Mary Kay Business.  Making videos on how to use products is so much fun!
5,I really like it
5,Worlds great. Does everything advertised I like the different light options and the remote!
5,in case some of y’all need instructions on making the base sturdy you should loosen up that lower knob and unscrew(by twisting) the pole from the base of the stand until it fully detaches.Otherwise is not a bad light and does a great job for what it serves and it is pretty sturdy. My only con which is more of a suggestion is clearer instructions for set up.
5,Me agrado muchísimo lo compre con el fin de practicar & tomar fotos a mis maquillajes y pues me encanto.
5,Great for photos from a distance! Captures the light needed in every frame so pictures come out clear and clean.

5,I liked !! The product is good.
5,Product was as represented. Easy to set up easy to use gives off great light. Definitely recommend.
3,I was a little worried when I opened the box because the box inside of the amazon box was pretty beat up but the actual product it ok. The light worked really well!The light is not bulky it's actually a decent size and does not take up a lot of space. I really like that you are able to adjust the height in so many ways.I have only had it for about 4 days and the only defect I have just noticed is that the USB is already falling apart. I have kept the light set up in one area in my room and has not been moved or messed with. I have a Samsung S21 ultra and the phone holder works great! I will most likely get a replacement.
5,So easy to set up and use. Lighting is flattering without blinding you.
5,Love this very bright
5,I love that it came with a remote control and the different mounts for your phone

5,I loved how it could change heights and different light settings!! Overall loved this product.
5,Like: everythingDislike: the packaging it was compact and a puzzle to put back together
5,Great product!!!!!
4,Overall the product is great. It was a little difficult to assemble but once you get it you get it I kind of just did my own thing and it worked. The only thing I have a problem with is getting it to stand at a certain height with it not falling down. The stand you have to twist it a certain way so it can stand up without it falling down. I also wish the phone grip was made wider for phones with cases because I do have to take my case off of my iPhone for it to stay in place. The brightness is great with the 3 different settings. I do wish the cord was longer but you just have to make it work.
5,I love how bright and beautiful My images are using the light ring!!! Great deal
5,I used this ring light for zoom appointments and it worked great to make me look professional.
5,Exelente calidad

I use my iPhone 13promax so I definitely don’t want to damage it and I feel like my phone is held securely.

The inner circle more than fit the SLR camera I use as a webcam and the brightness levels make it easy to get the perfect lighting.Especially considering the price I've been very impressed and pleased. This is a great product for any beginner streamers!

5,This kit has everything you need to brighten your face on video calls. If you're using your phone for those calls there are several attachments to hold any phone. If you're using a computer the light settings are great and allow you to control brightness as well as warm/cool tones. Great kit!
5,Great product! Easy to setup and use.
5,Good for kids
4,Very good product for beginners use and for price.  Not really durable and sturdy.  But good for home use.  I wish there were options to purchase/replace accessories separate because upon assembling the phone tripod broke.  It is just a suggestion.
5,Great brightness and quality!
4,does exactly what is says this is a deal for $20:00. packed well and arrived in great condition BUT not very stable everything has to be set up just right.
5,Look no further! With the amount of selfie ring lights out it took me forever to choose one. With this one being inexpensive I gave it a chance and I’m SO glad I did! I can’t get over how cheap it was and how many features and attachments it comes with! The selfie stick extends so far to get the furthest distance! I love how you can adjust all the different brightnesses and it gives off the BEST light. I took my real estate headshot in it and it came out so beautiful saved me a couple hundred instead of getting the done professionally. The remote bluetooths to your phone making it so easy to snap your own photo! All the attachments make it so easy to assemble and I can use everything all in one for what I need! I recommended it to my friends and they all got one as well! :)
5,Photoshot life video
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 It's super easy to work with and does a pretty good job. It stays up most of the time. Just need to make sure it's tightened at every section. I love how I can section it down to so I can use it for my table or counter. It's just super easy to work with and I love it. The light works great and love how it has 3 different settings. The remote is super easy to work and was so easy to put together.
5,I love it all. I use it for makeup
4,Works perfect for home and business needs.
5,
4,This ring light works well. It is plenty bright. It did not come with a wall brick so I had to use one from another device. Because of this when the brick gets too hot the lights will shut off automatically. The remote works most of the time but the batteries run out quickly. Overall great purchase for the price.
5,Love it
5,Very sturdy for mobile cameras. The selfie stick is handy as well. I use it for scanning documents in the posture shown in the images. The ring lights are useful as well. The most important thing is the compressed size and great for travelling. Got great discounts when I ordered.
5,Perfect
4,Product is cool I like the length of it and it serves its purpose for what I got
5,It's cheaply made but the price is totally awesome. I just wish it came with a regular camera shoe on top of the light ring as well. But one was included that holds most smartphones. I just bought a threaded rod and some washers for using my GoPro hero 8 cam with it and it works just fine. Pretty cool set up with lots of extras except for the cam shoe I needed. But I'm super happy considering the cost and how quickly it arrived. Hopefully they read this and include a double sided thread cam shoe for future customers cameras. Because I'm still married to using my GoPro and other cameras for my personal video shooting preference. But I love the functions and extras and the choices of lighting options and how easily it was to assemble. Overall I'm very happy with the purchase.
5,I don't write a lot of reviews but am very glad I purchased this light ring. Unlike most potential customers I don't use it for photographing myself but rather for amateur photography of inanimate objects. This was a nice inexpensive option I can use with my phone. The three color settings and options for brightness have proven to be successful for different settings and moods. The stand is easy to use and the option for height control was a big selling point for me. For those unfamiliar with this type of light it doesn't produce heat: it is never hot to the touch or uncomfortable in one's face if you are using it for selfies or video conferences. It came as described and is a value for the price. There are no regrets and it has helped up my game for my hobby.
5,I love the ease of set up and how gorgeous my pics turn out but it arrived broken. It is made of plastic.
5,Me gusto mucho
4,Be careful about balancing my phone has tipped over a couple of times. The tripod is very thin so if you’re looking for something sturdy probably not the one for you. If you’re looking for something basic this is the way to go. The phone holder *barely* fits my iPhone 12 pro max (6.7”). The remote works (
5,Loved the brightness!!
4,The tripod is not sturdy as well as the attachments. I don’t know if my IPhone 12 Pro Max is too heavy for the attachment but it’s a struggle to maintain the structure of the stand.
5,This product ended up being a treasure & a value to buy. I was not for sure it would work for my event business being I have to move around & use this tripod with lighting on the regular but I have been using it for over 2 months now & I have to honestly admit I have gotten my money worth from this product. It may not be the top of the line product but your client or others would never know the difference when used in a professional setting. The remote control was concerning as I would say that I may have to look into getting a replacement for it. This is a great product for beginners to start using because it will pay for itself in the long run.
5,Recomendado
4,We like the brightness of this light and the remote control switch. We do have trouble with the stand collapsing frequently and the weight of the phone makes the light flop down frequently. We have tried to tighten the screws but it doesn’t hold very well.
4,The light is bright and works great. But it’s not as sturdy when it needs to hold my phone. It’s okay if you don’t extend it too high. About 4-5 feet is good but much higher and it starts to get a little wobbly. It works for what I need it to do.
5,My boyfriend is a one handed Warzone streamer @ Nubz OT on YouTube. We got this light for his stream in April (about 3 months now) and it works perfectly for it's price. There's been no problems with the light it's easy to set up and use. It has 3 different tints (white yellow and blue) as well as different brightness levels. There's one light in front of his setup but a second light is needed to even it out. I attached 2 before & after pictures of the light on and off and 1 picture of the face cam and hand cam it lights up during gameplay. Overall It's a great light and recommended.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Shipping was fast product came with everything in description product is stable light and remote work great light has different modes for brightness I definitely recommend this light and company I am very happy with my product and service I received
5,Exactly what I was looking for I use it everyday and it still works great.
4,The product is amazing it works very well and smoothly. The only think I dislike is that some of the attachments are complicated and might not fit for use. Besides that it’s a great ring light! Highly recommend
5,I can’t even lie I’m still in love with my ring light. It allows me to get great photos and videos without having to add filters and it’s easy to use🙌🏾🙌🏾
4,The best feature is the base it doesnt wobble. Only downside if you move the tripod you can easily cause it to collapse down. The sections don't  securely lock in place.  One tiny twist expwct an accordion style collapse and your recording is ruined.  If you can refrain from touching it you are all good.
5,I liked everything about this device.  I use for my YouTube videos and works perfectly.
5,The remote light is dim but that’s not a big deal for me. It gets the job done. :)
4,Now that I’m working remotely I needed a way to brighten my face when on Webex meetings. This was a great value for the price. I do wish it got a lighter brighter. Love the flexibility of the product as it has so many uses/functions
5,I used this product to set up a virtual studio for college musical theatre auditions. It worked great! It was very easy to travel with. Also it was perfect to set up behind a laptop desk. The quality of light was highly professional and I received a lot of compliments on my setup during the audition process.
4,The ring light is dope offers different level lighting and three different hue types that u can choose to give sort of like a filtered look on your recordings I’m a little disappointed with the stand it doesn’t stand at its tallest point it drops down and u kinda have to fight with it to get it to stay up but other than that I’m happy with the product ☺️
4,Really like the ring light and phone set up. Didn’t realize the connector doesn’t connect to iPhone and so has to purchase another adopter. Overall satisfied with product
4,Easy and quick to put together.  I managed to get set up at the last minute of a project. I've been needing better lighting for my cramped space
5,We bought this light to take puppy pictures. We love natural light but until they are vaccinated we keep them inside so lighting is never right…. Until we bought this set up!! It is really awesome and having the remote makes taking pictures even easier!! They are now nice and bright and you can have your phone right in the center of the light. It was super easy to put together we were taking pictures in just minutes after opening. Our daughter bought a different one from a local store to make TikTok videos she paid more and it wasn’t good at all. She tried ours and LIVES IT!!I would give this one more then 5 stars if I could. We highly recommend buying one if you have a issue with shadows and just bad lighting!! This will fix your issue.
3,I use this for my lives for my businesses it works well enough my only issue is that it collapses sometimes during my lives even after retightening the screws and adjusting the poles. It’s worth the price though. I wish it was a little brighter especially since my apartment lights are already dim enough and sometimes it appears a little grainy. But it’s good enough
4,Using the attachments do not hold up the phone as good. The phone is heavier than the stand and tends to fall over. Twist to lock mechanism isn’t as sturdy. Collapses often.
4,Nice item easy to assemble but parts a pretty flimsy
5,Brightness is on point
5,If you do any kind of content recording or even hair this is perfect for you. It’s easy to setup and has different lighting settings.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I love using this light to get pictures of rocks and rings I have made! Great ring light many options and the price is perfect. Would recommend and buy again
5,Be gentle with the chord
5,
5,I really like this ring light-easy to set up and great lighting. Will buy another… I’m satisfied with my purchase!
4,I didn’t receive everything I was suppose to receive! My selfie pole was missing! This seems to be happening with other people order as well from reviews I read!
4,Easy to use great brightness
5,Taking photos of our edible artwork.
4,Selfies stick was not inside
5,Very easy to set up! The selfie ring light was bright and switches between warm and cool light with a touch of the button. You can also adjust brightness to your liking. Only issue was one of the phone holders grip came apart. I applied some glue and no issues afterwards.
5,I like how easy it is to use the ring light as adjusting stability and mounting whatever device you plan to use. I like that you can cycle through different tones for either natural led or a combination of both. Will purchase again should I need another at some point
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I like that it has several attachments to hold my phone for different angles and that it is adjustable. Different light settings and brightness levels. The control makes it easier to take pictures from a distance and to make poses.
4,I really like how bright the ring light is and it easily holds my phone in place. The only thing that I would change is to make it a little more sturdy I just feels too light like it could break easily. But I thought overall this is a great product at an affordable price!
4,It is a decent product. My biggest complaint is sometimes when I stand it up it will slip and fall if it’s not locked tightly.
5,We bought this to use at our wedding for a DIY photo booth to cut back on costs and it worked perfectly! We had a backdrop and some photo props laid out and a little sign next to this light directing guests to click their phone into the phone holder and set their timer for a photo although the remote control does seem easy to use as well. I'm excited to also use this for my husband and I when taking photos of just the two of us or with our pets rather than having to fight with trying to hold one of our arms out to get the photo.
5,First time writing a review so please bare with me lolGreat product so far. Had it for a bout a 2&half months and nothing break or defected. Has three light modes which is really nice and its really easy to adjust/set up. Love the fact that my web cam can fit perfectly inside the ring which makes my streams look way better. I've already recemented this product to personal people in my life and haven't gotten any complaints what's so ever. Highly recommend to buy this product if your looking for a nice lighting to your stream without braking your wallet.
4,This product has good lighting very bright & easy to assemble. Different lighting settings and different colors. Love it ! I use it for my tiktok videos
4,It was extremely easy to assemble.  I use it to capture pictures of my dog and myself.
4,Assembly was a bit difficult but otherwise works well. The Bluetooth connected with my phone and the ring light lit up the area nicely.
4,I bought it for the price. It was very easy to assemble. Not the most sturdy but it gets job done.
5,It’s NOT the big 1. Don’t get fooled. Still gets the job done. And the remote thingy is kl. Only 1 holder fits in the light though but they send 3. The other 2 work with the selfie stick. But I wished all 3 worked in the ring
5,I really like this ring light. I have used it for multiple different things including school photos interviews and even social media content. I don’t have any complaints about it and would recommend if you are in the market for one.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Tiene muchos accesorios de buena calidad h esta muy grande y tambien se hace pequeño pra llevar en la bolsa
4,I love this ring light!!  It’s bright  and it fills my whole room. For it being a 10-inch I didn’t expect it to be this powerful. This light is great for makeup videos and definitely pictures. I would purchase again if it goes out. I’ve had it for 7 months now.
5,I really like how easy it was to put this ring light together. I wish it was a little brighter but works for what I need it to. Great for that extra touch on my videos.
5,Great light!
5,I’ve had it over a month now and I’ve used it daily and haven’t had any problems with it at all
5,Great quality ring light
4,So I like this ring light I really do. HOWEVER when I tilt the light down and tighten the screw to hold it in place the light still falls down and then my phone will fall. The screw only tightens so much so I’m not sure if it’s just defective or what. The light itself is great. Nice and bright but it’s just not sturdy enough for me. The base of the tripod doesn’t sit flat no matter how I adjust it so I will be returning it. I just can’t seem to find that perfect light for me.
5,It is exactly what I expected and works great!
4,I love using this light and it’s brightness is great! I have however used more study ones that are very similar but didn’t take as much readjusting to make it stable. But once you get it where you want it it does the trick!
4,Was pretty simple to put together and remote works well.
5,Very great ring light. Perfect size stable light weight  and very good lighting. For the price I got it for I couldn’t ask for a better. 10/10.
4,This product is great for people who want a quality light at a reasonable cost. All the components work well its relatively easy to use and its reliable. The stand is a little unstable and the fact that the light needs a USB port to work is a little annoying but other than that its a good product.
4,The ONLY reason for the 4 stars is that the tripod is a little too tall to be considered a desktop light for making videos. It would also be nice if directions were available in the box to describe each implement in the box. Other than that the light works great!
4,I like the fact that this product has fewer moving parts and come  already assembled. It’s light weight and I use it for Internet broadcasting. It has lots of ways to attach your phone.
4,I like it’s bright and changes color
4,Super easy to assemble. Works great for conference calls.
3,The light works nice and the remote but the actual stand always falls down and the phone is to heavy for it to stay upright
5,Easy to use does the job! Light is good for the price
5,Would recommend for first timers! I did my research and this was the best price for the features (remote telescoping height portable).  It definitely feels “light duty” but everything was easy to put together. I like the adjustable height—from standing up (I'm 5'7") all the way down to the floor. In order to make it more portable I plugged the USB cable from the light into an external battery and it works great. My one complaint would be that the phone holder doesn’t move into landscape position (unless I just don’t know how?) ~ overall good value!
5,I love how easily the assembly was. It came with multiple attachments to record take photos and etc. If you share content via tiktok YouTube or whatever I highly recommend this ring light. It comes with a blue tooth remote that connects to your phone to easily snapshot pics from afar as well which comes in handy if you take pics alone. The brightness on the ring light is perfect as well. There’s a clicker button attached that allows you to dim or brighten the light to your liking. Overall 10/10 would highly recommended this product! :)
4,Assembly was not totally self-explanatory (Tip: lift and twist to lock in place you’re welcome!) and it’s a little “flimsy”/lightweight but overall a decent value ring light at a lower price than other ring lights.
5,One word perfect!!!!!! that light fulfilled my sisters exact needs she couldn't have been any happier very bright and her v blogs look so much better as far as lighting goes.
4,The product is a great value for the price but careful when assembling as some of the parts are prone to be damages. don't tighten or force any of the attachments and it will work just fine.
4,I find this a great way to take pictures of the whole party. The remote is great! The lighting is great.
4,I like the ease of operation.
4,Easy to put together and I like the remote control. Wish the lighting was brighter.
4,Actually great. Just a bit difficult to set up .
5,This has made preaching online so much better! I have no windows in my office and the lighting in my house isn’t the greatest. I needed something easy to use that would provide me good lighting for my video recordings. This has done the trick! The wireless remote makes it easy to stop and start my recordings and even take pictures. And I love that I can adjust it to fit my needs. The warm cool and neutral lighting settings also make it nice because depending on what color I’m wearing it may reflect differently. With this I have options! Amazing purchase.
5,I was initially looking for some thing small and ran across this. This had way more features for about the same price and I’m glad I chose this one. I love that this can stand up be a selfie stick or sit on a desktop.  I have never used a remote control before and I have to say it is probably the coolest thing ever. The ability to change the light color is a huge asset as well.  Definitely an awesome product.
5,The quality of the product was great. No trouble with it the brightness. Only thing was it was hard to keep the stick up. Every time I would want to move the light the screw would unscrew or the pole would fall. Other than that everything else was good quality. It even has its own little button to press to take pictures if you can’t do it through your phone. That was my favorite part. I recommend this product had different light settings and it has a selfie stick along with it for such a great price.
4,The ring light was nice the only thing is that only two of the settings worked and then shortly afterwards only one and now none of them worked. Only had a short time bought for my business to take good quality pictures of my products and other stuff pertaining to my personal blog. But it didn't last long..
3,My cord broke really quickly... But it did work but just wish it was more durable
5,Pros: The ring is brighter than I anticipated. For this price there are lots of attachments that fit both my iPhone 13 Pro Max and my GoPro Hero 8. Also this tripod extends plenty high to accommodate any height that you need to record at. Cons: The ball that holds the ring could be designed better. When my phone is in the stand it would hold hold it and fell until I added some glue (since i never needed to change the angle)Overall: I would purchase again for this price and after 4 months of weekly use I am satisfied with this product.
4,I liked this ring light ! It came fast and was easy to put together. I used it to film audition videos and the lighting quality came out that much better!
5,Good
5,Love awesome 💜
4,This product does the job especially for the price. Comes with a lot of accessories so you can use it in just about any scenario. It’s very lightweight and easy to assemble. Gave it 4 stars because sometimes it’s hard to get the full length of the stand to stay up.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Love it folds down neatly so I can leave it up
5,Great product! It was challenging to assemble and disassemble-the sticks didn’t stay up sometimes it would slip down. I still can’t figure out how to take it apart to fit it in the box. The brightness was great I liked how I could change the tone of the light-yellow vs blue-and the brightness levels were great! The cord could be a little longer but that was fine.
5,Very modular to get the light set up the way I needed for my shoot. Now I use it as a desk lamp.
5,The only thing I was a little sad about was that it didn’t come with the selfie stick. I already had one so it worked out fine though.
5,I loved everything about this product. It comes with options for phone placement and it's sturdy. The lighting is awesome. There are different levels of brightness and light color options. This product comes with a remote so that you can be at a distance get yourself together and then take your picture(s) or begin recording. I do radio and use this to assist with going live on my social media platform simultaneously as it works well and allows my viewers to see me much better. I received it according to the shipping information provided and  the packaging was great. Completely satisfied with this product overall!!
5,Very pleased with this purchase. It was easy to put together and now I can use it for a desk light a vanity light and to take pictures and video.
4,Cord broke really easily.
5,Had a lot of fun with ring light! simple set up!
5,Easy to assemble
5,Perfect lighting
5,Product is solid for the money! Gives perfect lighting to your face even in a dark environment!
5,Was bright enough for what I wanted it for. Was even thinking of getting a new one
5,I haven't used this much yet but ive used it a few times and the brightness is good I didn't understand how to properly get the stand to stand at first lol but I figured it . It works good for the cost 🥰
4,Easy to use does the job as described.
4,The product does have 3 different brightness settings and that makes it way easy to use it for what ever reason you need it .
5,This Selfie Ring Light is perfect! It has everything you need to make an event memorable! It has multiple clips to accommodate any device you want to use for picture taking. I absolutely love this product; makes my job of capturing memories so much easier! You can't go wrong with this; it will make your life easier and memories priceless! Cheers have fun!
3,The light isn’t sturdy it constantly moves and deff can’t hold a phone without almost falling over
4,The light works well easy to operate with the remote and the different settings work well for what I need it for. The downfall is it is not super stable when the post is extended much taller then 4 feet.
4,Bought the item as a gift using it now for 5 months. Works great. No issues. Uses it for makeup and states it's the better light she's ever used. I would recommend.
4,I like the variety of lights although it was a little tricky to put together
4,The light is nice! It is a bit flimsy but other than that it works all right for videos. 😊
3,The entire product is just alright. The stand is alright. The light is okay quality and the attachments are as depicted. It's not a bad product but an alright one
4,Great product highly recommended
4,I like the product overall!!
4,I love the prime deals
4,Light weight easy to use very bright. The phone holder needs to be bigger or more stable for bigger and heavier phones.
5,We had a great time taking pics and videos during the holidays. I now use it for work. I appreciate the different hues in the light.
4,Good
3,Very good when taking pictures
5,The product overall was easy to assemble and utilize. The best part of the ring light was being able to switch from cool to warm color. There is also a clicker which was very helpful in taking pictures and videos without having to press the record button which moves the position of the setup. Lastly it comes with different heads that can hold your phone and cameras. Great product overall! Recommend it to everyone:)
5,Es frágil ideal para moverse sin ningún problema el control es fácil de hacerlo compatible al Bluetooth de tu celular para tomar la fotosme gusto bastante que trae para colocar tu celular arriba abajo según lo prefierasla altura también es muy importante sobre  todo a comparación de otros esteesta bastante alto y lo mejor es el súper precio que tiene.Gracias estoy muy contenta con mi compra súpero mis expectativas y lo recomiendo 100% no dudes en comprarlo no te arrepentirás te lo prometo
4,It’s ok. Wish it was a little more sturdy
3,I can’t get the stand to stay up that’s my only complaint
5,This product was easy to navigate and helpful to use in the classroom for students learning to work with technology.
5,
5,I love how I can just set my ring light stand up and take selfies😄. It’s adjustable too! The remote control have different features and the brightness adjustment.
4,Worked fairly!
5,Easy to assemble love the attachments
4,…
4,Product is nice. The different light settings are cool as well as the remote control. However it is antad bit flimsy
5,Great ring light I use it daily for my lives and creating my products it add a lot of light to the dark room I work in!! Perfect!
5,Love it and highly recommended it!!! I use it for my Mary Kay life
3,Na
4,Used for photos etc… had to twist the stem to find desired length
4,Easy to handle with the remote control and the brightness is amazing.
5,I didn’t realize it had so many options when I bought it because I thought I would just be using it with the floor stand. But then I wanted to floor space and switched it to a table stand then to the selfie stick bar that fits perfectly in the structure where I need it. I’ve actually used all of the options and never intended to need them. I permanently mounted the light where I wanted it and it provides just the right amount of light. I’m very happy with it. It’s been over a month of heavy consistent use and I haven’t had a problem.
5,A lot of ring-lights go for a lot more than this one did and for one this cheap I must say I'm really impressed! Assembly wasn't too difficult and I found that it can easily be used for so many different things! I initially purchased it just for creating videos but I can also use it as a desk light or even a selfie stick. It's very cool that I can have all of this for such a low price!
4,Product is great for the cost
5,The light works great! I don’t like how wide the legs are because it’s harder to clear space for it.
5,This was a great ring light I love it
3,It isn’t steady. But it’s durable
4,I use this for recording video and meetings works well for the price
4,For the price it is a decent kit. Allows me to make videos.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Exelente producto fácil de usar
3,The light ring and remote are fine.  But the clamp holding the light ring in place broke as soon as I tightened it down in place.  Had to tape it upright to use it.  Not worth it.
4,Very nice light. The cord could be longer but its fine. The brightness was very good. I would reccomend for sure.
5,I’m a natural hair care stylist and I’m always knocking it over. This ring light is maintaining its structural integrity!! Not to mention I can change the light settings the height and I can put my phone on it and do tictoks lol. It was easy to assemble and it came with a remote. No more setting a timer on my phone. I’m very satisfied with my purchase and I highly recommend!!
5,I was not sure which to choose to get the job done so i just picked the one that looked like it was what i needed and i made the right choice! It comes with accessories to fit all of your needs and an adjustable light source. Perfect for a face shot or from your shoulders up if your room lighting is not enough. A must-buy for the vlogger or poster.
5,This light is excellent and a step above others for the price range. The materials of the light and stand feel very sturdy and good quality. The light is very controllable can get beautifully bright or stay subtle with basic controls as well as having the three colors to suit your room or studio.Highly recommended.
4,Good ring light! Good quality worth it
5,The Selfie Ring Light was shipped fast easy to assemble and gave my presentation the extra lighting it needed. While using the audience stated how bright my face and surroundings were. That it helped keep them engaged during my presentation. I would purchase again and tell others to purchase it for their needs.
4,Great product. Happy to have it.
5,Loved this ring light the remote was so user friendly and the assembly was very easy 10/10
5,The light itself is pretty nice quality. Has several lighting settings and brightness remotes and different phone holders. There was not much instruction on assembly but it was for the most part easy to figure out. I can't seem to get the joints to tighten very well sometimes the weight of my phone makes the holder sink down. Overall I'm pleased with the device. I am using it for pictures of cakes and baked goods
5,Content creation
5,Much better then expected awesome that you can change the tone of the light from cool tone to warm. The only negatives is I had a little trouble putting it together at first but I'm bad at that type of stuff anyway and that I didn't get the selfie stick but that's fine because I probably wouldn't have used it. Overall would definitely recommend
5,Easy set up and to use! Lights put off good brightness! Remote works good enough to not use the phone app!
4,easy to set up and brake down need counter weight at the bottom because it is light weight and flimsy.
5,The other device attachments are helpful. I usually use the adjustable phone holder. The height is exactly what I need for photos and videos. The light brightness setting adjustments are my favorite part of the Ring Light.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 It works perfectly for me I 💕 it
5,I ordered this for my future esthetician business. The lighting is great and the adjustable height make it easy for set up. I also use this for makeup application and it really helps! The stand hold my phone without it falling out. Highly recommend!
4,I liked the brightness but it was quite difficult to assemble for me
5,My wife always want a selfie stick especially when we host a party and want to include everyone in the photo. We finally give this one a try and it works as expected! Then we also try the light function and the remote control. it’s amazing especially the light function! You can see significant difference when you turn on and off the light. Now my wife use it every time she wants to take photos!
5,The light provides enough brightness to mimic being outdoors or next to a bright window. The entire thing is very sturdy and holds my heavy phone perfectly! The only issue is I couldn’t get the remote to work; but I record videos for Tiktok and Instagram so I manage just fine without the remote. VERY happy with this product.
5,I own a small nail business and a YouTube channel and I use the ring light for both. It’s so convenient and so efficient for the price. I recommend to everyone it’s worth it and comes with different light colors. I also use it to take pictures for Instagram. I love how easy it is to adjust!
5,I like the lamp nice and affordable
3,Update. After a rest period. The light started working again.I bought this in January. Used it to photograph about a dozen craft items I’m selling.Set it up yesterday and after taking about 10 pictures it shut off and is no longer working.I wasn’t  expecting a lot from this but I didn’t need professional lighting. It was good for my need but now it’s trash. :(
4,I really wanted to love this product. Good product good price terrible quality. I am still using this product however the product has broken off from the base after one week. I WISH that the product did not break because I am currently not getting the full use of the product. I am limited to desk uses only and hoping the light doesn't move in the slightest or else it topples over.
4,Pretty decent for the cost
5,Appreciate the quick shipping easy to understand instructions well put together. Have loved my results in my videos from using it! Thank you
5,Adjustable height right light a perfect size I still haven’t used the selfie stick portion but I’m sure it’s great ! I would highly recommend this product to my friends
3,Great lighting I use it when I stream and vlogging I can’t complain
5,I love the setting and the light was perfect
4,The product was great quality. I received a gift with less accessories and that worked better for me. If you are trying to save funds and do your own photoshoot this product will definitely work for you. Light equipment (weight) and a variety of settings makes thos product stand out.
5,This ring light came in Handy for my husband and I vow renewal ceremony. It was a easy setup  my guest were able to put there phones on the stand and take pictures along with our backdrop. Love it. Now my kids and I use for TikTok videos lol.
5,I love this lighting device. It was super easy to assemble and it gets the job done. I use it for my pictures and for my videos. It has different lighting settings. The price was perfect for my budget. This is what I call Value! Getting more for your money. Overall I highly recommend anyone looking for a lighting device to buy this one.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Funciona muy lindo 🥰 el brillo y todo
5,I use this for better lighting when braiding hair. Works well. The best that I've used thus far
3,
5,This is the best money I have ever spent! It has everything you need to become a star.  The different lights make it even more perfect  since of course  we record in different settings.  And the tripod is fantastic.  Use with or without the phone.  I was really impressed with the quality.  I'm not the gentlest person  but this thing can take a beating.  I'm certain it will last a long time.  And if it ever needs to be replaced  I'm coming right back here for another one.  You can't beat this!
3,Not bad but tye remote sometime didn’t work
5,Product is bright and great for your pictures and videos
5,I love it it works great and the remote control really makes a big difference when you’re taking selfies.
3,Isn’t very bright. Lighting is very dull
5,I’m in love with my Selfie Ring Light LED Light Ring Trapod! It allows me to create better quality reel videos for Instagram without having to hold my phone! The automatic camera shutter captures amazing pictures as well! I highly recommend this product!
5,This is my first ring lamp and I’m so happy I went with this one it’s really easy to use came with a lot of attachments and it’s perfect for our little side Funko pop puzzle we got going on perfect amount of light three tones able to make it brighter or lower as a please I would definitely buy another if needed one
5,I really enjoy my product very useful.
5,I found that this had the perfect lighting for my products. No glare like I’d get from a regular phone camera.
5,I will say the only thing I would change is instead of having the twist poles to hold it into place I would put those clamps on it. The twist is nice but it easily comes untwisted and falls to the ground if you’re not careful while moving it. Other than that the light is amazing!!
4,Easy to assemble. Good product for the price. Would buy again.
5,Work fine love it
5,I purchased this to take it with me on a trip to Punta Cana. I was able to fit it in my suitcase. It’s the perfect size. My pictures look amazing! There are many different lighting options and it’s very easy to use. I would definitely recommend.
5,❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ this the best ring light compared to other ring lights.❤️❤️🔥🔥
5,I’ve been using it for 2 months. And it’s the most useful lamp I have ever had. It’s not only the lamp you can also use it like selfie maker or only for your phone. Make pictures from the far. It also has Bluetooth . The lights have 3 Colors and modes. I really like it
5,These ring lights work well. I bought one for personal use then purchased two more for work! I like the r flexibility of height the ability to operate by remote or switch. Easy to assemble and set up. Very portable. Arrives nicely packaged.
4,Only issue I have is getting the stand to stay up it slips down frequently after trying to put it extending it. But it has a Fantastic my brightness love the camera remote it’s great overall except for the issue with keeping it up
5,I was thoroughly surprised by this purchase. For the price I assumed I was getting a countertop ring light be the thing expands taller than me and I’m 5’0 ft tall perfect for the travel work that I do. And it’s definitely bright I’m happy with my purchase :)
5,This comes with so many different options and is easy to set up and install. I bought for my best friends wedding. We could use a selfie stick option along with the ring light. The brightness options are awesome depending on location of picture. The remote control is an awesome feature to have!
5,Clear and bright lighting has really added to my YouTube videos!  Thank you!!!
5,I love this light stand. It was very easy to put together. The control to take pictures is very convenient.  I use it to make videos and even to do my makeup.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Buen trípode e iluminación se puede cambiar la intensidad y hay 3 colores. Es difícil mantener la altura estable tiene muchas piezas y usos.
4,Good but not sturdy
5,The ring light is easy to use and has 3 different light features that are great! I also like how I can adjust the height of the ring light to be able to put it on my table or on the ground. This has been a great asset to my small business!
4,No complaints. Works great for my needs
5,i dont that it doesn’t stay up when phone onbut it works ok
5,Great starter product. My kids really wanted something like this and this product works great. They are enjoying the product.
5,I really love the usefulness of this item. When I'm not using it for videos or photography it has become a regular light. It's sturdy and easy to use.  The selfie stick option is really great too. I don't use the remote control much but it does work well when needed.
5,The selfie ring light stand was easy to assemble. I love how you can adjust the dimness or brightness of the ring light to achieve the desired look for photos and videos. This product has made making TIKTOK videos so much easier for me!
5,I didn’t realize the difference in my photos until utilizing the ring light. It’s definitely become a staple in my everyday routine and taking photos.
5,Absolutely loved this portable ring light. It was inexpensive and super easy-to-use. Perfect for me as a new content creator when I don’t want to set up my full-size ring light. The remote was easy to pair with my phone so I could take photos and record video discretely. Definitely recommend!
3,The items to enable the short desktop configuration pictured in the main item graphic is not part of the kit. Instructions are not great. My ring light did not illuminate fully all the way around the ring which was probably not a big deal but made me suspicious of the quality. Returning.
5,This was the best product for me !! The light is so bright and this is great because it catches everything I’m filming. I’m a paint artist and I need alot of light so that my audience can see me all of my details
4,They need a carrying case!
5,I haven’t quite got use to how to work the adjustable stand but it functions very well pretty much everything I needed in a tripod. The remote connects to phone with ease. I used it for a photoshoot by myself and worked perfect
5,This product is great for someone just getting into blogging. It’s easy to assemble and just as easy to use.
5,I love the lighting adjustments and the height. My only thing is that sometimes the adjustment of height doesn’t stay or I have to fix it a lot but it is kind of what’s expected from products like this. Great beginner ring light for social media influencers!
5,Decent
5,I really like this ring light . It definitely helps with brightness for my tik tok videos that I do. Very easy to use and doesn’t take up a lot of space. It expands really high and it’s perfect because my boyfriend is 6ft1 so it gets the height. ❤️
5,I was not expecting for this ring light to be as great as it is since it is so cheap but it has turned out to be the best one I have had yet. I love how tall the tripod is and how easy it is to adjust the height. My favorite thing about it though is the brightness of the ring light. I love how there are three different modes and each mode has different intensities. It is also super convenient that this light comes with this extra piece to hold another phone or camera off to the side on the tripod. It makes it easier for me to be able to film with my camera and stream with my phone at the same time.
5,I've been using this ring light for a couple weeks now and it hasn't failed me. It tightens and loosens with a simple twist it reaches a good height the ring light has great projection and helps keep shadows out of frame. Would recommend for purchase.
5,Daughter loved it!!
5,Got this for my daughter to catch pictures of her New Yorkie dog and it is so amazing it captures him with such OK you said it’s August 24 of 2021 and what is that total charge amount OK give me one moment here and I love that information or fullness and brightness. Very easy to assemble
5,I am an interior designer and bought this light to help better capture spaces in a better light. It works perfectly. Being able to adjust the settings of the tripod and light allow for flexibility with the types of pictures I take.
5,The items was very fun and easy to use.  I didn’t realized how fun it was to put together and use at my age (58).  If I had to buy it again I would. Thank you do such a lovely product.
5,i like that the product was delivered in the exact form i ordered online. it works very well with my phone and the lights gets me quality videos while recording
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Great price and versatility
4,This has taken my photos to a whole new level! Other than the fact that it has to stay plugged in and the cord is not very long this product is amazing!
5,Great ring light. Easy to setup and use. I use this product when I am taking pictures or recording videos.
4,Easy to assemble
5,I make waist beads and the lighting needs to perfect to capture my beads....this light does that. I also like that the stand can be lowered that come in handy when I'm making eye level videos!!!
5,This is a great light ring I use for streaming! It has three levels of white which are perfect for chroma keying out the green and keeping everything well lit. The brightness levels range from soft tiny lit to full day brightness! Would buy again!
5,I needed this for college for my speeches and the light worked great and it was super easy to set up and Cheaper and better than the ones in store. I plan on continuing to use it for my YouTube to channel since the light is so good and it has many pieces to switch out in case you need it for a camera or your phone. I highly recommend it for anyone starting a YouTube channel or if you need it for college speech class
5,This ring light stand was exactly what I needed for some impromptu selfies for my fiance(the ladies know what I mean) 😉 Sturdy great lighting & remote everything worked like a charm! Definitely recommend. Think I'll use it for some great family photos sessions too!
5,It is exactly what I wanted it to be!!!

5,i’ve been looking for a sturdy & easy to use ring light & im so happy with my purchase. it holds my phone up without tilting & the different lightings are perfect. you can adjust how bright or dim you need it. 10/10 purchase!
5,The directions had no words just pictures. You need a laptop to work it. But it does the job
5,All the functions work but the instrument that the phone is placed in broke at the neck so I could no longer attach my phone to the ring light.The remote control takes second to connect to my phone so that was a plus. Overall the product was on for the time it lasted.
5,I waited to review so that everyone knows how good it really is. Great quality have been using for over 3 months & I can use in more than one place! Love it.
4,The Selfie Ring Light was easy to assemble had great lighting and worked as expected. I purchased this for my 12-year old and she was able to set it up and start using without assistance.
5,It fits perfectly in my work space and is easy to assemble and just as easy to break down for next time. I really appreciate how bright the ring light is

5,I bought this as a gift for my sister’s birthday so she could start doing her makeup tutorials and she thanks me everyday because she loves it so much plus we do tic toks and also takes great photos!!! It’s a great product.
5,This product is easy to assemble and is a great product for someone just starting out with ring lights. It offers three different settings for lighting and there is a remote. The only negative I would say is that it can be a little tricky to get the expandable height concept to work. Other than that it’s a great product.

5,There are different brightness settings which is amazing when you’re trying to find the perfect amount of light. There are so many different attachments that make this product really worth the money. I love having multiple uses from one product. It’s easy to use and it can be adjusted to go wherever you need it to. If I ever needed another ring light I’d purchase this one again!
5,I was thrilled to receive this lighting.  I had one before and broke it. This one was much better and have several accessories that I hadn't existed for the price.
4,The remote is perfect! I really love this because I can do more Selfies.
5,I bought this light because my other one (not this brand) broke very easily. This one is much more durable and has a way better design.

5,I am very pleased with the product. The price was great and it is especially useful due to me working from home and my home having poor lighting when completing zoom calls. Would definitely recommend.
5,The brightness of the ring camera is absolutely amazing gives my photo life.
5,This is a great product! I use it to take pictures of my baby and the pictures come out amazing quality. There are different light color/brightness settings. The settings are easy to figure out.

5,Like the adjustable stand the different color filters. I have been using it with a mirror I have to apply makeup as well as video call.  Works great!
5,I had never purchased a ring light (or any lighting for that matter) and wanted something easy to use for photographing my grandchildren. This fit the bill perfectly. Excellent for novices like me but with enough features to keep me happy as I progress. Very lightweight and easy to set up/ disassemble. Would absolutely purchase again.
5,Bastante luminosa buena calidad

The light works great it came with many pieces even a bluetooth remote for pictures!  It has different settings for the light! The stand is completely adjustable! My pictures have gotten much clearer and brighter! Thank you for this value! Excuse my messy craft space. #goodiesbygonzalez
5,My son (8 yrs old) purchased this to use for videos that he makes for his gamer YouTube channel.  He primarily purchased it just to hold his phone in place while he records his videos.  After getting it he loves the light too.  The base is great since it's wider and doesn't tend to tip over.
5,Very bright and excellent for taking pictures of products!
4,Works great
5,Easy to use I haven’t tried all the lights but it’s been great.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I love it it’s very stable and bright makes my pictures look very clear and with great light.
5,I loved how easy this was to put together and how it’s so many different ways to use it I’m going but another for my work station
5,I bought this ring light for zoom interviews and I got a lot of compliments on how well lit my place was. It does a great job with selfies too. It was also really easy to set up!!! Definitely a keeper!!
5,This was my first ring light and I like the different lighting options and levels. It’s easy to assemble and it’s nice to have the Bluetooth remote. The things I dislike are the remote sometimes has a delay (need to click it a time or two before it takes the photo or starts video) and the phone holder isn’t very strong (doesn’t hold up iPhone 13 Pro Max very well). Overall it’s a good product for the price.
5,The ring light was easy to assemble. The Bluetooth shutter (remote control) is great. I had no problems linking it to my phone. Buying this light has made all of my pics better and brighter.
5,Excelente producto para la iluminaacion en la toma de fotografias
5,Great versatile light. I use it as a spot light rather than a selfie light. It works well.
5,I most say i loved everything about this item  from the easy assessment to the quality of the light pictures came out looking amazing.
5,The light was everything I hoped for. It works exactly as I need it too. Its brightness setting let's me adjust the brightness level and has 3 different colors. It was easy to assemble. But what I love the most is the height adjustments I do hair so it perfect
5,I really like this ring light  it’s really easy to carry around and put together!
5,This ring light and phone stand has worked great to take content pictures for social media and my small business. Super affordable and easy to use!
5,

5,Easy to use
5,I've just started my Tictoc this light is perfect at a great price. I love the brightness and the different light settings and of course the remote is a good plus
5,Works great for a great price. Gets the job done.
5,Love that I can pick if I want a more yellow light or a more blue light. Every time I use this for tik tok lighting I get an exceptional amount of likes. The detachable head is also so convenient for when I want to move around to get the background and scenery I want. Would recommend.
3,No matter how i fassen my phone to it it cannot support the weight not a big phone either... I think mine came too loose
4,No complaints
5,I love this product. The price and quality are amazing! The remote feature works well and I like that it is USB capable. My son even uses it for streaming.
5,This is a great selfie light and assembly was very simple.  Great price when comparing to other similar lights and I like that it has more than 1 use.  Could not be any happier with this product.
5,This is a great light for the value! I needed a light to do my makeup in my room and it’s great for that and also photos! Definitely recommend!
5,This is a really versatile light. I used it as a standing lamp besides my working table mostly and it's been great to add additional lighting for video calls. I also appreciate it being extra lightweight and can carry it around or easily move to a place to add lighting at the right angle. One small thing that's a pity is the sturdiness of its power line/extension cord. One day I found out it's broken and have to tape it around - there seems to be no ways to replace the cord on its own without damaging the light. So be extra careful of this Achilles heel when you use it. Then you'll be able to have endurable fun with the product. :)
5,I love how easy to assemble the product is definitely worth buying. The 3 brightness settings are awesome and I love that I can use the remote for pictures! Highly recommend!!!
5,I love this ring light. Works perfect for what I meed
5,I really liked that its easy to assemble it is also a plus that i can use 2 phones at once....
5,It is good for the price & it's easy to use. I recommend thus for anyone who is a beginner or needs something to start with. Super cool settings for different light hues.
5,I needed something to use for personal photographs and when I record videos for tiktok or narrating for people.  This light was literally perfect for my need.  I’ve been looking for one for a while this business came through!  Super easy to use and assemble too.  Nice and compact for travel!
5,Excellent product. I use it for my auditions photos and lighting during zoom calls. The adjustable brightness is great it’s easy to assemble and I love the remote that comes with it. Awesome product.
5,If you are looking for a ring light to just give you some extra brightness on zoom calls or while gaming this it is! I love how I can adjust the color and brightness as well as the height and use it for anything! Highly recommend!
5,It helps the clarity of your pictures and makes them appear brighter
5,I didn’t pay Attention to the size when I added to my cart. So When I received it I definitely thought it was going to be bigger. But still a great ring light
5,I love how versatile this item is.
5,This light has helped me get better pictures on my instagram. The warm tone is my favorite the remote fell apart though. All in all I love the product
5,I bought this rushing because I was going to be traveling and my old selfie stick broke. Turns out I get a 3 in 1 with this! Selfie stick ring light and tripod. It was definitely a fantastic investment! And all my recordings came out amazing for it!!!
5,Very good product for my needs. I like the differe t light settings. Very bright LED. Quick shipping. Thank you
5,Great Lighting but cellphone holder needs to be strong enough ring light isn't stable when you place the phone on the holder it wobbles/dangles too much.. But otherwise overall great product
3,I ordered this in November and now its May and I can say that this is a cheap product and ultimately a waste of money. At first it worked for what I wanted. I wanted the light and the stand to make videos for my business. However the stand is very hard to manipulate. Its cheapy and it already broke apart. I was able to put it back together. I also don't like how big it is. I don't want to break it down and put it away because it would be too hard to put it together again. I wish I could still return it.
5,I love this product because it’s so easy to use and set up
4,Lighting is a bit harsh but the 3 different colors are nice for different moods
5,I love how you can put your phone on the holder and use the wireless button to take a picture/video. I like how it changes colors: purple blue etc. It can be adjusted to various heights to fit your needs.Definitely recommend this product. Would purchase again.
5,I was looking for a ring light for conference calls and this one works great! Well-priced and gets the job done!
5,The ring light has 3 different lighting tones (from more white to more yellow) each for which you can adjust the brightness. I use the ring light to be well lit for online meetings in this work from home era. The light is super light weight and easy to use.
5,I like it it's light way it serves the purpose for going live definitely would recommend
5,In my honest opinion if you have a regular tripod to hold your phone and you just use this for the light purposes it’s great but the pieces that hold the phone don’t really work for the content i make and it doesn’t hold my phone in the right angles. But other than that it works great and the lighting brightness and different shades are awesome!
4,I liked the fact that i was able to assemble it easily and the product didn’t need to be used with batteries
5,Good buy! Great lighting love the remote and the different height adjustments. It’s very light weight as well so not too much of you need to transport it for any reason. It’s no to big not to small I think it’s perfect.
5,The ring light came neatly packed with several attachments and easy to follow instructions on how to assemble each piece. No issues with the remote. The light is bright and easy to adjust! I’d recommend this to anyone looking for a ring light.
4,My kids love it. Simple and easy to use and assemble. Brightness of lights is excellent and product is child/teenager friendly.
5,Bought for gaming purposes to stream and it has not been a disappointment! Very sturdy and easy to move as needed.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I had never used a light ring or a stand to film a video but this made it so easy. I own a business and wanted something I could use to make videos for my social media. It was easy right from the beginning and the video was better than I imagined. Th brightness was just what I needed to make everything visible and clear. Perfect for beginners and pros alike. I would highly recommend.
5,Gets the job done! I am able to make my videos and take great photos without holding my camera. Does what it’s suppose to do!
5,Used it for a bridal shower and was greatly impressed by the quality of the pictures. It was easy to use and assembled/ take down.  I travel with it just in case I need to get pictures of people.
5,Great ring light! I like that there are 3 different settings for the light. I tend to use the bright light and warm light depending on what I need it for. Really makes my product pictures look nice and bright!
5,I'm a little late to review this selfie ring light and stick but this is really cool. Works very well Lotta light with different settings. I am setting this up behind my PC screen for better lighting on my zoom calls.
5,It's what I wanted it to be
5,I have ordered many ring lights but this one has been by far my favorite. It is so easy to assemble and very sturdy. I use it for all my photoshoots and video content. Definitely is a must buy!
5,It’s a good ring light. Has good quality lighting for pictures. Easy to put together. I don’t like how the light holder isn’t adjustable to tighten so it won’t keep falling. Overall the ring light is good and I recommend it to anyone who wants to take nice pictures.
4,Works great
4,The brightness was really good but the remote control did not work sadly so my sister had to just use the buttons on the cord but overall was a good gift to get someone
5,I bought this to help me make YouTube video for my business and it works great! Set up is easy and I can take it anywhere!
5,Got this light to use for product pictures and it works great. Has different lighting options and comes with many attachments and is easily adjustable.
4,UPDATE(Nov2021): The ring light stand broke. It will not balance straight because the stand cannot stay in the middle securely. I’m not sure how that happened because I BARELY even used the stand and placed it in a secure safe area. I only had two good “self shoots” with this ring light. Need a new stand!ORIGINAL COMMENT: This light does it’s job and it is perfect for close-up photos. Assemble was pretty much easy I wish it came with written instructions Along with the pictures. I really love the remote that comes with it so you can have the freedom of snapping your own pictures without having to set a timer on your phone. It only works with my phone’s camera though the camera  remote does not work for any other apps such as Snapchat Facebook Instagram cameras. The stand is sturdy on flat surfaces and the height can be adjusted. The different modes of light brightness is also good. Overall this is a good ring light for its price!
5,excellent quality size height easy to install your remote control very useful I recommend 💯 and most importantly the price
5,Bought these for my teenage granddaughters.  They have held up great. I recommend and would buy for my niece.

5,The remote control feature worked amazing

4,Overall good product my 12 year old was able to assemble everything and he loves it!
5,The light is super bright and I love that it comes with a Bluetooth remote. You can adjust the height very easily and the phone holder keeps the phone very secure. Would definitely recommend!
4,The arm for the light broke on the first use. Should look at making it more durable
5,Great product!  I use it for my zoom meetings and teaching online in my very poorly lit office and it's great!
5,My favorite handy device.
5,This is a great product! Super easy to assemble with several options for use. I love the different lighting options as well as the ability to change the brightness.  The remote is probably my favorite part because it makes it so easy!
5,Bought it for a dual purpose to use it for pictures and also to stand the ring light behind my work laptop to help with lighting during zoom class. Love that it has light strength seatings and also 3 different light colors. SUPER easy to put together. I can connect it to my laptop since it’s a USB and power it on.
5,I always wanted a ring light but didn’t know which one would be the best. This one is exactly what you’d expect works well really bright easy to use! Good for the money!
5,I didn’t think this was going to be what I needed but it was more than I expected. This light was amazing. I love it
5,Got this for my son and as a birthday gift for my girlfriend's daughter and it's perfect!  Great price and just what they wanted!
5,This lighting system does exactly what I need!! Earlier this year I started a new business working from home and my days are filled with Virtual Calls to clients as well as the production of promotional videos. People comment on my production value and the sharpness of the picture. Without this system I would not be as successful. Could have spent more... but why?
5,Very useful light for our Podcast HandiKappin with Remy on Spotify . Several different settings help with background. Very handy and light weight.
5,I use this ring light for my YouTube videos and for my spa !! Great light
5,I like this very much. Use it for personal use
5,I didn't dislike anything. I use it for make up light and videos. I love that it have 3 sets of light.
5,I really enjoyed my ring light. It worked just as I expected it too. I usually use it when on FaceTime on my iPad and because I don’t have a lot of lighting in my bedroom. So it was perfect for me to use also as a only light source.
5,Liked how easy it was to set up and use! Could be just a touch brighter but over all great deal.
5,My daughter is on the TikTok trend and after watching her videos I knew she needed lighting. I didn’t want anything to pricey or complicated and something lighter she could set up easily without my help. This was it!Great buy and even ended up using it myself. Would buy again!
5,Really good for its price great lighting for making videos
5,I’ve had this product since Christmas 2021 and I have to say it’s a great buy. Everything is as listed. The only thing is that sometimes it overheats and has to take a short break but I find that as a plus because it prevents it from burning the outlet//using too much energy. I totally recommend this product!
5,I like this. Came with a lot of pieces. Functions well.
5,I got this light ring because of its cost--it's a very inexpensive option for me as I tend to do one to two Zoom calls a week. It's easy to use right out of the box. Within minutes of getting it I had the tripod set up. It's user-friendly: a twist at the joint and the stand extends to the height you need.The light ring easily screwed on to the tripod. You will need an adapter if you're plugging it into a wall outlet that doesn't have a USB port but once it was plugged it it worked perfectly. The attached picture shows the ring on its brightest setting. The light is brilliant and sufficient to bring out facial features while on a call.Once my daughters saw it was set up they borrowed it for a school Teams meeting. Their call lasted two solid hours with no issue. The tripod stayed extended the whole time with no issue and the light stayed at its full intensity with no problem. GREAT!We haven't tried the accessories yet and look forward to it. There are several holders for cell phones to plug right into the center of the light ring. We haven't tried putting a heavy camera on the tripod (the light ring is very light weight). It's a good product and you can't beat the price!
5,I like that a look just like the picture but I don’t like the fact that it’s difficult to assemble because the stick is weak . It doesn’t stand still.
5,Works great for taking try ons for my small business. Photo shown is taken at night and looks as good as our pics we take during the day. Super adjustable as far as height and angle goes. Remote works well and I like the different light temperature choices provided.
5,This product is very bright the remote is very useful  easy to use ! For beginners
5,Works great for what I’ve needed it for. Would recommend it to anyone looking for a nice light
5,Amazing quality. Really satisfied with all the accessories that come with it. It’s a great item for the price. I highly recommend!
4,The instructions aren't very well put together and are hard to understand. Once I got the product figured out it was easy to use. The "selfie stick" is included in the base of the tripod but it takes a minute to figure out where it is if you don't know what you're looking for. I think if the instructions were bigger and a little more detailed it would help with initial usage of the product
5,I bought this stand after my other stand that I bought from a different company broke on me. But this one is much more sturdy and easier to use! I really appreciate the sturdy legs and the light is a great quality!
5,This is the third ring light I’ve bought and it’s by far the beat one. It has different light settings you can switch remotely and an easily adjustable height. Definitely would recommend to anyone looking for an affordable ring light!
5,We recommend purchasing this product. Easy to assemble. Great to take pictures day and night.
5,I am Youtuber who those videos online.  I love the product and its has been helpful for caring out my task.
5,This light helps me have pictures and great videos. I love the different heights it can be how easy it is to put together/ take apart. Would highly recommend.
5,Love this light very affordable and works perfectly I take it everywhere with me  5 stars!!!
5,The lighting set is a little confusing but the instructions are good so I got it assembled in a few minutes the way I wanted. I ended up using one of the clamp on phone holders to hold a USB-A charging pack for cell phones. That way I can power the light and move it around without messing with cords everywhere. I like that the light has three different color temps. I usually do some testing on the subject and shoot with all three temperatures just to see what the different colors show when I get back to my editing workstation.I think this would also work good for a selfie light as the description suggests because the stand can get really short so it would fit on the top of a desk just fine. You can adjust the width of the feet at the base so you can squeeze it in between stuff on a desk or table.Overall I'm happy with the purchase this is a really inexpensive item and I feel it's also a great value. I am not a full time  photographer or vlogger or anything but more of a hobbyist... and this light totally fits the bill!
5,My ring light came super quick was really easy to set up and put together (under 10 minutes) and works perfect! Definitely worth the money!!!
5,I really enjoy this for taking pictures of my product! Very professional and easy to use!
5,I like this ring light. If I had to pick one thing that could be better it would be to have a longer cord but I got a usb extension to solve that problem . Over all great light and stand.
5,This lighting kit was a perfect gift for my friend who wanted to start making Tik Tok videos. It’s an easy buy for those looking to start making better lit videos and add their creative flare.
5,Light is very bright and is a great buy!!!
5,It was the perfect height for me since im short. My phone never falls over. And its really easy to store.
5,I love this ring light. It’s perfect for any height and perfect for videos and pictures. I highly recommend for all age groups. I was hard to please with other products but this one is perfect for me.
5,My daughter has had hours of fun by herself and with friends. Super easy to put together transport and use. She loves the remote control and ease of using. If you are looking for a ring light I’d recommend this product

4,Lo use para fotos de navidad muy fácil de montar
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I don’t like the fact that the string wire to the remote is fragile and the phone holder to the to the light is very fragile to but it is very bright and good for a ring light. I don’t have a picture because I already thrown it away because the cable remote broke.
5,This light has been working so good for my  business. Makes the quality of my photos just amazing
5,I did figure out a way to mount it so it didn’t sit on the table. Works great.

5,This was extremely easy to put together and the quality is great.
4,Overall I like this ring light and tripod. Tripod doesn't feel too cheap. It took me a hot minute to figure out where the selfie stick was because it came somewhat assembled already. It untwists from the tripod base to become the selfie stick. I have already used this light in multiple ways. I use it to get better lighting in kids pictures. I use it for recording my workouts to check form. I use this as a beauty light. The only thing that I feel would improve of it is to make it so it didn't have to be plugged in. Also you need to have your own USB adapter to plug it in. The remote has not worked for me. I'm assuming it's because I had another shutter remote connected to my phone so it isn't syncing properly for some reason. I still haven't figured that out yet. Overall I'm happy with my purchase and use this thing everyday!
3,Needed additional light for video meetings. This was not the answer. Just not very bright. Amazon return was easy.
5,Very bright!  Easy to use!  Would recommend 100%!

4,The brightness is perfect and it was very easy to assemble.
5,This is my husbands account but he bought the light for me. I primarily bought the light for when we take family pictures and videos. The 3 light settings are great and I love that you can dim them as well. It was also super easy to assemble. I LOVE that the tripod can be short or tall. It's very versatile. I also like that it has 3 different ways to attach phone/cameras.I actually also used the light to put my makeup on with and boy did it make a difference. So there are many uses for this light as well as being used for Skype/Zoom. It's so much more flattering than no light monitor light or a lamp.I had bought another light a few weeks earlier but returned it. It did not illuminate as well as this one nor did it have versatility for the height of the tripod. This BLOWS that light out of the water. Wish I would have had this light when my son was a baby. I took all of his pictures but adjusted lighting in post production. This would have saved me so much time.
5,I like the controls and everything else about it. Good quality and tall
5,This was a great investment.  I especially like all the attachements

5,This is very good product.my daughter uses it alot. And it's tough we've dropped it knocked it over and still works as it has from day 1 I'll buy another for sure
5,It does this job what I really like about the ring light is that it does cover imperfections in my face. Doing videos you wanna kind of look perfect in a way and although it’s not perfect it does do the job and making me feel confident. The ring light does move still a little bit I don’t know why but it can’t stay steady as long as you don’t move it too much.
3,It does not stand properly when my iPhone is attached. The weight of the iPhone  causes it to begin dropping down. I have had to tighten the nut underneath the ring to stop that but I'm afraid it's going to have a 'short shelf life' because of that.
5,Worked well to get my Etsy listings all set up. Loved the different settings. Great product for the price!
5,Great but slides down and does not stay at the height you want without sliding down.
5,The selfie ring lamp is AMAZING!!!! I must say that the brightness of the ring lamp is strong and bright. I have bought ring lamps around the same price as this ring lamp and either the brightness is not very powerful or the stand is not tall enough. However this ring lamp does not only have powerful brightness but is also tall! Definitely an amazing purchase for the price. I also LOVE the accessories that come with the ring lamp! I like that there are different ways to use it. I HIGHLY recommend buying this ring lamp. Also when it comes to buying electronics I am extremely picky. This item speaks a lot because I loved it the moment I assembled it and took my first pictures! Also the Bluetooth remote is handy!! Super easy to connect to iPhone and start clicking right away to take pictures. I also noticed that when I hold the shutter button down it turns into a video. Again very AWESOME BUY!
5,Loved the ease of having bring constant light and compact space. Perfect for travel.
5,Great item love it
5,It is a really good ring light with Adjustable sizes!

5,I liked the set. It was very useful and it was easy to put together.
5,The light was bright and it held my phone amazingly well and it was easy to put together
5,Love this light. It has 3 different settings for the light. Easy to set up
5,
5,I love this tripod. I like that you can adjust the height. Also it has different lighting modes which is also good. Overall very nice and I can recommend!
5,Easy to use and assemble. Lots of options with product customization
5,Great product. Everything came with it. The light is bright. Great for YouTube videos Snapchat etc.
5,Does what it’s supposed to do!
5,I enjoyed this purchase very much at first then I set it up and it would constantly fall because it was made with CHEAP material. It’s very frustrating. I had to put the glue that turns things into rocks to get it to stay. Quite annoyed tbh. Don’t recommend
5,This lights really great! Its helped my content alot!
5,This is a great starter ring to get set up with! Simple assembly and good light quality for the price.
5,I didn’t dislike anything about this product
5,We use the ring light for business purposes. To record videos & taking photos for social media. I attached a picture of an unedited picture taken in portrait mode using the ring light all by myself using the bluetooth control mode. It's super convenient portable light weight and sturdy. It measured up to all the details in the descriptions and additional reviews.
5,Easy to set up. Great quality for price.
5,Nice product that allows me to take great pictures. .
5,I love this product it is very bright and the quality is amazing.It was also very easy to assemble 10/10!!!🥰
5,Difficult to move around. The light is too heavy and not stable it keeps on falling to the front.
3,The only thing I didn’t like is the difficulty to keep the stand locked
3,The attachment that keeps the ring light and the tripod together broke. The screw or bolt (4.8) came out of the plastic piece. It is not supposed to detach . I had to tape it together until  eventually I was able to pop it back in. Hopefully it stays in.I've used it once for my Christmas party and it came detached the 2nd time I tired used it. Besides that the product is good I like the light and its very easy to use! :) The product is good for the price.
5,i got this as a gift for a my friend and coincidentally their boyfriend ALSO got them a ring light. This one was clearly better so i WON.On the real my friend said it was super easy to use and loved the gift especially how it came with so many accessories. they're smart so it's probably pretty great!
5,it works amazing and easy setup
5,This light helps me take before&after photos for like fitness purposes! I love it & all the light settings!!!
3,I wish that the ring light stand was more sturdy my phone would cause the whole thing to collapse.
5,Order for our 12 year old son who completely assembled alone and easily started using. Everything has a good quality of material and has been great for his “movies” totally recommend this to anyone young or old!
3,I wouldn’t buy this again. But I’m keeping it. I can use it for something.
5,Product is great  easy to use no troubles in setting up
5,I purchased this item for our girls they love it. We paired it with the FHD camera on Amazon works perfectly. Love the camera remote. Love the detachable rings added plus and the night of the stand is perfect and adjustable. The girls can grow with it as they are already tall for their age.
5,we needed something for youtube and also for pictures and this worked perfectly honestly. The lighting is just on point and when taking pictures it just looks so nice if you are looking for something to brighten up your pictures pun intended lol this is it.
5,Great ring light!
5,Love this light!
5,I really love this product! Not only is it good to take selfies but it also works as an amazing make-up light. I use it daily to apply make-up. I have been recommending this product to all my friends. It was easy to put together and the different high adjustments makes it easy to sit on my vanity for excellent light!
5,Excelente brillo el control remoto super facil de manejar y el montaje super facil.
5,Works as described
5,I enjoyed this ring light a lot! I use it for my social media photoshoots.
5,Great product easy to use worth the money
4,I've only had it one day but I have used it for a zoom call I was on last night. And so far I really love it! It is lightweight but sturdy. It was easy to set up even though I wasn't sure of the use for a couple of the accessories.  The remote is Bluetooth and I had no trouble connecting to my phone.  It has a small flat battery similar to that of watches.. The only thing I could wish for is that the lightring would hold a charge so that the light can be used without plugging it in. I know there are workarounds but being rechargeable would be very convenient. Very happy with this item!
5,So easy to put together. I love it that I can have it on my desk behind my iMac or on the floor whenever I need it. I was worried it would be too bright but it adjust perfectly. I also wear glasses so having it directly in my face couldn't happen but with the adjustable stand it works great behind my iMac desktop. I can not rate this high enough.
5,Perfect for the price and easy to put together. One of the best things I bought so far.
5,Originally purchased a ring light at Walmart for more with less features then came across this ring light and immediately went back to Walmart to return original as this one offered more colors settings modes and more. Been doing great so far and have had for 4 months with no complaints!
5,Use this for make up and it’s great!
5,as a tattooist i use this light everyday and it works great.
5,The reason why I bought this product was because I have a little family and it’s only us. We never have pictures ALL TOGETHER and I’m finally able to make that happen with this. The only thing I would suggest is a longer cord or somehow to make it cordless. But other than that I LOVE this product !!
5,I love to use this when making videos.  It gives the perfect light and can be adjusted if needed.
5,
5,My daughter loves it.  She has no complaints.
5,I love everything
4,Nice good product shines bright and easy to setup and use
5,This product has been great for me!!! It has brightness control to set the brightness you want and has 3 different light settings. It works great!!! Definitely Recommend.
3,Phone holder didn’t last long . Had a hard time understanding instructions
5,This product works great!
5,I love everything about this product
5,Love it will buy again
5,
5,Love this for doing my makeup in my room. I have bad lighting and this truly helps!
5,I love this product. The remote makes it extremely  easy to take the picture and is better then the countdown. Definitely  worth the money. Would buy again if I  broke mine and needed another. Easy to put together and take apart.
5,Does everything I need
3,The Ring light was real flimsy and would not stay in place. Phone adapter was terrible. But the lighting itself was great.
5,Great gift
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               El montaje es algo complicado pero todo bien
5,I love my ring light i use it for my small business and it works great!
5,Easy to assemble works great
5,I liked the remote the best!  We used it take family photos. No setting a camera timer and running to sit down. My daughter uses it to take pictures of her cups she sells.
5,Many different ways to use it with all the attachments included.
5,It works exactly how it says and it's a good cheap price.
5,All good
5,I bought this for my son so he could start his budding photography career.  He loves it and takes it on every shoot!!Everything was easy to assemble and clean up was a snap!
5,The only criticism is that the light seems to easily detach from the stand.  I’ve been able to reattach it but happens a lot.  Other than that it works fine just advertised.  Thanks
5,I got this for my daughter for Christmas and she absolutely loves it! Uses it on her own and anytime she has friends over! Great product and super easy to use!
5,This ring light is awesome.It’s very bright and works great. i highly recommend it.
5,I cannot get the light to quit flopping around.  Have to brace it with something or against the wall.  But do like the selfie stick part
5,I’ve been using the ring light to take more photos and it’s been such a good buy!! It’s stand can extend much taller than I realized and has been perfect for taking product photos and professional photography!
5,Purchased to take pictures indoors. Worked great.
5,I love this ring light!!! It’s super easy to assembled and the light settings on it are perfect for the type of lightening I want for my photos!! 10/10 recommend! Also the price is great!!
5,Nice and light weight. Love the color choices great selfie light.
5,The array of light hues and brightness levels is nice to utilize.  The remote is easy to use.  I use a small external battery to give it power so I can be mobile.  The stand has a lot of options but the locking mechanism on each level could be more sturdy.
5,Bought this as a gift for my sister for Christmas. She used it to take her progress pics for her weight loss account. She says it works great and is easy to use!
5,Great quality for the price
5,Works extremely well better than some of the other ones I’ve ordered off here
5,Easy to use! Love the brightness!
2,I don't know if it's just me but I couldn't figure out how to properly use all of the attachments. I tried for hours days and weeks and just could not get them to work how I wanted them to. The ring light itself works very well but the tripod and attachments need some serious work. I tried returning but unfortunately I'm out of the return window by 2 days.
5,Ring light is great it works well. Just wish it was a little bigger.
5,very bright perfect for photos
5,Great product
5,I love it!! Thank you so much.
3,The light works well but the charging cord is limiting because it is short and the attachment for your phone is flimsy.
5,Worth the price!!

5,The product is just as described. It works well and I use it often.
5,Perfect for what I needed!
5,Great product I use it behind my bed to make videos and read books

5,Love this ring light. It has made taking pictures very easy!
2,When I first received the product it arrived missing a piece. I sent it back and got an exchange. The second ring light I received was easy to set up and I was overall impressed with the quality however after only a couple of weeks the ring snapped off. I tried to put it back on but it was completely broken. I don't know why this occurred but I was very disappointed. Seeing that this was the second ring light we had received from this company I would not recommend this product. However everything else worked great. I had no issues with the Bluetooth remote or the brightness of the light.
5,i use this for my lives for my small business and it is PERFECT!
5,I love it
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Great product came on time and works awesome I use it to film tik toks

5,Bought this for my wife and she loves it for putting on makeup!
5,Love lighting 👍👍
5,Used for some phone videos. This was exactly what I wanted and needed. Washed the whole capture with light and was really customizable!
5,Exactly what I was needing for my webcam! I love that it’s lightweight I video chat with a friend nearly 100% of the time and I move around a lot. This is way better than my rather pricey dslr camera tripod way more simple and easier to use for what I’m doing.My friend thinks it looks way better too because of the ring light. I personally don’t like having a light shining in my face all the time but it does help improve the lighting.Lots of parts you can use which is nice even nicer that I hardly had to assemble anything. What I did have to assemble was straight forward/self explanatory nothing complicated which I appreciate.I’d definitely recommend getting it personally I think it’s underpriced!

5,She was very excited and surprised with this product. She uses it in making videos and pics for her business and for her VLOG. Great choice.
3,This product is ok. I will get by until I can afford something better. It is very lightweight. One of the legs cannot support itself so my tripod doesn't stand straight. I can correct it with the other adjustments but I am afraid of what will happen when I put my phone on it. Fortunately I really need it for a light. I can use the phone in another way.
5,It broke kinda easily it need better assembly instructions

5,Great brightness! Awesome light!
2,Could not even hold the weight of my phone I have an 11 pro max and kept falling over when I was recording
5,Light works great! Perfect for photo shoots. Looks very professional.
4,I bought this to use for video conference meetings at work. The light is much less harsh than the pair of unshaded (i.e. bare bulb) lamps that I had been using which were really hard on my eyes especially during longer meetings or multiple meetings in a single day.I took off one star because the power button does not turn the light completely off -- it just switches the light to a very low brightness -- so I have to take the extra step of unplugging it from the outlet if I want the light to be completely off. Otherwise it's exactly what I needed.
5,It was easy to assemble
5,This product was easy Tom set up and makes my pictures look bomb!!!!!
5,The best ring light ever. So satisfied with my purchase! This is your sign to get the ring light !! 🙌

5,I purchased the ring light for my job in social media and I was absolutely astounded by the quality and how easy it was to assemble. The directions were very well descriptive and the product was much more useful than I intended when bought it. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone trying to kickstart their social media Carrier or just have nice lighting for photos. You can use it for anything. 5/5  no complaints
2,Not worth it. Had to buy a new one only like a month or 2 after. Just not sturdy enough light quit working correctly couldn’t handle weight of phone. It was pretty nice before those problems though.
5,The lighting is perfect for use with my haircuts. Just a little lightweight but that’s to be expected with its size
5,this product was amazing. super easy to assemble and so worth the buy!
2,The weight of the phone tends to make the ring light portion lean. It's pretty annoying. No matter how tight I get the joint it still tilts most of the time. The rest is great.
5,The products worked as described! This was a Christmas gift for my girls to use for tick toks! They were very excited to use it and we’re not disappointed!
5,This was very easy to assemble and use. My teenage daughter loves it and uses it all the time. The adjustable height and the phone holder are awesome additions. Great product for the price.

5,Got it for my daughter she loves it and uses it almost everyday.. User friendly..
5,Todo muy lindo
5,I love it! The second I opened the box I was overjoyed. I had been in want of a ring light for some time now and was always combatted with problems like how tall it stood or how large the ring was and mainly it was the actual cost of the ring light that would deter me from purchasing. When I came across this ring light I instantly hit “add to cart.” The price point was exactly what I was aiming for as well as the height size etc. AND its portable and can change into a selfie stick. It’s perfect! Thank you all sooo much. Since I set it up I’ve been taking many more pictures.
5,The product is stable and works well. If you are in the market for one choose this one.
5,It was a perfect gift my girlfriend
2,Unit is NOT very sturdy.  Would not hold phone good.  It would tip over.  Would NOT purchase this product again.
5,I have this to my cousin for Christmas she is a 19 year old girl. She absolutely loves it
5,I enjoyed my time with this heavily
5,This does it all.  It is easy to set up and extremly portable. I highly recommend.
5,This is a great ring light! Super bright and the remote control works really well. I like all the height options with this one of the best ring lights I’ve had.
5,Great product
5,It was easy to assemble.  Bought this for my daughter for her tik tok videos.  She really loves it.  She really like to remote to start and stop her videos.
5,It was super easy to assemble  comes with alot of useful parts. My husband loves it.
5,This product was exactly as described in the listing.
5,Christmas was so much fun with this as we were able to take the best family pictures!!
5,This is a hood ring light. Only thing was it took me a while to figure out how to extend to make bigger. The flaps on legs to it. It’s really light weight and can easy break but if u are careful it will be fine. Overall good for price.
5,My son absolutely loves this product! It's an easy setup and is durable. Would buy again if needed.
5,Very bright
5,I purchased this ring light to take photos of my door hangers for Facebook and Instagram. I’m starting a small business and just wanted a professional touch. This was the PERFECT purchase. The settings are awesome you can dim the light the remote was super easy to pair and the assembly was a cake walk. They send you with a few different phone holders so you can use what works best for you. Furthermore you can easy break everything down for easy storage. You’re not just stuck with a giant stand light somewhere. I absolutely LOVE this and will be recommending this to so many folks!
5,Great product
5,I like it
5,Lo compré para mi mujer para maquillarse. Perfecto fácil de montar y de usar
5,Not only does it have a remote (yay!!) it has a completely bendable wand that can move 360 independently of the ring light. My other light did not do this and I can't believe I paid more for it. smh.... You'll love the brightness of the lights and did I mention the remote. Not only does it work with my phone's camera it works with other camera apps too. That comes in handy when you're doing a preloaded video background. You'll love everything about this ring light.
5,Great product for the price will tell others about it
5,I love how bright it is and that it’s retractable to different lengths. Perfect.
5,😊
5,This exceeded my expectations and did exactly what I needed it to do. Highly recommend!
5,Live it

5,I love this ring light!
2,It’s ok it’s just flimsy and ring light doesn’t hold up and kinda just fall back

5,Very good and nice product very brightness good quality good price good vendor fast delivery
5,Was given to my daughter for Christmas and she loves it!!! It's bright and works wonderful.  The only down is the stand doesn't want to stay up.
2,Apparently my iPhone 11 is too heavy? I have had it tightened multiple times and it just flops over. The tripod is not great for the desk because it’s too talk and flimsy and overall to not great when it comes to sturdiness.
5,I would highly recommend this selfie ring to anyone who is looking for one! Great quality.
5,Easy to assemble very light weight which is good for me and the lights are perfect. Good product good price. It’s what I was looking for.
5,It was better than expected!! My sister loves using it for her photo shoots.
5,Product arrived on time and works great. Makes my pictures look a lot better
5,This was bought for my daughter and she absolutely loves her light.
2,I know this isn’t the most expensive ring light out there but I was hoping for good things. After using the light for a week it shorted out. Not sure exactly what happened because it was staying in one place so all I did was turn it on and off. Upsetting but hoping they can work to fix this issue for future buyers.
5,Great gift for my granddaughter. Bright light and easy assembly.
5,great overall product and has helped so much with my content for social media. the changing colors is the best feature I did not know I needed.
5,Brightness is goodRemote is goodIt was easy to assemble
5,Easy to move up and down. Good lighting. Lots of features with this product.
4,The phone holder for selfie stick broke when I was trying to put it on my phone. A spring flung out of it and no longer stays. Wasn’t planning on using it on a selfie stick anyway. Instructions were hard to follow especially if this is your first ring light.
5,The only thing I dislike is that it is very difficult to setup
5,This product is great exactly what I wanted and was delivered in a timely manner ! Will order from them again ❤
5,I like that it came with all the pieces it mentioned and the light was pretty bright. It was great for my pictures.
5,This product was better than expected and works amazing. The light settings are perfect for any occasion. Very easy to assemble and also very sturdy. Super happy!
5,The brightness was what I was looking for. The remote is very convenient and assembly was easy. I love my ring light.
5,Bought this ring light for my 12 year old niece a d she was able to put it together herself and she loves it.
2,I like the lighting it gives but it refuses to stay still on the stick. It loses its balance because of the weight and slides down even after tightening.
3,Good product
5,Perfect lighting for the selfies and tiktok videos the kids love it!
3,The light has a great tone and brightness. The stand however broke as soon as I screwed the ring light on to it and attached my phone. I’ve spent the first three hours trying to glue it back together so I can use it. I guess there is a reason it was inexpensive.
5,Love the brightness really makes my skin glow
5,It was a gift for my daughter and she has had no complaints (once she figured out how to lock the stand). She loves it!
5,Just what I needed it perfect for my clients make up looks ❤️
5,Easy to set up and use.  Grandkids love it as gift.
5,The set up was easy and clean I enjoy the adjustable clips
5,No dislikes at all the light is everything I need it to be
5,This is super easy to use and a great product.
5,This selfie ring is great.  Just what we wanted and it works great.
3,This product is pretty good if you want a cheap light that will do the job. Some of the pieces that attach are a little cheap and break easily but overall it is pretty good.
5,This ring light is provided evenly distributed light for photos and video conferencing.
5,I use this light for makeup application and it works very nicely.
5,I love this for taking photos and videos as well as making TikTok’s and doing my makeup! Works great! Very bright and easy to transport.
5,Easy to use & great quality. My 12 yr old daughter loves it
2,I would NOT recommend this product... I got this light beginning of Jan. and it is now June and my light already broke. The cord has ripped and now the light won't turn on. I also am unhappy with the stand. You can adjust the height of it but those poles never stay put and always fall down. It is very annoying and again I would not recommend.
5,Love this product i use it about 2 times a day! AMAZING
5,I recommend this product to anyone looking for that special effect light
5,It is excellent very easy to use .. I love it
5,The lights and quality are amazing.  Perfect for videos.
3,It has a bit of a hard time standing the whole way up… Other than that its very bright and the remote it comes with works really well. Durability is definitely the low blow on this one.
5,Very good product easy to use grandson is using it seven years old
5,GREAT PRODUCT GOOD QUALITYVERY EASY TO ASSEMBLE AND THE LIGHT IS AMAIZING IT MADE THE HOLIDAYS FUN AND ABLE TO CAPTURE ALOT OF MEMORIES

5,Works really well as expected. Multiple lights abs ability to adjust height
5,My kids love it.  very easy to set up and works great.  i recommend.
5,Very easy to assemble and worth the value of your money
5,I don’t think all the pieces come in the box but the kids loved it. Stand should be taller missing a part.
4,The stick is not stable or maybe mines was an malfunction but other that the the ring is durable
5,the ringlight was exactly what I was in search of adjustable lighting and height.
5,love how bright my pictures are with the selfie ring lite

5,Easy to put together and works great.
5,The media could not be loaded.
5,I though it was pretty good. It’s just hard to get it to stay in one position but does the job
5,Wish it had changing colors and used for tik tok
5,Perfect for holding my phone and taking pictures! I love the two different light settings.. would deff recommend this company
5,Very easy to assemble overall great product. Would purchase again!
4,It did not receive a five star because the instructions are quite awful.Someone needs to write instructions that make sense. And print them in a font that is larger!!! This is for all products!
5,Muy util me sirve para poder grabar mis fotos
5,Very easy to use and great quality for the price
5,Great light for my daughter but the stand wants to fall back into itself making it hard to keep it up sometimes
5,Got this for my 13 yr old for Christmas. To say the least it was everything he wanted and didn't break the bank
5,Great product my daughter and I enjoy using it Light is bright has 3 different lightings easy to assemble. I recommend this product
5,This set has so many accessories and the light works really well with three different settings. I would buy a different tripod though
2,You will not receive all the items pictured.  The light is small and poor quality. I did not use based upon initial inspection very flimsy.
5,I bought this for my daughter as one of her Christmas presents.  She loves it. She wants to be a photographer
5,Ita good product but not real sturdy
5,Brought this product for my daughter and she loves it . She practically uses it everyday.
5,Great deal for the price. Lightweight but sturdy. Love all the accessories and the lighting is nice and bright.
5,The ring light is great for my office it has adjustable settings for brightness which makes it clearer to see very easy to assemble. And  I love that it has Bluetooth capabilities and a remote control for convenient  use.  Also the selfie stick is an added bonus too. I am ready to buy again…. Woohoo!!!
5,This product is amazing. It was a wonderful Christmas gift . It didn’t disappoint
5,Bright easy to use and different light colors
5,Super easy to assemble and love the remote feature
5,Use this ring light for perfect lighting on my Zoom meetings!
2,After 3 months this product stopped working. I have tried multiple different blocks for the usb and a variety of outlets but the ring light no longer turns on.
5,Every item in the box works perfectly light has pretty good quality me as a remote worker and streamer recommend this product.
1,I bought this ring light as a travel light and it had the best reviews. I used this ring light once. As I was setting it up one of the screws to hold the ring light seemed loose. I tried to screw it in but it’s impossible. I was really careful putting it away but the screw came out all the way. So now the ring light is loose on the stand and if I screw my phone in it just drops down. So it’s impossible to use this light for what I bought it for. I’m so upset I highly recommend you buy the Walmart version instead. Works MUCH better. This was a total waste of money.
5,Bought it for my teenage daughter to take pictures of herself. She loves it and uses it often
5,Strongly recommend! Great product!
5,I really like my item it was easily to assemble and use. I would recommend it to family and friends.
5,Product is high quality and preforms as we expected
5,Easy to use and provides what i need
5,Easy assembly with Strong plastics in a bright light
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This works so good
5,Happy with purchase. Multifunction as described would recommend.
5,First off I thought this product would be cheaply made and pieces missing like the reviews stated but in all honesty this item was made by design on its intended uses its quick to put together and the lighting is very bright but also can be dimmed even though I bought this item for the white lighting I love the cool blue effect lol and what I love the most is the little remote its a life saver 😊 over all great product for the buck I've been looking for a decent priced ring light 💜
5,Products are easy to use!
5,Really good product
5,It works great! I have no complaints. I use it to record workout videos. I love it!
5,My son loves this so much!! The quality and price are absolutely perfect!
3,I love the height
5,Seems pretty durable and has stood up to an 9 year olds demands! Very bright and can be adjusted so many ways!
5,Me encanto muy práctico y de buena calidad
3,The screw to keep the light sturdy does not hold the light up when the phone is connected. That is my only issue which kinda is a big issue since I need it to record but since there are other phone clips it's not a total deal breaker.
5,Easy to assemble and so many options.
5,I purchased this for a bday party. It worked great!!! Great buy!!! Would def buy it again.
5,I wanted some extra lighting in my makeup area but didn't feel like getting something fancy. I'm so glad I chose this set over the others! It's super beginner-friendly and it has everything you might need. I found it easy to put together. The base is pretty sturdy although locking the tripod rod extensions was a little tricky since you have to twist them into place. I didn't have any problems with my phone sliding out or weighing down the mounts but you might want to keep in mind the thickness of your phone case and the button placement. I think it's a good value! Simple and inexpensive. Overall I'm very satisfied :-)*Pictured is the neutral color temperature*
5,This was easy to set up. I like the fact I can use a power bank for the ring light even at the beach. This is so cool. I love the little remote in my hand that doesn't show when I click the button for the pictures. Great investment.
5,Easy to assemble
5,Es un producto de buena calidad excelente
5,Bought this for my girlfriend and she cant stop taking selfies…top tier quality for the price
5,Love the light and remote control
5,Love it
5,Easy assemble quick.  Very bright.  Love how it all connects with the phone. Pairing was so easy.
5,It's so easy to put together and holds my phone with ease! Great for tiktoks or Facebook Lives!!!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I loved the remote ! It was a pleasant surprise because I did not remember reading that it came with a remote. As a content creator this is going to make my recording so much easier! The brightness on all three colors is amazing! If you record videos or do makeup or anything that would require a ring light I highly recommend. And the price is phenomenal! I know my daughters are going to want one as well so I’ll be getting a few more of these lol. DO NOT HESITATE ITS WORRTH EVERY CENT!
5,My grand daughter loved the lighting this product gave her videos.  Thanks!
5,Loved this...it was a gift for my daughter. She loves it and its perfect for her tik toks.
5,So easy to set up and use!
5,I liked how easy it is to use the ring the assembly was easy and the lighting was great.
5,My son uses this to do his stop motion photography and he loves it. Great product great price!
5,Arrived in a timely matter.  My daughter uses it for you tube.  It’s a great product.
5,This product came quicker than i expected! and it is so amazing. The light is so bright! & It came with all the attachments. Looks like there is 8 attachments in the photo but the selfie stick is already attached to the adjustable tripod stand. the stand is so sturdy! and i was sooo excited that it came with the bluetooth remote. I must have skipped over that when i bought the ring light but to my surprise it came with the bluetooth remote to take pictures! amazing product and such a steal with the price!
5,I bought this for my son and he really likes it it arrived on time its a great purchase
5,Great Light. Easy to assemble
5,I like that there are multiple ways to set up your phone.  I love that I could use this small enough that I could put it right on my desk or stand it up on the floor.  I thought the ring light is very effective and gives a beautiful glow.  In any of the three shades. I also love the Camara remote. This was super helpful. What can I say it was easy to put together and we got a great stand out of it.  I'm very pleased for the price!
5,It’s perfect
5,Very easy to use can be plugged into any USB port(wall charger laptop/computer) to be powered.For the price you pay I expected it to be very wobbly or top heavy but that is not the case it is very sturdy.I am also very happy with how high it extends  just follow the instructions provided and make sure you're not over looking an extension section(I did that at first).Also the capability to tilt the light left right backward and forward helps with positioning it where you want.I have not used the phone holder myself but it does seem to be sturdy so you shouldn't have any problems with it.
5,This product is really amazing. I ordered two of them and they’re helping me with my art:))
5,Very happy
2,Cool set up for the price. What's going to use it for tattoos. It does not get bright enough for that
5,Very good product! Easy to assemble!!
5,Great product at a good price
5,I purchased this ring light for my daughter and she loves it! She uses it a lot!
5,Me encanto el brillo que tiene
5,You get what you pay for! This ring light provides good lighting and is easy to use.
5,I like the ease of use…..set up was quick…..the brightness is fantastic from high to low light
5,Product was a hit.
2,I bought one thought it was missing the selfie stick so returned it for replacement. Figured I was missing something. Reading the box and putting it together at the 2nd go around no selfie stick and no latches on the adjustable tripod m. Box says( 6)selfie strick but it’s part of 5the actual adjustable tripod.
2,Missing pieces
5,This light works just at described!
3,The phone wouldn't stay mounted and would fall off and it broke first use. The light is good though.
4,Él aro es sencillo solo que no tiene mucha fuerza y estabilidad no creo que soporté el peso de una cámara
5,Has excellent lighting capability. Works real well & very easy to use! Love it!
3,This product was okay
5,I received this product as a Christmas gift and I couldn’t be happier! This is the first selfie stick that I’ve ever owned and comparing this one to others before adding it to my “Christmas Wish List” I could tell that this one was the best product for the price. After opening the box and setting it up I was honestly amazed. The lighting adds amazing quality to your pictures and it includes everything you need to set your phone up to take hands-free pictures using the stand with the light the selfie stick and the tripod. It’s a great product and I would recommend it to anyone considering this purchase.
5,This was a great Christmas gift
5,This was just what my daughter was looking for. Affordable and user friendly! Would recommend.
5,Works great
5,I wish the brightness would be more panoramic. It’s very centered. Otherwise it is great.
5,Works exactly for what I needed it for!!! And love the different phone handles
5,I gave this to my daughter as a present. She loves it!!
5,Bought for my grandsons mommy. Great for getting a professional looking photograph
2,I used the product a couple of times and I did like it however the tripod broke after only using it a few times and I can’t use it without a tripod. I would not buy this product again.
4,Personal use!
5,Works like a ring light. So it does exactly what it needs to do!
2,Cheap and broke
5,I use this very often to take my pictures! Great lighting
5,I did have to Google instructions for set up but once found set ypu was easy.
5,Love that it's easy to use and the remote is a plus.
5,Super easy to easy and pretty convenient to have for videos and selfies!
3,I like the brightness it gave off and the 3 different colors. It wasn't sturdy enough for me. The top light kept flipping down and you had to make sure the poles were twisted tight. It's probably good for a teen or those doing light weight work. We are to busy for this product and need something more sturdy
5,The product was easy to assemble and it worked fine great for the price!
2,The holder is loose and tried everything to tighten it…even hurt my hands cannot hold long
5,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas she enjoys it a lot.
5,Easy to set up bought it for my niece and she loves it.
5,My favorite light!
5,I really like the way it brightens up the pictures. Love it.
1,I ordered 2 of these. I’m using the first one and after 5 min it shut off I noticed the USB was super hot. Let it cool down and it did it again but this time in 2 min. I use this plug and box for everything including other lights. It’s this product. I haven’t used the other yet but so far I’m really not loving it.I had one of these and I lost it. I loved that one and it was almost 2 years old with no issues. This one? Not so great.
5,I was searching for a decent ring light and this fit the bill and then some! It's versatile and all of the accessories are amazing. I can adjust the height the light strength and mode use it as a selfie stick and a lot more (that's just what I've used so far). I'm also in love with the remote since it makes it that much more versatile. I actually bought one for my sister as well and she's thrilled with it too!
5,The lighting is perfect...
5,I liked the compact size
5,The remote works great
5,My teen loves it!!
5,Love everything about this product!!!
5,I love this so much! It has so many light brightening and dimming settings. I had a mini photoshoot with my best friend and it's warm setting gave us the golden hour glow at 11:30pm. It took about 5 minutes to set up very easy the directions were clear. It also comes with a bluetooth remote that helps take photos from from distance and if you hold down the button you can rapid fire shots. I can't wait to take more photos  I will be definitely recommending this to friends looking for a ring light!
3,It fell apart after awhile and the instructions weren’t really clear on how to assemble it.
5,It’s a great purchase. Works perfectly for my zoom calls and insta selfies. I had a bit of a struggle during assembly coz the directions on the box and manual are kind of confusing. But once assembled it’s very easy to operate. My fave part is the rotating light which you can easily adjust based on your need as well as the multi-purpose handle/ selfie stick/ tripod (height is adjustable). The remote control is also an awesome feature!! Must-try item for sure!! I def love mine :)
5,Hot beans! This is a great product! the lights have a wide range of brightness the warm tone looks lovely and has "golden hour" energy the neutral tone is quite nice and if your highlighter is bright on your face you'll glow like an angel in a Citizen Way concert. The cool tone isn't my vibe but is just as good as the others. This is super adjustable and has a whole bunch of swivel abilities. It comes with 4 phone holders i only use one but the other 3 are very good extras in case i need them. The little clicker photo thing is also very cool and kinda a godsend.
5,Light works great! Perfect for all types of uses. Would recommend!!
5,This Is A Great Product Well Packaged Arrived Early So Happy With My Puchase
2,
5,This has helped me so much create things for social media. Thanks

5,Me gusta mucho el brillo y fue fácil de ensamblar.
5,Great Product
5,Very easy to use and great lighting. The remote is awesome
5,Product is great! Just what I needed.
5,Nice and easy to use!
1,Completely stopped working after a few weeks and just a little bit of use. When I first set it up it was flimsy and not super bright. It really wasn’t good but I figured I’d just use it anyways because I bought it and it was inexpensive. Nope.. should’ve returned it because this thing is trash and a few weeks later it doesn’t even work. Just invest in a GOOD ring light if you’re looking to buy one. I’d rather have spent twice as much and not received a piece of garbage
5,I really like the 3 brightness levels and the height can be adjusted.
5,Used this to take Christmas photos. Turned out great
3,Great light easy to use but in the end wasn't for me
5,Cool light frl frl
5,Was perfect for our Christmas pictures and is still just as bright

5,Bueno
5,Very satisfied
5,It was easy to assemble & the lights are great for pictures
5,A quality product easy it is to assemble and works great!The remote paired with no problems and at first I didn’t even think I would need it but I was wrong it makes taking pictures super easy. The directions are simple and easy to understand.  If you are thinking about purchasing a ring light buy this one! I promise you will not regret it.This has totally changed the way I take pictures you can see what a difference the warm and cool light settings make on pics the three color temperature options fit my most common needs. I definitely recommend it!
5,Great brightness and very easy to set up and use
2,When it worked it was great!  The stand is cheap but it held together just fine for the few months the light worked.  At about 6 months the light started flickering and within a week it stopped working completely.
5,I used this product to take full body pics and videos for tiktok
5,great product!
5,The shipping was fast everything works perfectly and it’s very bright.
5,Great ring light!!
5,I would recommend this light! Very good very bright!

5,I don’t have any pictures it my step daughter loved it
5,Bigger than expected lots of extra parts for different devices etc. I haven't actually used it yet but can't wait to try!
5,Works perfectly
5,Muy buen producto
5,Teenage dream
5,got it for my crushes birthdayhe loved it 10/10
5,My niece loves this ring light
5,it has levels to how bright you can make it.
5,
5,I needed to obtain a ring light to get more even skin tones for the many zoom conferences I attend.  I have tried a lume cube light and could not make it work.  This is a quality product easy to set up and gives a very versatile bunch of choices.  I especially like the ring light itself:  the color is easy to adjust and even at the higher settings the light is not too intense.  The directions are slim but adequate if you take a minute to review them.  I highly recommend this product.
5,Great product
3,The ring light and accessories that came with are ok… unfortunately the stand tripod is cheap and weak… not sure if I should keep this product.
5,I am a Pure Romance Consultant and I have to use a ring light to help my video's for virtual parties. Well this was on sale and I said what the hay I have purchased many tripods before and ring lights and none were this simple. The light is bright. It has 3 different lighting colors and  the adjustable height with shutter is AWESOME!! If you are looking for a new ring light look no further!
2,Was easy to assemble.Light was not bright like i expected.Average at best.Very tall stand.That was good.Never used remote.
5,I love this ring light so much Oh my god!
5,It’s perfect! Very sturdy and durable.
5,This is the first ring light I've bought.  I didn't want to invest in a $100 ring light right away and this seemed like a great deal and had most of the features I wanted.  Set up was very easy and I really like that you can choose between different color temperatures.  The bluetooth remote comes in handy too.  Overall I'm very happy with this and recommend this to anyone looking for a starter ring light!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Bought this light ring to help with lighting when doing mobile spray tanning. It's got several setting and the bright white is perfect for what I am needing it. It's got several attachments that are included and can't wait to use when doing a demo of a spray tan. Quality is excellent and the prices was great as well. The remote control has compatible with Android and iphone.
5,I love this ring light. Very easy to set up and the brightness is really good didn’t expect that. It has white soft white and warm functions and they can be adjusted either super bright or dimmed. Package came on time but I was missing one part the selfie stick. I contacted Amazon but due to my rush schedule I settled for a $10 promo code because I can’t wait for a new one. Overall the product is good.
5,Los diferentes colores y la iluminacion para tomar fotos y videos
5,My niece loved it light is great.
5,Highly recommend this ring light! I didn’t want to spend a fortune on a bright light just for pictures and this was perfect! Affordable easy to assemble really bright all of the settings worked and love the remote! I really hated using self timers so the remote is a life savor lol.
5,Really easy to use I would recommend
5,It's easy to assemble and overall easy to use.
5,I gifted it to my friends she loved it
5,We love the quality of the photos and videos
5,I use this to take pictures of my collectable dolls. I was previously using a separate ring light and phone stand and decided it was time to get one that was both. This set comes with a lot of different attachments and I really like that it has 3 light settings different brightness and can also be used as a stand alone selfie stick. It can be adjusted to multiple heights and it's just all around great for taking pictures of sales items dolls people and more. I highly recommend this!
4,For the amount of money spent the quality is great the light is easy to assemble and easy to use. My only wish is that it came with a stand option other than tripod because when you don’t need all the height it is a little inconvenient to place the light. All in all happy with my purchase it’s been about three weeks 8/10
5,Easy to use and sturdy
5,As described
5,it was very useful
2,Dislike it broke
5,Great product. Accurate description
5,I purchased this tripod because I needed to mount a webcam for video calls etc. This one has everything you’d need. The tripod can turn into a selfie stick. It has mounts for any type of phone or camera that you have and it also comes with a remote to take pictures start video. The price point is great as well considering all it has. I’m very satisfied. Only complaint is I wish they would have included a tripod mounting screw to connect a webcam or camera to the actual mount.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The brightness helps with my TikTok since my videos have been great
5,Very bright and convenient to use! I love it!
5,great product. bright lights. works perfect for my youtube videos
5,Very easy to assemble. Stand is very durable.
2,The "gooseneck" phone holder is weak AF and incapy of holding up a smart phone in fact it dropped my $15000 phone FOUR times. The right light keeps falling over so you can't get good angles for crap. Everything feels like cheap plastic and cheaply made. $40 for basically a pile of junk that will eventually break your phone
5,Is easy to use and the lighting is amazing.
5,Got for my daughter says it works great
5,Great Value and Great Quality.Thank you
5,Easy to set up and great light settings
3,So sad this broke after the 3rd use. Don’t tighten things super hard because it’s just light plastic. Sad because the light and the remote and setup were perfect. 😢
5,Great product! Lighting is great! I got this to use primarily during my video calls because of the poor lighting in my room and it has solved the problem. It comes with all the necessary pieces to be able to record videos phone if needed. It took a minute for me to find the selfie stick but once I figured out where it was I was good to go.
5,Good for traveling
5,Overall a great light. Can be used up close and can fit full body view from iPhone. Pretty bright overall. Didn’t set up remote but good anyways
5,We will be using this for our wedding photo booth! With the low price I was a little worried but this thing is amazing! Took maybe 2 minutes to set up and our phones easily paired to the Bluetooth remote.This is a quick photo my fiancé and I took after we set it up to test out the remote. Definitely worth the buy!!
1,The quality is ridiculously cheat. It doesn’t stay in place for long it always slides down to the shortest HIGHT. The phones wouldn’t stay str8 as well as if the phone is too heavy to it tip the ring light over. It’s way too much work to be trying to get it to be stable. Do not buy if you a 0 tolerance for fixing something over and over. Oh and light isn’t that bright.
5,Best purchase ever!
4,Brightness is great. Not the easiest to assemble and it really heats up if left on awhile- wouldn’t recommend leaving it on when no one is around.
5,Easy to assemble and just the right brightness!
5,Excellent
5,This light plugged into my laptop and worked right away. You have 3 different color settings and multiple brightness levels to help illuminate your face to create the perfect video. I use mine for zoom calls for work and it definitely helps create a more professional appearance.
5,Great product for making videos.
4,Ring light provides adequate lighting and the selfie stick/tripod wand though it can get stuck works well.
2,The light ring itself is awesome.  With the brightness control temperature selections and assortment of phone holder accessories- you can't beat it.  The tripod it comes with on the other hand.... worthless.  The screw that holds the light ring onto the tripod is not properly anchored into it's housing which means it pops out sending your light ring and phone tumbling to the floor.  This is a major design flaw that may be able to be overcome with some Gorilla Glue and MacGyver-ing might solve this but I will most likely get a better quality tripod.  If you're ok with spending the $40-something dollars on the light ring itself. then go on ahead.
5,Easy to assemble
5,Fun for my son. Just as expected.
5,The directions are a little lacking; but thanks to the large picture on the box front it's pretty easy to figure out how to set this Ring Light up.  I love all of the lighting options as well as the blue tooth remote it comes with for snapping pictures at a distance!The ring light plugs right into my USB port on the computer or in one of my wall jacks.  Lightweight and easy to move around and store!  Would recommend.
5,Honestly this was the Best Buy ever
5,What stands out the most about this product 2 things: the first being that the tilt item really holds the LED ring light in place where as other led ring lights either stand up or fall straight down! And the second thing being the light!!! This has been one of the brightest led lights I've ever had!
2,Could not complete set up due to selfie strick item missing therefore I cannot add the adjustable tripod stand to sit on.
5,Works great when recording.
5,Kids love it to make tiktoks
5,i absolutely loved this ring light!!
5,I was worried about the smaller ring but this light is awesome! It gives off enough light for me to do my live videos for my business! The remote gives you the different light options and there is a second blue tooth remote for you to take pics with ! The light is sturdy and holds my iPhone 12 with no problem. I do have to take my case off in order for I t to fit but that’s not a big deal.
5,Very good
3,Lo compré para regalar y la persona no logro al armarlo que el aro se mantuviera en su lugar
2,Too small to fit an iPhone in the center. Hing holding light and phone tilts due to weight.
5,Has my pics and videos looking fabulous ♥️
5,I’m using it for make up
5,Bright good accessories remote works great.
5,It’s the best light
1,I was so excited to use this. . . do some fun recordings reading to my grandchildren.  Couldn't get the light to stay up and when I added my phone the whole thing just dropped flopping the light down and the phone too.  The telescoping pole has only plastic twist tightening to keep it extended which didn't work too well and would especially with frequent use wear out quickly!  This is made of lightweight plastic with plastic tightening locks and the taller to make it the more flimsy and wobbly it becomes.  The weight of my phone made the locks slip and drop.  So sad and disappointed. . . literally almost cried.  And. . .could never get the remote to connect with my phone or my computer so that was a bust too!  The one good thing was the light was nice and bright and I liked the different color shades and brightness options.
5,I’m taking this on my cruise
3,Idk if my daughter was aggressive with the assembly but it had broke. Light front stand. Light still work. Good lighting.
5,Works great for photos and video
5,Easy to assemble.. fun time
5,Love the ring light very handy
5,Great for my 11yr old
5,Now that I'm working from Home I wanted some professional lighting for my numerous Microsoft Teams calls and this fits the bill. It was very easy to assemble and has several settings to choose from. I should have purchased this sooner.
5,Amazing product! Worth the money
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I read many reviews before I decided to buy it and I am happy that I did it. It is made with a very good quality and the circle ⭕️ light is perfect for me to live stream. Thank you. Highly recommend!
5,Easy set up works great
5,Love the quality and brightness!
5,I love this ring light! it was exactly what I was looking for and I’m so glad I decided to get it it comes with several things to attach along with it. I love the Bluetooth remote and it is small enough to hide in your hand so when you are taking a picture none can tell. It has has 3 light settings and you can adjust the brightness up and down. I am Very pleased with this product.
5,I would recommend again
5,It is very bright. Great product
5,I had been looking for one of these lights for the longest but many of them were too expensive. This one is easy to install and easy to use. The lighting is amazing and perfect for what I need it for. This is the only lamp that I noticed with a remote adjustable stand selfie stick different lighting options etc… for a great price. It’s definitely worth it.
5,It is easy to use
5,A little hard to assemble
5,Great Christmas gift for child.
5,Been using this for over a year to stream at least once a week. Works great!
5,Daughter loves it
5,The stick is broke
5,Nothing
3,A screw is missing on our tripod. We can’t use it unfortunately. The light is great though.
3,Es súper complicadoY solo trae un palo  es decir que no se puede usar el aro de luz y el selfie stick al mismo tiempo.Es difícil de armar  la luz es débilNo recomiendo comprarlo
5,Great product easy set up
5,Me encanta es muy buena
5,Helps take nice quality photos!
5,I have been wanting a ring light since my original one broke. I LOVE this one!! The light has different brightness options and the stand has different heights. It even can be used as a selfie stick. Perfect for me when I am on the go trying to capture pictures with my kids and myself. Also it is super easy to assemble. Would 10/10 recommend.
5,I love that this product is fully adjustable it is very versatile with many options for phone placement and angle. The 3 different light options and the ability to brighten and dim them all is great!! I also love the Bluetooth remote for your camera shutter! I am very satisfied with my purchase and have already told a few of my friends and family about this item. Highly recommended in my opinion!
5,Worked just as intended
2,Don’t buy this product it’s too expensive and the quality it’s not the best
2,Product is ok customer service is not so great. Was promised a $20 gift card for a 5 star review and no gift card was given. If seller send post card in mail promising gift card more than likely it’s not legit. Please leave a honest review
5,My daughter loves it
5,This product is soo good! Works exactly as described super easy to assemble and to work. The Bluetooth shutter is easy to use and very responsive. Very happy with this product highly recommend! Love the three different types of lights they work great!  I have an IPhone 8 Plus fits in the stand no problem even with the bulky case I have the phone in it fits into the stand no problem.
5,Worked perfectly
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 It seems small yes but the light! Omg! It is so breathtaking! I love way you can use it for anything (Selfie stick and camera stand). It’s easy to take it apart and put it back together real quick no hustle. Highly recommend. If I got my money’s worth I know you will too!
3,The tall tripod is flimsy and wobbles. The light itself is fine.
5,I needed this product to take better pictures for a manual I’m working on. I don’t have a photographer so this setup made it so quick and easy for one person to use. Would highly recommended
5,
5,It’s the best
5,I love it
5,I like the product lasted a good while but the end piece broke this is my favorite item tho.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I LOVED IT  just hate that weak behind lock to stand the pole up but it gets the job done 💪🏾👏😉definitely recommend if you love pictures like me
5,A perfect gift!!
5,Love this product..
5,Easy to use
5,Great product
5,I bought this light to help with taking pictures for my business. It’s perfect! I can use it for selfies product pictures & can use it hands free with the remote if needed. Has 3 light color settings that can be turned up for brightness or down.
5,Best selfie ring!
5,
5,I loved this ring light ! It was easy to assemble and came with a few add on parts so you could have something to hold your phone or decide between the ring light ! Don’t forget to have a Dnd piece to plug into the wall so the ring light usb can turn on . Would order again !
5,I love it!
5,While I wish there were instructions on what all the pieces were or where they go my daughter loves this ring light!! She had it set up pretty quick with the basic pieces that she needed. We bagged the stuff we didn't know how to use...lol. It's sturdy gives off great light and she likes the different shades and brightness options. It's also nice that it can be tapletop height or stand on its own and be her height. Great product.
3,I used this light a maybe 6 times and already the wiring is showing and it flickers if you move the cord.. far from satisfied.
5,It took a little guessing to put together at first but followed other reviews and pictures. I’ve been having so much fun with this set up. It’s just what I wanted AND a great price!  Easy to use. Lots of selections of lighting and camera heights remote control for pics and videos light weight and the stand turns in to a selfie stick. I’ve gotten many compliments that my videos and pictures looks so good!! I’m recommending to my friends.
5,Nothing
5,Its a great ring light for the price I love that it goes really high and it has 3 light settings. I also like that it comes with a remote control but psa it works only with the camera app! i overall love this purchase and I would definitely buy again.
5,We bought this product to use it for a family vacation. We were pleased to find that the ring light has 3 levels of intensity. The stand also allows you to adjust the phone stand to get any angle. Needless to say we loved it and would definitely recommend!!
5,
5,It provides really good lighting even after a year of use and the remote is really handy.
5,Did not come with selfie stick. Happy I don't need it. Everything else was good.
5,There are tons of ring-lights out there and ever since the Covid19 issue a lot more have come into being. Usewell's version has everything. No need to wonder about "what if I need" because you have whatever it is. This is definitely one of the best ring lights out there. For me the only downside was having to buy two because my daughter "borrowed" my first one.
5,Just received and assembled the selfie light on the tripod and we are TOTALLY impressed with the quality and how bright the light is. It was pretty easy to assemble and the remote control makes the whole thing very easy to use. Would definitely recommend and would buy again if we needed another.
5,Works great!
5,Great price Quick delivery easy to set up and use!Different lighting types brightness levels and intensities. The remote control is easy to set up too via Bluetooth and makes taking pictures by yourself super easy instead of having to set up a timer on your phone. I am happy with my purchase and recommend it for anyone who needs a lighting set up for vlogs or just nice pictures anywhere you go.
5,I got this for my virtual classes and work and it is the best! And when taking pictures or recording omg the remote is a plus!! I can adjust the lighting it has multiple accessories. Good quality and lightweight. I can use it everywhere is easy to assemble! I recommend this product!
5,This ring light is great and it shows in the quality of my photos. I love the Bluetooth capability and being able to press a single button to snap the picture. The light color options make it super easy to create whatever effect you desire and the setup was a breeze! I bought this for my wedding and I'm so happy with my purchase! Great price for the quality!
5,Good qualityeasy to put togetherI do recomend this product
5,Bought this to use on video calls so I don't have to hold the phone.  It gives different light moods for great lighting.  The remote allows to adjust the brightness of the light.  Can also use the stand as a selfie stick.  Do wish the outlet cord was a little longer. Other than that great product.
3,The set up was easy for the most part but then i realized that i was missing the selfie stick which is honestly annoying I was looking forward to having one.
5,Good product
5,My kid like a lot of kids wants to be a streamer. Luckily he is only 4 and right now the act of pretending to stream is enough to make him happy. We were looking for low cost methods to get him started and this fit the bill. Everything is easy to set up the lights are nice and bright and the adjustable sizes make it super easy for him to move around.
5,This Selfie Ring is a very good value and provides a complete set up for recording vlogs and videos on your phone with a nice group of adapters to hold the phone.  The brightness of the ring and lighting modes give enough variety for the novice person starting out.  A good purchase overall for the price.
5,I am so happy for this purchase because everything is complete with no damage. It is easy to use and install. It is everything I need ;all in one. Loved it
5,Great product
5,Good product
5,I absolutely adore this ring light it’s very easy to set up unlike others I’ve bought in the past and it’s is very bright and even has a way to adjust the brightness of it and different lighting types! It has a very handy remote control as well so it’s great for one person ! Would definitely recommend this one!
5,Divino 😍
5,
5,
5,Works great
5,Love it!
5,perfect
2,It’s not very bright and it won’t stay up right. I can’t put my phone down on it it pulls the whole thing down. It holds nothing up but the light and it’s pretty small. I’m not sure if I would recommend this one.
5,Love it!!!
5,So at first it was confusing because I didn't read the instructions but once I did everything made sense 😅  it stands pretty tall when fully extended and worked perfectly for my before and after pictures. I haven't used the remote yet but was actually super stoked it came with one 🙌 I would definitely buy from here again.
5,I order this ring light a few days before Christmas and it arrived before then. Definitely a plus. Setup is a little difficult but it has instructions on how to assemble and the different ways it can be used. I also like that it comes with a Bluetooth remote for pictures. Tripod is a little wobbly but I don't use it to the full length so it's no issue. Great product! Happy with my purchase.

But when I plugged it the next day it was fine that is the first time I put something together very easy and don't take too much space and very sturdy I really like it! It has different hight
5,Awesome
5,This product comes with absolutely everything you need to provide the perfect lighting for any photos or selfies that you need to take. I was surprised by the height that the ring light can extend to. It's sturdy too. Even at the highest height I haven't had to worry about anything toppling over.
5,If your looking for a cost effective super simple ring light this is perfect.Sometimes you just need a little bit of light in your life :-D
3,I was expecting a brighter light but it’s still easy to put together and comes with lots of parts. I love it when taking pictures of my clients makeup/nails.
5,I loved everything about my Selfie Ring Light ! Set up was very easy just take your time read the simple short instructions and pay attention. The remote is Bluetooth and connects to your iPhone or Android which is amazing and helpful as opposed to having to set timer on the phone. Definitely recommend this for any vlogger and selfie fanatic lol

5,I have never used a ring light much less a tripod for videotaping but wanted to have good lighting and qualify video for some facebook videos I was doing.  This did the trick and was so easy to set up.  My kids were secretly impressed while rolling their eyes at me.  :-)
5,Saw this on a bride page I follow on FB and had to get it! Had my soon to be niece & nephew try it out and they had a blast!! Can’t wait to use at our wedding on Sept 4!
5,I can add numerous phone cameras and go pro with all these attachments.Added selfie stick is amazing value for this price tag.The light is bright. Even the filtered settings emit a good amount of coverage.The twist and lock stand is sturdy but you have to be careful not to be heavy handedTaller than it's more expensive competitorThe remote works on my samsung and iPhone (iPhone is made with samsung parts
3,Works well but box was missing one piece. Light is good and easy to assemble. Not super sturdy but works for light usage.
5,I purchased this ring light because I needed something bright enough to be able to comfortably see my clients eyelashes when applying extensions. This ring light was at a great price for amazing quality and it’s very easy to assemble and travel with. 10/10 recommend
5,Easy
5,This is extremely easy to put together and the light is brighter than I thought it would be. Looking at it is difficult but not so bright that you can’t. The phone holder works great and doesn’t tip the stand over at all.  It is adjustable and the remote works great!! Would highly recommend especially for beginners who want to stream videos or absolutely fantastic for doing makeup.
2,Well the light works construction is not up to par. I could have found one cheeper and better put together at the dollar store. It works I guess.
5,Bright and love the Quality of my pictures now the light looks natural it is very tall for my height something that I was looking for and very cheap will recommend to all my family
5,I ordered this one because it had great reviews and was within my budget so I can take better videos and pics and I love it ! It’s bright enough! The 3 different light choices is perfect for different moods and settings. It has very great height on it so I can snap videos and pics from different angles and heights ! Love it so far!
5,Overall great product. It will get very bright on all settings if that’s what you need but you can also dim it down a good amount. I’ve used mine several times for my videos and it does what a ring light should!
5,It’s pretty easy to use but the directions could have been more detailed. Now the only issue I noticed was that the bottom pole slipped out of its place a few times. I attached a photo of the pole I’m talked about it almost looks like someone took and ice pick to the thing because I don’t think it’s supposed to look like that or separate from the black plastic screw end.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Beside the instructions being hard to understand at first I love my order. I took trial pictures and I love the brightness of the ring. It was so easy to connect the remote with my iPhone. And my Snapchat pictures came out flawless
5,I love this Ring light. It was easy to assemble the lights have three different modes and it can be dimmed if too bright. It comes also with a Bluetooth remote control for android and I Phones. It’s a great buy and I recommend.
5,Super easy assembly easy to use and turn on and snap photos/videos with ease. Sturdy as well and not broken. Well worth the money if considering a light for home shoots or video filming / streaming.
5,The media could not be loaded.
5,The ring light was super easy to set up. I was super impressed on the height. I still have not tried the selfie stick but over all it’s a great product and the lighting comes out perfect. Plus you can’t beat this price. Very satisfied with this product.
5,Gotten this as a present for my Neice and she loves it.
5,The only issue that I had is the phone holder that goes in the middle of the ring light is a bit too tall and does not sit in the middle of the light. I had to bend it slightly to make it fit. Other than that I absolutely would recommend!
5,The ring light is super easy to put together and use Bluetooth sets up easy and all the controls to the brightness and the warmth settings are on the power cord. I bought it to take pictures of products I sell and I’ve used it on a cloudy day and the lighting was perfect and very natural!
5,This light ring came in clutch for our family Christmas dinner! It was easy to set up and use. The Bluetooth shutter paired with both Android and Iphone. We had so much fun and the kids enjoyed taking selfies with this.One thing that made our pictures even better was turning off the main light in the room when using the ring. It gave our pictures a more professional look.
3,Great but make sure you get you your selfie stick because I didn’t…
5,Super Easy to set up and use! i didn't even need to read any directions! Its pretty self explanatory and i love all of the levels it has! Warm light blue light as well as bright white. Which is exactly what i needed for what i do. It also arrived way before its expected delivery date.  Im very pleased with my purchase and the seller! tysm!
5,I haven’t gotten the chance to test the remote but everything works really well so far and it came with SO MANY accessories. I got this for taking makeup pictures and for my bf to use while twitch streaming and we both love it. I almost bought and $80 one and I’m so glad I found this instead very happy with my purchase.
5,For the price point this is a great product. I will be using it for microblading and the lighting could be a tad bit brighter but it will work just fine for a first time starter and you can’t beat the price!
5,It does what it’s supposed to
5,Very good item comes with everything you need and all of them are made really well. Definitely recommend especially due to wonderful price since everything you need is included in 1! Very bright items made with thick plastic! Happy Customer Here! Ty for this extreme amount of products at such a great price!
2,This light is literally super cheap. It doesn't stay up!!! Very Dissatisfied
2,It wouldn't hold up the light but other then that it worked well
5,This light is such great quality! It’s very durable and sturdy. I LOVE that it extends to 60+ inches. I don’t need to balance it on anything or put it on top of things to make it longer. It’s the perfect length. The light itself is extremely bright and very good quality. This light for the price is INCREDIBLE. I’m so so so so so happy with my purchase!
5,I got this for my daughters 11th birthday and she loved it! I have a 70” one I use for professional photography and I know it’s the current wave with these young tiktokers lol. This is a cheaper alternative easy to use and an overall great starter ring light. 3 months later still working great no complaints. I’d recommend.
5,Liked everything except for base base is larger/wider than expected. but overall works well.
5,The light works great. Having control over the color and brightness intensity is perfect for anything that you might need it. Finally the included attachments are nice to have! Is not that you might need them but it gives you more options to use the product.
5,Love love this ring light!! I purchased it for pics but I also use it for my meetings! The brightness is great! I was a little skeptical at buying it but but I’m so glad I did. 10/10 recommend!!
5,I have purchased quite a few tripod / selfie stick combos and this one is far superior in terms of quality and functionality.  The ring light is very bright the tripod stand is secure and steady and the selfie stick is lightweight and very long.  Seller is extremely responsive and delivery was lightning fast.  Thank you!!
5,Amazing ring light! Currently using it for streaming and it works so well. I love that I can adjust the colors and brightness and it’s easy to set up with many attachments. I totally recommend to anyone who needs a great ring light at a very good price!
5,Product comes in a sturdy packaging. Remote control is a handy device to control camera shutter on your phone. Lamp size is good and it gets pretty brighter than I expected. Luckily there are different brightness level to choose from from the remote. Also there are three color options of light as listed in the description of this product. Overall happy purchase.
5,This product is perfect for Instagram pictures and videos. I workout in my garage and the lighting is awful. This ring light has helped me capture great videos and pictures of my workouts! There is a phone attachment piece and a remote that connects to your phone so you can take pictures or record a video when you are ready! I am recommending this product to friends.
5,We wanted to get a ring light for beginning youtube videos and twitch streaming.  Didn't wanna invest a lot at the start and this light was very affordable but puts out a great amount of light.  Being able to adjust the brightness was a big plus too.
5,I have been looking for selfie stick ring. I love this product as it is so light & easy to carry it around. I also like the fact that u can use different colors & able adjust the brightness easily.
5,Every live advertised seems to be in present and working order. The tripod itself has a good amount of height which is helpful for someone as tall as me and the different phone holders give a good amount of different options to play with!
2,Top mounting item will just fall over. The bolt doesnt make it any tighter so i will have to try and get it to stay in place with tape.One of the tripod feet are missing too.
5,Perfect
5,It meets my expectations and do like the remote control…I Don’t like that it has to be tethered to a power cord.
5,Great purchase for the price. Very happy with item. It comes with a couple different phone holder pieces but we can not figure out how to use them so we just stick with the standard one which is fine for us. We will continue to recommend and use! Wish it came with instructions for the additional parts.
5,This product is amazing. The super long extendable arm allows you to record and photograph things from all distances. The attatchments allow for all sorts of connections. The photos with this light are STUNNING. Not only that it comes with a remote to take photos on command when youre posing with family.
5,Great purchase!! Super easy to set up & use. Definitely recommend especially due to wonderful price. Happy Customer 😊
5,Great product for the price and many accessories for a variety of uses. This was purchased to help when recording science experiments for my students. The ring light is brighter than I expected and helps for what I am using it for.  Set up was quick and easy. Will be ordering a second one to keep at home.
5,The light was really bright just how I wanted it:) it was Alsatian easy to set up!! It was just perfect !!
5,I’m really happy with this! It was super easy to get set up and figuring out how to use it even without the instructions. I’m really excited to use it for product photography of my crafts. Definitely recommend this to anyone starting out or fooling around with photography.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I dislike how quick the turning parts broke. The like flickers and the control plug had a shortage the very first week of using it.
5,Why haven’t you bought this yet ? I Absolutely love this Ring Light ! I love the different settings to adjust the brightness and I also love how you can adjust the height  . Overall  it’s a great purchase and  I would definitely recommend this .
3,Item was not what I expected. But the manufacturer did reach out to correct their mistake.
5,Happy with the product. It was easy to assemble and easy to use. I love that it has 3 lighting modes and you can adjust the brightness. If your wondering where the selfie stick is... it’s attached to the tripod. You just have to unscrew/untwist it.
3,The light times out when it gets hot. The light will not stay on for hours at a time.
3,*updated review-After a few uses the tripod cannot hold my phone. No matter how tight I make it my phone falls off. It’s useless i cannot use it at all. Money down the drain.Super impressed with this product! As a business owner- I need to take my own videos- this stand is perfect! It offers different height options plus it turns into a selfie stick!Best part- it arrived the next day!So excited to take my content to the next level.

2,Ring light itself was bright but the stand does not carry the weight of my phone for instance when I tilt the ring light did not stay in position and often fell over.And one tip over has resulted in a piece not connecting to another crucial piece.It would have done better with weak magnets.Cheaply made and unreliable for its intended purpose.Spend the extra money and get a better one
1,This is my second one that’s defaulted. The first one’s lights were blinking. Asked for a replacement but never got to returning it because I travel for work extensively. The second on came in and the cord was broken. It’s cheap and you get what you pay for but don’t buy from this seller.
5,I look thru others review and pictures before purchase and now I got I am happy with it... don't look anymore I use this for sales on live videos and works great ...
5,Love that it's both a selfie stick and a tripod. The ring light is so big and bright and it's detachable so you can pretty much use it anywhere else for other purposes. Overall the materials are strong doesnt feel cheap at all.
5,I love this ring light. I love the fact that it’s super bright it has 3 different light settings and it could go as high as 53 inches. Plus I got it on prime day for a great price! I would definitely recommend this ring light:)
5,I really like the fact that I can quickly set up this kit in a matter of minutes compared to my previous light arrangement. This kit also takes up a lot less space than other lighting solutions. It can go from being dismantled and tucked away in a drawer to completely ready to use in half the time of traditional softboxes.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I loved how fast the product came. I only gave 3 stars for remote because I have to turn it off and back on for photos on snap and insta. But I like it
5,It’s very nice good quality. Stands tall or short. With a bunch of a attachments for your phone and a wireless remote to take photos. It’s a very bright light. Good for cutting hair. 10/10 worth the buy
5,This product was easy to assemble and use!Our organization purchased this product for our live stream Free Black History Ballet Dance Day with THE Lauren Anderson!It worked wonderfully well and allowed us to attach and use 2 phones for our FB and IG livestream.Thank you Selfie Ring Light🌞
5,I have a YouTube channel and my old ring light broke which halted my videos. I bought this one and it’s literally an all in one. Selfie stick ring light tripod. This thing is amazing I love it! Great product especially for the price. Favorite part is the remote control for shooting content.
5,I love this product. I owned a previous ring light and it was horrible. I love the sleek look on the light. The remote control is my favorite! And the brightness it perfect. One of the best ring light I have seen for the price.
5,There are multiple different settings for the ring light the remote is very easy to set up with your phone since it's Bluetooth. Also the tripod is also very simple to set up and has multiple attachments. I would highly recommend.
5,Super easy to set up and use. Instructions were extremely clear. Came with all sorts of attachments to use. We use the light for our puppy photos and they turned out amazing! The three options for different lums was fun to mess around with and made editing photos so much easier.
5,Excelente accesible muy buena iluminación con diferentes estilos ya sea luz blanca amarilla o media azul hace todo que se vea espectacular.
2,I thought this would be a nice one but it’s very cheap. The stand cut my finger as I was trying to open it &  it couldn’t hold my phone. Not very good for bigger iPhones. I sent it back & went to Best Buy. Cost $100 but it’s bright supports my phone & the stand wasn’t stuck. Paying for quality.
5,Guess I’m going to be taking a lot of pictures now. The brightness is amazing. I ordered it on Friday and I was supposed to receive it on Wednesday but it came the next day. The remote control is also easy to handle
1,I dislike the fact that it constantly falls each time I try to extend the STAND CAMERA REMOTE DOES NOT WORK. Will not recommend and the camera holder is not steady.
5,super easy to setup. i’ve taken the light on a trip and just took a portable charger and it has amazing lighting no matter the area! everything is easy on and off as well. the ring light comes with a bluetooth remote that works from a good distance for amazing pictures. 100% recommend this product!
5,A great simple to setup and use ring light for hosting Zoom webinars or meetings! The light temperature and brightness settings are perfect to find just the right lighting you need. Lots of accessories included too.
5,I really love this light it’s so perfect for my photo shoots. I love how it got a Bluetooth remote thought that was pretty cool
5,I was looking for a quality ring light and I'm  super glad I found this one. It arrived super quick it was easy to assemble and it's super convenient how it has USB plug in. Best; it takes really amazing photos. Love the options with the lighting! Would definitely recommend to purchase this if your reading this.
2,Ring light is the perfect size but the other pieces never came and I never got any kind of refund added to my acct
5,My granddaughter uses it for selfies and dance videos. She has  enjoyed learning to use it.
5,I love how easy it was to put together and use was worried I wouldn’t be able to navigate using it I was wrong and quality is 👌🏻 too!
5,The light set up was easy to assemble and use. The added accessories are helpful and allow for more creativity in terms of phone/camera angles.
5,My daughter told me about this itemInstantly bought it.. Came quickly and easily put together. I was so surprised it was so bright and fancy too.I will purchased another one for my 2nd home as well. Very glamorous...My happy light.Would not hesitate to recommend it.
5,What a pleasant surprise! So good I bought two one for each office to make working remotely for everyone in my household a breeze. The variable light settings are clutch and the ease of use is unmatched. Highly recommend you get one yesterday!
3,Its ok if you hit it slightly it will lossing it and make it fall it dont really like to stay up wish there was direction on what every attempt was and how to use them but other then that its a ok product
5,Great item and quality. I like the part where you can unscrew the selfie stick from the tripod base and move around with it. The only issue is that there were no instructions that this was possible but I inferred it from the pictures. Light is great and it makes quite a difference when recording yourself.
5,I've only had it since yesterday but I love it!  Does what's needed now I can take full body pics lol cuz my man suck as a photographer lmfao. I I also liked while holding the shutter button it even records snap hat videos.. Def worth the buy so far
3,The stand is not sturdy at all it has been the cause of my phone hitting the floor.
2,I just recieved mine today.  Everything seems to be working well except I am missing the small stick that connects the phone to the stand when the light is attatched
5,It’s a little complicated to understand all the extra pieces it comes with but I love that it includes so much. It’s a super helpful light  all in all a good product.
5,Wow.... I’m impressed. For the price this is super great quality. The remote control is a good idea and I liked that there are so many different accessories  so I can use it many different ways. This is perfect for us to take some photos for our wedding!
5,Teenage granddaughter lives it!
5,Esta todo bien
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Good lightweight easy to put together. Remote works good I use it with a Samsung S20 and works fine. Has different accesories to use in diferent situaciones light and recorder phone. Recommend.
2,As soon as I put it together n put my cell in the holder it broke.. it won't hold my cell from day 1 so I used my glue gun to fix it.. so far it has held but I don't use it much because I don't want it to break..
5,So many options out there! But we are happy we chose this one. Easy to use tall enough gives you three different light settings and much more. My daughter and I will be using it a lot for live videos. But as soon as we received it we played around with it. Thank you!
3,So the light by it self is good! I can hook a 🔋 pack and be fine. The stand was missing a screw and a selfie stick. I could have given a 5 star if it wasnt for the missing stuff. Over all you pay for what you get.
5,It's exactly what I need for my online streaming! It's not as bright as I expected it to be but it does the job. And I love that I can use it as a selfish stick too!
3,I like the product as a ring light but the selfie stick concept did not work for this.  It's too heavy and bukly as a selfie stick.
5,Perfect size!
2,unboxing all pieces were included. Feels like it’s sturdy. However when I connected the actual ring light and screwed it onto the pole when I went to adjust it according to the picture description that came in the box - The light fell off with a piece of the pole attached. I have tried re-attaching it and it does not screw onto the pole on this particular piece. So I can’t even get the ring light to securely stay on the pole. I feel like I wasted my money
5,I got this product as a starter kit for the vlogs that I have to make for my classes. It’s very easy to use the remote control is very helpful and it is a very sturdy product. I have a bigger phone so I was worried but it works perfectly!!
5,Love my new ring light. It was easy to assemble set up and bright enough to display my products. The selfie stick was missing but I'm sure the seller will correct this. Great product!
5,Such an amazing product! Love how easy everything was to set up very user friendly. Great quality and so perfect for someone like me just starting out & doesn't know what to get. All the work is done for you they’ve included all that you need!! Definitely would recommend!
5,This has everything I was looking for at a good price! I like how it had a way to use my phone or a camera. The light is pretty bright and I am so excited to be working with it.
5,I really am enjoying my new ring light. I use it to make live videos of my makeup tutorials to do my own makeup or on I clients! I especially enjoy the 3 different lighting chooses for pictures! I am extremely happy with this product! Will be ordering again in the future thank you!
5,Easy to put together and it works great!
5,I just received my ring light in the mail today. I love it! It's so bright but can he adjusted. I also like that it comes with different attachments. It's perfect!
5,This is amazing good quality! I want to get my friends one!!!
5,This product is great! Especially for the price. I bought two of these for my children for Christmas and they are awesome. Equally as good as the slightly larger much higher priced ($80) product I bought last year from another company. Very pleased with this order and my children both LOVE them.
2,It’s Hard To Keep In One Shot And My Phone Will Not Stay Connected To It .
4,So far so good.  Easy to use.  Hasn't been used a lot so can't comment on how sturdy it is.
5,The first things I noticed after getting it assembled was that it was very sturdy. The tripod stand was not flimsy and the light was very bright. This is great for taking any pictures if you need extra brightness.
5,for a fairly cheap price you get a nice adjustable ring light that can do warm or cold light. Bright to dim. the tripod it comes with works like a tripod but you get the added bonus of making it into a useable selfie stick! This product is a win for the price!
5,So happy with this product fully extended it's taller than me and I'm 5'1" the first picture of me is without the light granted it's daytime so the lighting in the room is pretty good but with the light in the second picture is even better can't wait to take real photo with it!
5,Easy to assemble and just what I wanted!  Many mounting options for your phone.  Light is great!
5,This light is absolutely perfect! With a great price and quality this light will get the job done! It’s prefect for any level of photographer! It also comes with many attachments!
4,This product is so amazing easy to use makes pictures come out so good. Would definitely recommend to anyone.
5,My wife uses to stream video games and she tells me it works great. Great price and comes with a bunch of accessories.
5,This was a great buy! Due to COVID-19 restrictions we weren’t able to spend the holidays with family in person. Using the ring light during our zoom calls made it a little more special. We were able to take the most beautiful family portraits using a simple cell phone! Great purchase!
1,I wasn't able to make the stand hold my phone up. When I tried it would lean down towards the ground no matter how much I tightened it. I emailed the company and was given a full refund which I appreciated but I didn't reorder the product.
5,This product is wonderful! it is very well built and so easy to put together and use! My kids love making videos and it is perfect for that! I received it a day earlier than it was supposed to come which was even better because it was a last minute Christmas request!
1,It always glitches and freezes on one of the rgb settings with only about ¼ the light lit up. Won't turn off when this happens so I have to unplug it and reset it
5,This ring light and stand is exactly what I was looking for. I love the different color settings and how easy the stand and phone holder are to adjust. Was incredibly easy to assemble too. Highly recommend.
5,The item was easy to assemble my son loves it and has already used it to record 3 tiktok videos.... he's only 5 ac was able to figure it out
5,It’s way better than i thought. The pictures don’t do it justice. its smaller than i thought but still works just as great. the only thing i dont like is that it doesn’t come with instructions to tighten everything or the attachments but other than that its great!
5,Very easy to assemble and great quality of brightness!
5,This is an amazing product that’s very versatile from a smaller tripod for a counter top to a full sized one perfect for group pictures!!I would definitely suggest picking one up for yourself if you need a great tripod or ring light for videos and pictures!!
5,using for zoom calls. makes a huge difference
5,It was literally amazing!! I used it for my online Zoom presentation and it was perfectly awesome!! Also I was able to fit my phone in it and take perfect bright selfies👍
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I was looking to improve the lighting on my vlog recordings.  This was the perfect portable solution and it gave me exactly what I needed.
5,I like the adjustability of this product. Makes my videos much more sharper. It is well constructed  easy to operate and well priced. I am a satisfied customer.
5,I purchased this light to help with my zoom meetings. With daylight savings time...I am always in the dark. This is a really good and efficient setup. The only thing I would like more is a tad more information on the setup. Thanks for the quick delivery and a great product.
5,Wonderful Product Easy Assembly once you Examine everything I love how there's a remote on the light and a separate remote to take pictures with. Very universal and easy to pack up and take with you anywhere! These will really make my cosplay photos even better!
3,It works. Not very stable though. Easily assembled but the pole doesn’t always lock in place with the twist and lock mechanism. Also I have an iPhone 11 Pro which seems to heavy for the mount so the ring light tips over during my self taped auditions. Super annoying.
5,This product is of very good quality which assembles easily and quick. I really liked the three colors available in the ring light. Also it comes with multiple attachments/holder for mobile and a Bluetooth remote which make capturing photos from anywhere where much easy. I would definitely recommend this product.
5,Everything was easy to set up and it works great. The light is perfect for photos and videos! It’s a definite must have for me!
5,I love the lighting and easy to assemble Bluetooth connected right away. It's perfect can't wait to use it on an a variety of fun things.
5,I like that it comes with a stand and I don’t have to set it up on my desk where I have no room.
5,I was skeptical at first and t sted for about two months now and pretty happy with it. Remote control is nice...I can take family picture and use it to vlog. The light is adjustable...and is good for selfie.
5,I love this ring light it’s perfect I can’t stay off TikTok and Snapchat now
5,This is a great ringlight. It's affordable too and it works very well with three different light settings.
5,I got this for my daughter for Christmas! She was so happy to finally get one! It’s very nice and sturdy! Easy to set up and use! She’s been using it to take pics and videos on TikTok YouTube  and other social media sites! She really loves it!
5,Fast easy to install.  Perfect light for all! Whether for videos pictures or selfies-You can get the best angles since the light rotates 360 degrees and the height/angle can be easily adjusted.  Bought for my daughter as a gift for her level up her YouTube Channel.
5,I was amazed at the quality of the photos I took using the LED ring light and stand. Our family photos taken during the holidays appeared extremely professional. The remote was the icing on the cake because we were all able to be included in each photo.
5,This order came super fast which was amazing because my last light broke. I am super happy about how bright it is and how well it stores away.
5,I love it! the instructions on how to install it was very helpful the details matter.
5,It was super easy to assemble. I honestly didn't even need the directions. Works super well and can reach as tall as I am. Super happy with this purchase
5,Has way more accessory than I knew I was getting it works perfectly and I love it! Love the different lighting levels love everything about it
2,I wasn’t able to use this for use of lash tech purposes
5,I love it! Lighting is bright Perfect to take pictures of my inventory for my small business and my models I recommend to everyone! Remote control is awesome to take pics on your own!
3,When I got this I was really excited to set it up and get started. I've found I can only use it on the lowest height setting. Nothing else locks into place.  Also I have no idea where the selfie stick is that's listed in the product info. So now it's become a table top tripod
5,This ring light is really really bright and it will be perfect for my Boudoir photography. It will light up the whole room if needed! I'm really excited about it.
5,It is exactly what I wanted. More than I could hope for especially for the price!!
5,I got this ring light set as a gift for someone and they absolutely love it. It comes with so many accessories and is ready to use right out of the box. If you're on the fence and shopping around I would highly recommend this product.
5,Great light! Awesome features multiple light colors and height- couldn’t figure out how to make it a selfie stick (probably would never use a selfie stick)  but still overall really happy it
5,I ready love my ring light. One of the best purchases I’ve made this month. You won’t be disappointed.
4,As others have said *Doesnt come with selfie stick as advertised* very flimsy but good for starters.
5,It was easy to assemble and attach a phone or digital camera to. The multiple light settings also helps set the desired mood. Definitely pleased with this purchase.
5,The brightness is perfect  I really like it . It makes photos and videos to look great.  It has the feature to adjust the brightness of it. It works really well.
5,Todo llego tal y  como estaba descrito el producto es de buena calidad práctico el control remoto super fácil de enlazar con el celular y funciona a la perfección  se puede extender  o plegar para ponerlo en una mesa. Muy satisfecha con la compra
1,It's feels cheap it's goes to high brightness and can't lower the brightness color temperature sucks. Tripod stands doesn't stand straight. Everything about is is cheap
1,This is how this was shipped to me. No clear instructions for assembly. Highly disappoint. Will be returning to manufacturer.
1,This cheap light broke in two days and wouldn't even stay up . Do yourself a favor don't buy !!
5,Very easy to put together! Brightness is perfect for doing makeup taking photos as well as vlogging. The perfect height perfect size and you get way more for the price. Overall its amazing!

5,All pieces came as promised. Nothing came broken  loved the light quality in each setting . It can get sooooo bright ! & that’s a plus !
5,Easy to assemble and figure out. The different lighting options are nice and each setting can be adjusted brighter or dimmer. Took me a minute to realize the telescopic pole on the tripod IS the selfie stick.
5,First It was well packaged and very sturdy!  It was super easy to set up.I bought it for our family trip and I am so excited already.I did test shot my photo came out very nice and clean~Thank you!!
5,We have been using for last 1 month and happy with the product.
5,Used excellently for zoom interviews
5,I like how bright it is but if I’m being honest it’s kind of hard to assemble assemble at  first.
5,No dislikes its easy to use and put together great for any project
5,I hate we waited to so long to open this but if you have a child or yourself interested in making youtube videos make up or just regular pictures buy this!!!!! Easy to set up and easy to use at a great price!

5,I love this!!! I accidentally broke mine from Walmart and I can use the ring light for both stands...who knew!!! Overall extremely pleased!
1,This ring light is the cheapest thing I’ve ever bought it Literally broke as I tried to assemble it… it’s not sturdy & it’s so thin and so light that my iPhone 13 Pro Max Was too heavy for it  & the ring light bent forward and broke along with the phone holder… it’s the worst product it should be sold on Wish!
5,I bought product for my kids and I fell in love with this product lol. The lighting is everything! I will recommend this for EVERYBODY
5,Everything is fine and I rated it a 5 star for sure but I'm just missing the joystick part everything else is ok.
5,I loved this product over the holidays when no one is there to take a pic.  We also used the light and it worked wonders on how the picture turned out.  Love that it can also be a selfie stick. Highly recommend!
5,I really like it! It’s my first time using something like this and I’m happy with the results and the quality I’m getting out of it! Def recommend it to anyone who is like me!
3,You get what you pay for. It's not the best. Some parts were missing others were just useless but the LED light is bright. The stand is flimsy and doesn't stay up but I didn't expect it to be that great considering the price.
5,Looks just like the picture. This was very easy to put together and the Bluetooth connected to my iPhone with no problem. I’m so happy to have this so my husband and I can actually take some nice photos before we leave for our dates.
4,easy to use a little hard to set up but after awhile you figure it out.
5,This is such a great deal. You get a bunch of versatility and they provide you with additional add ons to enhance your selfie.  I used this for groups photo taking and my daughter uses it to help make her videos better.
5,I like the remote control. This light has really helped me take more professional images of my art and design work for class
5,IT CAME SO FAST I LOVE THE LIGHT IT IS PERFECT VERY BRIGHT . SUPER EASY TO ASSEMBLE I LOVE THE FACT THAT IT COMES WITH A LITTLE BLUETOOTH REMOTE.WHICH IS VERY HELPFUL .
5,The different settings on the light was great my daughter LOVED it! It was just missing a piece which we returned and placed a order for a new one super easy!Love that it can be used on the table or on the stand!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             We loved all the different ways you could use all the different assemblies for all different purposes. We bought this for our daughter for Christmas for photo shoots and her Tik Tok's. She loves it!!
3,The attachment for the phone is fine but the ring itself sags under the weight of the phone.
5,I am in love with this ring light! The three light options come in handy and so easy to use. The quality of my pictures has improved I highly highly recommend purchasing this product I wish I could give it a higher rate 🤗🤗
5,The remote was a plus that I didn’t even know of lol. It works perfect and has multi use functions to it
4,Good item
5,I bought this for my son as he likes to go live on the web. He loves it! It works and does as it states it should. He said that everything works properly and it's a great buy.
5,The product itself is easy to use. The sturdiness of the stand is a little off depending on the type of flooring you have. Overall the product was worth the price I got it for.
5,I love the fact that it was easy to set up easy to use especially with the remote control. It is sturdy and manageable.  I was anticipating it’s arrival. The product arrived in excellent condition.
5,This ring light is a MUST HAVE it was easy to assemble and the pictures I took for my b-day came out absolutely amazing. Everyone thought I hired a photographer.
1,This product didn’t even come with the piece for me to attach my phone to the ring light I had to buy another piece to even do that and it’s not what it seems it doesn’t even turn into a long selfie stick it’s also not as bright as a regular ring light
5,I absolutely love this selfie stand with light ring.  It has made taking pictures of my products so much easier not to mention video.  Putting the light ring together took less than 5 minutes
5,I Love everything about ring light I love the fact that it's adjustable has lots of adjustable and add on attachments the sturdiness and portability exactly what I was looking for.  Thanks 😊
5,Simple assembly lighting kit that is great for staged social media photos. The brightness and white variations will come in handy for capturing quality photos for posts. What it lacks in sturdiness is made up by being lightweight and easy to move around.
5,Love it!! I own a galaxy z fold 2 and it withstands the weight of it. Great lighting and extremely stable.
5,I love this!!!!! The brightness of this light is totally up there! I love how it comes with different tools and you can use it anyway you want. I can’t wait to use this for my sister wedding!!!!
5,Gave this as a Christmas gift. Recipient put it together and started using it right away. Other family members tried it as well. The remote control was a great idea.  Good because of 3 lighting options. Probably the favorite gift received.
5,Very great products can’t wait to make a video with them. Ring light is bigger than expected! (Huge plus) and instructions were very easy to understand on all the different settings gs you get! 10/10 recommend.
2,the wire connected to the usb port broke very fast
5,I am absolutely in love with this product it’s what I needed at the right price. The height is perfect for me  the different settings in light are amazing. I’m already obsessed with taking pictures and now with this I’ll be no good.
5,Super Easy to assemble and works awesome.  The remote was easy to set up and use.  This is going to make my videos and lives so much easier.  Absolutely recommended.
5,Its incredibly sturdy after its locked. I am still figuring out how to use the remote but its a great addition. Its a nice ring light for a kid considering its nothing too big
5,It’s pretty easy to assemble the light settings are perfect for what I need it.Loving the brightness and how easy is to use!Definitely a great find!
5,I was so impressed by the quality of this product. My selfie game is gonna be on point now !! 😂
5,I liked the versatility and all the different positions and lights it has. Also I was impressed for the way it works even in a dark room. Excellent product for it’s price!
4,Good product but I actually thought I was buying the tall lamp.
5,The assembly was very easy and the instructions were easy to follow The light and stand are light weight. My videos and pictures come out amazing! The pricing was affordable and well worth it!
2,This is falsely advertised because it does not come with the selfie stick that is promised. Save yourself some money if you’re interested in the selfie stick because yes it comes with the other parts which is awesome. I just wanted the selfie stick for outings but 🤷🏾‍♀️ We can always get a refund.
5,Selfie ring light is very easy to set up. It has a very bright light with brightness and light mode . It's light weight and ready to be used anywhere
1,Flimsy tripod. I have tape around mind bc it cant hold weight of my iphone 🙄
5,This helps with filming for content updating quality head shots and easily able to transport when traveling !
5,This is my first ring light stand and so far I'm loving it. The lighting settings are great and there are a few different phone holders that grip the phone really well. Love the remote also overall great for the price.
5,We mainly got this for family photo shoot. the Bluetooth synced perfectly with IPhone. The light is bright enough. This came in handy for a last min interview for our uncle. The quality looks fine.
5,I bought this Selfie ring for my son and he is happy with it so far.It's a great product for the price.
2,I think my iPhone 12 Pro Max is too heavy for it the ring keeps falling with the phone on it. What a waste of money
1,UPDATE: After leaving a negative review I started to get harassing emails from the company demanding I change my review. They kept offering “coupons” if I did it. No I cannot be bribed to change my review for a cheap product that broke immediately and continues to be a waste of space. Says a lot about the company that they’re willing to buy you off with a coupon in order for you to change your review to higher review without actually changing the quality of the product itself.Wish I had opened this during my return window but now I’m stuck with it. The screw stop doesn’t even stay on—it’s “set” in a molded space for the bolt and easily comes apart. Can’t even hold the light up! CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP.
5,Arrived earlier then expected  easy-to-use lightweight love the light settings and how easy it is to assemble and to top it off the remote works great with both of out phones (Android & Apple).Best purchase I've made so far
5,This ring light is great. Love the lighting. The stand is a nice height and the remote is easy and makes taking that perfect picture easy. A must buy.

5,Love it so far. I am terrible with putting things together and would have liked better Instructions but that could be me.I think it’s a good  value.
2,Product was good and easy to assemble. I purchase it for my teenager and it broke the first day if use.
5,Good lighting. Instructions weren’t that clear to follow and didn’t know what to do with three of the pieces but I think I figured it out. I like it.
5,Me gusto mucho este equipo. Facil de ensamblar.Muy buena calidad para el precioLo recomiendo
5,Really good Selfie Ring like I was thinking and expecting! Easy to use and set up!
5,Great for the average social media user  perfect for much-needed lighting for some pictures. sturdiness on the other hand is decent could be better but it's what you pay for. overall great product!
5,I liked all the attachments. The clicker to take pictures with works great and is easy to set up on my phone thru Bluetooth. My 12 year old loved it and all her friends love using it!
5,It’s very light to carry and just an overall good product especially for the cheap price
5,This product is AH-MAZING!!So versatile!! Adjustable stand several different phone holders light settings are awesome! Very sturdy. Remote control is so simple to use. You will not be disappointed with this purchase!!!
5,I’m very satisfied with the product very easy to assemble the remote control works perfectly the light has different intensity on the brightness and it works perfectly.

5,I loved the variety of options the ring light has for brightness and type of lighting. Easy to use. Quality product.
5,Received it fast easy to build all pieces came in package. Also customer service is quick to respond to questions or messages.
5,The light is bright has a lot of different brightness options colors and is built very well. By far the best price I've seen for what I was looking for.
5,This is an amazing light that I now use for all of my videos. It works exactly as described. Easy to assemble sturdy and inexpensive. All of my future videos will now look amazing thanks to great lighting!
5,This ring light is great! I use it for online meetings and pictures. Has three light settings that you can dim. It's pretty versatile and portable for anything my you need.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Easy to assemble and use.. very sturdy.. my 16yr old loves it.. and Now I Want one For myself but bigger lolGreat for a starter Kit. Ps.. MOM
4,Quick shipping. I little unsteady but does the job
5,So easy to use and set up. I felt like a photographer just look at the photos I have taken with it haha. Very beginner friendly also. Great buy for a great price and lightweight but sturdy.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I don’t know what tripod everybody else received with their ring light but my tripod will not stand tall and it’s as if the weight of my iPhone 12 makes the ring light itself fall as well. I have tightened every knob is tight as it will go on the ring light and they both keep just falling. I will probably be returning and that sucks because the actual ring light isn’t the problem it’s the stand.
5,I’m happy with it. The remote works well and it was super easy to put to together.
5,This is perfect and does exactly what it says it does. I liked having the different types of “whites” to chose from.
5,Purchased it as a gift for my girlfriend and she loved it. It is perfect and just the way as described. The pictures come out awesome and it is worth every cent.
5,Good light for the price easy to connect smartphone or camera to.
5,Great ring light for a great price. Was easy to setup as well. Loved that it came with a remote.
1,Product broke in less than a month of using
3,I didn’t get the selfie stick as well but I guess I don’t need it and the picture directions were not helpful  I couldn’t figure out how to put it together so I just put it down for tonight  maybe I will try and figure it out tomorrow .
5,Love this ring light! I needed something simple and fairly priced and this one was perfect! I especially like the warm setting.
5,excellent!!!!
5,Using this light for additional lighting for makeup. Superb quality for the size and weight. Love the remote!
5,got by order earlier then expected.  Looks just like the picture. This was very easy to put together and the Bluetooth connected to my iPhone with no problem. I’m so happy to have this ring
2,Worked decent for about a week but if you plan on moving it up and down or anywhere it will break. The pole is very flimsy and broke within a month.
5,Good product for recording videos. The extending feature is good. The different ring colors and intensities make it convenient to use.
5,Very nice for pictures and videos. It’s also easy to assemble and very affordable.
1,None of the parts hold their positions which makes it difficult to use in studio or in the field.I’m afraid the selfie will drop my iPhone  because the neck won’t stay tight or in place.  I am returning it for hopefully a better quality product
3,The stand was great but the light arrived broken and I was never able to turn on the ring light. Luckily for the project I needed it on I didn’t need the light.
5,Easy to set up and use right out of the box! The ringlight is a great size. Bigger than ones I have had In the past. Would definitely purchase again.
5,I love this Selfie Ring Light.  My pics are sharp and there's a noticeable difference.  The remote allows you to take pics from far away.  i would definitely recommend this to anyone.
5,Works great
5,Very cute exactly what I needed for my tiktok videos. I've been wanting a ring light an this is perfect
4,Works great and easy to assemble.
5,This is exactly what I needed as a musician. With Covid 19 cancelling shows I can at least make good quality videos for my followers. This is perfect for all my content and making sure I look fabulous!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I like it’it’s easy to used very good quality .It has tripod with selfie stick....Anybody can make easily YouTube Video and TikTok  Video etc.

5,This is the best ring light ever
5,Bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter and she loves it. It's super cool and very sturdy. Awesome for her to make her tik tok videos and videos for her YouTube.
1,I bought this ring light to take pictures of my products for my Etsy store. It lasted for about 5 pictures. Easy to put together Yes. The light works. Remote control is a great feature as well. But..the extender pole no longer "extends" and the "adjustable" ring light doesnt stay in position and falls over! I cannot use this piece of junk. Cheaply made. Save your money.
5,I really like this. It arrived quickly and ready to go.
5,Love how tall this can get perfect for downward angles at full height. Only complaint is there's no way to really lock it in place unless you twist hard but that's honestly not an issue.
5,It works exactly as described highly recommend
5,Very bright perfect lighting. This is all the equipment I need to start making videos. Great product!
5,I love the versatility of the product easy to use this was a great Christmas present!!! This is just what I wanted you no longer have to ask anyone to take your picture!!!
1,This is a very cheaply made ring light. The stand is not sturdy and the ring is small and plastic.The light is not bright at all. Save your money and purchase a good quality ring light.
5,The brightness is really good and the remote control feature is really nice! I like it !
2,The piece that holds the phone was broken so I never got a chance to try it. Returned it immensely.
5,I love it.. its bright.. it holds multiple cameras and is very flexible & easy to put  together..
2,The remote won't connect with my phone and the light only works in one color (yellow). The yellow is fine but I really wanted it for the white light.
5,My family loved it. I got it for a nice Xmas picture and it turned out clear! Also helps to get little babies attention which made the photo even better!!! Thank you!!

5,This product could not be easier to assemble or use. All of the great features and functionality of similar products that are twice the price. Would definitely recommend.

1,I was going to use it for makeup videos but the bottom stand is so wide it will not sit in front of me on my makeup stand. It's also not sturdy cheap plastic. I can tell the knobs will strip fast.

2,Works for what u need it for
5,I love it 🥰!! I can’t wait to use it
1,Broke same day trash!
5,I am amazed by this product the price and all the material inside
5,One of my greatest purchases!! I love this and the selfies I get with it!
1,The light came missing the bottom piece to the base so it is unsteady.  The screws are what sit on the floor.  The legs barely open and are at least 2 to 3 inches shorter than the base and therefore has absolutely no balance.  As far as the 360 rotation you can forget about it.  It is so top heavy and since it is unsteady leaning the light down will topple over the whole thing.  You must put something under the legs in order to use it.  I am so disappointed as I waited so long for it.  I can not send it back because I need a light right now for my home business and so must make due and order a new one from a different supplier.
5,Easy to assemble a very bright I like the  remote control option
5,I would recommend this product. It works good and does everything it’s suppose to do. The light is pretty bright.
1,It was the worst purchase ever the ring lasted one week . The cable broke I have to trash it . I’m very disappointed . I wish I tops a picture of the cable completely  teared I wish I had asked for my money back but I’m in a trip in colombia and couldn’t do the videos i planned because it broke at the begging for of my trip
5,Perfect for home and office use. Love the adjustable lights and multiple options. Great value and price. Thanks

1,The media could not be loaded.
5,Easy to use and easy to connect to iphone
5,Good ring light
1,Cheap price because it’s a cheap product.  The remote didn’t work straight out of the box.  Replaced the batteries and that did nothing.  Contacted to seller never got a response.  Half the time the light doesn’t want to turn on because the cord is loose.  I have wiggle it around for a good 10 minutes to get it in the right spot for it to turn on.  Don’t waste your money.

5,Just as describe perfect gift

5,The light gives the perfect glow and pictures come out radiant.
5,This product is AMAZING and versatile! My children love it.
5,Super fast delivery and high quality product!
1,My package included everything except the selfie stick. Amazon warehouse workers seem to never do quality checks on orders before sending them out for delivery. On the brightest setting the light makes an annoying low high pitch ringing sound! Hopefully I can return this overpriced ring light for a refund. Ridiculous.

5,Very sturdy ring light lighting it AMAZING!! And most definitely worth ever penny.
5,Great for the price. Easy to assemble and use!
1,The quality was beyond terrible. Not only did the ring light break within a day it also couldn't hold up my phone with the accessories that was included. I also didn't receive the selfie stick that it said was apart of the bundle.The worst part was that the tripod would not lock properly and would just randomly drop the entire ring light and my phone with it. Definitely stay away from this product.
5,It’s very bright and I can use it for my makeup pictures!

Very unprofessional in my opinion. I thought I was getting a brand new light not something used because of it was new why would the main piece be missing. I want a replacement or my money back God knows how to do that
1,Had it a week and it broke.
5,Nice product and the light is very bright
1,when i opened it i put it all together right n turned it on. worked just fine for 5 MINUTES!! right after it wouldn’t turn on absolutely disappointing right after being excited of getting it

5,I loved the ring light. Just as expected

5,Easy to assembly and made here happy
5,Very nice product. Nicely made.
5,Amazing product! Was a great Christmas present!
5,Like the product
5,Loved it
1,When my package arrived and I unboxed it there was already this random phone piece attached to it with no way to get it off and no way to attached the actual ring light to the stand. Looking at the instructions this piece isn’t even apart of the assemble process. Clearly it’s been used before and I didn’t even get the right pieces. I’m 100% getting my money back. More irritation than what it’s worth.
5,Highly recommended
5,Love this
5,Great Product loving my new light!
5,Love this product..
5,Lovely
1,I used the product for lighting and taking pictures. One day I was about to take a picture when the top part where the light and phone is held broke in half.! All I did was try to place my phone on the space provided and it broke!
5,Good and affordable
1,No es fácil para montar

1,This ring light broke the day my grand daughter opened it. The light itself fell to the ground. It's held together with a plastic nut. Basically the light sits on the nut. Please don't waste your money on this item.
1,Missing selfie stick
5,Easy to use
1,This was terrible!  I wish I new if we could send back or exchange for a better one.  Christmas came my daughter was so excited she pulled out content through out the box only to find a broken product and inturn she was heart broken her own self.  I'd like to know if this can still be returned for a product that isn't broke
5,Easy to use
5,I liked everything!

5,Great product!
1,I like it but won’t working good long is broke after use 1 months old
5,Sturdiness
1,Worst product I’ve ever purchased from Amazon.Tripod accessory attachment point broke during assembly rendering the item useless.Seller will not accept exchanges or returns.Attempted to repair product using JB Weld PlasticWeld after discovering seller would not exchange or refund to no avail.Price has increased by $3 since I purchased it.Not worth $27.99 much less $30.99.Would give 0 stars if I could.Avoid this seller at all costs.
1,It was not what I expected
5,Like
1,It’s very hard to get the stand to stay up. Cheaply made. Definitely not worth the money. Try another one.
2,Was supposed to come with a selfie stick and did not have one in order
2,It was missing the part that connects the light to the legs.
1,I thought the ring was bigger then i was received.
1,The connection piece to the ring light broke in 2 days.  Then the screw at the base of the tripod came out and could not go back in despite hours of working on it.  Very cheap made.
4,Great product
1,I would order this again or tell a friend
1,Got this for my daughter for Christmas. Didn’t even make it a month. I was beside her when it broke so it wasn’t as if she was hard on it. Do not buy!!!! It’s trash and waste of money.
1,When I was setting up the stand the poles kept sliding down even when locked. Then when I put the ring light portion on with the phone holder it wouldn’t stay up because it didn’t have enough support. Then when I tried to turn it on the light portion didn’t work. Pretty bummed /:
1,This thing came in and the stand wouldn't stay upright kept sliding down. The ring light itself is flimsy and CHEAAAAAP. I can't believe everyone gave this good reviews.... this is the worst one I've ever owned and it's going BACK 2 Day!
1,Really cheap and it broke really fast :(
4,Everything is fine but when you plug in the phone with the light on its head can tilt down.
2,The light falls down a lot. It's not a sturdy light. Wish we could return.
1,Cheap and broke in 2 weeks
1,It broke so easily!!! It shouldn’t have broke with just a bump so I had to replace smh
1,Very flimsy do not buy it cane with missing parts
1,Product failed as soon as I tried to assembleCan’t attach ring light to pole.Contacted Amazon they advised for me to go thru multiple steps to contact sellerI’m taking this as a lossBuy from another seller
1,It didn’t come with what it said The only thing we got was the tall stand but other than that we did not get everything it said that we were supposed to Very disappointing
1,It is not very well made… thin and flimsy and it actually broke while I was putting it together.  I still use parts of it but not as intended.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Snapped in half after using it once and the light stopped working and kept flickering
1,This product did not come with all the parts advertised. It did not include the selfie stick. The adjustable tripod broke the first time I tried to attach the ring light. Total waste of money.
1,Very hard to assemble I believe I didn’t have all the parts that were shown in instructions so it was hard to follow also when I thought I had set it correctly it fell apart so do not buy wast of your money
1,Cheap quality. Used it like 3 times. Remote already not working when extended it’s not sturdy.
1,Both times I got this it broke
1,Update...I original gave this light 5 stars but am now giving it 1 star. I bought this light in Feb 9th and today is Aug 10th it has only been used about 10 times  I have tried to reach the seller twice now for it to be warrantied but still have not received a response. Do not buy this light  the seller will not answer if you need to have it replaced.
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS! the description says that this works as a selfie stick as well. it does NOT! the USB that you must have plugged into a power source to work 🙄 is completely defective and will not plug into anything. the directions are shoddy at best. it gives you multiple ‘phone holders’ that don’t even work with the tripod/supposed selfie stick! worst $37 i have ever spent. the reviews are WAY off.
1,When using the light it didn't make much difference
1,Light works fine. Cord is a bit too short but the worst part was the folding stand. It broke while I was folding it up after the second use…
1,This thing is lighter than my phone and its so poorly constructed that it doesn’t even stand without collapsing every 2 seconds. I had to put tape around the joints so that it wouldn’t collapse on itself.It’s incredibly cheap. Not worth the money
1,I’ve never had this happen with anything. One of the inserts to the base is worn and keeps falling off. I hate I bought this!
1,Do not buy. Item’s stand does not stay up it’s very cheap and didn’t work.
1,Ring Light is  great how ever the full stand is so awful it broke within two mins of me figuring out why my i phone kept falling down I guess it was too heavy  stand bustedPay cheapGet cheap 🤷🏽‍♀️

1,It’s junk. The light works but the stand is cheap and flimsy. It didn’t stay steady and broke when I tightened it. Spend money for better quality.
1,I’m so disappointed with my order. I just got my product and I was super excited to assemble it. It was broken and so I can not speak to the way it works because it’s broken 😑
1,Very cheaply made. Missing parts. Can't believe they are sell this cheap thing for this price. I was expecting better quality for that price..
1,Missing pieces can’t even use
1,It came already broke don't recommend
1,This thing is cheap. Might as well set fire to your money. It won't even stay together long enough to use. Such a waste.
1,The light is super bright and I love that the equipment is sturdy.The company said that if I wrote a review and gave them five stars that they will give you a gift card and they did not hold up to the promise
1,The ring came irreparably off 3 days after we took it out of the box. Buy from someone else.
2,Very disappointed!
2,Cheap quality a piece broke that connects the light to the stand.
1,Purchased product in late February received product only was able to use for less than a month and product broke unable to return because it broke right as the window to return closedI don't recommend  cheap plastic. Very flimsy and not durable at all....Save your money
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. It is an absolute P.O.S.💩…literally the worst product I have ever purchased on Amazon. Scam alert!!!!
1,It didn’t workworst product

Just wack. I had to double check on if I “reorder” or was sent the wrong thing. Either way I’m not happy.
1,I would have been pretty happy if it didn’t arrive broken. The only other thing is it’s not very strong / sturdy to hold the weight of My phone.
1,I did not receive the selfie stick in my package so I cannot fully set it up. I will have to return unfortunately.
1,The phone holders are not big enough for a galaxy s20
1,Disappointed missing the selfie strick! I want my money back
1,Worked great 2days than all of sudden stop work So annoying
4,Get what you pay for. Did the job.
1,Broke first time it was used
5,One of my family members had this selfie stand at an event and I fell in love.  I was gifted the selfie stand for my birthday and I absolute love it.  The brightness makes my skin glow and you can go wrong with any of the lighting options.Love the fact that I can take a full body selfie with the remote.However  it can be seen depending on your pose when doing a full body.  I forget to turn the remote off so the battery life probably won't last long.Overall if you love taking selfies this is great for individual and groups.  This will also be an asset if you are a photographer.
5,I like how it is very easy to take out and put away
5,I USED THIS DEVICE FOR FAMILY PHOTOS

5,….
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I use the selfie ring almost daily for Zoom meetings IG and other social media.  It is easy to use the lighting options are awesome and its been a few months and it works great!  I would buy another one as a gift for family or friends.
5,I love the product and I use it as a phone stand and to read my chat from my stream hands free

5,Very good
5,I loved this product it was amazing
5,Nothing but good
5,I was very excited to have gotten this ring light for Christmas from my best friend. It has very strong brightness and was simple to set up! Very great product!!
5,Great product easy to use! Looking so much 'brighter' on work calls now!
5,Pictures are so nice
5,So I bought this because I needed something in order to take our engagement pictures as we are on a tight budget and we're doing the pics ourselves. I was drawn to this because it had different light Temps and brightness as well as a phone holder and wireless remote. The ONLY thing I wish it had as well was a battery or something. It was hard to figure out how to use it away from a power source.Assembly was fine. The phone holders were incredibly difficult to figure where and how to put together and use.It's a little wobbly but you'd expect that as it gets super tall and is very light weight. The remote is super easy to pair to your phone and is accurate.I would recommend this!
5,I bought this for my nephew for his birthday.  He loves it and uses it in his streaming and youtube videos.  It was very easy to assemble and was exactly what he was looking for. Score points for the best aunt ever.
5,So bright
5,I enjoy the product. Very affordable as well! It was fairly easy to assemble. Easy to to use once assembled. I love that there are multiple ways it can be set up. My favorite quality is the fact that there are a few different colored lights and not just one.
5,A very great product at a good price all my friends loved it too I gave them the website to order . I will order more very happy with product.
5,I loved my light! I was so sad when the cord broke from the light switch but I sent them a message and they immediately took care of it! Good customer service is what I look for most in a company and they are top notch!
4,Easy to set up! Just be careful when closing the legs back up metal attached bends easily.Easy to use great lighting folds up nice!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I love the fact that it allows you to use a remote to make changes. It’s super bright
4,This light is CRAZY BRIGHT! The only thing I wish is that there was a light type setting on the light instead of filters and diffusers.
5,My husband bought me this light and it’s perfect for my vanity.
5,Great product performing better than I would of ever expected for the price. Assembly was super easy and it’s size fits perfectly in any backpack or satchel.
5,Great product. Love the different settings of life. Only issue I have is adjusting the height of it.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 My daughter fell in love with it soon she saw it. She said now her tiktok will be perfect.

5,I like the brightness and you could move it around don’t take a lot space
5,Me agrado todo

5,Very great product I would recommend to anyone looking to purchase such product. Love the remote
5,I love the different color settings as well as the brightness variety. It goes a lot taller than I thought it would and it came with so many other attachments that are useful for other things and tripod stands as well- a plus! Also cool- my laptop doesn't need to be open for the usb part to be plugged in and power the ring!
5,My son-in-law has always want this product.  We gave it to him for Christmas and he loves it.
5,This was a gift for my daughter who does you tube content. She loves that she can use her ring light at different levels.
5,Got it as a gift and they said it works great
5,Me gusto mucho el aro tiene buena luz trae varios adaptadores para el teléfono buena calidad me gusto!
3,Easy to assemble my 10 year old did it and set it all up no problem. It’s a little flimsy and the chord isn’t very long. The light ring is easily seen in my glasses but as this is my first experience with this type of product I can’t compare it much with anything. I’m a little disappointed but I’m going to try to work with it.
5,I bought this for my daughter who is a budding influencer. She loves it. It has made everything a lot easier.
5,It was a gift for Christmas. Easy to assemble and set up. Adds good lighting and helps to take good photos.
5,Easy to assemble and easy to use! Great material and sturdy!
5,No dislikes use it for make up and pictures :)
5,Got it for my wife she loves it. She has to use it without her phone case because it's super bulky but very nice product
5,I love it!
5,Best purchase ever made. Worth every penny
5,It is easy to use and set up.  The quality of the pictures taken was remarkable.  Very dramatic prints.  I would buy again.
5,The light was good
5,It’s was very easy to use and assemble. Remote felt a bit cheap but otherwise it’s a great product. I would recommend it

5,My daughter use the light for pictures
5,Great for creating good lighting for videos and photos. The controls are easy to use and it's also easy to change the different shades of light.
5,I liked the easy setup for the light and the remote control worked very well.
5,Easy to use and bright
5,Loved everything of it
5,good quality lighting simple to use
2,Different light settings but not worth it
1,I was so excited about this but the piece that allows the ring to mount on the tripod busted almost immediately. There’s no way to use the apparatus at all now. I’m so disappointed.
4,I opened the box and showed comes with the selfie stick and when I opened it it didn’t have the selfie stick.
5,Bought it for the circle light then I realized all the other pieces that come with it and now we use it as a selfie stick and a tripod for family pictures.  Such a great multi use purchase
5,it was confusing at first to set up but after a second i got it. it’s super bright and super easy to use. the remote control for the camera works amazing and is super discreet so it won’t show up in photos unless you want it to. i plan on using it for photo shoots for my business and i can already tell it’s going to be amazing!
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I dislike the fact that it will not stand up on all three legs and that it supposed to without the help of my children's support I also dislike that it does not come with a frame over the lights and I also dislike the second part of the phone holder I believe it's a tablet holder but it doesn't expand so yeah it's like I wasted my money
1,It got here broken
5,I was impressed with the overall quality of this device and I was surprised by how easily the Bluetooth remote worked. I bought this device to take better product photos and I think it helped a lot.
5,I recieved this product fast and it was easy to assemble. I use it to take out photos on my clients while working. My pictures come out very clear and this is such a big help when putting on my makeup. I recommend it to all my friends
5,Es perfecto en tamaño y su luz es muy buena tiene 3 cambio de luz y perfecto  en su tamaño puedo hacerlo de varios tamaños y las fotos quedan perfecta buena inversión
2,This was brought as a Christmas gift for my son who’s a content creator on YouTube and social media. He was unsuccessful in assembling the product because the selfie ring would not attach to the selfie stick. It looks as though a piece is missing at the connection or he received a defective/broken product. Unfortunately he didn’t try to use it until after the return date. Although the ring light works we’re really bummed he’s not able to use it as intended. 🙁
5,This was really easy to assemble. Took me about 10 minutes to get everything set up and plugged in. Super bright and for this price it is definitely worth it.
5,Very good product!
4,Easy to use
1,The ring light itself is fine but the stand is AWFUL! It constantly collapses down because of the twist motion to fix the height. So any adjustment to where it’s physically at usually makes it collapse. Also when adjusting height it’s the same problem because you adjust one and which then loosens another part. It’s just way more trouble than it’s worth.  The stand itself also leans and falls all the time which has lead to the light breaking. Also because it’s holding my phone I risk it breaking it with each fall. Save your money and get something else.
5,Love it! It’s easy to setup and use. Not flimsy at all!
5,I use this all the time for selfies and live-streaming! I keep it handy in my living room for whenever i may need it. Very sleek and doesn’t take up much floor space at all.
5,I bought this for my daughter for a Christmas present. She absolutely loves it. She used it the 1st day to posts some TikTok videos.
5,This was a great purchase. The versatility of devices you can use is awesome it comes with different attachments for phones. The remote is really handy for selfish and my daughter is excited to make videos.
5,Dope and easy to use. I would recommend changing the stand.
5,Good lighting
5,Bought for my partner for christmas! can’t wait to see their reaction to this gift!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I didn’t know the selfie stick was in the holder blonde moment!But great I love it can’t wait to do my cooking videosGreat customer service!
5,Ring light is awesome works great and actually is bigger than I expected. I would highly recommend this for purchase.
5,Light weight but good quality.  Easy to use and fun!
5,Number one It looked like something I could use. Two the price was right. Three it was delivered in a day. Four everything unpacked well and Five it is exactly what I thought it would be. Its relatively sturdy selfie stick  accommodates an extended "reach" for a mounted camera and therefore feels a little heavy. It is actually relatively lightweight for its strength at full extension. The Bluetooth camera trigger-fob also accommodates the long extension. The Tripod Adaptor for the selfie stick provides a stable stand (and mount) for the Ring light inside of which is the ability to include a camera. (the Ring light needs a USB power source; not rechargeable) The instructions were mostly very clear. Overall I'm pretty happy and think it was a great deal for the dough.
4,If you’re interested in getting a ring light and aren’t sure if you’ll be using it long term this is a good starter set. It comes with tons of accessories to make sure you can connect whatever you need to on the rig. It bright has different color temps and comes with the stand (most don’t).
2,I purchased this excited to get it on a prime deal.  Everything came as expected packaged well and shipped promptly.  However when I plugged the Ring light into a charging block (as it does not come with one) it caused the block to get extremely hot.  I contacted the seller prior to leaving a review.  I just wanted to trade it out for a non-defective one (and there is an issue I’ve used another charging block and it blew the fuse after 20 minutes of use) The seller processed a full refund and the reply to me was that I was the only person who had ever said this.  When I wrote back and asked if I could do a trade out for one that wasn’t defective it was if they were offended by my issue altogether.  I was told again never have they had this issue only me and have a nice day.  I didn’t understand at all why they wouldn’t just try to get me a working item that I wasn’t looking for a refund rather a working unit.  They advised me to keep the unit…which is fine but I still need one that doesn’t overheat my plug.  Dissatisfied with the customer service response.
5,This product is soooo worth the money. It does everything that it’s supposed to. I am using this to film my cooking channel so I need these videos to be of good quality.......guess what? Struck Gold!! The warmth and quality of the video is equal to if not better than one that I paid $289 for. The brightness of the colors was AMAZING! That was something that I would have never expected given the price. However my favorite feature is the thickness. I have an iPhone and they are some heavy phones and because of that my phone used to fall over all the time. Not this one! Heavy and thick enough to keep getting the job done.Ok I am back with an updated review. OMG!! This thing is FABULOUS! I see exactly why the reviews on this product is 5 stars as a matter of fact I am going to give it 5 more stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️!!! I am just in awe. I am so in love with this product. WOW!
1,Shipment came in a cute little box but the box was missing the most important part… the long pole that extends. Had to return.
5,Best and affordable ring light compared to a lot out there. It has multiple light levels you can choose different light modes as well. Excellent item  can be used in any usb devices. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to enhance their video or picture quality. I’ve attached some before and after photos as well.
4,Pros - This kit provides flexibility for many different options and it allows for you to take pictures and live stream from many angles.Cons - if you're using anything heavier than a phone the tripod is not super stable.  The parts that tighten the elements to hold them in place sometimes still feel a little loose - probably because they are made of plastic.Overall: Great as far as accessories go tripod leaves some room for improvement
3,The issue is that the adjustable stand doesn’t hold in place very well with the mechanism they designed for it. Everything else is great. But in the middle of recording it lowers itself. 🙄 sometimes with a bang and always with a jolt.. it’s not like it slowly glides down.The lights are great on it.
5,Bought this for a Bachelorette party! The remote control and different options were great! We definitely got our use out of it. It took me a few minutes to understand how to put it together but it held up all night.
5,DANG!! this is the best ring light ive ever purchased. Number one It looked like something I could use. Two the price was right. Three it was delivered in a day. Four everything unpacked well and Five it is exactly what I thought it would be. Its relatively sturdy. It is actually relatively lightweight for its strength at full extension. The Bluetooth camera trigger-fob also accommodates the long extension.

(the Ring light needs a USB power source; not rechargeable) The instructions were mostly very clear. Overall I'm pretty happy and think it was a great deal for the dough.
5,Nothing to dislike yet but I can say that I absolutely LOVE this light! 3 different lightSettings adjustable low to high lighting It’s light yet sturdy The Bluetooth button is nice to have 1 click and your on your way very happy with it and excited to use it!  highly recommend
5,The selfie ring light was surprisingly very easy to assemble. The height options are really convenient for different uses. My phone fits snug on the holder though it does seem a little top heavy- you might want to lean it on something to support it if it's facing down towards a table top. I plan on using this for sketchbook videos.The lights are really bright in all 3 settings. Can't wait to start recording!
5,We love this product. It's super easy to use the bluetooth remote connects with no issues and has no delay the light settings are great quality and the stand is sturdy and very easy to adjust.
5,Ami hijo le encanta muy bueno
2,I was really excited about this ring light because of all the positive reviews. But unfortunately my light broke off the stand the 2nd time I tried to use it. Sadly I will be returning it.
5,Love this ring light it's not 9000 dollars and guess what it still does what I need it adds light I don't feel a ring light should be outrageous in price they do a simple job and this is that light. Tripod is sturdy and puts the light at the right height for me to add light to my videos.
5,Absolutely love this ring light! I needed a new ring light after my other ring light broke. So I gave this one a try & it does everything I could possibly ask for. It was easy to put together and easy to pack up when you take it on the go. Bravo!
5,I chose this light kit for it's simple off/on function without having to connect to bluetooth. The off/on and brightness switch is on the light cord not on a bluetooth remote control. A nice sturdy stand with pivoting head. Perfect for me I photo items and bluetooth is not always available when & where I need light. It comes with a bluetooth remote & attachments to use with your phone for videos & selfies and that is a very nice bonus. Win Win.
5,I purchased this light to help me takePictures. It’s gives a more professional look to my images and I am very happy with the result. I know is not a professional light but since it allows to Change the light temperature I amAble to get the image I want also I don’t need an extra pair of hands with the tripod which makes it even better!
5,I bought this as a cheap lamp for our living room it's great as it gets darker out earlier and there's no lighting in the back corner of our apartment. With everyone working from home and needing to be on video calls this really helps. The light is really nice and plugs into any USB the stand is over 6ft tall but feels a little flimsy.
5,I was comparing 10 Light Stands and I am happy with this one. We weren't looking for an expensive one but didn't want to waist our money on something cheap. I like the ability to use the stand as a selfie stick when needed. The bluetooth camera shutter button linked really well to my phone. Came with multiple ways to attach my phone which was really nice. The 3 light modes work really well and they have different light settings (A range from dim to bright).
5,This ring light is really bright which makes it good to use at night. The stand is tall enough so that I can use it not only while sitting but also standing. I do not have to worry about dropping my phone when filming video since the tripod is steady. And there are multiple accessories in the package to fit my different devices. I also like the USB powered charging port because it makes it easy to charge and use it anywhere I want.
5,an awesome bundle.  Ring light.  Great telescoping stand that can be converted into a selfie stick.. tons of accessories.  bluetooth remote multiple phone mounts....and you can easily mount a phone or webcam.  If you're on a budget or just starting out...i cant recommend this anymore.  I love it...easy to assemble or dissassemble.  A must get for anyone starting out in photographyyoutube or twitch!!!
5,At first I was about iffy about the low price and how it would fare on the quality of the ring light! Don't be discouraged this ring light rocks! One of my best purchases! I have yet to use it as a selfie stick but if it's anything like the ring light; I know it's great.
5,Tons of options for light brightness and also warm and cool tones. Holds my phone with no issue and no jiggles. So its pretty fun going to start using it a makeup tutorials.
5,This is an awesome bundle.It has everything I needed to make my streams look BEAUTIFUL!Incredibly easy to put together and very sturdy. Simple and efficient controls. Very flexible light modes make finding the best setting for my room easy.I’ve tried other ring lights and this one by far is the best quality and value! For all the accessories you get it is the best deal out there!
5,This is the best ring light I’ve purchased! It extends so high and comes with multiple attachments. And the remote is a great addition. Good chance I’ll buy more as gifts in the future!
5,Well it is a good light for the normal close lighting requirements! I use it to light my desk to improve my work video calls quality specifically with the shorter days sunlight going out early is a problem. Bought this only for that but I might try it for other video recording may be sometime. The only problem I’ve had with this one is that it doesn’t completely turn off with the button on the provided controller on cable rather switches to very low brightness. I just unplug it when not in use.
5,Perfect size and lighting is great
5,I like the three different shades of light and how you can control the brightness. It is helpful to have the height adjustment that this offers! I also like how you can change the angle of your phone for easy recording.
5,This product came all together and works perfectly. It a very effective and efficient ring light. I’d for sure recommend this to other customers.
5,Love this ring light! It came with many different attachment and impressed with many attachment functions. Love the remote control capability as well. Love it so much taht I bought another set for my daughter.
5,I’m very happy with my purchase. Lighting is great and it holds very well my heavy Iphone plus.
5,This ring light is perfect for pictures. It gives the right amount of lighting along with the correct lighting with its 3 different lights.
5,Works great everything I've been looking for to shoot my videos on my own. Thank you for this product!
5,I am little dumb but it took me awhile to assemble it but besides that everything else was super easy to do and it works sooo well and even it’s a good product. Not even a cheap feeling at all
5,Easy to use for my 11 year old
5,Item arrived very quickly. This ring light gives movies and photos a professional touch. Not to mention making working with virtual platforms in fantastic quality. Lots of attachments to hold phone and other items remote control of light all very versatile.
5,Great light for the price. Have only used it with a phone so far but it is sturdy enough that it won't fall over right away. The included remote is also a must have. Also would recommend getting a power bank to power it.
5,Love it
5,The only thing they could have included was better instructions! It didn’t take but 10 minutes for me to figure out. They send you extra pieces that’s why I was confused. I love this light though and I can’t wait to start my YouTube videos with it.
5,I loved the lighting of the different settings. It was a little difficult to put the pieces together but I eventually got it together. I now have a great stand for my phone to take beautiful pictures.

5,Three light settings lots of attachments remote to use for distance.  Very easy to setup and for the price a solid buy
5,Very happy with purchase...Very helpful for a novice movie maker.  the only downside was the lack of clarity in the instructions related to how to best utilize the various attachment
5,I like that it has a remote control so it is easy to take group pictures and the different light settings helps you get the perfect picture
5,The ring light is easy to assemble and the lighting is amazing. Good quality as well for the price.

5,Really great
5,Better than what I thought!
5,Absolutely great purchase! Would definitely recommend product.
5,Product is amazing my daughter loves it :)
5,Good bang for your buck!
5,This was  my first time buying a ring light. Been wanting one for awhile and I am glad I chose this!I am going to be streaming video games so I needed something that provided a good amount of lighting for my streams. This product has several brightness settings / levels and a stand that adjusts its height. Super excited to have something that provides me with amazing lighting to support my video streams. Highly recommend this product!
1,Stand is poorly built.  Falls apart after a few uses.
5,I love love love this product. It is very versatile.  It as has three light settings. It's extremely east to assemble. Took no more than ten minutes. Very sturdy and durable. It extends to at least 5 feet. And what i love the most is the bluetooth connection/remote. Once the bluetooth is connected  you can take great pics and videos from afar. No more getting someone to hold the camera.  No more tilting a selfie stick. Just click the button on the remote  and strike a pose.  You'll love it.  The warmth is great!!! And the lightning is just perfect.
5,Best Christmas 🎅🏽 💝 🎁 giftMoney ✔️Perfect
4,The ring light kit was what I bought for my business. My disappointment was the ring light was missing the selfie stick. I guess I’m most disappointed in that because that was a huge part of the reason I bought this set in the first place. As I put everything together I realized that the Bluetooth remote only took one photo and then would not take another after that. I would have to disconnect the Bluetooth and reconnect it in order for it to work. The brightness of the ring light is perfect the stand is pretty cool to except the ring light keeps falling forward even when I tighten it.
5,Funcional fácil de montar
5,Awesome product. Just what my daughter wanted. Easy to use and lightweight. Very portable.
5,Really liked all of the various choices in attachments and different angles to set up to use light.  Was very eager to use it but the light part was damaged I think during shipping so had to send it back.  But the light still worked and the different colors that you could set it at depending on your lighting would have been perfect for my TikTok videos!
5,I wanted something basic and easy to use. This was a bit challenging to put together because it came with several phone holders. Once I figured it out it was fine. The light is bright and the set up is just what I need. It was easy to connect to my phone and take pictures.
5,Got the job done although a bit flimsy. I haven’t used the light yet but I did turn it on and found it bright enough when needed. It was very self explanatory and easy to use.
5,Was a quick and easy set up also love how its multi function with two phones on the stand works really good with what i need it for.
5,Me gusto mucho... lo ocupo para maquillarme es suficiente  para mi
5,We purchased this ring light for zoom meetings and other virtual meetings. The lighting is really good and has different settings. It was pretty easy to put together and easy to use. Also sturdy. Great value.
5,Adjustable heights different lighting settings and you can change them all either dimmer or brighter has a Bluetooth button you connect to your phone which is awesome! Great product
5,An all in one kinda product wife adores this for her picture taking. Never seen her so excited and happy with her puchase. Totally recomend
3,The light is so flimsy. The brightness is amazing but the ring just flops down.
5,I really enjoy this product
5,I reviewed several of these "selfie" light/stands on Amazon for my granddaughter before I made the choice. She loves this product... Thanks
5,Very impressed.  Searching a for Mall Santa photo and this is perfect for home use.  Very versatile.  Tripod selfie stick Bluetooth and multiple adapters !  Great buyer experience.  Thanks !
5,This is perfect for what I need.  I didn’t realize the selfie stick is part of the stand and emailed to say it was missing expecting to hear back in a few days.  Within an hour I had a reply.  Really nice people product works great.
5,I purchased the selfie ring light and I wanted to say that this ring light is so great !! I used the light for my family's Christmas pictures this year and they came out so great and professional. i'm obsessed!! i will be buying one for my sister in the near future! I will be giving this a 5 star rating :)
5,This is a great ring light with 3 different settings and bright level adjusting feature.
5,Not sure why I thought it was going to be multiple lights (maybe the photo or the description was misleading) but it is basically the same as the ones you can pick up at your local Walmart without the wait time on delivery (still great nonetheless). The instructions were minimal but it was easy enough to figure out. The settings are on point and it is easy to use. So many to choose from! Great product for TikTokers and Instagramers!
5,works great!
5,I got it for cheap on Black Friday. Great value for the money. So many different settings and detachable options.
5,Excellent product. I needed one for my pictures this product is very good.
5,Perfect for what I need. Decent quality. Good brightness. Nice accessories.
5,The selfie stick untwists from the tripod stand. It’s relatively lightweight for travel and pretty compact (minus the ring itself).The different light settings work perfectly.If you are wanting a selfie stick for sightseeing etc I don’t know that this would be the best option as it does not have a wrist holder.This was perfect for our needs. Does not take up a lot of space in our home and works efficiently when I do use it.
5,So my 11 yr old took this pic with the ring light and I love it. I bought it for her but I couldn't believe how nice the picture came out. The ring light is a great buy will recommend. Its bright and the remote control is awesome .it was also easy to assemble
5,Very easy to use sturdy makes my pictures look awesome. Changes height can keep it low or bring it up to my height. Very white light strong and a great deal for the price. I recommend it!
5,I love this easy to use selfie light. It is amazing makes your pictures look professional it makes face look airbrushed. It is versatile upward downwardstraight leftright portions. Highly recommended
5,Amazing lovely lightweight and tall .Bright HollywoodI love it and definitely recommend itThank you an I appreciate you guys
5,Thick as expected
5,Love how tall it goes my kids are selfieing it up Already
5,Niece had no trouble setting it up and putting it to use right away. She loves it.
5,I bought this to give me some new light for making pics of my puppies and I was beyond thrilled! I may buy another one in the future
5,This ring light is by far the best ring light I've ever bought!!!!!! If you need it for a desk?! Works perfect!!!! If you don't have a desk and need some length this is the right ring light for you!!! There's 3 different settings and you can make it brighter or darker for the most perfect lighting for you! ☺️
5,The right light makes it easier to take pics and they look much better than just using my phone. However the stand isn't as stable as it probably could be. But all in all I like the stand.
5,This tripod is so easy to carry i love that it can be adjusted to the perfect height.
5,This is a new toy for me to do live videos very strong and sturdy thank you.
5,Great buy my daughter have been wanting one for a whileand I decided to get her this for Christmas. She loves how tall it is and how it has a button she can use when taking pictures.
5,It's easy to use and set up! Didn't come with written instructions but it's not hard to figure out. It's really bright and comes with different color settings so I'm really satisfied. Worth the money
5,The remote makes it really easy to use and the most hands free I’ve ever been taking selfies.
5,The light saves settings when turned off/on as long as power remains connected. This is a marvelous and unexpected advantage of the fixture. Well thought out. The variety of accessories is another welcome feature.
5,I love it. It was worth the wait. I been wanting one quiet some time now... I bake cakes and this going to help me to make tutorials and take beautiful pictures of my pictures... The light is amazing.
5,I love the new product I brought from you guys. It’s very much is awesome I got this product to help with my up coming YouTube channel  I thank you guys so much.

5,I just received it and can't wait to use it for my daughter's piano exam recording.It is very easy to assemble and use the twist and lock stand is sturdy.You have to plug-in when using the light.For the quality and price I would like to give it a 5-star.
5,It came earlier then expected and its really cool to use . Was a little confusing to set up but once I understood what i was doing I absolutely fell in love with it .  10/10 would buy again
5,The product can be used multiple ways but I bought it for the purpose of having a ring light that can hold my phone while taking photos. The remote works well. I had trouble getting the light to work initially but that was only because the usb box i was using was an off brand cheap one. Once I used my apply usb box it supported it fine my laptop supported it as well! Resolving the issue was easy as Amazon and this company both replied immediately with assistance ultimately the free amazon support I spoke with on the phone helped me figure out my issue in minutes. Definitely recommend this product!

5,My daughter is a beginner painter. She absolutely loves how easy abs sturdy the easel is to use. Good product.
5,I challenged with the instructions at first but figured it out. The whole set up is perfect and for what I need. I do wish the light had battery option instead of USB due to charge option. Overall love the product and highly recommend. I look forward to using all the attachments. They all assemble very easily.
5,I bought this as a gift for my friend's 13 year-old daughter and she is obsessed. She can take selfies and make tik-toks with great lighting. She loved the lighting options the different phone mount holders and how the height of the selfie ring is adjustable. A great purchase! (:
5,The packaging was great I got it safe and in tact. It is very easy to set up and use. The lights are really bright and I live the blue tooth selfie feature.
5,The ring light is great and I like it for pictures
5,This package was so much better than I even expected! The products came so fast and were exactly as shown/described!

5,The lights and stands did exactly what I wanted and for a good price.
5,It was a gift for my college granddaughter.  She loves it’s ease of operation and the beautiful photos she is able to take!  For me it was a great value and all the other things that came with it!
5,This ring light stand has exceeded my expectations! I’ve wanted one of these for a long time now and I ordered one from a different company a few days ago that never showed up. I’m so happy that I never received that one because that allowed me to order this one! I am so in love! The selfie stick that comes with the stand is amazing! It’s a part of the stand and is very sturdy. The light itself is bright on all three levels even when dimming it. The clicker connected to my iPhone via Bluetooth in a matter of seconds after I first turned it on. The assembly is relatively straightforward as well. I was very happy to see that it came with a swivel ball to tilt the ring light up or down! Overall I definitely would recommend this stand and light. And the price is unbeatable by far!!!
5,The item was as described. Thank you
5,Remote makes it easy.  Came fast.
5,I really like this selfie ring light and tripod. The 3 different light colors and being able to make each one lighter or darker is a bonus! I wish there were more directions that came in the box. The pictures were a little confusing. But I was eventually able to figure everything out. I would reccomend this.
5,I love this LED light ring!!! I am a video blogger and needed something sturdy and easy to use. This is it. The different light settings work great as well.#FoundItOnAmazon

5,Perfect
5,I like how this version has clips on the adjuster that doesn't break easily
5,There are Three different settings for different hues of light. My favorite is the warm light. This makes my job so much easier and makes pictures soo much better when the lighting is normally bad. You can change the height to any size you want and even comes with a remote to take the pictures! I definitely recommend this product.
5,I love the Bluetooth remote. Great little setup. Wish it was little brighter but again not bad for the price.
5,So far it works great! I bought this for small photo shoots and so far so good. everything seems to be very solid and the light itself is very bright. for the price you can’t beat this! highly recommend.

I just followed the instructions on the box to assemble and it was an easy task. Looking forward to using the bluetooth feature and I'm sure it would work seamlessly too.
5,Para tomar fotografías
5,This product is amazing love all the accessories that came with it so easy to set up and work perfectly was a great buy
5,This light was a little better than I thought it would be. I got it for my dad to put in his puzzle room. He needed a light that he could adjust that wouldn't cause a g lot of glare off semi-reflective surfaces. This light was appealing because the stand was taller than a lot of the other lights on the same price range. The stand is pretty decent. It does extend up to a little over 5ft. The ring light is decently large about the size of a normal good-quality frisbee. It's not insanely bright but it's bright enough to light things up sufficiently. The 3 modes are nice. All in all this light is better than I thought it would be and it's worth the money if you're looking for a versatile inexpensive ring light and you don't need an overpowering amount of lumens.
5,Tiktok
5,Simple to put together nice for photos and videos.
5,I bought this product for a Christmas present for kids that love making videos for social media. It worked great and they loved it! Great bang for the buck!

5,This product is all in one great.  Came packaged well and allows a lot of versatility for photos zoom sessions and angles.
5,My daughter loves her new ring light it's jus rite and she is able to do a lot of things with it so I give it five stars  🌟 and I will also be ordering more for my other daughters because they want one now lol but I will be ordering more . She also says she will be making her videos with it also.
4,Nice product with lots of accessories for various smart phone mounting options. Easy and mostly self-explanatory set up which is good as the instructions seem written by someone who speaks English as a second language
5,I absolutely LOVE this ring light with tripod stand.  It’s strong and sturdy enough to hold my heavy phone while I record and snap pictures for my small business.  Lighting is ridiculously important when creating content and this light stand is essential if you’re hoping to product quality video and studio quality pictures.  The two pictures show my setup when I’m taking product pictures and the second picture is an example of how bright and perky the light makes my tshirts.  For the price you can’t go wrong with this ring light!
5,I like how bright the light is
5,I love my ring light! it’s amazing it has amazing brightness it’s not small it’s good for the price and overall just something you should buy for a good price.

Makes your photos have a professional look and all the extras that come with this kit make it all the better. I highly recommend.

5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This ring light has literally been a life saver! It comes with phone attachments! You can station your phone in the middle of the ring light with the add on piece on simply clip it on the side with the other add on accessory! Has multiple settings (dimmer-natural & light) modes as well as on & off feature. The tripod itself is pretty sturdy twist to lock at whatever desired height and is usb cable connect so you can plug it into a multiple port deck if you’d like cord length is long as well which is nice if you need to move it around while using!

5,I would definitely recommend buying this. Everything was true from the brightness Bluetooth remote  it was easy to put together and everything.
5,Amazing ring-light very bright.
5,This works exactly as described. Had a previous ring light kit that broke. Got this one within 2 days and it was easy to assemble and worked perfectly. Took wonderful pics of out family vacation of 40+ people. No problem with wide shots or close ups. Everyone loved it.
5,A little flimsy but for the money paid it is acceptable not a light for kids or tweens because it is so light that I would be afraid it could easily be knocked over. But for this price it is fine I am using it to photograph items for resale site so this is a perfect light for me.Great purchase
5,These lights are very easy to use and they work great I recommend 100% they also make your pictures look great

3,it’s a very good buy bigger than I thought
5,Cool gadget it’s really a multi in one item.
5,Nice bright light. Easy to assemble and be up and working in no time. Works very well with my iPhone 11. Snug fit in the cradle centered in the ring. Illuminates videos and pictures great. Great extension of the tripod lets me place behind desk. A+
5,Yes I would rebuy
5,This ring of light is excellent my daughter likes it very much she is very happy it was a Christmas gift thank you Amazon
5,I used this product for video calling so I could be seen clearly on camera. I have also used this light on my miniature figures that I am painting so as to have a good light source nearby when I need it. I like that the stand is adjustable and there's a phone holder in the middle that can also be moved. The only drawback is the chord is not very long but the end is USB. Overall a nice ring light I am not disappointed with my purchase at all.
5,I am happy with my purchase. The brightness on this ring light is superb. It definitely improves my picture quality.
1,N/a
5,Touch screen very nice
5,good and worth the money
5,It’s came right away
5,Works so so well I absolutely love this thing I took it on my last two vacations the lighting makes such a difference I highly recommend
5,Easy to assemble. Portable can bring anywhere!
5,Si me agrado
5,Good product
5,I wish it could be brighter  but this ring light gets the job done!
5,This is incredibly easy to use easy to assemble and amazing for its price! The light is insanely brght (I use it a lot as a lamp as well because it lights the room better than my over head light) and can also be dimmed if needed for video recording or photo taking! also it being able to change the warmth of the light is good espeically if you get washed out with pure white light. 10/10 highly reccomend
5,Its brighter than I thought it would be and I'm highly impressed by the bluetooth remote. The light itself feels super cheap but its bright and can extend high af too. I'm really happy with it!
5,The brightness is great the remote works and it was very easy to assemble
5,Great product
1,Difficult to assemble no directions and missing parts
5,Really good
5,We absolutely loved it
5,Love it
5,I love this ring light! It came exactly as described and was so easy to put together. I love that you can choose the tone of the lighting. & for the price it’s a really great deal!
5,Works well
2,I bought this ring light a few months ago for making videos and it doesn’t stay on anymore. I turn it on and turns off by itself.
5,
5,Awesome. Very easy to set up. Arrived on time and is alot of fun to use for someone new to using a ring light. wouldn't hesitate to purchase again.
4,
5,Great product.  Very easy to assemble and it was an amazing price. wonderful investment and delivery was quick !
5,Works like it should. Easy to set up and use. My android said I needed an app for the shutter button but it connected to my blue tooth with no app needed. Good product for a great price.
5,I really liked the light color options. I can choose according to the moment of the day. The negative point is that you need to have an extra phone charge to use. It comes only with an USB cable.
5,Todo me agrado estoy maravillada con la alta calidad que tienen mis fotos 🥰
5,Easy to adjust and is pretty sturdy. The ring light works great and has different brightness levels
4,Love this!
5,Muy bueno Ami me encanta
5,I absolutely love it! Great quality and the light is so bright!
5,OMGGreat product for a great price it came perfectly packaged and the quality of the light is amazing The tripod is perfect and also has a detachable selfie stick Not to mention the little shutter remote that it came with.I've only seen ring lights on videos and photos etc I came across this one and I must say that I am really am impressed and glad that I got this oneI would definitely recommend this for any 1st time users or as a gift.It's a YES for me👍🏽
5,Daughter does alot of cosplay using this & loves it.
5,I purchased this ring light for a friend. I cost half of what I paid for my own so imagine my surprise when the quality of the light was noticeably better than my own. Also was easy to assemble and the remote works great. Highly recommend!
5,So i love it but I wish that is came with an attachment to where the ring light could just sit on the ground level or countertop because the tripod stand is not a convenient size to sit on a countertop.but alot of ring lights dont offer this so i will say i love it!
5,Could not believe all the stuff included for the price! Great height floor to above desk level accessories to use with either laptop or phone. I bought for more consistent lighting in zoom client sessions. It’s not for glamour shots. Doesn’t change much if you’re by a bright window but if you’re in a room that has inconsistent lighting throughout the day it makes a big difference. Five stars!
1,I like it but put and new picture on the website it amke people think they are getting everything in the picture that's it .
5,Came earlier than expected and was easy to assemble and super bright. Highly recommended.
5,Nice bright lights with dimming option. Adjustable height. Great price! I use this everyday! Thank you!
5,The light worked as intended out of box with no issues. USB connection makes it easy to use. Good quality and affordability!
4,This was my first selfie light ring; didn’t know what to expect overall I’m pleased with my purchase. I use the light for multi purpose (really good if you’re looking to add extra light to a room) the selfie ring light makes the picture quality look great I love that there’s a remote that you could use to make it easier to snap your photos. Downside is taking photos at a distance (ex. full body length pictures) doesn’t have the same light quality the pole is a little flimsy as well.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 literally amazing and its even better for the price im 5’6 and it reaches my mouth so its pretty tall and amazing for beginners took like 5 minutes to assemble the selfie stick is apart of the tripod so dont be alarmed if you are thinking of getting this GET IT
5,This ring light is taller than the usual comes with a shutter remote which is awesome and can be used as a selfie stick!!
5,This is awesome!! My wife and daughters LOVE this!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             For the price I paid and for the quality of this ring light compared to most this one was the best for me. It’s lightweight as durable as handy is good for blogging and TikTok and social media events is very nice.
5,This ring light is larger than I expected super bright and simple to set up. The bluetooth shutter control was easy to connect and works pretty well. It is very versatile and can be mounted on the floor on a desktop and used as a selfie stick. I will do a video update later
5,The media could not be loaded.
5,No me gusto que no se pueda poner el telefono mas facil
5,I use it to broadcast on the likee app and I'm very happy with my hoop💕❤️✨
5,This is my second time buying because I dropped my 1st ring light 3-5 times lol I'm clumsy. Any who I'm a gamer/mukbanger so i feel like i needed this. There are 3 main settings but the main settings have multiple options to have your light dim or brighter! Easy to use assemble and pack for travel. I love this light because of the affordability and how functional it is.  I actually want 2 more 1 for travel and another for my bedroom!
5,Great product
5,Purchased to help with wig making otherwise it's multi-functional. Was super easy to set up. The ring light with different modes is surprisingly very luminous and a perfect light source for video recordings. Like the convenience of the remote control. Not disappointed with this purchase.
4,It definitely served it's purpose. The lighting is great. I love the adjustable lights. I have to remember to you get what you pay for. I bought this in November 2020 and it completely broke off the stem.
5,Great product good light easy to put together.would buy it again.great price.
5,This is a great starter ring light. Fast shipping and delivery. I love the 3 settings remote and all the different ways to set it up.I will say that I can not get it to stay set. The ball joint is too loose and just keeps making the ring fall forward. I tighten it works great for a few minutes then it's slowly falling over. When you pull out the pole/selfie stick it constantly collapses. I fix it tighten it then it collapse. I really live the ring it's aweso.e with all the settings I'm just frustrated with it flopping forward.
5,This light was easy to set up. Took me about 5 min to set it up. The lighting is just perfect. It’s bright but doesn’t blind your eyes.
5,Ringlight didn’t cost much and is nice to have. Can be a bit difficult to set up but not so much that it needed less than 5 stars. The directions are helpful and having multiple and backup phone mounts is great.For those of you not understanding how to use as a selfie stick you’ve just got to take the legs off completely and the ring part then attach the designated phone holder.
5,Le brillo es impresionante y funciona muy bien el control remoto igual con la cámara
5,Absolutely  love this whole set up. Comes with everything handy works great for our streaming videos ect. I would give a higher rating of 5 if I was able!!
5,The price is right you can’t beat it!  This ring light is all I use for my makeup  videos.  Gives the right amount of light for a natural look. The remote works great.  Go grab this ring light! You won’t regret it😉
5,I love everything about this product except it doesn’t fit my Nikon camera which is my own fault but other than that amazing.
5,It was pretty straight forward. Works great! I wouldn’t use this for a desktop. The remote works awesome to take pictures or record. Even works with IG stories!
5,Wish it was bigger I look bigger in the picture.
5,I absolutely love it! Exactly what I need thank you so much !!
5,I love this lamp? Definitely worth it! And easy to put together and very light weight!
5,Great buy for the price. Easy to put together.
5,Very nice and bright light
5,
5,Easy assembly Made my photo so much brighter and made skin look so much clearer as a result! Must buy loved this purchase
5,I liked how bright it was
5,Love it
5,I liked how bright it was
5,Love it
5,Purchased for my daughter…Product was easy to assemble and the remote makes this the perfect tool for self directed blogs podcasts and more!!! I want one for myself now.
5,Omg I love how bright the light is and how easy it is to use. It has made my social media likes comments increased since using your product thanks again
5,The only thing I don’t like is the part that actually holds your phone it seems very fragile . And the top of the light sometimes is unsteady but definitely a goo product
5,So portable and easy to use.
5,Does everything that I need! Has bluetooth good lighting holds my phone well and I can also use it as selfie stick :)
2,The light is bright but also has button to dim the light. Love the set up. Only knock is The stick is a bit flimsy and weak where it doesn’t hold up to much weight.
5,This product came with all the expected attachments and it works perfectly.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Other than the clicker being a bit delayed I have no complaints about this light ring! Took a video a few pics and I even attend meetings on my laptop with the light behind it to enhance the lighting of my laptop camera!! Good buy I'd recommand!
5,Price was good!
5,This is such a nice product. It took me a second to realize the selfie stick was the mount for the light as well though since the instructions are a little confusing. I also appreciate the remote comes with batteries because usually these things don’t. Would definitely recommend getting this!
5,The little button on the usb works very well to turn the light on immediately and adjusts brightness very easily. The refresh icon on the button lets you choose three different hues of light which is very helpful. The height is adjustable and surprisingly sturdy. The LED light up top is very light which helps me not worry about it causing the whole light to fall over. Works well.
5,Beat prodouct brings videos and pictures to life
5,Came a day sooner then I thought. Well packaged. Given as a Xmas gift super easy to set up and use. She uses it to make tic toks. Loves it.
5,This light and stand has so many options for such a low price. The lighting is incredible. The stand is very sturdy and adjusts to several heights. It can be folded down small enough to take with you. I've taken it on several hiking trips. You can use it as a selfie stick. You can use it for full video shoots. It's absolutely PERFECT!
5,I was concerned that the less expensive price than other would make this not as good but it is a really good ring light! I like the different ways it can hold the camera or phone and also the different lighting colors. Easy to use and works well.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 It was easy to set up and the light works well sturdy and can’t wait to start recording videos with it. The remote control is very easy to set up as well. Worth the buy
1,I am really disappointed with this product. Another review mentioned a similar case in which the selfie stick was missing and I was hoping it was a fluke- however the product does not come with all pieces that are mentioned in the description. The selfie stick is also the lamp extender. I will be returning the product and looking for another similar one.
5,Me encanto
5,Easy to assemble easy to use!
5,Exactly as the picture
5,This thing works perfect!  I love it. Easy to put together. The remote linked to my phone easy and works great!  ♥️🥰
5,Loved the light! I bought it for my birthday party to capture pictures with my backdrop. The remote option is easy to use and practical for selfies. Everyone had fun.
5,I ordered this ring light to use for teaching virtual classes. I needed something easy to use and affordable. It is perfect. There are 3 types of light options and the brightness can be adjusted. Stand is also adjustable. The remote control makes it easy to quickly make lighting adjustments. It can stand on the floor or be adjusted for tabletop.
5,A nice and efficient ring light with multiple accessories.
5,YES ITS WORTH IT. My dad ordered it for me so I can take cute pictures or whatever and it was amazing! I love it so much. It stands really tall and the lighting works amazing! You can take it apart and reuse it for many different devices! Worth the money!
5,I absolutely love this ring light. It is so easy to use and easy to assemble. The different light setting are a great feature as well.
5,Loved this purchase so much. I am a content creator and being able to do my thing hands free is amazing. Love that I can adjust the size of the pole. Love the 3 different type of lighting and the brightness is amazing. Also love that it is easy to travel with of needed to.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Love everything about this product. So simple and quick to assemble. It can get a little top heavy since the stand itself is so light. There’s a place at the bottom where you can easily use weights to weigh it down. 5 STARS FROM ME. Plus it has many accessories included which is always a bonus.I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!
5,I would 100% recommended this ring light! Love the brightness and how easy it is to set up!!
5,It was easy to assemble. Not sure what all the pieces can do yet. It works great for small areas and smaller items close up items. It's compact and easy to use so far.
5,This unit is really functional. I am surprised at its sturdiness for the weight. Used it several times and has a number of attachments. I played with the light but have not used it but it seems to be sturdy and bright. The remote links up easily. I have not played with all the attachments but the only thing I see that may be an issue is if you want to hold a tablet on it. I don't know if any of the mounts would hold a really large phone or small tablet.
5,I loved every single thing about it
5,love Love LOVE IT! From the different height adjustments to the versatility of the phone attachment I absolutely adore this device. Now I can be lame and do tik toks lol.
5,You cant see it but lollll it works greatttt

5,I used everything with this product and my videos and pictures came out wonderful the brightness was very controllable and my projects was successful thank you amazon and to the company that created the selfie ring
5,Bought this to use at my brother's wedding. The remote made it so easy to use and the color change lights gave every one options.  All the pictures turned out amazing.  Very satisfied with this product.
5,This product is very cool and so easy to put together.
5,I love it!! Now I can take fashion pictures of myself.
5,This thing is SO BOMB! I honestly think this is the BEST bang for your buck! I've seen other ring lights with not a many options for much more and I honestly think this is the most perfect ring light for my live shows and everything I intend on using it for! The fact is got a remote as well is really cool! I'm so glad I bought this!
5,Works welleasy to assemble. I bought it for my daughter and she is happy as can be.
5,I love this product
5,I use it when I do my makeup and It makes the lighting in the room so much better!
5,This was a gift for my niece she just started adding videos to TikTok. She loves how easy it is to set it up and how convenient it is. She's just a beginner so this helped a lot.I'm happy when she's happy
5,I bought this as a gift for my friend and she really liked it. Buy this product and you’ll get what u paid for
5,Does its job no complaints!
5,
5,I loved.
5,I appreciate that there are different types of lighting that you can switch between. I used this to film training videos at work and the quality was great!It is not the most sturdy of a stand but it does the job. Just be careful not to put too much weight/pressure on it and you will be just fine!
5,I liked how i could adjust the lighting and move it around and set it up easily to take pictures for ebay. I also like all the attachments that came with it.
5,Nice ring light
5,Makeup
5,The media could not be loaded.
5,My daughter is enjoying the product.
5,We set up a photo booth for my daughter's 16th. This worked great and didn't break the bank! Super bright. Just fyi: pretty delicate construction and stand collapses easily (remedied with tape). Thanks for another option other than renting a photo booth for $400 😬
5,Me agrado mucho el producto es muy bueno
5,Love the ring light especially the warm cool normal tones and brightness level. But i do not use it as a filming tripod anymore. My phone seemed like it was just too heavy and it is quite heavier than my last phone (pixel 6 now). So i use it as a ring light only and bought a different tripod for my phone. For the price I'm happy i got it use it when i do my Livestreams on the computer since that doesn't adjust brightness like my phone does.
5,Loveeee it
5,The Product yet from manufacturer to the delivery process. Most Def Recommend High Quality!!!
5,It is honestly really good and for the price perfect.
5,Didn’t have any issues got it quickly as a gift and they’ve liked using it!
5,I like this photo light very much I have recorded my dancing and vibrato using the photo light can take my pictures beautifully
5,Easy to assemble and works great! Great product for a great price!!
5,Great product and amazing value! Love the different Heights you can use it on!
5,The item arrived early and was absolutely perfect! It has multiple brightness settings so it works for everything!
5,The reviews on this stand was amazing so I had to get one. The stand is so tall and can adjust to however height which was the main thing I was looking for. It is very sturdy and easy to put together. The price was great also! Does not get much better than this! 100% recommend!
5,Its bright and easy to installed. I love it and i can make my videos now
5,Has so many ways to use it.
5,Me agrado todo tiene buena luz es súper fácil de armar y de usar
5,Great addition to my business and making videos for social media.
5,Easy to use and to put together
5,The Ring Fill Light Stand I recommend.  It has been the best for my business as a Custom Cake Baker easy to install and easy to use with just one button you have different light changes and it makes your work easier.
5,Very easy to control  and was an easy setup
5,It’s a cool ring light but the only downfall is that I can’t keep the stand up straight it’s always sliding down but overall it’s cool.
5,Makes your pictures look wonderful and came with a Bluetooth remote for you to be your own photographer. The three settings are great and make a great addition to a up and coming content creator. 5 stars ⭐️
5,I love it I use it when I make my YouTube videos it makes a big difference

5,I love how easy it is to set up and the fact  that  when kids free the wife and I can take pics and videos like professionals and the best part is the remote it's small and easy to conceal makes our fun time a lot more fun. I'm really  happy that we bought  this ring.Also making  tik tok videos or streaming  live is less of a hassle .I wish we could  show pics and or videos  but since they are xxx ....so much fun
5,Great product
5,Often we want to take a family photo but one person has to be the picture taker so we can’t ever be all together during a family get together.  This ring light and remote has bern a game changer!  We can now take great pics with EVERYONE in the picture!
5,This set was good quality very solid.  It took a minute to figure out that the selfie stick is hidden in the middle of the tripod (for those of you that think it's missing). All and all it's a great value compared to other sets. I did end up reluctantly returning it because I ended up not needing it after all. I would buy it again in the future if I end up needing such a product.
5,I LOVEEEEEE super easy to use everything is simple shipping was fast  will be shopping again SOON🥰🥳
5,It so great. Definitely money worth and very quick to set up! Thanks so much
5,I love how easy it was to put together. Now I can finally be the Youtuber I want to be.

5,Easy to use . Many accessories . Fit a perfectly in the corner and doesn’t take much space . Great lighting with many options .
5,works wonder and helps me take great pictures
5,This product works exactly how it's intended. The thing I love the most I all the different phone attachments it comes with. It's nice cause you can also attach any kind of camera to it and the lights are bright! The adjustable stand is great! The only thing I didn't like/realize. I thought it didn't come with a selfie stick so I got a replacement one but the selfie stick is on the stand you just take it off!
5,The light is very bright. The shipping was fast and just in time. Best ring light I’ve ever brought

5,I Absolutely LOVVVVVVE This Selfie Ring Light!!! I Got It As A Gift For My Husband’s Birthday 🥳 He Was So Stoked & Absolutely Loves The Way It Lights Up His Videos! This Is Such A Great Quality & Easy To Assemble! Super Cute Too! Must Buy🎁
5,I used this ring light to take product photos and it works excellent for that. However positioning your phone and using more than one attachment at a time is difficult to do.
5,I love my ring light! It’s sturdy- the brightness and the colors options I’m all for.I love that it has its own selfie stick it’s the perfect size and the perfect purchase for a ring light!
5,This ring light is so wonderful and easy to use. The remote control connected with no issue. It holds up my heavy pgone and case I've never owned a ringlight/selfiestick that was so sturdy. Came with a million attachments even one for my professional camera on it!
5,easy to assemble. The lights are bright. Wireless clicker for photos. Easy to connect to my phone.
5,I love it just what I was looking for. You can adjust it to any length and it comes with a remote so you can snap just what you were capturing without standing right next to it. The brightness is good. So I am satisfied and believe you will like it too. Only thing I would say that kind of sucks is that it’s flimsy and sometimes if I have it on my carpet it falls over but I than that I would go for it I’m hoping to get another one as well!
5,This was exactly what I was looking for and great quality on top of it. I’m extremely satisfied.

5,I really like this product and how easy it was to setup. The light works like it should. The controls work great. Sturdy even on carpet. Well worth the money.
5,I love how many settings are on this ring light. Different shades for different pictures and videos that I can adjust them on! The remote is easy to use and once again the ring light makes my pictures look high quality ☺️ My favorite part about the ring light is that I can make the light as bright as I want or as low as I want. I recommend purchasing it!

5,Thanks.
5,Love how easy this was to put together! Does everything I need it to do! Great product for a great price!
5,Awesome light to have in our paint room
5,Did not get the remote controlThe ring light being gopro mount compatible is really cool. I’ve put a sticky mount on the bottom part of my top shelf  and now the ring light just attached there without needing to use the gopro stick. I do enjoy using the stick/handle it’s sturdy and it can be used for self defense if you need to just not fully extended.The lights look good very bright and strong it’s a little small but for the price it’s perfect to start with
5,I have no regrets purchasing this ring light.  It's my first one but it has fulfilled all the needs that I got it for. Easy assembly  versatile and I love the remote! It's a game changer for selfies or outfit pictures. Love it.

5,I use my selfie ring at my aesthetics practice. I enjoy the 3 different hues of lights it has to offer and it doesn't blind my clients like a mag light does. It makes pictures look great too. It gives off a nice ambience glow when I shut the main lights off in the ceiling.

5,It was nicely packaged. Instructions could’ve been a little bit better. I had to come back to Amazon to help with set up and looking at how things went. Overall…. The light works great it is bright. The remote control… could be a little bit better but it just gets the basic needs done.
