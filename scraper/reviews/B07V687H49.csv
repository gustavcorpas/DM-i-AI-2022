5,This is a good set of cables if you need replacements for old ones. I have gone through so many cell phone charger cables because I wear them out at the charging port. I thought my phone port was dying when two went out in one week (I think that was a fluke). I bought these as a replacement and absolutely love them. The short and medium length get the most use but it is nice to have the long cable as an option if I am not close to an outlet/power strip to plug in. They are nice and sturdy charge my devices at a decent rate and have not developed any weak stress points from use. I believe these will work for quite a while and we well worth the investment.
5,I like the fabric covered cables as those tend to be more sturdy than the. On covered cables.
5,Made an RF choke 27 turns around a ring.
5,This item worked perfectly for what I needed it for
5,My kid destroys chords. These seem to hold up the longest and do the best job as far as durability. Best part is the rubber coating at the base of the plug that prevents the chord from fraying and being damaged from bending.
5,I have two types of ports: Micro USB and Type C.  For type C I got the red cables. For the Micro-B I got the blue/aqua cables.  I have them plugged at various places around the house. Wherever I go I don't have to think about which cable is there. I grab the color for my USB device.
4,Very strong cables
5,Pretty durable. Charges good. No complaints so far
5,I don't have much to say. If you need a couple micro USB cables of varying length this is the way to go. I haven't had any of the tips get bendy or come out of the socket yet and I think I've had them for almost half a year now. Very decent products all around and I like that they're blue.
5,Good quality for cheap price👌👌👌👌
5,Very pleased with these cords.  Sturdy and lengths are perfect for various locations.
5,Works excellent
5,Very high quality durable cables.
3,Don't charge well doesn't seem to get good connection no matter where I plug it in. Tried others to be sure it's just these and it was.
4,The computer industry occasionally has a problem with semantics.  What's a "mini" vs. "micro" USB plug.  It seems that some manufacturers cannot get on the same page with these terms!(?)  I had to do a switcheroo with one set of JS Audio patch cords for these.  Impressed with this shade of RED and being male a "good" look will always attract me!  So far . . . I'm satisfied.  We'll see how long they'll last with all the coiling/uncoiling.
5,Having been buying these now for past few years. The only ones I will buy now. Have tried many brands that have not lasted. Still using the same 2 that I bought 3-4 years ago.  As others go out I replace with these.
5,I already love the look of these charger cables! They are sturdy and durable! Also yes I did receive the shipment four days late but the package was intact and I was very happy to receive it! Thank you so much!
4,Keeping because I have devices that have the same connector.  Never enough charging cords.....so they are staying with me.
5,I think I got these on sale - it was a while back. I only ever used the cords that came with devices but now trying these I can feel the quality and can tell they'll last longer. Worth it.
5,I bought this set of 3 micro-USB to USB-A charging cables for $11.99 back in November 2019 and I can say now in June 2021 that it is honestly one of the best purchases I have ever made. I still use these cables to charge my phone every single day and can't say a single negative thing about them. In fact I would gladly and willingly shell out TRIPLE the price I paid and STILL feel like I got a good deal. And if that's not enough to convince you this brand is worth a try that's fine by me - I've already decided that every person in my life is getting these for Christmas this year and it'd be a bummer to find any of the port options out-of-stock! ;)Seriously though: like most people I've used and replaced many charging cables over the years. Seems a bit weird in hindsight but I had accepted the short lifespan of these products as inevitable with normal use. Since a handful of weak points seemed to be universal across brands and price points I had assumed a better design must simply be impossible. Obviously I was wrong! This product has proven to me that a better design DOES exist. These cables feel sturdy and strong but without sacrificing flexibility to the point where they become unwieldy (I'd only call them stiff in comparison to non-braided alternatives). And these stand out even among other braided options because they're so well-reinforced around the connector. No give or wear there at all or anywhere else along the cable after a year and a half of daily use.
5,Very sturdy in construction and charges fast...
4,I’ve had these before and overall they’re great. Love the sturdy fabric cable and never had an issue before. But one of them arrived non-functional this time. Let’s see how the return/refund goes.
5,These are good quality cables. I like the "braided" fabric outer layer and the velcro strap that comes on them that makes them easy to bundle up. The color combo is nice too.
5,I love the colors I love the different lengths.  That I can plug the 10ftr in my house and stick it out my patio door and sit outside and play my game while charging. I love the 3ft for my kitchen and car and 6ft for my desk at work.  I originally bought the old style android and now I bought the c chargers and hdmi cables for the TV also.  They are fast and durable so far.
4,They were great for the first couple months but after that they just don't work anymore.
5,I'm still using these 2 years later.
5,Good quality and they work as advertised.  If that changes I will update this review later.
5,Nice cable set has a 10ft length which I have not seen before plus 6ft and 3ft.  More than long enough to add a bluetooth device in my car and keep it charged really handy when the car's bluetooth fails to work.  This cable will also be ideal for older hotel rooms where electric outlets can be scarce or hard to reach.
5,Arrived as promised.  Cables are heavy duty.  Well made.  No problems with use of cables
5,These cords are the best.
5,I was sceptical because all the other chargers I purched failed from other dealer's. These are still working and you get three chargers.  The best ones yet the ends are protected from bending making them worth the purchase.
3,The durability of these chargers wasn't great as after a couple of uses they no longer worked. The sturdiness is great i like that the wire is hard and sturdy. Again didn't last long though.
5,After buying a charge cord from a drug store which lasted all of a week I bought this three pack about a month ago and it's going strong. It comes with three cords  3 6 and 10 ft. I've only been using the 3ft so far. I bought this one after using a friend's of similar design and seeing how long it lasts and works well. Fits right in phone so I can basically hang it if I want and it will stay connected.
3,Didn't last long.  Plug Ends broke down to soon.
5,Worked great on my wife’s phone with a regular phone case but not on my Ottar box case as the plug would not fit up into the case hole
5,I have been using these cords for a month now.  No problems or breakage of any kind.  I don’t believe a three pack with an extra long one is necessary but not much can be done about that.  Less one star for forcing a three packing purchase.
5,Work good
4,my initial thought was "cannot beat the price of this product". There are 3 cords in varying lengths and they all seem to be pretty sturdy - especially at the connectors.  And the sturdy looking connectors are exactly why I bought this product - well that and the cost given that 3 cords were in the package.I don't know if it's the Android connection or whoever makes these charging cords but the snug connection does not seem to last very long.  And the connection does not stay snug very long on these cords at all - only 3 months and already it showed 10+ hours to charge.  With the other charging cords that I bought in the past the snug connection usually lasted about a year.  BUT unattaching and reattaching usually fixes the problem - for now - until the connectors no longer fit snug at all and then it takes 10+ hours to charge the phone all the time.
5,Fantastic product that appears to be built to last! I personally hate USB Micro cables due to the design of the "Micro" end of the cable being easily susceptible to becoming damaged with little effort. I couldnt even begin to add up how many USB Micro cables I have had fail on me without the slightest neglect being shown towards the cable. I have a Bachelors in "Information Technology and Information Systems" as well as minoring in "Computer Science" so taking proper care of any type of cable re traits that I am anal about. So with that being said even with me treating every "Micro" cable I've purchased or received with a(n) electronic purchase as if it were gold within a ridiculously short amount of time everyone of them fails. Ultimately I hope that these particular cables can withstand the test of time but my hopes are high due to the manufacturer being JSAUX. I have purchased nearly every type of cable imaginable from JSAUX (i.e. USB Type A/B/C/ Mini ABC/ Micro B 30 Pin Lightning Type C etc.) and to this day every cable I have purchased from them works without fail. Buy these cables from JSAUX and you will never need to buy this type cable again!
5,Very well made & seem to be cat proof.
5,I use them in various spots around the house so I can work from any place without gathering cords etc. The cats don't even attempt to play with these which was what I was looking for. The color separates mine from other people's so no more doubt about whose is worse. The flexibility and length of the chords are useful daily. I bought different colors for other family members all of whom are more than satisfied with the cords.
5,I have ordered these 3 times I think.  I like that there are different lengths.  The cord never trays.  They work well.
5,My mom goes through phone chargers like toilet paper and these ones have lasted a solid couple months for both of us so they have survived longer than several chord types. The variable lengths are nice too and the price is a great value for them.
5,Great cords.  Good quality!
2,Pros: get 3 different cord lengths.Cons: After only a week the cord keeps slipping out of phone.  Its fine if you NEVER disconnect from phone but thats not what a cell phone is made for.I want to stress that I have been very careful on inserting and removing from phone. I have made this purchase more than once only because you get 3 different sizes and difficult if not impossible to find a 10 ft for my cell. I will be returning this set again!
5,This isby farone of the best chargers I've ever purchased. Dont hesitate to purchase!
5,I love how it has this hard plastic part were the ends are so the wire doesn't break as easily!
5,These may be fading into obscurity with the invention of USB Type-C Cables but many of us still have equipment that uses micro USB plugs. To those of you that are these are tough. My kids haven't been able to break them yet and that is an accomplishment I do not want to be underestimated.  These are great.
5,I needed some longer charging cables so I thought I'd give these a try. Then I needed some data cables and asked the seller JS Digital if these cables were data cables too and not just charging cables. Within minutes I got a reply that these cable were. WOW a reply with in minutes!!!! When testing all three cables to be sure they all were working with data I was pleasantly surprised how well they worked over my Anker cables. When I plugged in my device to my computer via these outstanding cables the computer immediately recognized the device first time and every time. If you want great cables take it from an me an IT consultant these are the best mini to USB cables I've ever used. AND the price is so low for these quality cables I feel like I stole them. I highly recommend them to anyone who wants the best.
4,great deal for price
5,The cords arrived just as advertised. Seem to be sturdy and built to spec. Too soon to judge longevity.
5,Durability
5,In short; these have been by far the most reliable micro usb cords. I might be biased and prefer usb c cords but these are far more durable than any other micro's I've used
5,Works great
5,These are very good..  it’s great to have different lengths!!!
5,I actually have not used this set as I accidentally purchased micro USB when I needed the C cable but I did exchange them for the C which I assume are the same except for the end. These braided cables are perfectly flexible but feel substantial. The ends are bendable and feel well made. I had been using a McDodo cable previously. Loved it's length the feel of it and as silly as it sounds the bright light blue color. Within 6 months or so somehow the C plug had a slight tilt to it so it would not work unless in the perfect position. I was concerned it could damage my phone. So I wanted a well reviewed quality cable and altho it really didn't matter that much I wanted a similar color. These cables are identified as green but I would describe them as a rich shade of teal blue. The variety set was a good value.
5,I go through a lot of USB micro chargers. A lot. Like maybe 100 in a year between all of my gadgets and my kids'. Plus I work in schools and I just go through a lot I them. I have seen many cables advertised as tough and my kids will destroy them in a month. These have lasted two months now and they have taken a beating and are holding up great. I also like the way the braids feel and the alternative colors to just your usual black and white. I would order again but I don't need to get because they are still lasting!Oh one more thing a lot of cables don't work well for data transfer but these work great. And the connectors on them work with even my most beat up devices that won't seem to charge or connect. No problem with these ones. I hope they keep going like this.Great price too.
5,These chargers work great!
5,I love these charging cables!  We struggle to keep charging cables working in our house because of young kids who bend the cables and put stress on them while in use.  I have tried several different brands of cables that are labeled as durable strong long-lasting etc.  Those cables do not last long because they almost always have plastic surrounding the USB plugs.  These cables have survived my kids rough treatment.  They are well built and have metal surrounding the USB plugs.  No more worrying about the exact angle of the plug and ensuring that the cord is actually working as it should.  No more waking up in the morning to discover that my phone or kindle did not charge even though it was plugged in all night.  When I use these cords items are quickly and reliably charged.  I definitely recommend them especially to people that have kids or generally treat their cords roughly.
5,Uses for my Android phone. No dislikes.  Sturdy + fast charging.
5,I bought these cables to replace my original Kindle charging cable.  The plastic/soy cover near the end that plugs into my Kindle Fire had come off and exposed the wiring.  These new cables appear very sturdy and durable.  I expect them to last a long time.  I like having the 3 lengths as well for different situations.
5,Works great. Able to string behind couch without worrying it will kink.
5,These have good ends on them where most cords fail
4,Use it for my everyday charging  needs does not like to much abuse.  I plug it in at night while using it and then phone falls out of bed bending the cord at the connection point.  Other then that they are great and work really fast fastest cords I have found out there.
5,I like how sturdy the cable is but am slightly disappointed to find it only lasted me 6 months. Granted that's still far longer than normal cords last so I can't complain
5,Having killed any number of cables over the years when bending at the juncture of cable and plug  cause them short out having protectors built in is great. While I'm sure if one tried it would be possible to bend them too much once past the proctors  it would take a bit work.  Also the cables themselves are slightly stiffer than the other braided cables I've had but not so much as to make coiling difficult and the built in cable management is a nice touch. The colored plugs are also useful in sorting out what is attached when dealing with hubs with large numbers of ports.I will be buying more of these as I kill off other cables.
4,Liked the fact that it is a sturdy cable less likely to wear out and also 3 different lengths for versatility
5,The best I've ever used
5,So happy with my 3 different cords! One is perfect for the car (3'). One is perfect for bedside (6'). And the third replaces my 10' cord in the TV room for playing video games on my tablet. Also the reinforced base on the plug ends makes it harder to fray the connections and have to replace them as often! Very happy!
5,Overall great product
5,These work great!  I have ordered these a couple of years ago too.  I have never had a problem.
5,Bought these to use with an older Xbox One windows controller and they work great. Plenty of length and they seem durable. They also look fantastic in the variety of colors that are offered.
5,So much better than that cheap cable that came with the charger I bought at Verizon who charged me $30. 😳
5,They are very sturdy good quality and different sizes makes them convenient.
5,A+
5,I bought this brand before for my Google phone and it has fallen with the phone dangling on it for who knows how long it has been stepped on pulled on by mistake and it's still as sturdy as the day I took it out of the box. I had another brand for my Kindle. When my Kindle fell on my bed that other charger bent and can no longer stay inside the Kindle unless I tape it. This time I made sure to buy this jsaux brand for my Kindle charger. The price is right and the quality is superb.
5,These are great chargers and the fact that there are three of them is even better.  So far they have been very sturdy and durable.  The only thing I would add is some way to differentiate the front fromm the back do that you are not trying to plug the charger ib the wrong way.
3,If you're into replacing things twice a year this is the USB cord for you! I use these to charge my phone and two of them each lasted about 5 months of light daily use. The metal charging pieces on both of them broke off so they are sitting in a dumpster now.The third cord still works ... for now ... but I did not start using that one until the other two went to the dump.
5,I bought these charger cables about 3 months ago.  They are of very good and durable quality and feels thick so you'll know they'll last. I have one in my car and 2 at different sections in my home.  I recently had an issue with the pins in one so it didn't stick to the phone as it charges it just slid off the port. I contacted the seller and they responded with a replacement quickly.  I appreciate their service and their product.  And for the price you get 3 cables!  With a warranty! You can't go wrong!!
5,I love these charging cords.  3 perfect lengths!  Great price!  Amazing durability!!!  We have 3 dogs and one has chewed through so many things in our house that you can't take your eyes off her.  These cords are perfect.  She has tried to chew them but does not like them and has done no damage to them when she did try.  The color is great.  The sizes are great for different uses and areas or needs.  Also if you use your device while charging it does not crack if bent.  I highly recommend!
5,I have only used 2 of the cables so far (3ft and 6ft car and bedroom respectively). They connect perfectly with my phone. I have only had them for a few days but I am glad I purchased them. My old (6ft) cable became worn and could barely stay connected to my phone so I am glad that these do their job.
5,I first tried JSAUX cables last year when I noticed they looked a lot thicker than the ones I usually use and the rubber sleeve covering the the cord connection looked to offer more protection at the most common breaking point. My family goes through too many of these a year so I needed something more durable. Over a year ago I bought a couple and they’ve held up great. No wear and tear no breaks and still work perfectly. They also work well with higher wattage chargers for fast charging. This year I bought a bunch more to replace all the old ones for our home and car chargers. I’m sticking with these for the foreseeable future. They’re really worth it. 👍🏻
5,I threw out my crappy old broken cords the minute I got these in the mail. They have a durable wrap right around the connection point between the plug-in and cord right on the spots that usually break in typical cords. They look nice too. Also because they are wrapped in a cloth weave my cat is not interested in sinking his teeth into the cord. I put one in each place near where I sit or sleep.
5,Good value for multi use cords.
5,I already own some and I needed some more so I bought the same thing they're great.
5,Realmente funcionan muy bien y tener 3 longitudes diferentes ayuda mucho a la hora de conectar otros componentes como una cámara al computador.
5,I like that they come with three sizes for whatever stretch I might need. i love that they are covered with a tough woven cable covering that seems like it will be very durable. I have been using these for several months and they are holding up well.
5,Really nice cables.  I didnt realize it was a 3' then 6' and a 10'.  So 3' for the kitchen 6' for the night stand and the 10' for the couch and end table.  That is really nice for the couch.  You can sit or lay however you want.So Ive had this problem with cables throughout the house charging at diffrrent speeds.  Some may be older and some may be cheap.  This cable does indeed quick charge our Samsung phones.  If I can get a package of JUST 3' cables I will systematically replace the cables throughout work and home.
4,nice
5,Love the 10' cord it allows allot of flexibility in location and works fantastic!
5,Phone charger stand from anker that you just set your phone on it to charge
5,This cable is solid construction.  I have an older S7 Samsung Galaxy smartphone.  The cable plugs in firmly and it stays put unlike my older cable.  Data transfer and synching work as advertised.  I would highly recommend this cable to anyone who needs a micro USB cable.
5,JSAUX are the best cables for the money!
5,Value for. The money
5,Excellent value. I have replaced more charging cords than I can remember because my cat chews plastic cords. These braided cords with metal plug in ends completely deter my cat from chewing them. They're unlikely to break the wires because of the reinforced plastic connected to the ends that resists the wear of being plugged into outlet chargers. I really like having three lengths for use in different situations. The 3 ft length is perfect for use in charging in cars and the 10 foot length is great for charging my Bluetooth hearing aid streamer for my cell phone and TV sound while walking around. The bright colors are great so that I can distinguish my Type C charging cords from my micro USB charging cords.
5,Completely serviceable and darn fashionable to boot!
5,Better than I expected!!  Great patina I lov’em!!
5,It is a good value  but the longer cords are a little too Long....like will reach Damn near across the room Long....i really just needed the shortest one for the Truck....the other 2 are Backups
5,xellent cables
5,I got this for my fiancé because his phone has having issues with cordless charging. These cords are durable and charges the phone up without leaving it heated. Great quality and are convenient to have around.
5,Sturdy product and feels strong.
5,Exactly what I needed.
5,These are Durable cables Anker-like construction and they came with a bunch of useful lenghts which is great for the money!
5,I love these cables! No more twisting and bending very durable! I have purchased several of these in different lengths! I absolutely love these!
5,These cables work great
5,JSAUX cables are sturdy well designed and well worth the value. A few pennies a day for a durable cable. We have many of them for various plug types.
4,These jsaux micro usb charger cables only lasted 2 1/2 months. I am careful plugging in and unplugging the by the fitting and not the cord. So now I have several cords that has to beMoved around to different positions to get them to work right
5,No thanks
5,They feel sturdy right out of the box In the past I have broken several cords right at the end but the design of these eliminates that problem. My tablet was slow charging but with this cord it is faster. The surprising thing  is that they don't tangle like my old ones. I have several items plugged in on my little table. I was always having to un-tangle them but I haven't had this problem.
5,These cords are well made.  The quality is good and there was a noticeable increase in the speed of data transfer over older cord that was failing.  They look good with the colored braid and the connectors and have extra strength where the cord meets the connector.  The price was good and they work well.  I would recommend them.
4,I like these phone charging cords. They charge my phone pretty fast and are a nice bright blue.
5,For the price of one elsewhere you get THREE here - all with flexible braided cords and a gorgeous color.  I keep one at home one in my backpack and one in my car. Lightning fast chargers too!
5,My condition keeps me in bed a lot so I placed mine on the side of my night stand and wow what a great way to put my computer charger in!Now I don't have to feel around on the floor it's right there. So covenant 😁❤
5,Love the different lengths to use. Very attractive braided covered cable. Ends are secured to the device and the plug ends do not get hot. The reinforced rubber to prevent cords from fraying at the connectors is a plus. Using the middle size right now while my phone charges.If I need more cables definitely will purchase again.
5,I wanted a different color cord that would show up among the others in my cord pile lol. Love the color and it does show up. Love that I have three different lenghts of achords to meet my different needs.
5,I have had these for three months. Love the different lengths. Would purchase again!
2,This is the second set of wires I have bought from this brand. Initially they are great - fast charges my s7 edge as it was supposed to. However after a few months fast charging stops working and it will  charge at regular speed. You also have to jiggle the wire around for it to fit perfectly and charge. The second time around the wire stopped working (unless I intervened) at under 3 months. I like how sturdy the wire is...just wish it could work consistently and properly.
5,The longest cable just stopped working. I replaced with the medium length and it too will not charge.  Currently charging with the last short cable predicting it too will stop soon.  Only lasted a little over a year with normal use.
5,I love these .. Very strong material i believe it'll last me a long time!  Charges my cell a bit quicker from what i can tell...I am using the 3ft in my vehicle 6 ft where i usually sit & 10ft for guests or when i need to move around.  Green is my favorite color too So... I'm happy
4,Vale la pena
5,I have only had this product for a few days but they are working great. The plugs are tight and snug. The cord feels a little stiff but I think they will work in well. Love the color. Product is exactly as advertised. Would definitely buy again.
5,We love this brand of chargers! If you have a child that needs these type of chargers for their devices then you knlw you can go through these quite often! So far my child has had 2 in the past 9 months. Before he was going through about 5 in that time frame. I use this for my phone as well. I love the quality of this for the price. It's amazing! Definitely recommend!
5,I have been looking a replacement lightening charger for my Galaxy S7. These work as good as my original charger and are durable. The price was very reasonable for three of them in different lengths.
5,The cables worked really well given their length and I reached out about faulty contact pins in one of the cables I received. They quickly offered me solutions and I went with a replacement order. They back up their warranty with very little hassle and made sure I was happy with my purchase. I've already bought additional cables from them of a different type as a direct result of this experience.
5,The cords were as described on the site. Appear to be sturdy and really like that there are three different lengths in the set. Price was more than fair. We'll probably order one more set before the product is no longer available or becomes limited in supply.
5,The three sizes are perfect for different locations in the house
3,So this is a pack of three charger cables. I uses the shortest for in my car works great the middle one for office kinda slow but I think that's the power source's fault. But the longest which I kept for home use just stopped charging a few days ago. I bought this back in April and I have never had a charger stop working on me so quickly. Never. Not even the crappy ones I've gotten for 5 dollars. The other two work great and granted they get used less but still. It's not even two months old yet. So I don't know... It seems like this one isn't actually worth the purchase if one third of the product fizzles out after a month and a half of use.
5,Strong 💪
5,No problem. Completely satisfied. Good item.
5,great
5,These are great USB cables the only problem you could run into is if your device has a narrow cavity. These new USB cables coming out all have a resistor on the end that is supposed to not fry your hardware but last time I checked that was only supposed to happen on USB c cables so the need for them on a micro USB doesn't seem warranted and causes them to not fit into some USB devices like the Logitech g502 wireless hero mouse.
5,These chargers are excellent quality and very fast charging. They also have great protection where cord meets adapter so they don't bend and break. We have bought like 6 sets for every room and every car. Highly recommend. Plus they fit even with the phone cases on.
5,I was a little weary when I first bought these charges because the price is pretty low especially when considering that there are three cords in the package. I was happy to find that all three cords feel really sturdy. They also fit my phone nicely and I can feel them click into place when I plug it in which is nice because I've had issues with charges popping out without me noticing in the past. The color is also a nice touch.
5,I have older equipment and these are the usb cables that I needed it took awhile but after an amazon c s rep helped me to find the micro cables no more problems and faster charges. it you have this type of units these are what is needed.
5,The cable works exactly as it should and we are very happy and thankful that Amazon has a tremendous selection of cables at such wonderful prices. This was a typical Amazon transaction which is to say perfection! Homework and you asked for?
5,These charger cords are durable and a lot longer than I expected them to be. Going from a regular samsung charger cable the middle sized one is already much longer than that. As such the longest cable has some extreme reach! Very happy with this choice
5,Fit tightly in my wife's Samsung Galaxy S6. Glad I got the package of 3. One for the car one for desk one for the night stand.
5,These micro usb cords seem high quality and made well.3 pack of 3 different sizes were just what I needed.Really like the teal color and casing.
5,They are extremely durable I've had an USB C from this same brand and it's lasted for over a year and still works perfectly.The length is going to be perfect to play with on the couch while the controller is charging.
5,I love having the 3 different lengths to choose from and the beautiful color is an added bonus!
3,One of the cords failed after 6 months.  No apparent problem just no longer would charge anything I hooked up to it.  It was only used by me never by my kids and I never rolled it up or abused it in any way...just kept it with the wall plug ready to plug in.  Other 2 seem to be doing okay still.
5,This is a 3 pack. One 3ft one 6ft and one 10ft long charger cord is included. It does not include the charging box only the 3 cables. For those of you who are picky about the color teal this is a true beautiful teal color. They seem well made. Reinforced rubber at the end for longer wear and tear. Fits snuggly into an Android phone. Time will tell but this seems to be one of the better built pcroducts.
5,EDIT - Wow! They sent me a new set! That's incredibly kind of them! All three of the new ones are 100% perfect. Thank you again!Really nice cables! For some reason the middle length one (6.6ft iirc?) doesn't really plug into any device well? It kind of wiggles around a bit so charging is a bit sporadic. The other two cables are lovely and sturdy though!
5,Really attractive high quality cables. My central USB hub is mounted next to the bed. One short size to charge my phone on the nightstand. One medium length to keep my tablet plugged in while using it in bed. One long one to reach my bookshelf to charge my earphones.
5,Very nice micro charger cables.  Had 3 different lengths. I like the connectors very sturdy. Got it because it said that it got 10000 bend lifespan.
5,These cords are perfect for Galaxy Tab A (2019) that my twin 12 year olds own. They are constantly on them with this lockdown and so sometimes are connected to charger the chargers that came with them failed within two weeks because of bending. These cords offer protection against that and they also charge them faster then the original cables. I definitely reccomend.
5,I love these cords. They are sturdy and I love all the length options. I haven't had one break on me yet and I've been using them for at least a year or two.
5,These are very sturdy and most importantly they don't unplug from the phone! Most other cords I've used either wear out around the plug head or fall out of the phone too easily. These are very secure. I haven't had them for more than a few weeks but so far they seem great!
3,No puedo dar mi opinión sobre ellos porque los compré por error pero se los regalé a mi hijo y hasta ahora a el le esta funcionando!
5,These usb C values have lasted longer than any other cables I've purchased. Usually the end near my phone becomes flimsy and eventually the charging power lessens within a couple months.  So far so great!
5,Previous review:  The cables work for my phone but will not charge my tablet.  The cord seems to fit snugly but the charge goes in and out and my tablet does not charge.Update:  I recently discovered that the problem was not the cable but the tablet USB port.  My new tablet charges great with this cable.  The cables are heavy duty and work wonderfully.
5,Very strong and durable..i like it so much  not just like any other charger that easily gets broken..i would recommend this to buyers looking for a good  reliable and durable charger.
5,I like these usb cables. Nice and sturdy. Has a 3ft 6ft 10ft cable included. Love the 10ft to play on my phone while laying in bed charging my dead phone. 10ft is even too long. 6ft is perfect. I like the material these cords are made out of. They feel like heavy duty cables. Hopefully they last for awhile.
5,These are our go to cables that we buy for us and any gifts. Highly recommend!
5,
5,They are well made. I liked the strain relief at the connectors.  This is my second set from this Manufacturer.  The first set were C connectors and I love them.  I had a set from another Manufacturer and they wore out in about 4 months of constant use.
4,I really have no complaints overall with the product build quality is pretty good for what it is. However it wasn't compatible with a device that uses Motorola's TurboPower technology.
5,I had ordered the incorrect product twice  when my Samsung charging cord fell apart.  So I was very excited to have this arrive and be the correct size.  Love the durability of the cord and the fast charging speed.  I now have a cord for my computer bedroom and family room.  Thanks for the fast shipping.
5,It's not durable I've had for only 4 months and it's not working I would like to get it replaced.  if then I'll get it from somebody else
5,Putting the 3ft length in the car charger the 6ft length at work and the 10ft one lets me charge my e-reader while reading in bed.  What's not to like?  I keep sharing info on these (and occasionally sharing the cords to friends) so I'm usually ordering every few months.  For the price sturdiness and so far no issues these are great!
4,Well one stopped working in a few days
5,Love that this comes with 3 different lengths keeping one in the car and 2 in different rooms makes it easier than switching it out all the time.
1,Cords do not work. You have to move them in different positions to get a charge
5,Excellent buy!  You get three chargers in different lengths for a great price.  Very high quality.
5,Love the different lengths.  Use the short on for charging on the kitchen cabinets and the two longer ones for charging while reading in bed.
5,Sturdy shiny nylon cord that still works and hasn't shown Any wear!👍 And my son is rough with his cords.
5,I just received so long term durability is still TBD but these are some seriously sturdy cables. They're USB cables so it's hard to get overly excited but I've had so many of the cheaper ones fail that I'm hopeful these will last long enough for a positive future edit.
3,Unfortunately the 10-ft cable stopped working shortly after I purchased it :-( It just stopped charging. I switched to the next cable in the three-pack. Let's see how long that one works.
5,First and foremost JSAUX customer support is excellent. That said the USB charging cables come in a wide variety of lengths the connection between the cable and the cord is protected by a one inch bendable extension that prevents the most common problem. The product is neat strong and with the addition of the customer support the JSAUX charging cables are probably the best buy in the market.
5,Great charger!
5,Work great! Worth the money! I recommend these charging cords!
5,These cables are great for use as using a the long cord for long range ps4 charging while gaming and great for using Dualshock 4 for PC gaming at short distance from a computer.
5,Couldn’t be more satisfied!
4,Product arrived with package pretty banged up unfortunately. No other problems so far.
5,Fast delivery and durable product. We could not ask for mire. 😁
5,This is the second time I purchased these.  They are durable and charging  seems faster.  I have replaced my older charging cables with them. The only suggestion  for improvement  would be to have length  choices.  I would  prefer 3-6 ft available as a purchasing  option.
4,Seems like a great product.  The only reason I gave it a 4 star rating instead of 5 is because I have only had them for a few days.  Durability is still yet to be tested.
5,Charges super fast! Like that it has 3 different sizes. Now i don't have to worry that i forgot my charger at home.
5,Excellent product
5,Excellent quality very well made
4,These lightning cables aren’t bad but the first one I used out of the package broke at the connector to the iPhone. One broken isn’t going to deter me from enjoying the rest of the cables.
5,They are shorter as I need. Was perfect and powerful. My technology charges faster now. Very satisfied!
5,Better than the charging cables that originally come with products. Charge very fast and the 3 different lengths come in very handy. Using all.
5,These cables are very sturdy and have a quality build. The end has a great fatigue reliever that has also helped prevent bending the connector a couple times when I've dropped my phone while it was plugged in. I'm glad I got them and I'll be buying this brand next time I need a replacement cable.
3,From reading the description and details of this product I thought this was gonna be the charger that survived my 4-yr old. It wasn't. He still managed to mess this one up too within the first week of having it. They're fine for regular use from someone who's not going to be yanking on them constantly.
3,Cords are to the proper length but the current output is very very low so the charge time is often 8+ hours and barely keeps the charge stable if you are using your phone.
5,nice thick wire. These are the 4 set of wires I buy. I have these wires everywhere. Cars truck backpack around the house in my office at work. These are good quality wires that charge my devices really quick.
5,Works good
5,These are great! Used the short one in my car and it charges my phone while I drive with no worry of the chord coming loose. I love that it clicks into place! They charge very fast which is definitely another bonus!
5,These usb cables are the best I've purchased hands down. They are heavier more durable and I love the color! But seriously they really are the best that I've used since having a cell phone. I also use them to charge my vapes. I think you will if you decide to buy agree with me.
5,Serious power cords the different lengths (up to 10') are great
5,Chargers work great and fasf charging.
5,The best charger I ever boutCharge very fast.
4,Best purchase love the different sizes. I have one in my car office and bedroom.
5,Used on controllers tablets headphones a wireless charger and probably more things. Never had any issues at all.
5,Solid cables good color and durability.
5,Holding up wonderfully.  Great flexibility and durability.
5,Like the product exactly what I needed
5,It's definitely worth the money.
5,Like any other cables you have to take care of not pulling them or they will become unusable
4,As of now these cords are working well. They also have some sort of warranty 🤔I use them in my semi so they are getting tested fully here.
1,Does not fit my phone when it states in info that it fits an LG phone.
4,Great cable and easy to see for charging phones
5,Love these so far. My sil absconded with one already! I need something my cat won't be inclined to chew up these covered wires usually work well. She's already chewed 5 of the plain charging cords.
5,I'm very pleased with these charging cables. The three different sizes are so beneficial for me. Charged my phone very quickly as opposed to the original short cords that came with my phone. And I'm very pleased with the packaging. They arrived in a box inside the Amazon padded envelope as opposed to being wrapped in plastic wrap. Awesome product. Thanks!
5,We bought for a Galaxy phone and for an earpiece so far so good and durable.
5,Nope
5,These cables were excellent! They can be used with a fast charger to charge up your phone super fast and they can do data with no problem. They're sturdy and reliable. My husband's a techie and he loved these. He said they're way better than any other he's ever bought. Such a great deal.
5,Given a strong braid. Have had them before. Does not have Braille but does have sticker. It's enough for me.
5,GREAT PRODUCT
5,Haven't needed to use them yet. But have tested all of them and they all seem to work fine.
4,Durable enough
5,These seem to be very good cables.  All three work perfectly. I especially like the very durable cable covering and the very good strain relief which will prevent sharp bends at the plugs.  If the longer ones are too long you can coil the unneeded part and fasten them with the attached cable ties.
5,I like the durability of the cables.
3,The actual cable portion is hefty but the micro usb end has already stopped making connection with my device. I need to jiggle it to make a connection which isn't very good. I bought it for my wife's phone and she isnt very happy. Two cables and the same thing.
5,Durable seems pretty high quality
5,These are great! Well worth the money and I like the variety of sizes! Fast charging and very durable. I don't see the area that's around the charger port fraying and becoming bent up like a regular old charger any time soon!
5,Looks good and sturdy. Price and delivery were great
5,They worked beautifully. Well constructed and nice to the touch. Exactly what I needed - thank you!!!
4,I bought the micro 6.6ft ones first and love them and need more as my older cables broke. Now I own these the lighting for iPhone and the usb c all work amazing
5,These are the best charging cords I've ever used an well worth the money
5,They charge my Samsung S7 nice and quick and fit well too. The lengths are great
5,Very Nice Product.  Sturdy with snug fit on both connection ends!  Would purchase again!
5,Great product. I have ordered two more sets for my C chargers. Excellent value.
5,These are awesome! Very sturdy love the different lengths very good value for the price. I would definitely recommend this. I have a Samsung Galaxy S7 and it works perfect with my phone.
5,I like how this cord bends compared to the basic ones. However it's not as flexible as I'd hoped. Still it's a good quality for the price.
5,different sizes excellent quality  durable.
5,These are the best cables I've had for so many different reasons! The rubber reinforcement the velcro strip to bundle longer cords and the brand on the usb "this side up" for super easy at a glance connection! Highly recommend!!
5,Great value sturdy great for kids because we all know they are hard on things definitely durable very happy with this purchase.
5,great product for the price.
5,They are very durable
5,Great but. Well worth the money
5,Charging my phone has been so easy with these cords. I have an outlet that's at the foot of my bed so the 10ft one was a good length for me.The durability is good too since my cat tried to chew my cord and it has not broke.
5,Me encantaron en lo poco que llevo usándolos veo que el material es de muy buena calidad
4,It was a good price for 3. My son broke one right away.
5,Definitely wish I came across these long ago. So much wasted money spent on useless not lasting and overpriced ones. Absolutely worth every penny!!!!!!!
5,This set of charging cables comes in 3 different lengths in one box. And they charge my Samsung devices easily.  I liked these so much I bought another set.  Well worth the money.
5,Durable
5,A girl at told me about these cables. I have grandkids and they are always needing a cable when they come over. This is my second time to order these charging cables. They are sturdy and charge very fast.  Well worth the money!
5,I have purchased the same brand for my other phone and lasted for months. It's definitely worth the money. Sturdy and good quality. I will definitely recommend this to friends and family or whoever that needs it!
5,Great product! You get 3 different lengths&  are very durable
5,Very good quality cables for charging . You can't go wrong with these.
5,sturdy but too long
5,The assortment is great to have different lengths available.  I use the 10 foot cord but really could have done without such a long length.  Would have used a shorter package.
4,Good product.
5,This is my personal opinion about this product if you are going to get these cables you are going to get the best I have never seen better made cables just get them they are worth every penny I would also highly recommend them
5,Very sturdy I like that they don't break constantly. They don't s bend and break at the neck like other cords.
5,This is the best charger I've ever purchased.  I purchased for my Galaxy 7.  It charges at fast speed and is very durable.
5,Work great and very sturdy!
4,too long and can use it only when im home
5,Nice heavy duty cords. They are alot stiffer than a standard cord. Would get this brand again.
5,Bought these for my kids and they are still working so good and i have all boys so that should tell you how strong they are.
5,I love these cables. Super flexible and so useful as I am on my tablet most of every day. My Fire 10 battery can't keep up without the corded use. Almost like using w/o.
5,I just barely got it yesterday but it fits my phone and it works.  It seems very sturdy better than the cord my phone originally came with.
5,I use these cables to program my model airplanes. The long length is very helpful.
5,I like the coloring .I use for my phones and I pads
3,Haven't been work right since I got them.  Jumps between fast charge and slow charge.  Changed adapters and still having the same problem.
5,They are very heavy duty high quality and attractive.  I just received them today so I will update this review should they not last but initial impression is very favorable!
4,They work fine but instead of the three different sizes listed they were all the same size long.
4,Solid product
4,These are great charging cables. The only reason I'm not giving It 5 stars is because it was late getting to me.
5,A wonderful set of cables that's for sure
5,El color y son muy buenos.
5,Best cords I have purchased so far! The cat doesn’t even go near them!!
5,Currently using the 6" one to charge my phone at night. Going to use the 10" for the future hospital stay when my baby gets here.Works great doesn't overheat and is pretty durable.
5,Well made. I have several and have not had any go bad yet. With normal and careful usage they should last a long time. Any cord will break with abuse but these not as easy.
5,3 pack was more than I needed until I used them all
5,I like the charging cords.  I think they are a little stiff.  They could have made it a little more flexible.  Overall a good buy.
5,Good durable charger.  Thank you
5,Excellent cable set! Best of both worlds data & power plus you have a long & shorter cord...but not so short it’s useless. I’ll be buying more
5,Very good product fast speed cables durable and nice looking you will love the length of these cables.
5,They are strong and stick in the plug well.  I can hold up my tablet by the cord without it unplugging and the flex guards are stronger and more durable then I expected.
4,Using it right now
5,Very sturdy
5,Very high quality wires that work very well and the textures surface prevent them from getting tangled. The 3 sizes are perfect for various charging applications around the home!
5,It was so long if a plug was far away it could get to it so well
5,I've bent and crushed the cables by accident multiple times and they still work great.
5,I liked the way the cords held up to being pulled and tugged on.  I really like the style and color choices.
4,Love it
5,Perfect lengths and very strong. 👍👍
5,I am currently using the 10 foot charger and am enjoying the convenience of moving around a bit while online/streaming. The other two sizes are great for table charging or 'in place' charging. The product arrived on time and was in excellent condition.
5,Made very well.
5,Perfect size assortment gives me the size verity I needed and the cables are great!
5,I typically don't write reviews but these cables are fantastic! I use the 10' cable daily to charge my phone and would recommend them if anyone asked. 5/5 stars
5,One of the best products I have ever bought through Amazon. Fast delivery I would highly recommend and will purchase again.
5,These were the best cables I have purchased.  They fit tightly into my phone.  Most others are very loose and fall out easily.  Highly recommend theses.
5,seems to be durable and sturdy a great value for the money
5,I had purchased these charging cords as a gift and 2 of them did stop working after 6 months.  I contacted customer service and they replaced them promptly!
5,Have only had for one month so I cannot rate on durability.  These appear to be very sturdy.I was very pleased to find this set if charging cords with length options.
5,Always charging my 2 phones.  Never have enough cables.  Now I can charge from my front and my mid outlets and still have room to charge other items.  Great product & great value.
5,So far so good on all fronts. Love that it comes with a Velcro fastener to keep it in place when not in use.
5,Very nice cords.  As good as any cord out there.  I've used for a month now with no issues and I'd say these will last for years.
5,All the cables are great and in such cool colors...love em!
3,I had no problems with the cables they charge fast they're great for controllers but they will break easily like all other micro USB cables. One drop and it was flimsy and had to be moved around to connect right good thing it came in a pack of multiples.
5,I have grandsons and my cables disappear all the time I'm so happy I can buy multi-packs!
4,Fit god a little bit stiff.
5,Strain relief design should add durability and life to the cables. Most USB cable failures occur at the point where the cable enters the connector . The substantial strain relief will reduce the incidence of cable failure.
5,Just what i needed. Those short charges are useless to me. The long 6ft / 10ft chargers are perfect!!! makes life easier
5,A must have
5,Best çord for the price !!!
5,Looks good. Reinforced ends. Looks like these will serve for longer than the cheap set I had before.
5,My daughter goes through probably a cord every two weeks but not these. All working and in the same condition they came in.
5,Loce the product.
5,Robusto y carga muy rápido
5,Very sturdy and durable.
5,So far these have been great!  They were exactly what my son was looking for!
5,This color wasn't as bright as my other colored cords by JSAUX but this is a great quality charging cord brand...
5,Works great
5,These are actually well made.  Good job with the ends on them should hold up very well.
5,Great value 👏
4,Sturdy built for charging numerous units.
2,the cables stopped working after a few weeks. not durable
5,The cable looks very nice. The velcro strap is good quality velcro and handy for wrapping the cable. If it breaks in less than a year I'll come back to update the review.
5,Nice n strong.
5,Good cords
5,Quality made
5,strong material
5,This is the best cable I have ever had for charging my phone.
5,Love this cables the built is excellent! You won't be disappointed. Definitely recommend!!
3,This cable didn't hold up as I expected. It was better than  other I have purchased  .I am hard on phone cables.This may do great for you.
5,Yes it's teal green.
5,These r great charging cables. U get 3 for a really good price and they r very durable. I would buy these again.
5,The cables look great seem very sturdy. I really like the reinforced area where the cable bends. I've had other similar cables that broke in that area without the reinforcement. A good value overall.
5,i liked the product.  no issues.
5,The blue color is prettier in person.  Easy to connect to phone.  Strong cords.
5,These were perfect for my needs. Came quickly. The green is pretty and are a different than all the other cords I have.
5,I personally liked everything about it good value for money only 11.99 awesome amazing I love them and I use these cords on the go with my portable charger!!! Mulit uses
5,These cords are very sturdy nice quality and the look is very nice. I have not had them very long but I will update with whether they last or not.
5,It actually charges my phone SO MUCH faster!
5,Great durability and value for what you pay for.
5,Very sturdy chords I like the fact that some of them are longer than the standard length. Fits into the phone charger port tightly without any slippage!
5,worked great
4,Well made and durable.
5,Awesome cables and made very well. I have the 3ft one in my car to charge my headphones. I love how they feel and they are a bit stiff but they bend easily. Would definitely buy again
5,I put all three cables into immediate service.  They worked perfectly.  The long one is very handy while traveling and outlets that are far from where you want to work.
5,Su precio resistencia y durabilidad. Un cable Heavy dutty de verdad.
2,Bought the 3 pack in April and it's now August.  Only the mid length cord is still working.  Unfortunately  these cords don't last very long.  I gave 2 stars because I loved them when they were still working.
5,good size assortment
5,Very nice
5,Good value.
4,Well built cords.
5,These cords seem to work very well. They are made well. I am very happy so far.
5,Great variety of lengths. They come in more handy then you would imagine.  Quality is there and worth every penny

5,So far so good! No problems and these cable are very durable! I have the short one in my car one in the livingroom and one in the bedroom.
5,Strong and good cables
2,These cables are very sturdy & still look brand new. Unfortunately the plug that goes into the phone has come loose & doesn't always charge the phone. I did not contact anyone about this yet. We are going to try it on the grandkids tablet first. If it doesn't charge them I will be contacting Amazon or the seller.
5,Great price and seems well made. Would buy from again fast shipping too
3,The ends have to be broken in before they are easy to use.
5,Great variety of lengths of cords. Very sturdy!
5,Perfect for what I needed it for.

5,Very durable
5,So far so good. My kids are rough on cables but these seem more durable than the others.
5,My old set of cables I use for charging my phone were well worn. These make a good secure fit and the variety of sizes is great.
2,been buying micro USB from amazon for years but none of them gave up so fast. the prongs that hold the connector in the phone gave up and got stuck after my second use to charge the phone! I mean come on!!!!!!! I have other brands that they survived 1 y  my 3y old rascal and this one didn't survive 2 usages from a 30y old that is taking care of how I use everything.. so yeah that should say everything. hopefully the other 2 will survive longer than 3 4 usages
5,Vibrant color in the cord first of all that I liked and it works perfectly.
5,Use to charge airpods and LG Aristo2 cellphone.
5,I have had these for several months now. I am very pleased with them. Very durable and well made. Excellent value.
5,These are really well made and durable.
5,All three work very well. I like the velcro strap in the middle to keep it tidy and neat. I will be repurchasing these.
5,Good price for 3 cables including a couple pretty long ones. Fit snugly into the charging port. Only time will tell but the braided cable seems sturdy.
5,These cables are excellent! A nice firm fit in the Kindle charging port and recharged the device quite rapidly. I highly recommend these over anything I've found in stores.
5,As described. Works great so far. 3 diff size cords are super convenient
5,We use them to charge our cell phones. They look a lot more durable than our old ones that have quit working.
3,This was good @ first but 1 month in and the micro usd connection is bend at almost a 45°.They should try a side way construction instead of a linear plug-in.
5,In my home USB cables have a short life.Theslook and seem to be robust enough to last.
3,didnt last for long but value for money is quite considerable
5,Seriously the best charger cords I've ever owned

5,I use to change my phone. The one I have was not long enough.I love itperfect.
2,Great look sturdy wrapped cabling.  Unfortunately the fast charging stopped in less than 9 months.  Now a 1.5 hour charge takes 7 hours.  It has happened with 2 of the 3 cables.  Buy elsewhere if you want something that lasts.
5,Extra long tips. USB Micro 3pk.
5,No issues after 3 months
5,Best chargers ever! They are actually quick charging. Everyone claims quick charge but these ones are legit!

5,Good Value. Well made. Love three different lengths especially the long cord; great price.
5,Great product for the price. Working perfectly for my cell phones.  Highly recommend.
2,I bought these because my charging cords were constantly fraying at the base and these have a built-in protector which does a great job of protecting that area. Where they failed is in the piece that inserts into the phone. It has taken some months for this to happen but they need to correct that issue to earn more than two stars. Can't recommend these.
5,Good quality and work good in my truck for android auto data transfer from phone.

5,Best value. Fast charging
5,Nice tight fit in USB ports.
5,Fast delivery!
1,As soon as I recieved this set of cords I began using the longest one. It stopped charging 2 and a half months later. From there I began using the middle length cord. As of 12/07/2020 the middle length cord was working fine. Until today. The 2 little prongs on the back of the charging plate no longer stick up to secure the charger into the phone. So now I put it in the phone to charge and with the slightest shift it falls out. I very much feel scammed
5,What an awesome buy wow great
5,Works perfect and a great price.
5,Good value
5,Great cable!
3,Wasn't as strong as stated they were.
5,Great product & value. 3 diff sizes. Ty
5,Nothing for now all is good
1,The cables are well made on the outside. It's a shame that the end that plugs into your device is too long and slightly off in size. As a result it wiggles around and you have to put it in a very particular position to charge. The cord literally has to be pulled forward across the screen to work. Unfortunately even when it's actually working my device is still discharging. I can only think that the wires inside are too small and low quality to push a charge even on my 9W charger. They're basically nice looking sturdy garbage from China.
5,Cords are durable 2 teens sharing them so far so good!
5,Works great quality item
3,2 of the 3 worked.  wasn't time or cost effective to return.
5,It charges real fast

5,Good
5,Really happy with our purchase
5,Great cables that look good too.
1,This is my 1st review ever.  These cables are horrible.  I bought them 6 days ago.  The 6 foot cable went loose after 4 days.  The 3 foot cable went loose after about 28 hours.  I use them the same way I use all my cables (which generally last for over a year).
5,Excelente
5,Just want I wanted.
5,As expected
5,Great quality
5,Chakra feet

5,Sturdy & charges quick!
5,Phone charger cord
5,Great quality!
5,Still using fast charging
5,👍👍
2,These are just like any other product that comes out of China.  I have love for many products out of China but unfortunately this item is not one of them.
5,Buena calidad
1,Ordered a three pack and in a day or so of use realized that two of them had bad connections.  A slight wiggle while plugged into my tablet and power would go off and on.  Sent back for replacement as I figured I was just unlucky to get some bad ones.  Two of the replacements that came did the same thing right out of the package.  Tried about every cable in the house to make sure it wasn't my tablet.  My tablet was and is OK.  Sent back these for refund.
5,Great cords
2,I plugged it in and it didnt connect. It was bent and lose. The other 2 was fine.
5,Great product
5,Great cords!
2,I liked that they had different length cords but one of the cords already doesn't stay in the charging port of my phone.  Can't say that I'm thrilled about the durability.  I haven't even had these a week!
5,nothing to dislike
2,I loved the fact that there were different lengths. The medium size cord did not last long and was not as durable as I would have expected.
5,Good product good price.
5,just what I needed
5,Quality
5,Bien
5,Fast charge and durability
5,Good
2,Bending after gentle use. I thought these would be a spectacular ... But fail again. They refuse to stay Plugged in now too.
2,Doesn't work as recommended. Won't work at all with a Samsung Galaxy S7
5,Liked
5,Muy bueno
5,Charges fast and durable
2,Very upset these are not high speed charging cables at all. My battery dies quicker than it charges. I use high speed adaptors but its the cord quality it's unfortunately very very slow charging. Will not buy again.
1,Nice looking cable but it doesn't matter how nice it looks if it doesn't charge.  So I have a cable - the longest one the one I needed most- plugged into a charging block and it is taking 9+ HOURS to charge my phone. Change block thinking it can't be new cable still 9+ hours. Changed cable phone fully charged in 43 minutes. Not worth price if they wont fast charge!
2,Unfortunately connector was broken off of 1
5,Good
5,Perfecto
2,Couple hours in 1 cord already broken I'm disappointed.
1,I was really encouraged by the obvious quality that this cord seems to have... the braided outer the quality-LOOKING connectors. What a disappointment then after a month of using to charge an earphone once a day. After that amount of light use the cord will no longer deliver a charge. I tried it on other devices with the same zero result. Then I tried another cord on those devices and got good charging. So beware... this cord looks good but is nevertheless junk.
2,1 stopped working in a few weeks. But they do charge fast and comes in 3 different lengths.
1,Was very disappointed in this product. Saw reviews stating how long lasting these cords were and I was severely let down. I'm in no way tough on my charger cords they practically sit in one spot most of the time but these cords started to break down within a weeks of using them. They no longer charge fast I lose battery faster then they can charge at this point.
1,I was disappointed by these. They do not charge as described. I keep getting an error with the cord that it is slow charging. They look sturdy but one came apart after a day.
2,10 ft cord barely charges.  Other 2 are very slow at charging
1,All three broke within the first month of use. They worked well when they actually worked but they stopped charging at top efficiency and took forever to charge my devices after they gave up. Each charger barely lasted over 8 days a piece.
2,Worked well for about a month. Now when I plug my phone in overnight the battery is still about dead in the morning.
1,Charger stopped working
1,Not good broken very quick
1,I use the 3 ft cord every day for a month and the last week it's will not charge my phone 100% unless it has 3 hours to do so and has now been 6 weeks since I received these chords all three of them have quit working completely
1,I love the color but I am so disappointed that 2 stopped working under 15 days but my return deadline has passed because I didn't use all 3 right away.I am in hopes that the seller will reach out and I will update my review based on customer service?
1,The cable damaged my fast charging adapter and my phone. My phone would turn really hot to the point of burning my hands when it was charging. Now the charge runs out after a minute. I tried to charge my phone but it won’t start now.
1,These did not last long.They were only used with 2 phones. Ordered in April and now it’s June and all three do not work anymore.
1,There are three cables 3 feet 6 feet and 10 feet long.  The 10 foot long cable did not work.  I threw out the box and am not attempting to return. Just beware - keep the box if you order so that you can return.
1,At the beginning it was working great at right at 2 months it completely failed. It would take 4 hours to charge my phone and if I was on it or had music going it would go backwards. I couldn't figure out anything that happened to cause it so I think it just failed.
1,All 3 cords stopped working within a few months one at a time. Now left with no working charging cables.Cords are durable but the connections do not last. Will plug in and only connect if wire is angled in certain directions. Until one day will no longer connect or charge.
1,Defective All three of them they fit so tight into the inner charging piece that they actually destroyed that part of my cell phone which no longer will take a charge and I had to buy a new cell phone they also stopped working and would start randomly buyer beware
1,All 3 cords stopped working within a month of using each of them. They charge only for a few minutes before they stop working and my tablet won’t stay charged because of it. Waste of money
1,The cables are nice but 2 out of 3 don't charge. I thought it was the charging block and waited on ordering new charger blocks. However it seems the problem is the cable itself. Not happy with the product
1,My 3 foot cable stopped working within a week. Other cables work good but its not fair to pay for a bundle and 1 comes defective. Update now 2 cables aren't working I have to play around with the cables to get them to charge.
1,This is the second time I am buying this brand of cable - a capital waste of money!
1,we made sure that the usb-b was the order.  they got it wrong.  can't use a -c.  returning it....
1,They started out working fine to charge our tablets and then 2 of them got bent and broken in the first month. Now the 3rd one stopped charging even though it doesn't appear broken.
1,I have had these for 2 months and they have become unusable. The two cords I have been using both loosened up and will fall out of the device you are attempting to charge. Dont waste you money on these.
2,2 of the cables failed to work within 2 months
1,These cords work great...for a while. Like weeks.  Then it sloooooooows down to the point where it is useless.Don't waste your money.  Buy a better brand.
1,I received the above order the beginning pf December.  However I am missing the 3.3 ft. charger.  When can I expect to receive it?  Thank you very much.Gail E.McFarlandgegaff@yahoo.com
1,Guess one of those cords aren't plugging into the phone seems like there is a deformity at the end that has to plug in to the phone itself
1,They were supposed to be fast chargers but 2 out of 3 barely charged at a trickle rate. Very disappointed  they looked and felt very well made.
1,These were awful. Broke almost immediately and just threw them out. Be super careful if you purchase these it was almost like using these made the charging port on our tablet loose.
1,Bad. Only been 2 months and they already don't stay connected. The micro connection to my phone is loose.  Keeps stopping and starting charging if it moves.
1,These are very poor quality items. Even with light use they fail rapidly and without signs of wear. Save the $$; put it toward a reliable product!
1,Finding good chargers is hard. You'll need to keep searching
1,Only one cord worked with our phones. They are all different lengths and sized for different phones. None of them fit my LG G5.
1,I received this item less than a month ago and already stopped working not too happy at all.
1,this product did not fit my android S8+ as described in the description do not recommend
1,Does not stay connected to devices. I have to tape charges to devices.
1,Broke with the first month of owning them
1,These USB cables are supposed to be fast charging. They are NOT.
1,After 3 months of using the 3 chargers stopped working.
1,Got them - 1 of the 3 worked. Sigh.
1,Worst thing I've ever bought on Amazon. These chargers do not even work!!
1,These were AMAZING for a couple months. Then they stopped working 🙄
1,10 ft cord stopped working less than 2 months in
1,Used once and the connection no longer fit tight in my phone.
1,Have used them for 2 weeks and now they don't work!
1,Just got them a month ago and they already charge super slow
1,Does not fit my android
1,Didn't Work
4,Performs as advertised
3,i have had a set of these for about a year now which i may or may not have ordered from this seller its the exact same brand and cable is all i do know.anyways everything about these would be perfect for a good cable so you don't need to keep buying low quality cables EXEPT for the fact that for some absolutely unknown reason the tip of it that inserts in the devices u plug into on the micro USB end LOVEs to curl upward over time when plugged in. this wouldn't be a big issue if it still works but it gets so bad that what i assume are the main grounding tabs will recess into the end. it is hard to describe this issue but luckily theirs already a few images in the reviews of this seemingly magical bending.its such a big disappointment to because i love the looks of this thing and it even has a smart chip that may or may not actually do something I'm not an expert in this kind of thing.you can actually bend main body of the prongs by hand back to position and yes it does make it work again But it just bends back upward about 2 weeks to a month later depending on use.i doubt it but if JSAUX looks at this review please look into fixing this issue if u haven't already.I'd gladly buy some more of these cables if i knew this issue was fixed and I'm sure many others who bought your cables would do the same as i.long story short at least for now look for another USB to micro USB cable if u want it to last and not be annoyed to heck bending these back in position every few weeks.
5,Great value!  Three cables that stay plugged in. The different lengths are what I needed the most.Very satisfied.
5,Great value.
5,I am pleased to share my experience and has been by far the best USB type b purchase for its durability and quality it withholds. I'm just amazed with this product I shared my concerned with the old cable non braided USB type b my friends had and after they test it out themselves. I'm assured the placed an order for a pair. Same with my elder brother.Actually this came into handy so much that I gave the 10ft cable to my dad since his wireless charger only takes USB type b and his previous one broke. This turned out to be a little but much effective gift.Thank you for the opportunity and the product you guys put out and the amount and energy is with this team I see myself staying loyal to your company.I hope you guys also make USB type a to type c cable so I can switch out all my cable for my phone. I already have your type a to type b type c to type c and the hdmi which came in really handy over the months.
3,Two cables work only intermittently despite easy use.
5,Love the assortment of colors works well with my device's as my outlets are never where I need them the different lengths are most valuable so I don't have to arrange my furniture according to outlet availability. Also they don't get hot like a lot of cords often do.
5,This product is being used for charging my S7edge cellphone.  I received 3 different sizes which makes it easy to use if I'm  sitting far away or close.
1,Purchased december now february 2 are broken used in car the one used at home hasnt had any issues
3,I'd almost say these are two star cables but they at least function and look nice. The thing is though if I had a greater need for micro usb cables like this I'd probably throw these in the trash and keep looking. I've owned other cables from this "Brand" JSAUX and yeah. I don't think I'd buy from them again.So what makes these average to sub-par? Haha. Ahh. Two things.I think the braiding is mid-tier quality. It's not the best I've used but not the worst either. The overall cable though is kind of stiff feeling and it's something I noticed with these braided cables and the quality of the material they use. I find it easier to find these higher quality cables when looking at usb-c cables but more difficult on older style of connectors like micro-usb. It's just the braiding isn't that flexible or soft so it makes for a stiff awkward cable. When you compare this to a cable from a company like Uni it's just a big difference.The second part about this cable is the the whole connector design. Part of the marketing is that it's got 10000+ bend lifespan and oh look compared to those apple looking cables you aren't going to strip your cable. Ahh! so good! But uhhh... It's two inches of stiffness sticking out of whatever you plug it into. People post up shots of the bent micro-usb connector and as soon as I hand these in my hands I thought yeah yeah I can see exactly how this happens. So it's like sure you're not putting strain on your cable but the bulk of the connector itself ends up shifting that strain to the micro-usb connector. The whole connector is just so bulky.Beyond my issues with the stiffness of the cable and the bulky connector there's nothing that makes it stand out or be more than a 3 star product. A lot of these products made by nearly name brands like this are a lot of style over substance. I swear they all have their cables manufactured by the same factory and just slap their name on it. There are better cables out there. Ones that have a compact sturdy connector and a flexible but strong cable. Where the nylon braiding feels soft and flexible. That isn't this cable or any cable I've tried from this "brand".However they do function in their main purpose as a USB cable. I think if you have a more static application that you want a nice looking cable for these are just fine and look nice. However if you want to use them with a device you're going to be handling I think I'd keep looking. For me I was using it with a PS4 controller tethered to my computer and I did not like them. I went back to using the cable I had before hand. It's not as fancy looking but in the real world use it proved to be much better.
5,This is the second time I've purchased this set. I love that it comes with three different lengths that I can switch out depending on my needs. What I love the most is that this 3 cord set only costs $12. It's difficult to find non-iPhone cords locally so I have to pay out the nose for cords that go with my Samsung. It was going to cost me $16 for one cord just to have one that worked for Androids and fit the micro USB slot. This set is a steal compared to what I have access to locally. Whenever I need more I know where I'm coming to get them. These cords seem really strong and sturdy as well which is a good thing. I'm really pleased with how well they work for me. Plus they're a pretty blue color. 5 stars!
5,I ordered these in August and the 6-ft one stopped working. I contacted the company and they responded the same day to give me a discount code for 99% off to order the same item again. This was great customer service!I was initially a little worried about the phrasing on the listing "18-month worry-free period" rather than saying it had an 18 month warranty. but they honored that 18 months with a 99% off discount code. Shipping and tax still applied so I had to add something else to my order to get the free shipping. They responded saying that since they don't sell the 6-ft cord separately they would send me a package of all three which I was not expecting. It was a nice surprise though.for anyone else worried about the phrasing of the 18 month worry free I would not worry about that unless paying for tax and shipping concerns you. I would buy from this company again if I needed to and I would also recommend it to my friends.
5,Set of three: short medium long in green.  Perfect for different reaches at charging stations I set up in my home. Full fast charges.  Upgraded from old slow-charging cables.  Durable thick knit-covered cables with velcro tie at a reasonable price.Have "old-faithful" smartphones that work great but getting harder to find this adaptable charging cable model.  Glad I purchased and gifted another set for my husband.
5,Nice item. Just wasn’t what I needed as I was issues another phone at work with different charger type needed literally on the day these arrived
5,Was extremely happy with my purchase.
2,These cords only lasted about a week on kindle fires. Thought the price was right but when they don't charge you devices it's a waste of money.
5,Haven't used these for very long but like them so far. They charge devices well.
5,An inexpensive cable that seems very sturdy and should last longer than the cables that typically ship with products.
5,They're nice high quality chargers. I misread the description and expected them to all be 10ft but that was my mistake. Decent price as well. They're also a beautiful color
5,Cords work well seem like they will hold up for a long time!
5,Very happy with purchase
5,Cords work great just as they should.No issues. Arrived quickly.
4,Micro USB cables in general have a very limited life.  Ordered this product based on its durability and extended life time.  Happy with the product in full.
5,Very good product love the cord durability and they charge my phone alot faster then the stock charge cord.
5,Fast charge
5,I have only used them once but they seem to be well made and I like having multiple lengths for different applications.
5,Like everything about this Android S21 long fast charging cord. Priced right sturdy !!!!
4,So far so good but we all know how chargers go lol....Loved that it came with 3 different sizes.
5,My android phone is fast charged extremely fast.
5,Super nice cord 100% reliable
5,Great Product. All the sizes are extremely useful.
5,Very good quality. I'm very happy with this purchase.
5,I've only used this for the past week and so far I love it.  It came with different size cords so it can fit many needs.  I think it will hold up better than the cords I've gotten in the past.  I also purchased separately a fast charging base and that along with this product has really made my phone charge up fast.  I'm really impressed with that aspect.
5,When I saw that I could purchase 3 quality charging cords in one kit  I jumped at the opportunity !  The cords & end connectors look to be of high quality & well made. Besides the price was very affordable. I only rated 4 stars for durability & sturdiness because obviously I just received them. But I have no doubt they will last for quite a long time with proper care just like anything else. Try it you'll like it !!!
5,A++
5,Very happy with this product
5,This is my third purchase from JSAUX I was very satisfied with the C connector cables and the Micro cables purchased here are likewise very durable.
5,For what they cost the quality is SO GREAT!!But a set before the price goes up.
5,The 3 lengths are great
5,These cords are VERY well made and not necessarily cheap Chinese sh*t.  I like that they came in 3 sizes and the colors are amazing.  I have used these with my Verizon super charger and they're great.
5,Finally a cable that will last. This charger is well made. Good price for 3 (THREE) cables.
5,👍👍👍
5,100%
5,Very sturdy looking set of leads. I like the 3 different lengths. I like the short 3' lead for my car. It is long enough that I can hook up my phone and it will reach to the front seats and is not too long. The 6' lead is good for my nightstand it reaches the outlet and I can bring it into the bed. I use the 10' lead in my living room its good for on my couch where the outlet is way behind the couch. I am very pleased!
5,I purchased these cables for use with a Raspberry Pi 400 Quad-Core 64 Bit 4GB RAM system.  I will buy these cables again for my Windows and Unix based systems.
3,Cables are very durable no fraying occurred.  one of the 3 cables shorted out at the tip that connects to the phone after 1 month of usage.
5,Really like these cords.  Like the multiple sizes.  Sometimes I have to talk on the phone while charging.  The long length gives me mobility so I don't have to stand/sit right by the charger.  The color is very pretty and functional.  Works great!  Have had no issues!  (Also if the cord is too long there is a little velcro wrap you can tie around the cord to shorten it up.  Either way super convenient if you need long or short.)
4,Adequate
5,Highly recommend!
5,Love this item and it's durability
5,My Samsung Tab A is a few years old so it uses this type of cable instead of type C.  I needed a few different lenghts for different places in my house and these cables are much better quality than the ones they are replacing.
5,Good value work great.
5,Works great
5,I have bought from this company many times now and have only had one cable take damage. The flexible rubber near the end separated from the end over a year ago and it still works fine. If you abuse your cables as much as me this is the obvious choice.
5,They work good so far. No complaints. Hope the braded cord is durable. Set of 3. Using 2 and have one as a backup.
5,Nice! ridged wire firmest connector ends to wiring ive ever come across connector to phone end is a great super snug fit especially considering my phone is an s7 i purchased back in march of 2017. Happy with the 10ft now plugged-in behind a  recliner i can finally lay fully back and have plenty of extra slack while playing games. 3.3ft in my truck now and 6 footer in bedroom.
5,
5,The different sizes.
5,Really expensive looking cables. Like the variety of sizes. These have held up well.
5,I seem to go through cords pretty often so I decided to try these.  So far so good.  They don't seem to kink as much as most of my past cords so I have high hopes these will last longer!
5,Nice 5 starsFor the older Androids / Notes
5,Before unfolding I plugged them in to make sure they worked and they all did! But after unfolding them I noticed the 3ft cord has a short in it. As I move my tablet it pings telling me it's not continuously charging!  I hope to resolve this with the company but we will see! Hopefully they can send me another 3ft charger and replace this one!  I will update later on durability over time! I mean at the moment they seem like great chargers for the price! I just hope they last us more than a month!
1,Paid for a 3 pack and received a 2 pack that looked like the box had already been opened and resealed with another sticker. Plus the box was dented and the UPC stickers have been changed.
5,It charges fast.  I use the three foot and the six foot cord.  I gave the ten foot to a friend who had trouble with her tablet not keeping charge and staying plugged in.  Well that fixed the problem.  Delivered as promised by Amazon.  Cords are stiff but it works that is what matters.  I run tablet for all day and it stays on 100%.  It tends to get a little warm but not hot but then it cools down when it is done charging (or when I turn the table off).  Glad I found these and they work too!!  Oh the micro end is a snug fit so don't force it as that is a good thing.  I use the short one for a speaker and the other for my tablet.  The price was perfect.
5,This are awesome very sturdy and durable.
5,Just got them a couple days ago cords seems really durable. Love they come with a cord strap for storage. All have worked well so far. And i like the fun color
5,Mostly used for charging and down loading nothing else comes close
5,I like to have a charger close to me wherever I nest in the house.  These do a nice job if the break it's always where the cord joins the plug. Just part of life I suppose.
5,These are the best chargers! I love how they come in 3 different sizes and they are super fast chargers!!
5,Excellent
5,A durable and effective set of USB-A to Micro USB cables.I have only used the shortest cable so far to transfer photos from my Android phone to my MacBook Pro. Haven't got that transfer to work successfully so far but I suspect it is a software parameter or setting that is preventing it rather than the cable itself.
5,Good product. Fast shipping.
5,Cables are good and sturdy quality.
5,High quality and good price
5,Works great for my Samsung Galaxy smartphone an and the cords are durable
5,These arrived very quickly and they seem really sturdy.
5,looks really good
5,I bought these cables to replace the original cables that came with my Samsung Tab E and Galaxy S7 that began to rupture at the base of the plugs.  I noticed they didn't charge as fast as they normally did especially my phone which I always use with the Fast Charging Adapter.  These Micro USB Charger Cables are the best! I only had them for a week but so far I am totally impressed.  My phone charges much faster with the adapter and one of these cables.  I use the 10ft cable for my phone the 6.6ft cable for my Tablet and I keep the 3.3ft one in my desk drawer.  I would recommend these cables.
5,High quality does what it says on the tin.
5,Product was exactly as expected.
5,I dont have much to say about this.  They transferred the data and charged.
4,for cell phone
5,These cables work very well and are sturdy and I'm sure will last a long time
5,I like the different lenght and way they are built
5,Works well. Works fast
5,Muy bueno
5,Bought these because I needed multi-length USB cords for my home and phone. Very sturdy and durable. I keep 1 in my car home and on the go. Fast shipping and recommended buy.
5,I have a toddler who has a tendency to break the chargers when she plays on her tablet and so far these have held up! They actually fast charge so if you have a phone that will only charge with a fast charger these work. The colors are amazing and the different lengths are wonderful.
5,I can never find a 3.0 cord so I chose this one.  Wanted 10' and 3' and for the money getting three cords was a decent value.  My phone charges fully in about an hour.
5,These are holding up well. The various lengths are useful. I would buy these again.
5,Great product fold it neatly and wrap with straps and you'll have this product forever
5,Very nice

5,They feel durable and look great. Haven't had any troubles with any of JSAUX's cables.
5,best value.
5,So Bought these turquoise charging cables for my son and I wanna steal them. Anyways Its plain and simple they do exactly what they are meant to do and fast. No sign of wear yet and its been 4 months!
5,So it came with 3 chargers that are all different lengths. I got them for my kids because they seem to go through chargers like underwear🙄 They’re holding up great to the kids dragging them room from room. If they do break I plan to buy more because they’re nicely made and very sturdy.
5,Good length
5,Well I was reading the reviews and I can't believe that they sent out any bogus cables unless it was a bad lot I've been using these cables no I'm to a year and have ordered all but a few that they make and all are still in great condition hold a tight connection and still have rapid data transfer no matter what length of cable so what's the problem hands down the best cables made
5,Muito bom
