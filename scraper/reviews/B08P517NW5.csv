4,Did a great job recognized two separate cards (SD and microSD) at the same time as separate drives which was nice because I needed to transfer files between the two did it quick found no problem Windows 10/11. My only gripe is the USB connector especially with the little adapter will probably block one of your ports if you have them close together. The Black plastic is a bit wide in that area.
4,This seems like a cheap card reader. You know how normally with SD card inputs there's a spring and it "clicks" into place? This doesn't have that. You just push the card into the slot and in a moment it is recognized by your computer. I really wish it did have that click but for the price it's ok. It does what I need it to do and it hasn't given me any problems with it so far.
5,It works well has a solid build quality blue led that is not too bright for data movement feedback and the tail that is the perfect length to reach around the computer without getting in the way.  Highly recommend.
5,Bought for work. Keep plugged in to computer can import pictures into patients charts as needed.
5,I bought this reader hoping it could read a Sony Memory Stick - MSA 128A - from one of Sony's earlier digital cameras.  This card reader has an appropriate slot for this type of memory card and it read it perfectly.
5,I bought a camera (early 2000s) to take retro photos of my car. It only takes memory pro stick duo cards. I couldn’t find anything to read the cards until I found this. Absolute life saver!
5,looking at pictures on a SIM card
5,I was having trouble reading memory cards with my computer but this solved the problem. Recommend!
5,Very easy to use
5,Item was of admirable quality. Exceptionally fine packaging. Delivery was ever so fast. Recommended.
5,This is a pretty awesome card reader.  It will read multiple cards at once and makes file transferring very easy.  Well worth the money!
5,Most new computers no longer come equipped with these standard features so it is nice that this one unit has multiple functions. I use it once a week to check the SD camera footage on the farm obtained at entrances exits and animal pens. I needed something that was reliable and easy to store when not in use. This object helps keep our peace of mind. The product is easy to find under PC menu and is easy to operate.
5,I am a photographer.  My wife asked me to take photos of our pets.  My response was "we have over one thousand each how many do you want?"  Point is I need a way to store and back up huge quantities of photos.  I use SD cards.  This card reader stays plugged in to my main computer all the time....except when I need it with my laptop or my tablet (have not tried it with my phone..yet)  It does come with multiple plugs.  Out of the way till you need it then just works.  Again great product fast shipping priced right what more can you want?
5,After many years of faithful use my old card reader died.  I do a lot of video "taping" and then need to download onto my computer to edit.  My old one was much smaller this thing is pretty big but accepts the cards that I use and I don't mind bigger.  It is easier not to get lost.  This one also has a regular USB and a USB C reader on it.  I used both and the computer immediately recognized it as a drive as soon as I plugged it in.  I imagine the USB C might be a bit faster but an hour of taping usually only takes about 5 minutes to download onto my computer so if it takes 3 or 5 does not matter much (I will get a cup of coffee and it will be downloaded when I get back).  So far 5 star product and imagine it should work many years like my old one did
5,CF are not widely used these  days. Finding this easy to use multi storage device reader was just what I needed. Opened and used it upon receipt. Worked perfectly. Will it last and function  long term is always the question.
5,does what I needed
5,Very fast reading. Easy to use. I like the cord connection vs a direct plug-in unit that is supported by the USB port. Provides both USB A and C connectors.
5,Works great and have never had issue.
5,First time purchasing and works great!
3,ok nothing special but gets the job ( reading cards ) done seems slow and cards go in hard.  but it does read them that is the main need!...
3,Works on my computer and doesn't work on my phone as shown on pictures
4,It does its job.  Good value.  The slots don't offer a lot of purchase for the cards - you are never really sure the card is seated correctly.  There is no "click" in.  But it works just fine.
5,this works fine for loading photos into my laptop.
4,Product works as described.  Nice to have both USB port plugs included.
3,I have no issue with the functioning of this device. Works as expected. But when I connect the reader to my PC and boot the PC sees each of the four card slots in the reader as a active USB device and install it even if the slot is empty. It is not the PC as other readers I have used did not do this. It is annoying and time consuming as I only connect the reader when I need to upload a card.
5,Compatible with most electronics. Easy plug and play features. Worth the purchase.
5,I got this because the tiny cheap plastic reader I had used for years just completely fell apart.  This one is solid reads multiple types of cards and is much harder to lose.  Good deal for the price.
5,Worked as described needed it to load up my ps vita
5,I needed a device to easily transfer photos from my camera's SD card to my laptop. This was exactly what I needed.
5,Work so fine
5,Item as described. Works well.
5,Compared to a similar product that purchased at the same time this one is much easier to work with my mobile devices. Just be careful with how you unplug the device so you won't damage any data on your cards.
5,Thanks.
5,Works perfectly very easy to use quick downloads!
5,Works great and arrived in a timely manner.
5,Exactly what I needed.
5,Easy to use works great…..
5,this card reader is a great value easy to use. card reader can be used with a usb or usb-c port (most phones) very light weight  will take most sd cards.
5,This is exactly what I needed and it performs exactly as advertised.  Great product for the price and I would definitely recommend.  I received it the very next day when I placed my order and that for me was a major plus.  Can't beat it!
5,This card reader has 4 card slots so will work with most memory cards and has 2 connecters on the cord. Best buy I could find for this type of product.
5,It does the job it was meant to do. What more can I say?
5,cannot beat the price
5,Can use several different cards in reader
5,I was in need of a multi-platform media reader and the 4 in 1 Card Reader met all my needs.
2,Used with MacBook Pro  it was working fine  I was very happy until stop working corrupted my SD card. :-(
5,This is a good product works well
5,Used it  to read micro SD cards from GoPro camera.
5,Easy to use and functions great. Thanks for a good product.
5,Works as described
5,Great price - very good quality
5,Made very well it’s very versatile and easy to use
5,Great product reads with ease and highly recommend...
1,Just not at all compatible with my system. Mainline MB and drives.  Had to restore from image three times. Wasn't sure why it crashed the 1st time.  2 and 3rd time...plugged it in.  Tried to read an SD card. Crash and burn. Win 11 so corrupted it couldn't even fix itself. Fortunately it was my "Photos and games" PC.
1,The description said it supports CF cards and I bought it specifically to use with a microdrive CF card for an old Cannon Rebel. The CF card does not fit in it. So it's useless. CF does not fit in this!
5,Great transaction.
5,Works as advertised.
4,Works well but only 1 card inserted at a time.
5,noproblems
1,I loved this and used it 3 times and it stopped working. The little blue light flashes once and then doesn’t work. It won’t stay connected so I can’t get my photos off. Going to have to get something higher quality
5,Easy plug-in and go
5,works great
5,It's versatility and high speed data transfer meets all expectations.
5,Nice working
5,I like the long cord.
1,Unfortunately this devise did not work. It wasn’t too expensive though.
5,This is a simple plug and play item it works perfectly fine and for the price is a no brainer!!! Big time winner for me.
3,Used it once it worked out
1,This does work but just barely.  The C-type connection does not work forcing me to use the USB-A connection.  That's okay as it is the most convenient for me anyway but if part of the item doesn't work as expected that's a big deal.  The SD card slot would also not read my cards.  The only part the does work is the micro SD card reader.  Since this is mostly what I wanted (needed) and it works from the USB port I'm keeping the item.  But I had expected much more from this and it didn't deliver.  I would not recommend it.
5,Can edit files or move to or from various cards and or machines easily and quickly.
2,I will cut to the chase the SD card slot did work however the CF slot had bent pins and I could not get it to work. You are better off paying more and getting better. I don't even want to try a replacement I'm getting a refund.
5,Works as advertised for all sizes of sd cards
5,Awesome tool to have for your laptops
1,If you want to fight to get your card in the slot this is the reader for you. This thing is trash. The wires are bent.
5,Did the trick
1,I thought the description indicated that it would work and there is no slot that fits my memory card.  It is a total waste of money for me.
5,Exactly what I was looking for.
5,It worked!
5,Works perfectly good price
1,A useless piece of trash
1,Prongs got stuck in my CF card making my card unreadable and unusable.
1,We used this CF card about 2 times. Now 2 of the CF reading prongs are bent! Almost ruining my CF card! Sucks I'm out of the return period. Don't buy. Spring for a more expensive reader.
1,Not recommended. The prongs break on first use. Ordered twice both had to be returned.
1,Corrupted my files on my memory card
1,I tried using this 3 times in 20 minutes and it kept crashing my pc. I didn't have high expectations for it but come on now with dead on arrival. I'll just stick with SanDisk readers
1,En realidad el producto luce bien en la foto de el anuncio pero no trabaja bien.
1,Product would not work from the start do not waste your money buy another brand.
1,First time I used it it read the card. After that nothing tried original card again thinking the other cards may be blank nothing this time. Do not buy it’s one time only for me! Junk
1,Algunas veces si lee la tarjeta y otras veces no
1,Unfortunately wasn't compatible with my Fire HD 10 tablet so had to return.
1,The adapter plug is too big if you have a otter box case.
5,works
4,Multifunctional
5,I bought other card reader before and sadly it to didn't work but that one does.
5,I only used for micro sd slot and connect to pc and samsung galaxy phone and it work fine.
5,Easy hook up and self configured in Windows 10
5,Bought to read trails cameras works for just that. Love the phone compatibility.
5,Not much to say It worked well and was a good price!
5,Just what i needed a way to read mini sd cards without the adapters
5,all I did was plug the USB into my laptop and inserted a SD card to upgrade my Tucson Navigational system and it wasas easy as 123...
5,I bought this to replace an older SD card reader that randomly worked. This reader has worked flawlessly so far. Not much more you can say about a card reader lol it does what it's supposed to.
5,This handy little item works great.  Had some old memory chips and decided to check them out.  I recommend this item.
1,Can't get it to work
5,Several of the newer computers and Chromebooks don't have card readers anymore. This allows me to view my game camera sd cards on my Chromebook.  Shows up quickly on the folders menue.
5,Pros :functionality 10/10 works as advertised13$ is a fair deal ^Cons: feels clunky/stiff and overall cheap. I personally prefer usb stick converters because the wired ones just don't make much sense to me
5,I use this at work to import photos and it works beautifully.
5,I don't know if it is long lasting or if it works for heavy use. All i know it works and feels like a premium product. Very nice. Super happy. It was not on sale. Purchasing this product felt like buying some good stuff on a 75% discount sales event. I didin't expect it i though it was going to be cheap as the price. I took the decision of buying it because i have an old compact flash card with an important document and i just wanted to use it just for this. So i have use it lightly... can't say is reliable.
1,Product worked fine the first time I used it. The second time it failed to read the storage device. There was nothing wrong with the 32 Gb SD card since I was able to read it on two other machines without a problem. Tried the reader on two different machines and it failed to read the SD card on both PC's. I'm returning this item and getting a refund. I have no intention of wasting my time dealing with the seller.
5,Works great fast shipped.
5,I purchased this to store 3D stl files. It has been flawless.  I recommend.
5,Handy device when using multiple storage devices. Priced right and easy to use. Delivered quickly.
5,No issues and works perfectly as described!
5,No problem so far
5,I needed something to import pictures from my drone to my laptop and this does exactly what I needed it to do.  Very happy with my purchase.
5,found drivers after couple days automatically in win updates works well good design
5,2-Thumbs up
5,No issues with any of my cards including SD MicroSD and even Po Duo that I had laying around for what ever reason.  Very happy with this purchase!
5,I liked that the cable is longer than many which comes in handy. I plug it into my USB hub and it reads everything with no problems. It read all the SD cards (micro and standard sizes) I have including some that old readers couldn't.  Happy with my purchase.
5,I like the cord attachment so it does not break when plugged in. A real timesaver and read those pesky TF cards too. Plug this in first and then insert adapter second and WaaLaa.
5,Been using it for a few months it hasn't given me any problems. I like the two usb options.
5,I got this SD card reader to view pictures on my Bushnell cameras.  This really worked well for me so far.  I'm not really computer savy but figured this out on my own.  I didn't know I had so many critters in my yard after dark ie: deer groundhog fox neighbors cats squirrel.  Very interesting to say the least!
5,price can be little reduce ...quality good.. easy to use ... over all okay not bad.
5,Very easy to use
5,Great price and works very well
5,I found an old camera that had one of those big memory cards.  The reader worked great and I was able to see the pictures on my computer
1,My HP Spectre laptop computer couldn’t connect and detect this device. So I had to return. Luckily I was able to fix my SD card reader in my laptop.
5,Simple to use. We needed to clear a memory card in a car camera. Affordable.
5,Today most computers come with a built in SD card reader.  What to do when you need to download a CF or Memory stick card?  You could connect the device (my case a camera) to the computer via USB cable.  You could grow old waiting for all the data to download to the computer.  Does this sound like you?  Then get a high speed card reader that can download many different formats.  When this card reader is attached to a 3.0 USB port the download speed is quite impressive.
4,Je n'ai pas pu tester tous les types de cartes qu'il est censé prendre. En tous cas fonctionne bien sur les micro et mini SD
4,Perfetto quello che cercavo oltre il collegamento USB ha USB C il trasferimento dati è velocissimo ed io lo uso x foto RAW.
4,Uso le CF e queste non si inseriscono con facilità a volte si ha l impressione che la "bocca" l ingresso per quel tipo di schede sia stretto troppo 0"a filo"Ma d altronde per 11 euro non si può pretendere troppo...
5,Il me fallait un combo Compact-Flash SD et micro-SD. Pas de surprise avec ce lecteur et conforme aux attentes. Les taux de transfert vont au maximum des capacités de mes cartes / mon PC.Pour une utilisation nomade l'adaptateur USB-C attaché au cordon (USB-A) est très pratique tant que les deux normes coexistent.
4,facile d utilisation
5,Easy to use has every slot works better than my other small oneComfortable length of wire give it 9 out of 10
5,just plugged it in to my chromebook and worked like a charm.
5,ce qu il me fallait ok.
5,excellent value for money
4,Il prodotto è buono però è troppo grande la doppia presa e di conseguenza era impossibile mettere un’altra presa vicino ad essa. Per il resto ottima e veloce
5,does the job.  very satisfied
1,Came all dusty with bent pins in some port. Dont buy
5,Efficace je recommande
4,Ich habe das für meine Micro SD Karte aus der GoPro gekauft.Also es funktioniert einwandfrei. Die Videos können direkt angesehen werden da gibt es kein ruckeln und kein Buffering oder so. Und die GroPo Videos haben eine Unmenge an DatenvolumenHat USB-3 und USB-C Stecker was sehr praktisch ist.Mahl sehen wie lange das Ding hält
5,Ich bin sehr zufrieden mit dem Produkt
4,Comprato per leggere le schede di memoria compatibili con Nikon 810  CF  fa' il suo dovere  facilmente adattabile in ingresso con adattatore tipo C e classica usb 3.Buon compromesso qualità prezzo.
5,Robuster Karzenleser. Besonders vorteilhaft die beiden USB-Anschlüsse.So kann die Speicherkarte im Handy mit entsprechendem USB-Anschluss zur Datensicherung verwendet werden. Ein zusätzliches Tablet/Notebook ist nicht erforderlich.
5,Tutti i prodotti sono stàti utilizzati per uso utile
5,I needed to be able to download photos from my camera SD card onto my Chromebook book which doesn't have an SD card slot. This was perfect for the job (& thanks to the young man in the Tesco phone shop who suggested it!)
5,Bloc plutôt solide bon guidage des cartes mémoires. Transfert rapide.
5,Compatto e di buona fattura.Tempi di consegna ottimiPrezzo molto competitivo
4,Un buen lector de tarjetas a un precio razonable.
5,Il miglior rapporto qualità prezzo
5,Ottima scelta ottimo rapporto qualità-prezzo versatile possibilità di scaricare le foto sia su computer che su tablet o altri supporti grazie al doppio spinotto.
5,Perfetto funzionale e veloce. Accessorio indispensabile
4,Funziona ma la qualità generale è un po' scarsa
5,Der Aufbau ist simpel aber trotzdem robust. Alle Karten lassen sich leicht einfügen.
4,Resulta muy práctico a la hora de reunir los diversos almacenamientos de cada uno de los distintos dispositivos.Relación calidad- precio buena.Sobre la durabilidad no puedo opinar ya que lo adquirí recientemente pero pienso que todo depende de su uso cómo todo.
5,Avevo bisogno di un lettore schede per scaricare le foto dalla reflex al PC perfetto  oltre alla usb normale ha anche quella tipo c ....utilissimoConsegna sempre fast
5,Produit que j'utilise régulièrement il ne prend pas de place est fait parfaitement son job.
5,Very easy to use.
4,Macht was es soll Preis/Leistung passt...
5,GERÄT FUNKTIONIERT EINWANDFREI:
3,I brought this card reader as I have many CF cards for my camera's I was clearing ready for a trip.The unit seems well made and solid. The card slots were a little tighter tham my old reader. This is where my problem is the card reader for my cf cards was so snug on one side it is awkward to fit the cards in I tried 4 different cards of different ages but they were all the same the result is when the card reached the pins one of them bent it was not the end ones but the next set in I managed to straighten it but it seems very week. Although I have put 15 cards in and out of this unit the slot is still tight on one side making it very hard to get the cards in straight. Yes the same pin keeps bending.
5,Ottimo
5,Ce lecteur est bien conçu avec une bonne qualité de fabrication. Le câble est souple c'est pratique pour positionner le lecteur et aussi pour le ranger
5,article conforme à ma commande très facile d'utilisation.
5,As stated in the advertisingarrived late due to postal service strike
5,What I like the most about the hub it's the dual USB C/ USB 3.0 connector.The other hubs I have come with a USB-C connector which has become a standard now.In my work I still often need the USB 3.0 so this hub does a great job for me.So far the hub's performance was flawless and it gives an impression of a quality product.I'm not sure how fast it should work but it was fast enough for our purposes.We are pleased with the quality design functionality and performance.
5,Porto sempre con me questo adattatore quando vado a scattare con la mia 5d mk2 passo in un secondo le foto sul telefono ed eventualmente modifico e pubblico più veloce della connettività WiFi delle moderne fotocamera!
5,A good price and with sockets for a variety of memory card sizes.
5,Buon prodotto loUso per passare le foto dalla telecamera alMac… funziona bene e la velocità di download è soddisfacente
5,ottima resa e velocità
5,Lector de múltiples tarjetas pero no DNI fácil de utilizar buena calidad precio.
5,Alles perfekt
5,Molto versatile già usato più volte da quando mi è arrivato.
5,VERSATILE. VELOCE LETTURA. OTTIMO...
5,Funciona perfectamente y es ligero y Lee todo lo que indica.
5,Il prodotto fa quello che deve fare egregiamente.Apprezzo molto il fatto che abbia già incorporato nel suo cavo il connettore usbA-usbC (già che ci sono lo utilizzo anche per altre periferiche dato che è sempre lì a portata di mano e non si perde).
5,qualità Amazon e prezzo competitivo  provata è perfetta
4,Produit facile et simple d'utilisation.4/5.
5,While I only will ever use this with MicroSD and SD card it is nice to see that I have a bunch of other cards that I can use with this reader. I cannot think of any format that would not work with this it is definitely pretty universal. The included adapter also makes this supported on any computer. Setup was almost instant simply plug and play. The cable is long enough to tuck away behind my computer but not too long that I end up with a huge bundle.As far as performance goes I saw no difference between using my on board card reader and using this external one. The performance was near identical well within the margin of error.
5,Eccezionale 40 gb di file trasferiti in 8 min
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Tiene de todo puerto tipo C de movil usb pc sd de diverso tamaño  tf sdcf ms.
4,Funziona. Non ho misurato le prestazioni.
5,come detto prima prodotto eccellentecosto contenuto e consegna rapidissima.
5,Received for unbiased review...So far this card reader has worked very well in transferring files.  I got this so that my sister could transfer her files from her cell phone to her computer.  She was having problems with the cellphone saying it was full all the time.  Everything transferred correctly.
5,Mon fils est raviJe recommande
5,Poco da dire semplice ed efficace
3,The product is ok BUT it was delivered in the original zip lock bag with the label stuck on the back ….. no packaging what so ever ….. really!!!!
5,Ningún problema funciona bien
5,The plastic housing feels a little cheap but the device itself was a simply plug'n'play on windows 10 and worked without any issue. Transfer speeds were acceptable for both standard and micro SD cards.
5,Expeditivo en todo lo mostrado
5,Card reader on my laptop stopped working so bought this .  Very versatile in what it can read seems well made and durable. It's cable is a good length.Works exactly as described. Gets the job done at a good price
4,Es muy util
4,Bastante cómodo de usar porque trae un cable de longitud adecuada no excesivo.  Lo mejor es que funciona con el puerto USB C a velocidades realmente rápidas si lo acompañas de tarjetas de velocidad alta.  Permite visualizar RAWs a una velocidad estupenda sin interrupciones así como transferirlos al SSD.  Calidad precio está muy bien.  Único fallo es que no se puede expulsar como leí antes de adquirirlo.  En mi caso en Windows 11.  Puede ser un problema si trabajas con varias tarjetas con el riesgo de estropearlas.
4,Good card reader
4,L'ho provato una sola volta ma hha funzionato bene.Non avevo a disposizione un ingresso usb3 ma il trasferimento non è stato lento.
5,Ha il cavo di collegamento spesso. Sembra di buona qualità e trasferisce velocemente i file. Ho inserito vari tipi di schede e le legge tutte.
4,Consegna rapidaGiusto per quello che serve
5,Molto utile . Non ingombrante. Lo consiglio.
5,tutto come mi aspettavo giusto la cosa che mi serviva. Consegna veloce di domenica!
5,Bin sehr zufrieden kann ich empfehlen
2,When the drive was inserted my plug-and-play keyboard became useless.  It took me a while to figure out what the problem was.  This can be overcome with a bit of forward planning but it's not ideal.
5,Tenía mis dudas para el uso que le iba a dar pero perfectamente funciona.Tengo una camara reflex y quería pasar las fotos desde la tarjeta de la cámara al móvil al tener puerto C el lector acopla perfectamente en mi móvil y lo detecta nada más conectarlo la transmisión de la tarjeta de la cámara al móvil a través de la app Files y el lector fue rápida.Quizá el cable del lector lo encuentro un poco grande pero se ve robusto y por este precio no se puede pedir más aparte de que me sirve también para hacer una copia de seguridad de mi micro sd del móvil en el Pc y trasladarla al Disco duro externo de seguridad que tengo .Así que poco más que decir :prácticofuncional y barato ...y sobre todo para poder pasar mus fotos rápidamente de mu reflex al móvil.Lo recomiendo
5,Mantiene le promesse.  Comodo
3,Around 35 m/s slower than download from the camera directly!
5,Não tem o que errar com este leitor de cartões lê imensos formatos de cartões e é mesmo muito rápido recomendo fortemente!Excelente relação custo-benefício!
5,Perfect reader for putting in my drone bag as it’s compact and the read speeds are good
5,I was having a bit of trouble at times when inserting my SD card into the card reader on my PC. in-that It would not recognise that a card had been inserted due to the fact I'm sure that after years of use there is some wear in the unit.Another reason for purchasing this card reader is that I now have a camera which uses both SD and Compact Flash cards and I didn't have a card reader to access the CF card.The Card Reader solved my original trouble as it plugs into the USB socket so by-passing the original card slot; and I now have the option of using the CF card. So far (as I haven't had the reader very long) I can recommend this unit it works well and is perfect for me.
4,Lo mejor:- Portabilidad- Conector USB-C- PrecioLo peor:- No alcanza las velocidades soportadas por la conexión USB-C
5,Really please with this item. Takes memory cards from my 7D and 6D to download on to my iPad.
5,Tutto ok ! Memoria veloce perfetto!
5,I needed to get some images from an SD card to my MacBook Pro. It worked.
4,Sencillo de usar cómodo y muy versátil.Acepta todo tipo de tarjetas SD y las lee perfectamente.a día de hoy no puedo ponerle ninguna pega ya que va a las mil maravillas.Por ponerle alguna pega decir que es de plástico regulero con lo que hay que tener cuidado con que no se te caiga ya que puede romperse.relacion calidad precio buena.
3,Tested on Windows 10 with multiple CF and SD cards.First the good bits:Both read and write speed can be respectable and mostly comparable to more expensive independent reviews recommended readers. And of course great low price.Now the caveats:It is not possible to use Windows Safely Eject Media to just eject the card you are using you have to remove the whole reader. So it's not possible to just swap cards leaving the reader plugged in.Even more strangely if you plug the reader in with a card already in the reader it can sometimes result in the speed being significantly slower than it would be if you first plug in the reader then plug in the card. Even managed the slow speed once doing it once after the other. Unplugged and re-plugged it back in and it was okay again.Reading of high end SD card could be faster. It definitely wasn't reading anywhere near the speed the card was capable of.Great value for its price just beware of its limitation.
4,Un peu léger à première vue mais fait bien le job avec une bonne vitesse de transfert. Le plus lit les cartes les plus courantes et possède l'embout usb plus l'adaptateur pour le format Tél / tablette.
5,Come al solito un plauso ad Amazon in quanto affidabilità e rispetto nelle consegne detto questo il prodotto mi soddisfa e per quanto concerne la funzionalità a mio avviso è molto buona. Può leggere 4 differenti tipo di schede e inoltre il prezzo mi sembra onesto... Per quanto riguarda il rapporto qualità prezzo non essendo un'esperto non mi sento in grado di esprimere un'opinione... Al momento lavora bene e quindi posso ritenermi soddisfatto...
5,Facile a utiliser. Je recommande
4,Buon articolo per rapporto qualità prezzo fà il suo dovere
5,Super Ware weiter so
5,I purchased this item so that I could download photos from my digital camera but my memory card reader thingies and plug in extension had stopped working on my new computer I had replaced both a couple of times to no avail then spotted this item. Sent for it and almost send back as I thought it didn't fit then found the correct fitting was hidden beneath another - perfect very versatile and downloads perfectly - very happy and would highly recommend

2,I keep getting a "USB Device Not Recognised by the Computer" error! Very hit and miss sometimes it's OK sometimes it's not sometimes it packs up half way through down load. Just not reliable enough for me to use I can't risk losing files with it.
4,Leggero e versatile utilissimo e ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo
3,Provato solo su telefono ma vedo che buono adesso lo devo provare con l'autoradio spero funzioni bene in caso aggiornero recensione intanto OK consigliato bene per il PC ma non autoradio non lo legge a me serve in macchina per PC non lo uso quindi lo sto rimandando indietro ma se avete PC va benissimo
4,Buona x leggere diversi tipi d schede.
5,I found some old Compact Flash cards from an old camera and wanted to upload some of the photographs on them. I realised I have changed PC and no longer have a compact flash slot on the PC. This was a simple adapter and allowed me to recover memories from 14 years ago.When it arrived I plugged it into the USB connection on my Dell PC and slotted a Compact Flash card into the reader and it worked first time.Also comes with a USB to USB-C adapter so I could connect to my work lap top or Samsung Galaxy S9
5,Works perfectly can be used in full sized usb or usb c.Simple plug and play it worked on my phonemy laptop tablet and TV.
5,Todo genial cumple su función.
5,Muy bueno
4,Poteva essere almeno riconosciuto come periferica esterna al momento sono costretto ad estrarre le schede senza rimozione sicura in caso di problemi alle schede boh..
4,Ocupa poco espacio.  Funciona bien.
4,Praktisch einfache Bedienung
5,Lo llevo junto a mi mini portátil y me permite muchas opciones ya que solo trae USB normal
5,Ottimo modello mi ha consentito di scaricare dalla Sim del mio telefono delle foto.
5,Easily set up and used to store my photos.
5,Very reliable compact size fast and great for memory cards.Niall
4,Merece la pena
5,Adatto a parecchi tipi di scheda! Utilizzato per CF e SD. Funziona perfettamente
4,Cumple la expectativas y tiene todas las tarjetas por lo cual es muy cómodo
4,Construction légère mais permet de lire ma carte Sony. Pratique adaptateur USB et USB-C
5,I had a card reader which just plugged into the USB port.  This was inconvenient as it was simple to damage it.The Benfei reader has a short cable which eliminates this problem and it reads commonly used memory cards.  I was having trouble reading a 128GB SD card in the SD slot on my computer.  Using this adapter cured all the problems.  Highly recommended.
2,Feels very cheap. The CF card reader won't recognise on my desktop
5,Gli ho dato cinque stelle perché non ho trovato finora nessun difetto.
3,articolo che si presenta molto bene. bel cavetto robusto. ma purtroppo connesso al mio PC non riesce a creare collegamento per leggere le schede. L'avevo preso per non dovere continuare a collegare direttamente macchina fotografica e altri oggetti ma andrò avanti come prima magari sarà utilizzabile su un prossimo pc.
1,have used an old card reader that got left behind in a move. no problems in 10 years. could throw CF card in and pull out and be as rough as you like.2nd time using this the pins got bent out of shape while being pretty gentle and precise with it.
1,That's how many times I used it before it broke.... do yourself a favour and buy a better one!!!
5,Oggetto versatile e facile da utilizzare non necessità di driver io lo uso su un Mac e fa egregiamente il suo lavoro. Comoda il led posto in alto che ti avvisa quando sei in lavorazione ottime le porte 3.0 velocissime. Uno dei pochi ad avere entrata CF per card ad alta velocità. Buon rapporto qualità/prezzo.
5,ottimo e funzionale.
4,Buono
5,Lo probé para ver si funcionaba i si funciona puedes grabar i leer.
5,Ottimo prodotto lo uso su IPad Pro 2020 e l’ha riconosciuto subito. Importa velocemente foto da SD della macchinetta fotografica.Riconosciuto anche da iPhone se si utilizza adattatore la velocità d’importazione è più lenta.Consiglio!
5,Worked well from connection to my iMac and MacBook Pro. I like the fact it has both usb and usbc connections so it can be used with more devices b
5,Easy to use did what is required
5,Needed this to transfer files from my Fostex Recordor on 15 year old Compact Flash cards.
5,perfecto funciona bién es rápido yo lo uso para una cámara réflex Olympus y funciona perfectamente
5,Macht was es soll ausser Microdrive lesen soetwas hat zwar kaum noch jemand aber dafür ist es leider nicht geeignet.Eventuell wegen der fehlenden CFII Deklarierung.
1,Le lecteur ne lit pas les carte SD. Il n'est même pas reconnu par le PC.
5,Very quick delivery and card reader works well. What’s not to like?
4,the card reader arrive very quickly and the nieces daughter is over the moon with it
5,Molto utile
5,Ich bin sehr zufrieden
5,Funziona tutto a dovere sul mio Mac.

4,👌
4,In my view not very well made
5,Transferencias de datos muy rápidas especialmente en la conexión USB-C
5,Ottimo prodotto niente da dire.
5,The questions I asked before purchasing were answered ....all correct.I can write to the card in the reader and it also takes a very old memory stick from a very old Sony camera.Easy to use well put together and a sturdy cable.
4,Does exactly what it says on the tin. No issues for me.
5,Tutto ok
5,Con Usb 3.0... nulla da aggiungere perfetto per trasferire file di grandi dimensioni tra SD e Pc
5,Efficace e veloce usb 3.0. Consigliato
4,Moi
5,L'ho provato per passare dati da una sd a PC e devo dire che per ora funziona bene. Bisogna fare attenzione all'inserimento della scuola perché non è indicato bene. Il PC l'ha riconosciuto senza problemi e il trasferimento file è stato rapido.
5,Ottimo veloce e stabile
5,Perfetto
5,Facilidad de uso
5,Je suis très contente demande un chat fonctionne parfaitement de très bonne qualité je le recommande
5,pas cher et pratique; Encombrement réduit permettant de lire beaucoup de cartes..

2,Stift schon verbogen bei CF Card  schade das was ich immer brauche
5,Preis Leistung stimmt. Funktionen einwandfrei. Top
5,Pratico e veloce. Viene riconosciuto subito dal mac e non ho avuto nessun problema con i trasferimenti. Consigliato
5,Ottima logisticaConsegnato con puntualità e in frettaArticolo rispondente alle attese
1,Arrivato con un PIN storto che poi si è rotto...inutilizzabile...l'avevo preso per le compact flash
5,Versatile takes most different cards.Like the dual size usb plugs. Looks well made and a very good price.
2,Purtroppo il lettore delle schede CF e’ durato poco; infatti in breve tempo 5 pin i più esterni si sono piegati rendendo il lettore - almeno per questo tipo di scheda - inutilizzabile.
3,Sometimes works problems reading SDs
5,So much better then connecting my camera to  my PC and faster too. Will see if it lasts.
5,Excellent just what I needed to read micro memory cards.
5,Todo perfecto
4,Funziona correttamente
5,Dispositivo molto utile.
1,la fente pour les cartes CF est très courte et les aiguilles du lecteur trop longues et faibles.  Le résultat?  Les aiguilles se sont pliées après la première utilisation.  Un total gaspillage d'argent.
5,Fait le job.
5,I chose this model as it had such a wide variety of uses. Did the job.
5,Good value for money if it’s what you are looking for
5,Es un lector muy rápido tanto con las tarjetas SD como con las CF que son las que utilizo en mis cámaras.
5,Ottimo prodotto di qualità
5,Cumple su función. Calidad precio ok
5,lecteur carte mémoire 4 en 1 pratiqueconforme à la description
1,Se connecte au PC mais ne lit pas les cartes.
5,Really useful adapter. Works perfectly. The USB-C and USB 3.0 ports make it versatile.
1,Durato 2 mesi per un totale di non più di 10 utilizzi dopo di che i pin interni si sono piegati rendendolo inutilizzabile. Inutile specificare che è stato usato sempre con la massima cura ed attenzione è proprio la fattura del prodotto che risulta davvero schifosa. NON lo consiglio soldi buttati.
5,Value
5,Livraison gratuite et rapide. Appareil conforme à mes attentes
5,Bueno
5,Confirme à mes attentes
5,Très pratique
5,schnelle Lieferung alles ok und funktioniert
1,Sur mon PC ce lecteur de carte mémoire ne parvient pas a se connecter. Cette périphérie se connecte et déconnecte sans s'arrêter !!! (Certains commentaires mentionnent déjà ce souci)Sur mon téléviseur il se connecte puis au bout de 10 à 15 mn se déconnecte d'initiative ... Replacer sur le téléviseur idem il recommence a se déconnecter d'initiative... J'ai donc fait retour de ce produit inutilisable. Depuis j'ai acheté un produit similaire d'une autre marque et tout fonctionne parfaitement (conclusion : les soucis proviennent bien du lecteur de cartes BENFEI).
5,Nice fast card reader
1,Dopo un giorno di uso le barrette di lettura della cf si sono piegate.
5,It does a good job works well as a replacement for on board card readers
5,Guter Speicherkartenleser funktioniert tut was er soll alles okay!

1,Doesn't work with my Galaxy Tab s4 - "device not recognised".Found a 'lost'  old mini reader (no name on it) which actually works great for my camera and videocam micro sd cards.So I wasted my money!
5,Fonctionne parfaitement
5,Bin sehr zufrieden
5,Great product!
1,Vaya chasco y para colmo como tiré la caja y todo no lo puedo devolver es un zaleo se conecta y desconecta todo el rato no me pasa con ninguno de los que tengo. Cogí este solo porque el cable es más largo pero me he llevado una gran decepción la verdad.

1,ARNAQUE  NE  FONCTIONNE PAS  QUE  CE  SOIT  EN USB  OU MINI  HDMIL ORDINATEUR  NE PEUT LIRE  LA CARTE  SD  La  fenetre  d installation du  péripherique  s ouvre et ce  ferme  en permanence  sans  instalation définitive  BRef  du  vol
1,Extremely annoyed will not work with my CF card and has now corrupted my card so I've lost all my images thanks for nothing
1,Ne fonctionne pas pour les compact Flash . produit retourné
1,El lector CF roto a las 6 HORAS de usarlo.
1,Cuando fui a meter la segunda tarjeta uno de los palitos estaba doblado sin haberlo forzado.. Ha sido de un solo uso... Decepcionada
1,La prise USB c est mal usinée pas de contact
5,Este es  un lector de tarjetas muy ligero  puedo decir que pesa poco y es pequeño para llevar a cualquier lado. Lee varios  tipos de tarjetas. Y todas a la vez. Si tienes varias puedes transferir archivos de una a otra sin problemas. puedo decir que es muy rápido en la lectura y en la transferencia de las tarjetas. Incluye cable de transferencia. Muy recomendable.
4,Il Card Reader del mio Pc fisso non ha mai brillato in affidabilità probabilmente per un difetto di fabbrica e ciò oltre a spazientirmi tanto mi costringe spesso a far uso di un Card Reader esterno che è ormai anch'esso antiquato. Mi bisognava quindi un Upgrade che mi consentisse di affrontare lo spostamento dati con più relax e meno stress.Iniziamo…LA CONFEZIONE: Il Prodotto vi arriverà in una busta in plastica trasparente richiudibile e con il brand BENFEI stampato sul davanti. All'interno il nostro lettore ma nessun manuale di istruzioni.I MATERIALI E LE CARATTERISTICHE: Il Card Reader è fatto interamente in plastica di media fattura e risulta essere leggerissimo. Il cavo è collegato ad esso in maniera fissa e alla sua estremità si troverà una spina USB-A corredata da un adattatore per trasformarla in USB-C.Come descritto dal produttore questo Card Reader vi consentirà di leggere le seguenti schede:- SD (Secure Digital)- Micro-SD (Qui chiamate TF ovvero Trans Flash)- MS (Memory Stick)- CF (Compact Flash)LA PROVA: Come già descritto volevo qualcosa di moooolto Easy e che mi semplificasse la vita nel momento in cui avessi bisogno di scaricare dati al mio Pc fisso o Notebook (Specialmente Video e Foto).Questo Card Reader fa quindi proprio al caso mio visto che è un vero Plug & Play quindi quanto di più facile e semplice nell'utilizzo.Una volta collegato è stato subito riconosciuto sia da Windows 7 che da Windows 10.Il passaggio dei video e delle foto scattate con la mia Nikon è stato immediato.Anche la lettura della Micro SD del Tablet è stata perfetta.La velocità di trasmissione è supportata sia dalla porta USB che dal cavo entrambi etichettati come 3.0 ma è ovvio che l'intero comparto dei supporti usati come il tipo di Scheda che si sta usando e il tipo di porta devono mantenere quegli stessi standard per avere il miglior risultatoL'unica cosa su cui dubito è la scelta di non rendere estraibile il cavo dall'unità di lettura bensì vincolarlo in maniera fissa… non dico che sia un male ma nel caso di un trasporto in borsa può essere un po' fastidioso.Nel complesso però il prodotto è sicuramente PROMOSSO.► Prezzo al momento della Recensione EUR 1299 (Anche se i materiali non sono di "prima scelta" per la sua versatilità e facilità d'uso lo reputo un buon prezzo)✔ I (Miei) PRO:- Ampia versatilità di lettura schede SD/MicroSD/MS/CF.- Molto Easy perché Plug & Play.✘I (Miei) CONTRO:- Materiali non proprio d'eccellenza.- Il cavo USB non è estraibile dal lettore bensì fisso.Spero di esservi stato utile Grazie per il vostro tempo!
4,Der "Speicherkartenleser BENFEI 4 in1 USB / USB-C auf SD Micro SD MS CF-Kartenleseradapter" wird in einem Zip-Beutel von BENFEI geliefert.Kurzgesagt:✅ Der BENFEI Kartenleser scheint den UHS-I Bus (max. 104MB/s) nahezu vollständig auszuschöpfen! Die Transferraten von ca. 95 bzw. 87 MB/s (R/W) sind ein wirklich sehr gutes Ergebnis!Das Kunststoffgehäuse ist dabei sehr leicht und eine Status-LED zeigt die Betriebsbereitschaft an. Die Karten werden dabei auf 3 Seiten des Gehäuses eingesteckt. Leider unterstützt der Reader kein paralleles Lesen bzw. Bedienen von mehreren Karten. Es gibt immer nur ein USB-Laufwerk. Die Karte die zuerst eingesteckt wird "malt" zuerst. Praktisch ist dass direkt ein Adapter von USB-A (USB 3.0) auf USB-C beigelegt ist sodass man den Reader an beiden Schnittstellen verwenden kann. Für knapp 11EUR ist der Kartenleser von BENFEI daher durchaus überzeugend und bekommt von mir 4 Sterne.Im Detail...✅ Er besteht (leider) komplett aus Kunststoff.✅ Es werden SD Micro SD MS CF-Karten unterstützt.✅ Das Kabel ist zusammen mit dem Stecker ca. 55cm lang und verfügt über einen kleinen Knickschutz.✅ Eine Status-LED für die Betriebsbereitschaft ist vorhanden.✅ Des Weiteren wird ein USB-A (USB 3.0) auf USB-C-Adapter mitgeliefert sodass man beide Schnittstellen verwenden kann.⚪ Was mir nicht ganz so gut gefällt ist dass der Kartenleser quasi "rundum" bespielt wird. Ich bevorzuge es eher dass alle Kartenslots auf 1 oder 2 Seiten verteilt sind.❗⚪ Des Weiteren kann immer nur eine Karte verarbeitet werden. Es wird lediglich ein USB-Laufwerk angezeigt. Die Karte die zuerst eingesteckt wurde erhält den Vorrang. Auch wenn 2 Karten eingesteckt wurden und die zuerst eingesteckte Karte entfernt wird muss die zweite Karte erneut eingesteckt werden damit sich das USB-Laufwerk aktualisiert. Das ist etwas suboptimal aber nicht gravierend. Man muss es nur wissen.------------❗ Performance Test & ErgebnisIch habe den Reader direkt an meinen USB-C 3.1 Gen1 Anschluss des ASUS PRIME B365M-A angeschlossen und zusammen mit einer 128GB SanDisk Extreme PRO SDXC V30 Class 10 (170MB/s) getestet. Das Ergebnis seht ihr auf den Bildern. Mit 95MB/s beim sequentiellen Lesen sowie mit 87MB/s beim sequentiellen Schreiben kommt er sehr nahe an die 104MB/s der UHS-I Grenze heran :)❗ Zum Verständnis: UHS-I / UHS-II SD-KartenDie von SanDisk angegebenen 170MB/s werden wohl nur mit einem speziellen SanDisk-Reader erreicht der extra für SanDisk eigene Karten entwickelt wurde - es ist also kein allgemeingültiger Wert. Die maximale Bus-Geschwindigkeit von UHS-I SD-Karten liegt bei 104MB/s mit UHS-II steigt die maximale Bus-Geschwindigkeit auf 312 MB/s. Daraus ergibt sich dass so wunderschön klingende und oft zu lesende "Marketing-Angaben" wie "Datenraten bis 625MB/s == 5GBit/s" - also der maximale SATA III Durchsatz - aufgrund von Hardware-Limitationen der SD-Karten (noch lange) nicht erreicht werden können!
4,📦PACKAGINGIl lettore arriva in una semplicissima busta chiusa ermeticamente che riporta in bella vista il logo "BENFEI". All'interno non vi è nient'altro... nessun manuale (che sinceramente reputo un0inutile spreco di carta per prodotti del genere).🛠️QUALITA' COSTRUTTIVAA livello qualitativo il prodotto è buono: i materiali utilizzati sono di buona fattura anche se un po leggerini (per alcuni potrebbe essere un vantaggio). Nella parte superiore è presente una texture "ruvida" che dà un tocco in più al prodotto. La caratterstica peculiare è la presenza di un adattatore da USB (3.0) A ad USB-C il che è sicuramente un gran vantaggio per chi possiede dispositivi dotati di quest'ultima. Chiaramente si tratta di un semplice adattatore (che si può tranquillamente comprare a parte) pertanto le prestazioni rimangono quelle dell'USB A 3.0. Il cavo misura un 50 di cm.L'hub presenta la bellezza di 4 ingressi: CompactFlash SD microSD memorystick... ma purtroppo non può leggere più schede simultaneamente.➡️PRESTAZIONIA livello di prestazioni il prodotto si è comportato molto bene riuscendo così a superare senza problemi i miei test. Ho effettuato un confronto con il mio hub 3.0 uGreen (molto simile) ed una scheda Micro SDXC Netac U3 A1 V30 da16Gb (purtroppo era l'unica che avevo a disposizione). I risultati sono stati molto simili (allego foto): un leggero vantaggio presenta l'hub uGreen in velocità di lettura (si parla di pochi MB/s)... La velocità di scrittura è praticamente identica.Ho provato ad utilizzare il dispositivo con il mio vecchio Galaxy A8 e non ho riscontrato alcun problema: l'hub viene riconosciuto correttamente ed è possibile (naturalmente) accedere ai contenuti della periferica collegata senza alcun problema. E' molto comodo anche durante i viaggi per scaricare facilmente le foto della reflex/mirrorless rapidamente. Per questo motivo nella sezione dedicata alla qualità costruttiva ho detto che la relativa leggerezza del prodotto poteva essere un vantaggio per alcuni. Chiaramente questo dipende molto dall'utilizzo che se ne fa.💲PREZZO E CONSIDERAZIONI FINALIConcludendo credo che il lettore di schede Benfei sia un ottimo prodotto. La qualità costruttiva è buona (ma NON ECCELSA!) e in linea con il prezzo di vendita; le prestazioni sono ottime.
4,Die Vorteile des Produkts:++ Multi-Kartenleser der bis zu 4 verschiedene Kartentypen aufnehmen kann++ Plug & Play erfordert daher keinen Treiber für die Erkennung und kann im laufenden Systembetrieb an- und abgesteckt werden auf Apple Macs unter macOS als auch Windows-Systemen.++ Karten lassen sich einfach in die untersch. Steckplätze des Lesegeräts einschieben.++ Gewohnte Datenübertragungsgeschwindigkeit mit USB3.++ Erhitzte sich nicht auch wenn es längere Zeit an einen Computer angeschlossen war.++ Ermöglicht eine effiziente und sichere Datenübertragung;++ Eine Art „Schweizer Taschenmesser“ das mit verschiedenen Kartentypen kompatibel ist.++ Adapter für USB-Anschlüsse dabei.++ Superklein kompakt smart.Nachteile:- Keine gleichzeitige Erkennung und Übertragung von Daten eines Speichermediums zu einem Anderen parallel gesteckten möglich- Ist zwar per Adapter über USB-C anbindbar aber mir wäre lieber gewesen es wäre auf USB-C optimiert und einfach stattdessen ein Adapter für USB3 dabei was wahrscheinlich die Geschwindigkeit der Datenübertragung nochmal deutlich erhöhen würde weil soherum ist ja logisch dass maximal USB3-Geschwindigkeiten machbar sind auch wenn der integr. Chip im Gerät ggfls. effizienter arbeiten würde.Halten wir also fest: Super-kompakt quadratisch easy zu transportieren. Unterstützt Plug&Play auf Basis von USB3 mit einem mitgelieferten Kabel und Adapter auf USB-C ist von recht überzeugender Qualität erlaubt aber nicht die gleichzeitige Verwendung mehrerer Speichermedien was es ansonsten möglich machen würde Daten direkt von einer Karte auf eine andere kopieren zu können.Ich habe ihn mit einem MacBook Pro-Computer als auch unter Windows getestet und war überzeugt da er jwls. schnell erkannt wurde ohne dass ein Treiber installiert werden musste.Ausgestattet mit 4 Steckplätzen – für verschiedene Karten – bietet diese Peripherie eine gute Übertragungsgeschwindigkeit in  USB3-Manier.Im Gegensatz zu anderen Lesegeräten die ich kenne kann man die Speicherkarten ziemlich einfach einbringen und entfernen.Das testweise Kopieren von größeren Daten im Gigabyte-Bereich verlief reibungslos ohne Datenverlust oder Abbrüche oder komplettem Ausstieg des erkannten Kartenlaufwerks.Dieser platzsparende und robuste Leser ist der perfekte Begleiter für alle die öfters mit versch. Typen an Speichermedien hantieren und „mal eben schnell“ Datenaustauschaktionen durchführen müssen.Meine bedingte Empfehlung hat das Gerätchen in jedem Fall aktuell sofern mit den genannten Abstrichen zu leben ist. ((-:
3,Von Zeit zu Zeit benötige ich einen Cardreader um Videos von einem Camcorder oder dem Smartphone zu ziehen da eine Direktverbindung meist zu langsam ist. Aus diesem Grund habe ich mir den BENFEI 4 in1 USB Cardreader bestellt und im Rahmen des Vine-Programms kostenfrei zum Test zur Verfügung gestellt bekommen. Dieser Umstand wird in der Bewertung nicht berücksichtigt.Geliefert wurde mir der Cardreader in einer kleinen Tüte. Mit am USB-Anschlusskabel verbunden befindet sich ein USB zu USB-C Konverter. Sehr praktisch da ich mittlerweile über Hardware verfüge die diese Anschlüsse unterstützt. Das eigentliche USB-Verbindungskabel ist verhältnismäßig lang. Dennoch reicht es nicht aus wenn ich versuche den Reader fest (hinten am PC) anzuschließen um ihn dann auf dem Tisch zu installieren. Zum Einen ist das Kabel dafür zu kurz und das Kabel ist dazu noch relativ dick und starr so dass sich der extrem leichte Reader-Kasten gern mal zu einer Seite aufrichtet.Das Gehäuse des Readers ist sehr dünnwandig und komplett aus Kunststoff. Was oben und unten ist lässt sich lediglich durch das Branding und eine kleine LED erkennen die mir im ausgeschalteten Zustand zunächst nicht auffiel.Anschließen verläuft im Plug n Play-Verfahren. Der Reader wurde von meinem PC sofort erkannt und erkennt auch selbst sehr alte Karten die von anderen Readern so nicht problemlos ausgelesen werden konnten.Was ich persönlich allerdings sehr schade finde ist der Umstand dass es mir bei dem mir vorliegenden Gerät keine zeitgleiche Lese- und Schreibvorgänge vornehmen zu können. Hin und wieder muss ich Datensätze auch auf Karten hin und herschieben. Hiermit war es mir nur möglich die Daten mittels Zwischenstation (Festplatte) weiterzuschieben da der Cardreader bei mir immer nur eine Karte zeitgleich erkennt.Mit der Geschwindigkeit der Datenübertragung bin ich absolut zufrieden. Bei großen Datensätzen und noch unkomprimierten 4K Videos kommt das Gerät meinen Ansprüchen schon sehr nah.Alles in Allem ist der Cardreader recht solide. Er hat bei mir alle Karten verschiedenster Bauart problemlos erkannt. Das Schreiben und Lesen verlief in einer guten Geschwindigkeit wobei ich es stark vermisse zwei Karten gleichzeitig und auch untereinander nutzen zu können. Aber was für mich ein Ausschlusskriterium ist kann für Andere ja wiederum hinfällig sein. Was mir gut gefällt ist der bereits mitgelieferte USB-C-Adapter. Das erweitert den Nutzungsrahmen im Alltag ein Wenig. Gerade bei neuen Notebooks ist dieser Anschluss eher zu finden als ein normaler USB-Anschluss. Tatsächlich gefällt mir dahingehend das Gehäuse nicht sonderlich. Es ist extrem dünnwandig (da es ja lediglich nur eine kleine Platine hält) und sehr leicht. Dadurch dreht es sich nach Vorgabe des Kabels und liegt selten flach auf. Fühlt sich für mich dann leider sehr unordentlich und notdürftig an.Unterm Strich ist der Cardreader meiner Meinung nach für all jene empfehlenswert die nicht häufig zu einem Reader greifen müssen und nur einfache Kopien von den Karten ziehen möchten. Den Leuten die den Reader als Laufwerk nutzen möchten kann ich hier keine Empfehlung geben.Ich hoffe ich konnte mit meiner Rezension weiterhelfen.
4,Per le mie necessità è una manna: ha entrate per qualsiasi tipo di schedina e il geniale connettore USB A con prolunga USB C che mi permette di usarlo sia da PC che da telefono. Funziona in modo perfetto. Gli unici miei dubbi sono sulla longevità in quanto è in plastica piuttosto economica. Per il momento è il mio sistema primario per leggere le schede.
4,Interessante lettore multi-card con collegamento al Pc tramite cavo che termina con USB 3.0 e con l’adattatore USB tipo C. Le mie prese USB 3.1 e Tipo C non hanno trovato difficoltà a leggere e trasferire con velocità i dati dalle memorie collegate a questo compatto e duttile lettore (nota a parte per la Thunderbolt 3). Ad esso sono associabili 4 possibili tipologie di memorie:- SD (Secure Digital)- Micro-SD (Qui chiamate TF ovvero Trans Flash)- MS (Memory Stick)- CF (Compact Flash)Ci tengo a far notare che tramite Crystal Disk Mark 7.0.0 x64 e diversi tentativi per “vederci chiaro” si nota normalmente una lieve flessione delle prestazioni dell’unità di memoria (test fatto con SD e Micro-SD) quando collegata al PC con questo lettore di schede. Invito a fare molta attenzione a inserire l’adattatore USB C senza fretta e a tenere ben appoggiato questo lettore su un piano onde evitare la possibile importante perdita di velocità specialmente in scrittura!Preciso poi che la presa Thunderbolt 3 è tipo USB C ma con caratteristiche sorprendenti come velocità e potenza tali che i dispositivi adatti ivi collegati è come se fossero installati all’interno del PC leggi ad es. memorie SSD e scheda video ad altissime prestazioni per il gioco. Ecco se vuoi ottenere il massimo dalla tua scheda di memoria collegala direttamente nella sua esclusiva presa del Pc se ce l’ha bai passando questo lettore. Tramite la Thunderbolt 3 non aggiungi o togli nulla rispetto ad una normale USB C.Detto questo l’articolo è promosso anche se risulta di fattura economica con il cavo dati (lungo 50 cm) fisso non disinseribile dal lettore. Oggi i 13 euro richiesti sono accettabilissimi.Spero di essere stato di aiuto!
4,Ein universelles Speicherkartenlesegerät kann durchaus sehr praktisch sein - insbesondere wenn man einen schnellen Datenaustausch benötigt. Speicherkarten wie CompactFlash (CF) MemoryStick (MS) SecureDisc (SD) und microSD alias TransFlash (TF) werden dabei unterstützt. Um schnelle Geschwindigkeiten zu ermöglichen ist natürlich USB3 mit an Board. Ein integrierter Adapter für USB-C ist auch mit dabei.Die Geschwindigkeit lässt sich durchaus sehen: bis knapp 110MB/s sequentieller Leserate habe ich realisieren können - eine schnellere Speicherkarte habe ich leider nicht zu bieten. Ungünstig empfinde ich allerdings die Tatsache dass es sich um ein Laufwerk handelt. Man muss sich entscheiden welchen Speicherkartenport man nutzen will - gleichzeitig eine CompactFlash-Speicherkarte und eine microSD-Speicherkarte sind nicht nutzbar.Die Verarbeitungsqualität ist billig. Die Kunststoffdeckel sind mit etwas Druck eindrückbar und die Optik ist nicht besonders schön. Persönlich empfinde ich das allenfalls zweitrangig bei einem günstigen Produkt welches ich nicht täglich mehrfach in der Hand halte. Das bewerte ich also durchaus neutral. Der Speicherkartenleser ist zumindest robust und scheint haltbar.Während des Tests hatte ich Aussetzer: gelegentlich wollte der Speicherkartenleser im System einfach nicht erkannt werden. Die blaue Status-LED leuchtete aber mein (nahe neuer) Lenovo ThinkPad mochte manchmal einfach kein Laufwerk anzeigen. Das hatte ich so noch bei keinem Gerät und konnte den Fehler auch nicht rekonstruieren. Zumeist ging alles problemfrei und während des Betriebs ist der Kartenleser auch nicht ausgestiegen.Fazit: ein supergünstiges Produkt welches funktional und schmucklos daherkommt. Im Gegensatz zu anderen kann es nur eine Speicherkarte gleichzeitig ins System einbinden - CF und SD gleichzeitig gehen nicht. Schnell (bis 100MB/s scheinen problemfrei zu gehen - schnellere Speicherkarten kann ich nicht bieten) ist er ebenfalls. In sofern mit leichter Abstufung durchaus empfehlenswert!
4,Like a lot of photographers I use a mixture of cards; and cameras I would rather not risk damage by plugging them into my computer directly. So card readers are a necessary evil; and the goal is to have the fastest card reader to save time transferring 100s of gigabytes of images and video on a regular basis. The reader itself is a fairy small and lightweight design; it has a usb-a cable permanently connected to the reader; with a USB-C adaptor in the box. I would have preferred the cable not be attached to the box to allow for easier transport but if you are using this at your home desk it works just fine - albeit its quite light so its easy to knock it around.The performance of the device is acceptable for a UHS-i SD card reader;  copying 100Gb of video from a UHSii sd card took just under an hour - around 54 minutes. Speed testing it with Blackmagic says it can sustain about 82MB/s; as I mainly use faster UHS-ii cards its not the reader for me - but if you are using slower UHS-i SD cards it is faster than the average card reader.
4,De prime abord le boîtier semble un peu fragile mais il est solideLes cartes sont bien reconnues et la vitesse de transfert est plutôt correcte avec des cartes classe 10Il est reconnu par mon mac et mon pc sans soucisL’adaptateur usb-c attaché au câble est une très bonne idée 👍🏻
4,This helps quite a bit with transferring data. The product in essence knows how o quickly receive information to transfer it to the device that the data needs to go to. However this can only be sued for a limited number of products. For example not all laptops have a Type C port. The quality of the product feels authentic and strong and will definitely not easily break. Worth the money and I recommend it for customers! Quite an efficient product I must say obviously there's a variety of different slots that you can actually include which is of course fantastic something that you might need and want now at first i thought it was going to be slightly bigger than when it came in but slightly It ended up coming in a site you smaller size which is fantastic because that's something I would actually prefer easy to use easy to function with you can pretty much connected to any computer which is brilliant and that's the best thing though you can transfer data easily now not having to quickly switch out many different devices and many different adapters just one adapter and you can switch out pretty much all the information that you need.
5,Il lettore di schede Benfei consente di leggere i seguenti tipi di schede di memoria:- SD- Micro-SD (dette anche TF)- Sony Memory Stick (MS)- Compact Flash (CF)Si tratta quindi di buona parte delle schede di memoria oggi in circolazione essendo compresi anche due formati (MS e CF) ormai sempre meno diffusi.Le schede si inseriscono nello slot corrispondente alla tipologia presenti sui lati del lettore. Non si possono inserire più di una scheda alla volta poiché non vengono lette. Quindi non è possibile effettuare ad esempio la copia diretta da una scheda all'altra.Il lettore invece va collegato al computer mediante un cavo USB-A (standard) oppure usando l'adattatore inserito lungo il cavo a una porta USB-C (anche di smartphone o tablet).Non occorrono driver o configurazioni particolari: il lettore è trasparente e il computer visualizzerà direttamente la scheda di memoria.Per quanto riguarda le prestazioni la velocità massima di trasferimento al computer è imposta dallo standard USB 3.0 quindi 5 gigabit/s teorici. All'atto pratico la velocità sarà quasi sicuramente limitata dalla velocità di lettura e scrittura delle schede considerando anche che il lettore per le SD/micro-SD è limitato allo standard UHS-I (100 megabit/s circa raggiunti effettivamente in lettura sequenziale) pur rimanendo compatibile anche con le più rapide UHS-II.L'uso della spina USB-A o dell'USB-C è irrilevante si tratta solo di una comodità: le prestazioni non cambiano (su porta USB 3).A livello costruttivo è molto compatto e leggero facilmente trasportabile.Il prezzo attuale è di 12.99 euro che è buono considerando le caratteristiche del prodotto.
4,Un lettore 4 in 1 davvero molto comodo! Da poco ho comprato una fotocamera mirrorless Sony e questo oggettino fa davvero al caso mio! Trasferisco sia video in 4K che le foto con una velocità altissima e questo mi agevola molto in termini di tempistiche tra elaborazione ecc.Pensate che prima per trasferire file in una risoluzione così alta impiegavo davvero tanto tempo ma ora con questo lettore ho davvero migliorato tutto. E' molto leggero e questo inizialmente mi aveva fatto un po' "paura" perché non mi ha dato una bellissima impressione. Probabilmente è dovuto ai materiali utilizzati (forse la plastica non è proprio eccezionale...) ma poco importa il lettore funzionare discretamente bene ed è utilissimo compatto e comodo da portarmelo in giro nello zaino.Le 4 entrate per le schede sono rispettivamente per SD/Micro SD/MS e CF quindi ce n'è per tutti i tipi e per tutti i gusti. Il cavetto di collegamento è un 3.0 e questo conferisce l'alta velocità nei trasferimenti (ovviamente dovrete avere anche voi le porte di questo standard vicino al case del vostro PC o vicino al vostro portatile. Le mie per fortuna sono tutte 3.0 e oltre!Nel caso vogliate utilizzarlo su Mac o su un telefono Android (o anche su una porta USB-C del vostro computer fisso il mio le ha!) c'è un comodo adattatore USB-A - USB-C che sicuramente può fare al caso vostro.Il prezzo è ottimo l'oggetto è ottimo quindi non credo di aver assolutamente niente da ridire. Peccato solo per i materiali ma sicuramente usarne di migliori avrebbe fatto aumentare il costo finale quindi va più che bene così.
5,Finalmente un lettore di schede che riesce a raggiungere la velocità dichiarata. Effettivamente capita spesso di leggere dei roboati dati di velocità di trasferimento che poi si riducono ad andar bene ad un terzo di quanto dichiarato e questo vale per moltissime tipologie di periferiche (chiavette usb schede di memoria ecc.).In questo caso "fa strano" veder rispettati (o almeno molto vicini al dichiarato) i valori di lettura di circa 100 MB/s di questo pratico lettore 4 in 1. Naturalmente bisogna utilizzare schede di memoria compatibili con tale velocità per cui bisogna orientarsi con schede di classe di velocità UHS 3 altrimenti la velocità di lettura massima sarà data da quella della scheda stessa e quindi sappiate che il collo di bottiglia non è questo lettore ma la scheda.Il lettore viene spedito dentro una busta chiusa con un adattatore usb-c che lo rende molto più versatile della sola porta usb. Di fatto se siamo in carenza di porte usb (vedi un pc portatile) perchè già utilizzate da altre periferiche possiamo comunque utilizzare il lettore perchè una porta usb-c la troveremo di sicuro.Con un prezzo di circa 13 euro questo lettore di schede è davvero un ottimo acquisto.NotaLa lettura contemporanea di più schede non è consentita.
4,This is useful and practical. It is small. About 6 cm square and it is very light so very portable. It is plastic so I am not sure how robust it would be. If I have one concern this might be it but not the type of thing one breaks? It can connect various types of cards to your device wither through a 'C' or a 'USB'. iT can be used for either which I really like. I can use it on my phone or on my laptop/PC. It uses various types of card. I have tried it with a micro SD and an SD card (I don't have the other types of cards it uses). It connects very quickly and easily. It works with both well. What I really like is being able to use it with 'c' and 'usb'. A useful piece of kit to have with you for either phone or PC.
4,At £9.99 at the time of writingThisMemory Card Reader BENFEI 4in1 USB USB-C to SD Micro SD MS CF Card Reader Seems like a little bargain.But is it all that?Or is it all tat?(Thank you thank you 😊  I know... )To find out let's play at being 🕵️‍♂️ detectives 🕵️‍♂️ as we dig out our magnifying 🔎 glasses 🔎 and take a closer look 👀...🔎There are clues... clues everywhere... 🔍It arrives in a transparentfronted wee plastic bag with generic printed text on it.A wee white sticker is the only specific identification text on it.Put of it's wee bag it is light.Very light.Made out of lightweight plastic gives it a bit of a cheap feel. Not very professional or durable but robust enough to portable.I would have preffered an aluminium chassis rather than the black plastic one.It connects either by USBA or USBC due to an optional convertor adapter.That's a nice touch giving flexibility and connectivity options.✅It's very fast in it's connections and dats transfer speeds making reading cards is virtually instant.✅ 🔎 I see a pattern forming here ...🔍It reads 4 different types of cards:▪︎SD(Secure Digital)▪︎Micro SD(TF)▪︎MS(Memory Stick)▪︎CF(Compact Flash).Which is great.✅Covering most types of portable memory cards in use at the moment.It has different slots for each type of card so it dies not require fiddly adapters or card converters.Good news.✅Having different slots means you can read multiple cards without having to swap different types out while reading another type. 🔎 Are there finger prints? Or eaprints?🔍It's plug and play with no additional software of drivers needed.No additional power source is needed either.Both are additional plus points. ✅It's racking up those plus points rapidly. 🔎 Elementary my dear... Elementary...🔍In testing...It was great.Fsst as promised.✅Simple to install and use as promised. ✅It read every type of card I had available to test. ✅It worked on my PC my laptop and my phone.✅Making swapping cards in and out much easier than using the inbuilt reader slots and putting them all in one handy box. ✅The manufacturer has faith in it's durability backing it with an impressive 18 month warranty.That is very impressive. ✅ 🔎Nose prints? What do you mean those aren't even a thing? Hmmm....🔍Overall this little box of tricks is very goodIt's not the prettiest of peripherals not the slickest or most professional looking boxes you can get but it's functional utilitarian and it does the job.I would pay that wee bit more to get an aluminium shell or a nicer design.It performed brilliantly. Flawless.Value for money is fabulous.Cheap as 🍟 chips 🍟 and I can't fault it's price. 🔎 Please return any borrowed equipment or deerstalker hats to the front door 🚪 on your way out. 🔍Definitely recommended 👌..I hope you enjoyed our time together ❤Thank you for reading my review 🤗.
4,The whole thing is made from plastic on a budget.  It feels super light light there is hardly anything to it.  Plug it into a USB port (cord is about 40cm) and put the thing on top of your machine or nearby due to the limitation of length.  It light so if there is a kink in the cable then the back it will not sit flat on your desk.  I wish there was just some weight to it.  The bottom is smooth so it can move around your desk.The unit has all the necessary ports for popular cards so no issues in that department.It is what it is a card reader and it does it's job.  Just wish it felt a little heavier and had rubber feet on the bottom.
4,A lot of computers and laptops don't come with SD card slots anymore if you want to transfer stuff from your camera but don't have the slot one of these is what you need.There is a choice between USB-C and USB-A if you want to use USB-A you just have to disconnect the USB-C adaptor that is already plugged in sadly if you don't have any need for USB-C at all you will need to leave the adaptor hanging off the wire or cut it off since it is permanently attatched.The build quality feels very cheap it's made out of this really thin and rough plastic almost feels 3D printed.For the price it's fine but I would probably look into something smaller and higher quality if you're planning on using this on the go.Thanks for reading my review!
5,L’aspect légèrement granuleux du boitier n’entache pas une belle qualité apparente. Le câble est inamovible mais de belle longueur 50cm hors connecteur. Le point super positif est la présence d’un adaptateur USB C vers 3.0 sur le câble. Reste que pour le connecter en micro USB la bonne méthode de l’adaptateur ou du câble OTG est à utiliser.Lorsque vous connectez le lecteur une LED bleue s’allume pour confirmer la connexion.A la connexion Windows initialise une seule entrée "Lecteurs USB" dans la liste des disques de ce fait il ne peut lire qu’un seul format de carte à la fois et pour changer de format il faut d’abord retirer le précédent. La performance de transfert est très bonne comparable à celle d’un lecteur intégré.Il est certain qu’aujourd’hui les cartes les plus utilisées sont les micro-SD et les SD… donc ce lecteur peut paraitre inutile sauf si vous possédez un appareil photo utilisant des cartes CompactFlash ou Memory Stick… ou encore un appareil sans lecteur de carte.En dernier ressort je l’ai testé sur ma vielle tour sans lecteur de carte et en USB 2.0 (mais Windows 10). Rien ne se passe à la connexion c’est seulement à l’introduction d’une carte qu’une entrée se crée dans la liste des disques. En performance c’est divisé par deux par rapport à l’USB C ou 3.0 de mon portable.Si vous en avez le besoin voici un très bon lecteur de carte.
4,Da una parte la doppia possibilità di connettersi a una porta USB tipo A o USB C (o Thunderbolth 3 che è una “USB C potenziata”). Apprezzo che l’adattatore da USB A a USB C sia legato al cavo in modo da averlo sempre con sé quando serve.Dall’altra parte si trovano quattro diversi slot per i tipi di schede di memoria più diffusi:- Schede CF (Compact Flash)- Schede SD (Secure Digital UHS-I)- Schede TF (TransFlash anche definite MicroSD)- Schede MS (Memory Stick Sony)Circa le schede SD questa interfaccia è per le SD UHS-I. Leggerà anche le UHS-II ma non sarà in grado di sfruttarne la massima velocità. Le UHS-II hanno infatti due file di contatti elettrici un esterna e una più rientrata mentre le UHS-I hanno solo la tradizionale fila di contatti esterna. Per sfruttare la massima velocità delle UHS-II occorre utilizzare tutti i contatti ma funzionano anche se si utilizza solo la fila esterna. Questo lettore usa solo la fila esternaL’interfaccia USB è una USB 3.0 la quale può raggiungere una velocità di 48Gbps 10 volte superiore alla USB 2.0. Dalle indicazioni leggo che si possono leggere dati fino a 104 MB/s (quindi quasi 1000Mbps) se la scheda lo consente.Se però si usa il lettore connesso a una porta USB 2.0 allora il limite sarà di 30-40MB/s a causa delle minori prestazioni della USB 2.0Il cavo è lungo 55cm e permette di tenere vicino il lettore anche se la porta USB è un po’ fuori mano.
3,Adattatore che consente di leggere 4 più diffuse tipologie di schede in commercio: SD Micro SD Memory Stick e Compact Flash. E' possibile connetterlo ad un pc o ad una smartphone tramite connettore  USB 3 e USB C. Arriva ben sigillato in una busta di plastica. Le dimensioni ridotte misura solo 6 X 6 cm ne favoriscono la trasportabilità. E' molto leggero ed il cavo è lungo 50 cm ed è adeguatamente spesso e protetto da una morbida guaina. L'adattatore è in plastica e il colore è nero. L'adattatore USB tipo C è collegato al cavo. Se lo si volesse rimuovere basta tagliare il collegamento. La velocità è molto buona. Il riconoscimento sul pc è immediato. Funziona anche con pc con USB 2 naturalmente con velocità di trasferimento notevolmente ridotte.L'inserimento del connettore USB c  nel mio smartphone risulta stabile.  Anche in questo caso l'accesso ai dati è immediato.E' necessario qualche volta rimuovere la scheda e reinserirla affinché sia riconosciuta. Non mi piace il fatto che non è possibile inserire ed usare contemporaneamente più schede. Peccato !!!AVE!
4,Der Kartenleser ist gut aber nicht sehr gut.Warum gibt es einen Punktabzug? Der Kartenleser wird nicht an allen Geräten immer erkannt.Da es am Laptop am Laptop meines Mannes und auch an einem Desktop-Rechner nicht klappte kann das aus meiner Sicht kein Zufall sein. Meist funktioniert es nachdem ich ihn entfernt habe und dann neu eingesteckt habe.Da ich an den genannten Rechnern  aber mit anderen Kartenlesern dieses Problem nicht habe halte ich es für ausgeschlossen dass es an den Rechnern liegt.Wenn der Kartenleser was meistens der Fall ist funktioniert ist er gut. Die Übertragungsraten sind gut.
3,Im Laufe der Jahre haben sich einige Speicherkarten angesammelt SD Micro SD Mini SD Memory Stick Compact Flash. Eigentlich alles was es so gibt. Oft werden bei den kleinen Karten Adapter für SD Leser mitgeliefert dieses kleine Gerät kann alle oben genannten Speicherkarten lesen so die Theorie.Was mit gut gefällt- Das Gerät ist recht klein kann auch mal mitgenommen werden oder findet in der Fototasche Platz- Eine kleine LED zeigt an das es eingesteckt ist und bei Aktivität blinkt sie. Das ist aus meiner Sicht schon hilfreich- USB-C Anschluss mit Adapter für USB 3.0. Erreicht habe ich 80MB/s lesend von einer Micro SD Karte auf meinen Rechner. Den Wert finde ich schon sehr gut- Viele Karten können gelesen werdenWas mir nicht so gut gefallen hat- Ich habe es nicht geschafft das meine beiden Mini SD Karten gelesen werden. Die kommen in den Memory Stick Slot und eine MS Karte konnte ich lesen und die Mini SD auch mit Adapter im SD Slot- Es ist kein paralleler Zugriff möglich wenn mehrere Karten eingeschoben sind. Der Kartenleser wird gar nicht mehr erkannt- Das Gehäuse ist nicht wirklich schön keine Gummifüße das es nicht verrutscht. Fühlt sich nicht wirklich wertig an. Knickschutz sehr hartInsgesamt ein solides Gerät. Das mehrere Karten nicht lesbar sind kann man in der Beschreibung nachlesen die ist aber nicht sehr deutlich „Es ist kein Kartenleser gleichzeitig und kann nicht 4 Karten gleichzeitig lesen.“. Das ist für mich als Hinweis nicht ausreichend. Preislich noch vertretbar aber insgesamt nicht was ich erwarten würde. Mehr als zu einem 3 Sterne Ergebnis komme ich leider nicht.
5,…nein hier wurde keine Schokolade getestet sondern ein „Kartenleser“. Der Vorteil dieses von mir getesteten >Speicherkartenleser BENFEI 4 in1 USB / USB-C auf SD Micro SD MS CF-Kartenleseradapter< liegt und das führe ich als erstes an an den beiden Schnittstellen-Nutzungsmöglichkeiten mittels USB-A Und USB-C Steckern. Der USB-A Stecker ist dabei fest mit dem Kartenleserkabel verbunden daran anhängend befindet sich noch ein USB-C Stecker Adapter. Dieser wird einfach auf den USB-A Stecker aufgesteckt. Damit ist man sinnigerweise recht flexibel und kann zwischen möglichen Geräten mit beiden Anschlussarten problemlos wechseln.4 verschiedene Karten-Typen sind les- und Nutzbar.  „SD (Secure Digital) Micro SD (TF) MS (Memory Stick) und CF (Compact Flash).“Die Verarbeitung des Gerätes ist schlicht und praktisch das lesen der Karten geht je nach Type zügig und wird so wie es aussieht von dem Kartenleser nicht oder nur sehr wenig beeinflusst.Auch eine ältere Compactflash Karte die 2005 zum letzten Male genutzt wurde wurde problemlos gelesen wie der Bildausschnitt des Dateiname -Explorers deutlich zeigt. Leider hatte ich keine weiteren der Karten zum Test der anderen Slots zur Verfügung gehe aber ob der guten Leserergebnisse der beiden getesteten Karten (Micro-SD und Compact-Flash) von der gleich guten Funktion der anderen beiden Slots aus.Wie gesagt ein kleines kompaktes Kartenlesegerät welches an USB-A und USB-C gleichermaßen nutzbar ist. Preis- und Leitungsangemessen und von mir empfohlen.
4,Le choix entre USB et USB-C est une très bonne idée. Ne consacrer ce lecteur qu'aux cartes-mémoire est peut-être un peu trop sélectif mais peut-être est-ce pour éviter la surcharge (?)
4,Il lettore di schede sd è una periferica hardware che permette di leggere le memorie sd micro sd e altri tipi di memorie portatili. Il lettore di schede sd non solo permette la lettura su vari tipi di memorie sd ma ne permette anche la scrittura.Specifiche prodotto:Marchio: BENFEINome: Lettore di schedeSlot: 1 x SD 1 x Micro SD 1 x CF 1 x MSBen realizzato risulta comodo perché presenta sia l'attacco USB A 3.0 e sia l'adattatore per USB C infatti molti pc nuovi hanno una porta USB C a disposizione.E' un dispositivo davvero utile se si necessita trasferire spesso file da una scheda SD che al giorno d'oggi sono diffusissime nelle fotocamere videocamere cellulari. Ma non solo questo prodotto legge 4 formati di schede oltre alla classica SD e Micro SD abbiamo anche MS (Memory Stick) e CF(Compact Flash).Risulta essere molto veloce nel trasferimento dei dati fino a 104 Mb/Sec ovviamente tutto in base alla velocità della scheda utilizzata.In conclusione consigliato prodotto molto utile e funzionale per scaricare foto e video da un dispositivo audio/video al PC.
4,Lo bueno de este lector de tarjetas es que es compatible con las tarjetas SD microSD y Compact Flash (CF) y Memory Stick (MS) y lo puedes conectar tanto en un dispositivo con puerto USB (tipo A 3.0) como con puerto USB-C ya que lleva un adaptador de quita-.y-pon.Para los fans de Sony ideal ya que el MS es típico de esta marca. Y para los que tenemos una cámara de fotos “vintage” que lea CF nos va muy bien.El aspecto es clásico con la carcasa cuadrada de de plástico negro y las distintas ranuras en los tres lados (el cuarto es por donde sale el cable).Tiene un LED de actividad de color azul que queda fijo cuando conectas la unidad y parpadea cuando la tarjeta tiene actividad de lectura o escritura.El cable se ve robusto aunque no es de nylon trenzado sino de plástico. Mide 56 cm. ¿Demasiado largo? Depende. Para mí es una longitud adecuada para acceder con agilidad al puerto USB-C de mi portátil.Respecto a las velocidades de lectura y escritura ese es un tema complejo ya que la velocidad depende no sólo del aparato (que en realidad es un adaptador para pasar información de la tarjeta a un dispositivo y viceversa) sino también de la tarjeta que vayamos a leer o escribir. He hecho algunas pruebas y lo que puedo decir que la diferencia entre leer y escribir en una tarjeta SD con este lector y con el del portátil no es muy grande. En el lector es un poco más lenta pero no es un drama sobre todo teniendo en cuenta que éste es un dispositivo muy estable.PERONo soporta lectura y escritura en dos o más tarjetas simultáneamente.No viene con un manual de instrucciones que siempre es de agradecer aunque su uso es intuitivo.
4,4-in-1 plug and play card reader with both USB-A 3.0 and USB-C connections. Particularly useful as it reads the MF cards used in Sony cameras.
5,Si algo me ha llamado la atención de este lector de tarjetas de la marca BENFEI han sido dos.La primera que lee tarjetas Compact Flash. Si muchos pensareis que están en desuso pero no es así.La segunda que dispone de dos conectores uno de ellos USB-C. Aunque sea por medio de un adaptador.Por lo demás no deja de ser un lector de tarjetas hecho en plastico duro para ahorrar costes con una longitud de cable bastante buena. Para mi la ideal. No como otros que es cortisona.Puede leer cuatro tipos de tarjeta Compact Flash SD MicroSD y MS (Memory Stick la propietaria de Sony)Cuando conectas el lector e insertas una tarjeta un LED de color azul indicará que ha sido reconocida. En una de las fotos que he puesto podéis observarlo.La velocidad de lectura/escritura dependerá del tipo de tarjeta que uses no todas estas preparadas para dar la misma velocidad pero como mínimo en una SD Clase 10 podrás alcanzar los 480 MGb/s ya que estamos hablando de un puerto USB 3 aunque tenga un adaptador USB-C que alcanza mayores velocidades reales pero no es el caso. Sigue siendo USB 3.Viene en una bolsa de plastico con cierre tipo ZIP.Apenas pesa unos gramos por lo que podrás llevarlo allá donde vayas en la mochila bolsa maletín de ordenador bolsa de cámara de fotos etc...Lo recomiendo? Si en este caso digo que si puede leer cualquier formato de tarjeta de las existentes. Nunca te dejará colgado.Espero haberte sido de ayuda.
4,Der Kartenleser ist ganz Okay.Er ist jetzt nichts besonderes weder in der Optik noch in der Technik.Er unterstützt:SDMicroSDCFMSAngeschlossen kann er entweder über USB 3.0 oder USB-CDie Geschwindigkeit ist sehr gut. Meine Test MicroSD (Samsung EVO 64GB) wurde mit ca. 60mb/s beschrieben.Was mir nicht so gefällt ist das man nur eine Karte nutzen kann. Steckt man eine zweite in den Kartenleser wird gar keine mehr erkannt.Zusammenfassung:+ Schnelle Übertragungsrate+ USB-C Option- Keine gleichzeitigen Karten möglich------------------------------------------------+ Positivo Neutral- Negativ
4,In meinem alten PC hatte ich noch einen Speicherkartenleser intergiert. Meinem neuen PC geht dieses feature leider ab. Dennoch habe ich eine ganze Reihe von Geräten bei denen die Daten (auch für einen Datentransfer) auf SD-Karte gespeichert sind.Deshalb musste ein Adapter her. Ich habe den BENFEI 4 in1 Adapter ausgewählt da er USB und USB-C-Anschlüsse besitzt. Am "großen" PC nutze ich den USB-Anschluss und an Tablet/Smartphone den USB-C Anschluss.Der Adapter tut was er soll. Mit den Übertragungsraten (die ja nicht allein vom Adapter abhängen) bin ich zufrieden.
5,Ich habe den BENFEI 4 in1 USB / USB-C auf SD Micro SD MS CF-Kartenleseradapter Adapter Hub 5 Gbit/s am PC und Laptop mit Windows 10 getestet. Da ich aber nur aber nur SD und Micro SD-Karten besitze kamen die SD-Karten zu Einsatz.Die Datenübertragung des Kartenlesers finde ich mit 91/87 Mbit/s per USB-3.0 Anschluss schon sehr schnell bei einer SD-Karte mit 170 Mbits/s. Über USB 3.0 am PC hatte ich keine Probleme und würde sofort erkannt. Der Kartenleser ist ein Multitalent da er  alle Karten-Formate lesen und schreiben kann. Somit ist per Kartenleser per USB 3.0 Stecker an vielen Geräten oder über den USB 3.1 Typ C Adapter der dabei ist einsetzbar.Gehäuse: Farblich in schwarz und einem Kunsthof-Gehäuse sehr schön gemacht. Ich werde ihn unterwegs mehr für Laptop nutzen. Die Steckplätz für den Kartenschächte ist gut platziert und sehr gut zu erreichen.Fazit:Mittlerweile habe ich hier schon einige Kartenleser getestet und ich muss ehrlich sagen das ist einer der besten Kartenleser die hier bis jetzt zum Testen hatte.Der Kartenleser ist sehr funktional und mit einer guten Datenübertragung im USB 3.0 Bereich. Und ein gut verarbeiteter USB-Multi- Kartenleser. 5 Sterne und eine Kaufempfehlung allein wegen dem günstigen Preis. Danke dass ich den Kartenleser testen durfte. Und ich hoffe meine Rezession ist euch hilfreich bei der Kaufentscheidung.
5,Ho preso questo adattatore per fare un esperimento non essendo possibile collegare direttamente il mio telefono alla televisione ho voluto provare ad utilizzare questo adattatore per trasferire su una memory card e le fotografie ed i video dal mio smartphone utilizzando il cavo usb di tipo c. Il lettore viene riconosciuto e funziona perfettamente quindi una volta trasferite le immagini ho provato a collegarlo tramite adattatore qsb compreso nel caveau direttamente al mio televisore e finalmente ho potuto ammirare i miei video anche sulla TV di casa.Sono molto soddisfatto.
2,Il lettore si trova confezionato in una busta richiudibile con zip a pressione non ci sono le istruzioni d'uso.Il dispositivo è di colore nero costruito con la plastica leggermente zigrinata di qualità non molto alta.É dotato di un cavetto lungo 50 cm che è fisso sul lettore che è piuttosto leggero e non è troppo ingombrante con le dimensioni 62 cm x 62 cm x 15 cm.È dotato di 4 entrate compatibili con le schede di memoria sono posizionate su tre lati e in pratica legge la maggior parte di schede portatili che si trovano in commercio SD/MicroSD/MS/CF.Durante il funzionamento lampeggia la luce led di colore celeste nella parte superiore del lettore.Il cavetto di collegamento con il dispositivo è dotato di un uscita USB tipo A 3.0 (presa classica) facilmente riconoscibile dal colore celeste e un adattatore da USB tipo A 3.0  in C che è inserito sull'uscita USB 3.0.Le differenze della velocità in scrittura e lettura si notano da subito se il lettore è connesso alla presa USB 3 o quella C invece se viene connesso a quella USB 2 le schede le legge solo che non può superare la velocità della porta stessa poi ovviamente la velocità è condizionata anche dalle specifiche tecniche della scheda utilizzata che anche qui non può il lettore superare la velocità stessa della scheda.Ho postato le foto per fare il confronto delle velocità fra la porta USB 2 e USB 3 e quella tipo C.L'adattatore USB 3 maschio in USB tipo C è connesso sul cavetto in modo da non perderlo ma se si vuole si può anche distaccarlo facilmente ma in modo permanente.Purtroppo anche se il lettore è in grado di leggere mie schede utilizzando la loro velocità ho continui problemi nel riconoscerle e devo fare diversi tentativi di staccare e riattaccare il lettore dove a volte viene riconosciuto ma a volte il PC non lo trova e questo con le porte USB 3 e anche USB tipo C adesso non so se si è installato il driver sbagliato oppure il lettore è difettoso può capitare ma  subito dopo la scheda ha iniziato a darmi errore per correggerla la cosa che non va mai fatta perché dopo diventa quasi sempre illeggibile dunque i dati prima devono essere copiati da un' altra parte poi la scheda deve essere riformattata e caso mai dopo vano rimessi di nuovo sulla scheda.Il PC che mi da problemi è il Nitro gaming di pochi mesi sul quale un altro lettore non mi ha mai dato problemi.
4,Se trata de un lector USB/USB-C de tarjetas de la marca Benfei concretamente el modelo 000328black.El lector posee 2 tipos de conectores USB: USB-A y USB-C por lo que nos será útil en una gran variedad de dispositivos. Es una pena que no contemple también el tipo de conexión micro-USB ya que hubiese aumentado aún más su usabilidad.La calidad de fabricación es correcta aunque parece algo frágil debido a que está enteramente fabricado en plástico. El lector permite leer tarjetas CF MS SD y micro-SD por lo que es válido para la prácticamente totalidad de tarjetas actuales así que en ese aspecto poco se puede objetar. Lo he probado con tarjetas SDXC y micro-SD y no he tenido ningún problema la lectura y la copia de archivos se ha hecho adecuadamente y con una buena velocidad de transferencia ya que el lector es USB 3.0. El lector es pequeño lo que hace que se puede transportar con facilidad.En definitiva: un correcto lector de tarjetas que al ser USB 3.0 posee una buena velocidad de transferencia de archivos. El funcionamiento es correcto y lo único que se le puede achacar es el hecho de estar fabricado en plástico. De momento estoy satisfecho con él y en cuanto al precio está en la media.Espero que esta opinión te haya sido útil :)
4,Soy aficionado a la fotografía y trabajo mucho con todo tipo de tarjetas no disponer de un lector todo en uno supone estar haciendo malabares para leer distintos tipos de tarjeta.El lector es normal y corriente de hecho debido a que el plástico es tan normal y no se le ve buena calidad que desmerece las funciones que hace el lector y que las hace muy bien.Lee diferentes tipos de tarjetas y me llama la atención que lea tarjetas Compact Flash tengo varias perdidas por los cajones que he recuperado y leído perfectamente con este lector.La conexión se puede hacer por USB tipo A y C y lleva un cable flexible que hace que se pueda poner más a mano el lector para trabajar con el.La pega que le veo es que no puede leer diferentes tarjetas a la vez o sea si tienes varias tarjetas introducidas no puedes acceder a ellas.Sobre el precio a mi parecer no esta ajustado a la calidad del producto y debería de ajustarse a la baja algo.Si tienes alguna duda o pregunta te invito a visitar mi perfil público donde encontrarás otras críticas.

5,Memory Card Reader BENFEI 4in1 USB USB-C to SD Micro SD MS CF Card Reader AdapterIn the pack.You get the card reader with attached cable. The cable comes with an adapter so it can be used with USB full sized or USB C sockets.Build.It is well made and the cards fit in very securely.Using.As this reader compact flash cards it is very useful to me. My older Nikon cameras use these cards so I need to read off these cards. The reader is not the fastest but it is reliable. I have not had any corrupted or missing files while using it over the last few days. I have also used it with SD cards from my mirrorless cameras and it reads them accurately too. The unit is small enough to carry in your camera bag.Overall.For older camera without wireless or Bluetooth these readers are essential. Many modern laptops do not have a built-in reader to save space so a unit like this is essential for backing up in the field. This unit works very well if a little slowly on bigger files but apart from that it is perfect.
5,This review is for the Memory Card Reader BENFEI 4in1 USB USB-C to SD Micro SD MS CF Card Reader Adapter.It comes with a USB C lead that has a USB 3 adapter tied to the cable so it will fit either type of USB socket which is brilliant. Because the adapter is anchored you can’t lose it which is a great idea and a shame more companies don’t do this and it also means it will fit someone else’s computer if you carry it with you.The whole thing is made of lightweight plastic and to be honest I don’t see this as a downside at all because metal would have made it heavier and being so light makes it less susceptible to dropped damage which is more likely as it is portable. It connected well with Windows 10 all of the ports worked well and it’s great to see a CF reader in there too and it didn’t heat up at all. The cable is a decent length so it can be positioned more easily but I would tend to use this more as a portable add-on rather than having it permanently plugged in. It can only access one slot at a time so you can’t copy across several cards at the same time but for the price (£9.99) and it’s portability I don’t see this as a reason not to buy it.
5,acquistato perchè per lavoro ultimamente sto scaricando parecchi gigabyte al giorno da schede sd e il lettore interno del portatile purtroppo non  sfrutta  a pieno la velocità della scheda invece questo lettore è un lettore usb 3 che tra l’altro ha anche l’adattatore micro usb type-c ed infatti grazie a questo lettore riesco a scaricare le schede sd ad una velocità che oscilla dai 95-110 mb al secondo il bello che rende unico questo lettore di schede è la presenza dello slot per le schede compact flash il quale non sempre presente in un card reader è un ottimo prodotto veloce con un ottimo prezzo
5,This simple device is well constructed robust and has an integral cable terminating in a USB-C plug which can be pulled off to reveal a USB-A plug so that this will directly fit most ultrabooks and a range of tablets. Given less than a minute Windows 10 will detect the card reader and set it all up so that you can insert a memory card and immediately start downloading the information. This allows you to read and load music onto a micro SD card for your phone or to download photos and videos from a card that has been in your phone a security camera or your domestic/professional  camera.The cable is strong and well protected where it joins the plug and reader and the reader itself will read everything I have (SD Micro SD X SD and compact flash) and does so quickly and efficiently. The reader's speed is controlled by what type of USB connection that you have  (1 2 or 3) but will function well with all.This is an incredibly good value product and one that adds to your computers capabilities. Highly recommended!
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               👍 PUNTOS POSITIVOS✔️Soporta muchos tipos de tarjetas.✔️Se puede conectar mediante USB-A o USB-C.✔️Lo he probado y sí que transmite a velocidad USB 3.0.👎 PUNTOS NEGATIVOS❌Los materiales no parecen de buena calidad el plástico deja mucho que desear.❌El puerto USB-C no sirve para conectar el lector a móviles o tablets con entrada USB-C al menos en los míos no ha funcionado. Donde sí ha funcionado es en el ordenador.❌No se puede conectar más de una tarjeta a la vez. He probado a tener una conectada y sin desconectarla poner otra y el resultado ha sido que dejaron de funcionar ambas. También he probado a meter las dos tarjetas y luego conectar el lector pero no ha sido capaz de leer ninguna.❌La forma en la que se ponen y quitan las tarjetas da muy mala sensación tengo otras que son de las que hacen un click al introducirlas y luego las presionas para extraerlas y son muchísimo más cómodas. Además cuesta un poco meter las tarjetas tipo Memory Stick Pro Duo porque hay que mirar los conectores para encajarlas bien.❌El cable estaría mejor si fuera más corto y así si me hace falta podría añadirle un cable para hacerlo más largo. Si tuviera la opción de que fuera más corto me molestaría menos el cable en la mesa pero el cable no es extraíble.En definitiva si yo tuviera que comprar un lector de tarjetas no elegiría éste por los motivos que he comentado creo que hay mejores opciones en el mismo rango de precios.
4,Comentamos Lector de tarjetas SD/Micro SD/MS/CF 4 en 1 adaptador de lector de tarjetas BENFEI Compact USB-C/USB 3.0 a SD/Micro SD/MS/CF.Nos encontramos con base lectora de tarjetas compatibles con SD MicroSD y Memory Stick. El dispositivo es totalmente de plástico y al tacto lo notas que no es de muy buena calidad y es bastante ligero. También a la hora de meter las tarjetas notas que no hace ningún click simplemente la introduces y debes suponer que está correctamente.Nos avisa con luz azul de que está funcionando.Incorpora un cable USB-C de 50 centímetrosel cual tiene un adaptador a USB-A 3.0 que va enganchado  al cable para evitar que se nos pierda.Lo que menos me ha gustado y lo peor del dispositivo es que no podemos leer dos tarjetas a la vez mientras que el mercado tenemos otros dispositivos que si lo hacen y no difieren en precios.Porque después en sus uso tiene una lectura correcta pero para poder competir hay que estár en igualdad de condiciones.Espero haberos ayudado!! Saludos !!
4,Este lector de tarjetas resulta muy versátil ya que con él podemos leer tarjetas de una gran cantidad de formatos:- Micro SD (las que se suelen usar actualmente en móviles y cámaras)- SD (las de tamaño más grande que usaban cámaras más antiguas)- Compact Flash (las precursoras de las SD que se usaban en cámaras aún más antiguas)- Memory Stick (el formato de Sony que usaba en sus cámaras y en sus consolas)Por lo tanto no tendremos problema en leer cualquier tarjeta de cámaras tanto actuales como más antiguas.Además el lector tiene un adaptador incorporado en el cable con el que podemos conectarlo tanto a USB tipo A como a USB tipo C .El lector funciona de forma muy correcta simplemente con enchufarlo no necesita la instalación de drivers ni de ningún software.Sin embargo la pega que le pongo son sus materiales. Está fabricado en un plástico muy ligero y de no mucha calidad al ser un accesorio que normalmente transportaremos muy a menudo hubiera sido mucho mejor que hubieran optado por materiales metálicos o una construcción más robusta porque va a tener mucho traqueteo.
5,This little card reader has probably every type of card covered.  SD and Micro SD being the two most common but it also has Compact Flash (great for older cameras) and Memory Stick (MS - created by Sony and used in some of their equipment).It's pretty lightweight but sturdy enough for day to day use.  The lead isn't too bad being around 55cm long.  It has a USB A connection for virtually every computer on the planet and a USB C 'cap' that can be used for newer devices that have that connection (or even tablets/phones etc.).It's not the fastest device on the market but gives solid performance.  Using a faster USB connection does help so it's not an old USB 1.0 board.  Connections are positive and the cards aren't loose when inserted.  The CF slot worked well without worrying about bending the pins.
5,Yo siempre ando cacharreando en casa y nunca antes había tenido un lector de tarjetas que fuera fiable como si lo es este modelo. Pesa muy poco y es bastante manejable podremos llevarlo a donde nos haga falta es 4 en 1 además la principal ventaja que le he encontrado es que es 3.0 lo que hará la lectura más rápida de las tarjetas que le metamos incluye adaptador USB tipo-c por si nos hace falta no necesita un cable de alimentación solo el mismo que trae.He probado a usar tarjetas viejas de cámaras de fotos que ya no usaba por no tener lectores de estos y todo perfecto.Además recomiendo su compra porque muchos portátiles modernos de ahora los fabricantes por ahorrar suelen quitar este tipo de lectores siendo imposible recuperar esos archivos de fotos o lo que sean.
3,Gracias a la oportunidad que me han dado de poder probar este producto puede dar mi opinión.El producto llega en una bolsa serigrafiada con la marca y con cierre Zip insuficiente bajo mi punto de vista pues podria sufrir desperfectos me fijo mucho en estos detalles.Tiene un cable (demasiado largo para mí gusto y no es extraíble) con conector USB. Además tiene un adaptador incorporado para USB-C que le proporciona un amplio abanico de dispositivos compatibles.Admite 4 tipos de tarjetas (con lo que cubrimos la práctica totalidad de la oferta del mercado) con una muy buena tasa de intercambio de información.No se pueden leer dos tarjetas al mismo tiempo con lo que tampoco se pueden copiar datos de una tarjeta a otra directamente. Si eso es lo que se necesita mejor buscar otro.Este es un producto a tener en cuenta por su alta compatibilidad y velocidad de transferencia.Espero que mi opinión os haya ayudado.
5,The BENFEI memory card reader comes in a resealable plastic bag that is suitable for continued storage (pic 1).  The pack just includes the hub but there is a link to on-line information on the back of the bag should it be needed.The hub is constructed of black plastic and while there is a tiny bit of flex in the casing it seems sturdy enough and the sockets are all solidly constructed (pics 2-6).  It should give extended service but you will need to take a little bit more care not to damage or break the plastic.  This should not be a problem in normal use and I would not expect a metal case for this price.  The connection lead allows either a USB or a USB C socket to be used via a built in adapter (pic 2).  The sockets are of the push in and pull out type commonly found on laptops and desktops that is not the 'click in/out' kind you would find in a camera say.I particularly needed the CF (Compact Flash) card socket.  I have an old camera that uses this format but despite being old it still takes very nice pictures and so this hub has given it a new lease of life.  We also own a couple of cheap point and shoot cameras that use MS format cards so that is a bonus.  I had had a CF card slot on my desktop computer but that died when one of my little treasures tried to ram the card in upside down.  Oh well history is history and long since forgotten.For thoroughness sake I tried all of the sockets both through a USB and USB C connection and moved the same 1Gb of files back and forth to each type of card and an on board disk.  While there was some difference in the various performances these were mostly down to the motley selection of cards I own/used.  The bottom line is they all worked and transferred fast enough not to be a nuisance or a go and get a cup of coffee now moment.  With a decent SD card the transfer took a few seconds.  More than acceptable.  The hub is plenty fast enough just don't expect it to supercharge very old and slow cards.  But it will chug along nicely as fast as they can go and certainly will not be the factor limiting the speed of any transfers.  Incidentally you can happily use all 4 sockets at once.A good quality and cheap solution to my broken CF card slot that has the bonus of 3 other slots for commonly available cards.  I like these kinds of hubs and they do make it a bit easier to get the cards in an out particularly with a laptop.  If these are the sockets you need then this is a very good buy.
5,Es un lector de tarjetas Compact Flash SD MicroSD y Memory Stick. El aparato es totalmente de plástico y tiene un cable USB-C el cual tiene un adaptador a USB-A 3.0 que tiene el detalle de ir atado al cable para evitar que se nos pierda. Esto es de agradecer ya que te ahorras estar buscando el adaptador cuando hace falta.El cable es de unos 50 centímetros siendo perfecto para conectar en un pc en la parte de atrás dejándolo fijo. Quizás es lo más apropiado  ya que aunque vale perfectamente para portátiles para mi gusto sobra mucho cable.Tiene una importante desventaja para mi gusto y es que no puede leer dos tarjetas a la vez. Al menos en mi prueba con una SD y microSD solo lee una. Otros dispositivos del mercado leen ambas.En cuanto a la velocidad del dispositivo es correcta consigue las mismas velocidades que otro adaptador de MicroSD con el que lo he comparado.Por último indicar que tiene un pequeño led azul que indica que esta funcionando.
5,Yo que soy un aficionado a las consolas de antaño tanto las reales como las emuladas hecho mucho en falta un lector de tarjetas para el equipo y el portatil que me sirva para todas las tarjetas que manejo.Este lector me posibilita la conexión tanto a la torre como al portatil a través del puerto USB 3.0 con unos ratios de lectura altos limitados más por la velocidad de la tarjeta que por la del puerto USB 3.0. Dado que el último portatil adquirido viene ya con los puertos USB C lo usaremos gracias al adaptador que viene incluido.La inclusión del adaptador USB C también permite el uso del lector en teléfonos móviles y tabletas haciendo posible ver las fotos de una cámara que use tarjetas Compact Flash o SD normal en el móvil sin necesidad de un PC intermedio para volcarlas.Ya sean Memory Stick Compact Flash SD o microSD el lector nos servirá para leerlas a través de un PC portátil tableta o teléfono móvil.
4,Soy informático y mucha gente me suele pedir que le haga copia de las tarjetas de los móviles y demás por eso decidí probar este lector de tarjetas. Es uno de los lectores más completos que he visto lee cuatro tipo distintos de tarjetas: SD Micro SD MS y CF. Otra cosa que me ha gustado bastante es que tiene dos salidas una la típica USB y otra tipo C que viene bastante bien para poder conectarlo con los portátiles de Apple y los nuevos modelos que están fabricando.💸Sale por menos de 12 euros la verdad que está bastante bien de precio para los distintos tipos de tarjetas que lee.
5,Fonctionne sans souci accepte tous les formats compact pour le transport et câble assez long pour le bureau. 5/5
2,AllgemeinesDer Speicherkartenleser von Benfei unterstützt alle gängingen Formate an Speicherkarten (Micro SD CF MS SD) und bietet ein schlichtes Design. Der Hub ist quadratisches relativ flach und ein echtes Leichtgewicht. Der Anschluss an den USB-Port erfolgt mittels USB-A oder USB-C.Das Gehäuse ist aus reinem Plastik aber insgesamt ordentlich verarbeitet; wenn auch recht anfällig für Kratzer. Ein einfacher Transport in meiner Notebooktasche reichte aus um minimale Kratzer hervorzurufen.TechnischesDer Hub wird unter gängigen Betriebssystemen wie Windows 10 Linux und Android einwandfrei erkannt. Die Übertragungsrate nutzt jedoch den USB-C-Standard nicht vollkommen aus was ich jedoch nicht unbedingt kritisch finde; allerdings wäre hier sicher mehr möglich.Eine Speicherkarte die vorher 84 MB/s beim Lesen und 27 MB/s beim Lesen erreichte kam hier noch auf 42 MB/s und 17 MB/s. Das sind leider deutliche Einbußen.Die Nutzung mehrerer Speicherkaten parallel ist ebenfalls nicht möglich eine zweite Karte wird nicht erkannt; getestet wurde dies mit einer SD- und einer MicrSD-Karte. Dies ist wirklich verbesserungswürdig da ein Kopieren zwischen Speicherkarten eine durchaus sinnvolle Funktion ist.FazitDer Speicherkartenleser macht was er soll und ist zu allem was ich benötige kompatibel; nicht zuletzt durch die Option das Gerät per USB-A oder USB-C anzuschließen. An der Übertragungsgeschwindigkeit könnte noch etwas verbessert werden es ist schade wenn der Kartenleser der Flaschenhals ist und nicht die Speicherkarte.Insgesamt gebe ich 2 von 5 Sternen. Den dritten Stern würde ich geben wenn die parallele Nutzung mehrerer Speicherkarten möglich wäre den vierten Stern für eine höhere Übertragungsrate und den fünften Stern für ein alternatives bzw. kratzfesteres Gehäusematerial.
5,Der Cardreader macht ein gut verarbeiteten eindruck ist per USB A und USB C anschließbar und hat alle gängen Card eingänge diese sind auch beschriftet und eine LED kontrollleuchte leuchtet wenn das Gerät saft hat. Meine SD Karte von Camcorder wurde direkt erkannt das lesen und schreiben ging fix so wünscht man sich das. Dazu ist das USB Kabel auch relativ lang so das man es auch weiter weg stellen kann zb Regal oder so was. Absolute empfehlung.
3,Este lector 'Lector de tarjetas SD/Micro SD/MS/CF 4 en 1 adaptador de lector de tarjetas BENFEI Compact USB-C/USB 3.0 a SD/Micro SD/MS/CF' está bien por la cantidad de tarjetas que puede leer que son casi todas las existentes incluso Memory Sticks que muchos lectores ya no incluyen.El problema que le veo al lector son los siguientes:- Longitud del cable excesiva.- Material plástico de calidad media.- El sistema de entrada/salida de las tarjetas es sin 'clic' de posición por lo que la tarjeta puede moverse mientras descargas archivos de ella.- Conector usb-C solo apto para conexión a pc no a smartphones.- Precio algo elevado comparado con otros similares.Ventajas de este lector:- Acepta tarjetas "estándar" junto a otras como Compact Flash y Memory Stick.- Velocidad de transferencia usb 3.0.Un lector de tarjetas que no está mal pero que vale un par de euros que otros similares. No me acaba de convencer.
5,I got this mostly for transferring photos and videos from my camera SD card and 3D print files to a micro SD.It does the job spot on.  The cable is just a nice length so I can plug it into the rear of my tower PC and sit the adapter on top of the PC which keeps it handy and tidy.Card reading was seamless and fast.  Images and movies transfer at high speed via USB3 there is also a USBC adapter should you need that connection.  I even streamed an HD movie directly from the card no problems.The only issue I could see which is fairly obvious if you think about it is that you can only use one card slot at a time.  Not a problem as when you pull out a card and insert another it finds the new card immediately no problem.
5,Kleines kompaktes und äußerst praktisches Gerät das mit den meisten gängigen Speicherkarten klar kommt.Das Kabel ist  wertig und der Adapter auf USB-C macht das Gerät universell Einsetzbar. Der Kartenleser selbst macht einen guten und robusten Eindruck.Beim testen machte der Kartenleser einen sehr guten Eindruck die Speicherkarten wurden sofort erkannt und die Geschwindigkeit beim lesen/schreiben entsprach dem was die Karten leisten.Ein sehr guter Kartenleser den man durchaus weiter empfehlen kann.
5,Se trata de un lector de tarjetas USB C (realmente es USB 3.0 pero viene con un adaptador) para los formatos SD Micro SD Memory Stick y Compact Flash con la comodidad de que es plug-and-play. La carcasa es de plástico y parece de buena calidad.El funcionamiento es correcto con una Samsung Evo MicroSD llego a unos 95Mb/s idéntico resultado usando el lector MicroSD incorporado en mi Intel NUC. Las tarjetas se insertan y ya que no hay "click" para empujar para expulsar las tarjetas hay que estirar de ellas para sacarlas. Se puede conectar varias tarjetas al mismo tiempo y transferir archivos a ambas pero la velocidad se verá afectada.Hay un led que se enciende al insertar una tarjeta. Lo he probado en varios portátiles Windows y Apple además de un teléfono Samsung Galaxy S10+ y en todos ha funcionado sin problemas.
5,My old SD card reader became very temperamental because it had a removable cable so I thought I would try this one out. It’s USB 3 so quick to copy images and has a usb type A and C adapter so it works on PC MAC and even and iPad without extra dongles. As I use all three it’s great to have the flexibility in one device without the need for extra dongles.The device is extremely light so good for taking with you on the road but feels relatively well built I don’t see it breaking unless I stand on it. It has a soft textured plastic case which looks and feels good. The cable length is about 30cm so can reach from the back of a pc to the front but won’t go from the floor to the desk.Overall it’s a great device that does everything it needs to and just works!
3,Bonjour 🖖Voici un bon lecteur 4-en-1 qui a un gros défaut.Les ✅ du produit :✔️ 4 formats de cartes : micro SD SD compact flash et memory stick (Sony les cartes de PSP par exemple).✔️ Léger et plutôt compact.✔️ Excellents débits : sur une bonne carte micro SD j'ai atteint quasiment 90Mo/s en lecture et quasiment 80Mo/s en écriture sur un gros fichier.✔️ Pratique l'adaptateur USB A vers USB C.Les ⛔ du produit :❌ 4 lecteurs c'est bien mais 1 seul se monte à la fois sur mon Windows 10 Pro dommage peu pratique ça perd énormément de son intérêt.Bref bon lecteur avec de très bons débits mais 1 seule lecteur à la fois quel dommage.🎅 😺 LoloSasa 🎮 🎄
5,This 4 in one card reader is just what I was looking for I don't use SD cards too much but this reader works fine with a 64GB SD card in my mp3 player and moves data very quickly even faster than directly leaving the card in the player.  The unit itself is fairly large and made of quality plastic so will survive being bumped around in my laptop bag and the type-C connecter has a nice firm click when it connects to my Surface Go so highly recommended.
5,We have computers with only USB type A (about 5 years old) and newer ones with USB type C. The only inbuilt Card readers on two of the machines can only read SD Cards so I have to put TF Cards (MicroSD) into an SD Card Reader. I prefer this card reader as it reads TF (MicroSD) Cards in addition to SD Cards and two others I do not commonly use. It performs very well easily detected on any of our Computers.I recommend it.
5,Muchos pensarán que este tipo de productos ya están en el olvido pero quien necesite un lector de tarjetas lo mejor es disponer de uno que sea rápido.En este caso tiene compatibilidad con: SD Micro SD Compact Flash y Memory Stick y gracias a disponer de conexión USB 3.0 y venir acompañado de un adaptador de USB tipo C podemos asegurar una magnífica velocidad en transmisión y grabación de datos siempre teniendo en cuenta de la tarjeta que estemos insertando.El dispositivo es muy simple de utilizar no requiere de ningún driver conectar y listo. Al conectar el lector se encenderá un led de color azul que parpadeará para que tengamos conocimiento de que la unidad se encuentra leyendo o grabando.
5,A card reader that does the trick accepting SD Micro SD Compact Flash and something called a memory stick (MS).It conveniently also has a permanently attached USB-C and USB-A connection so you can switch as you need. Very helpful.It works looks as you'd expect and has a cheapish quality feel to it but then again it is plastic and only contains a circuit board so not reassuringly weighty in any way.Recommended for the price.
5,There are any number of devices like this at a similar price point and they tend to be largely similar. Variations in numbers of specific ports length of cable aside this one certainly did what I needed.With a Macbook air only having a USB-C connector this sorted out my immediate need to move files to and from SD cards I can't vouch for the other cards. What I will say is the fitting on this were good. Other devices I've tried haven't felt secure when plugged in (and this has a choice of fitting - see pic) this is robust and reliable. If I needed another I'd get one of these
5,Was ich sehr positiv finde ist das es ein USB-C und USB 3.0 Anschluss hat. So kann man es an neuen Geräten nutzen und auch an ältere Geräten. Man brauch dann kein Adapter.Das finde ich super gerade wenn man noch ein älteren iMac zu Hause hat.Der Kartenleser bietet hohen Datengeschwindigkeitszugriff auf 4 verschiedene Kartentypen die SD (Secure Digital) Micro SD (TF) MS (Memory Stick) und CF (Compact Flash). Hier hat man ein gutes Multifunktionsgerät mit gutem Preisleistungsverhältnis.
5,Sehr gut endlich habe ich einen problemlos arbeitenden Transport meiner Bilder aus der Camera auf mein Notebook. Anschluß USB-C passt auf die Idea-Pads von Lenovo (zB). Übertragungsrate ist klasse auch keine Aussetzer. Ich nutze SD und Micro-SD Karten der Adapter ist prima übersichtlich aufgebaut wertig verarbeitet ich bin sehr zufrieden.
5,A mi me ha salvado ya que la cámara reflex que utilizo lleva tarjeta compact flash y cada vez hay menos lectores para este tipo de tarjetas además mi cámara tienen un problema que no la puedo conectar por USB al ordenador...Este lector es muy bueno por eso tiene para tarjetas compact flash y también microSD SD y MemoryStick también puedes conectarlo mediante USB tipo C o mediante USB normal... Es muy completo para cualquier tipo de tarjeta.El cable es lo suficientemente largo.
4,Realizzato principalmente in plastica di buona qualità risulta compatibile con moltissimi sistemi e device. Presenta una connessione usb-a ed una usb-c 3.0 e riceve schede SD Micro SD MS e CF. Il cavo è discretamente lungo ed appare di discreta fattura.Il prodotto si presenta molto bene nella sua colorazione nero è discretamente compatto e molto leggero. E' dotato di un led di stato nella parte superiore. Molto buone le performance in trasferimento che raggiungono gli oltre 100mbps naturalmente la velocità è condizionata dalla velocità della scheda innestata.Avrei gradito la presenza di piedini in gomma sulla base a protezione delle superfici sulle quali si appoggia e per conferirgli una maggiore stabilità.Un prodotto ben fatto pratico e funzionale. Lo trovo veloce e versatile lo avrei gradito di dimensioni leggermente minori ma comprendo che il formato delle schede compatibili non permette di fare meglio. Corretto il rapporto qualità/prezzo. Consigliato!
5,my pc has regular usb ports but my laptop only has usbc/thunderbolt ports so this is excellent for using on both as the connector is dual format.it works really well fast and is detected right away by windows 10. looks good too!
5,Se trata de un lector de multiplex tarjetas muy facil de usar.No requiere instalación solo lo conectas y listo se puede conectar tanto por USB o Usb tipo C gracias al adaptador que trae en su cable.Puede ser muy útil o indispensable si usas un notebook y necesitas conectar diversas tarjetas ya que en la actualidad estos equipos son cada vez más delgados puede que necesites y no disponga de lector.Me parece recomendable se ve da calidad su cuerpo es de plastico bien acabado.
5,Der Kartenleser ist sehr preiswert macht einen guten Eindruck und funktioniert mit SD-Karte und Micro-SD ohne Probleme andere habe ich nicht probiert.Dazu praktischerweise die Möglichkeit für den Anschluss an USB und USB-C prima!Klare Kaufempfehlung!
5,Perfect card reader and the fastest I've ever used thanks to the USBC connector!There really isn't much to dislike. It comes with the appropriate cable that is rather long but not long enough that it would degrade the transfer rate.Surprisingly compact it will fit any laptop pocket or will tuck nicely away in a drawer.Very well made with a variety of card options it is unlikely you'll need anything else!Recommended!
5,Pues si buen producto puedes conectarlo a un puerto USB estándar 2/ 3.0 o Tipo-C.El conector USB del lector es version 3.0 si lo conectamos a una entrada 3.0 o Tipo-C la velocidad aumenta aunque tambien se puede conectar a un usb 2 si no teneis la version 3 ya que es compatible. El cable mide 50cm lo justo para que el dispositivo quede sentado sobre el escritorio.Admite un monton de tarjetas: Micro-SD Micro-SDHC Micro-SDXC SD-Card SDHC SDXC RS-MMC y Micro-MMC.Lo tengo puesto con Windows 10 y funciona bien supongo que en los demas sistemas funcionara tambien.
5,All my cards are UHS-I memory cards that have usually speeds around 100M/s read / write speed. I'm very satisfied that a £9.99 card reader can handle that. And most important for me was that I'm able to copy multiple cards at same time to my computer (SD and micro SD at same time) as my computer only have one slot for SD. That means half of my time I can spend for anything else important now.
5,Plugged this into our Windows 10 computer it worked straight away with no need for drivers..  Easy to read compact flash and SD cards and looked good against the computer.  It is quite compact and easy to carry with you..The only negative is that the lead that plugs into the computer is fixed to the adapter so it has to be quite close to the computer to be able to use.
3,Este lector de tarjetas está fabricado de plástico lo que le da un aspecto de menor calidad respecto a los que tienen un acabado de aluminio pero esto no debería de influir en sus prestaciones.El dispositivo se conecta mediante un cable provisto de conector USB-A de tipo fijo. Esto tiene el inconveniente que si se daña el cable perderemos el dispositivo. Para aumentar la compatibilidad se acompaña de un adaptador de USB-A a USB-C. En realidad dado que la velocidad de conexión del dispositivo se anuncia como USB 3.0 ya tenemos una capacidad de transmisión de 5Gbps superior a la velocidad de lectura y escritura de las tarjetas actuales.El dispositivo es reconocido de forma inmediata por el ordenador alíenos con las versiones de sistemas operativos más modernas. No es capaz de reconocer dos tarjetas de forma simultánea si bien esto no debiera de ser un problema.En cuanto al rendimiento es bastante pobre. Probando velocidades con una misma tarjeta de memoria entre este dispositivo y con otro similar de otro fabricante me he llevado una decepción. Con este dispositivo la tarjeta tiene unas tasas de escritura/lectura de 33/43 Mbps mientras que con el otro dispositivo las velocidades en igualdad de condiciones ha sido de 50/95 Mbps. He repetido la prueba varias veces dejando pasar días entre pruebas con distintas tarjetas y distintos ordenadores con resultados similares. Por tanto poco importa si es USB 3.0 o 2.0 los resultados no están a la altura.A favor diré que es un dispositivo estable y co lectura de CF menos frecuente en entornos domésticos que en el entorno profesional.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Vitesse de transfert respecter en USB-C et USB 3.0 c'est bluffant 😁.Lightroom les importes en un temps record.➡️ Multiport :Les plus connu et utilisé SD TF/micro sd. MS / CF plutôt pour la photographie sur les anciens model comme les canons 5d 12 etc ...➡️ Très bonne qualité.Assez léger .➡️ Câble d'environ 20 cm .➡️ Coté pratique :  Adaptateur USB-C / USB  qui reste accroché sur le câble.
5,Muy sencillo pero realmente práctico para visualizar desde la pantalla de la tablet las tarjetas SD de las Reflex es ideal porque igual se conectar a un PC/Mac por puesto USB que a un Smartphone Tablet o Android Box TV por puerto USB tipo C.Lee muchos formatos y es totalmente Plug & Play además de poderse llevar en un bolsillo sin problemas. Me ha resultado muy útil el aparatito y práctico pues hasta he podido ver el contenido de tarjetas CF que tenía en un cajón desde hace muchos años ya que lee SD/Micro SD/MS/CF.5 estrellas bien ganadas por su precio es ideal.
5,Der Speicherkartenleser ist super und funktioniert einwandfrei und tut das was er tun soll.Preis/Leistung gut.
5,J'ai pris ce lecteur de carte pour ma carte SD de mon appareil photo. Il fonctionne bien en lecture et écriture. La reconnaissance avec mon Windows 10 s'est faite dessuite. Je recommande!!!
5,Innanzitutto non costa uno sproposito!... non è particolarmente ingombrante ed è molto versatile visto che accetta i più comuni supporti di memorizzazione e si collega tanto ad USB-C che ad A.La velocità dichiarata per una volta non è uno specchietto per le allodole li fa davvero 100Mb al secondo di transfer! Chiaramente se si leggono o scrivono (o leggono e scrivono) più di una scheda per volta la velocità disponibile viene frazionata. Fa bene il suo lavoro!
5,Este lector de tarjetas está muy bien. Cumple con su función y posee buen precio. Muy recomendable
5,El producto se presenta dentro de una bolsa de plástico termosellado. Como es habitual la fabricación es china. La cracasa del lector es de plástico suficientemente robusto (tampoco va a estar sometido a tornsiones ni grandes esfuerzos). La doble posibilidad de conexión a otros dispositivos mediante USB/USB-C aumenta sus posibilidades .Su funcionalidad y eficiencia es buena con las tarjetas probadas con una respuesta rápida y sin fallos ni errores reconociéndolas sin problemas y con buen nivel de transmisión de datos .Muy polivalente eficiente aumenta la capacidad de los dispositivos a los que se adapte.
5,Lettore per schede fotografiche di quattro tipi SD MicroSD cf MFDotato di presa USB e tipo COttimo rapporto qualità prezzo
4,This Chinese made BENFEI 4in1 USB USB-C to SD Micro SD MS CF Card Reader Adapter these day is a must have item if you have digital cameras... Since there are so many memory card types and some of the latest fast ones not necessarily work in older readers.The housing of the card is very cheap looking black plastic but for a change the USB3 cord is of adequate length of about 18" and has the regular USB3 and the USB C (thunderbolt) adapter which makes connection easily with your laptop/desktop. Thus for the cost it is a good product if you can over look the cheap look. As an added benefit comes with an 18 month warranty.
4,Kopierar till dator
5,Easy to use and like that it also controls the usb C connector which is becoming very popular because you can't put it in backwards.
5,Plug and play great speed reliable!Outside of box feels and look high quality!
5,Toppen
5,There is nothing I disliked about this product. All is good!
5,I just bought it for Micro SD fast delivery and works well.
5,works great
5,Good connection cards good deep inside and when it falls the cards still inside and didn't break
5,Efter anslutning av minneskortläsaren fungerar allt på en gång till min fulla belåtenhet. Den är dessutom väldigt billig.
5,Works great! :D
