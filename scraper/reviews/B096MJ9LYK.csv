4,I like the camera and enjoy having something very small to throw in my bag when traveling. The camera needs a case because the white body picks up stains scuffs dirt quickly. Be careful cleaning-- the selfie mirror's iridescent coating wipes off with windex. Compared to Fujifilm Instax which my partner owns more expensive per shot (so more expensive to get familiar with the camera).This film *does not* do well in heat. Visited Arches National Park (105F/40.5C +) and was disappointed to find that the entire pack got too hot before the first snap. All the exposures were washed out and pink. Fujifilm Instax film in the same luggage same storage conditions did not have the same issue-- photos were clear and crisp  not over exposed not pink.Indoor exposures are soft but the photo develops nicely. Outdoor exposures are easy to accidentally flash the film but pulling out the film inside a purse is an easy fix.
4,Good picture
4,Supposed to have 5 packs only came with 4.
5,Works great just wish I could get them for a cheaper price but I like it very much
5,Bought this for my granddaughter for our Tennessee and I‚Äôm glad I got the extra pack because she was taking so many pictures
3,I tried several different things to get the film to try to take a better picture but all of them were just too dark I tried all the film to make sure and they all were dark I got one ok photo out of two cartridges There‚Äôs not many settings on the little go camera so I tried everything nothing worked possibly old film? No clue
3,Picture quality was as expected but one of the film cartridges was completely unusable and I was very disappointed as these are not easy to find in stores.
5,Excelente!
2,The used like new option is poor quality. These must have been stored improperly or damaged with time. The photos turn out blotchy and dark.
5,These pictures come out pretty nicely! I recommend leaving the picture developing under the tongue of the camera for a bit so that it develops nicely before risking any scratches from removing it from the tongue since it is a little rough.
5,Our grandson loves these but the quality of the pictures is not great. It could be that it is the camera and not the film that's the problem.
5,This is good I wish they have more pics in it. But still a good buy
5,My Girl was so happy with
5,Happy with my film!
5,Great instant pictures to hand out to everyone at the Christmas party.
5,So my only issue was packaging was damaged in delivery process but pictures are fine.
3,Expensive and only exposes in a circle in the middle. Not the whole thing
3,I had bought this and was wrong fit for my camera.
5,Bought for my little Polaroid and they work just fine. Pictures come out good.
5,Thank you always good
1,All of the film is damaged and none of the pictures are showing up. I bought them in bulk thinking I‚Äôd be saving money and I actually just wasted it all ü•≤
2,One pack was ok. A bit too yellow To Be Honest. The second pack came out with creamy stuff and damaged film. Wtf expensive film should not do this.
1,All the films I received are close to expiring while these films are supposed to be used within 12 months of production‚Ä¶
1,Many of the pictures came out with white lines. The initial cardboard piece that's supposed to come out first was stuck so the film wouldn't work. We even tried 2 cameras.
1,i ordered a double pack film and it ain‚Äôt come with a double pack it just came with one
1,These are miniature and won‚Äôt even fit in my camera. Please see photo. Box on the left is these and box on the right is the ones that actually go into the camera.
1,It doesn‚Äôt matter whether the pictures are take. Inside or out the quality is horrible. I bought this for an event which means I did t try to open right away now I‚Äôm pissed because I got on Amazon to initiate the return and have missed the deadline so now I‚Äôm stuck with $1100 worth of useless film and a terrible camera
1,These were mini sized does not fit in my camera at all total waste of money I took a chance with mixed reviews but I'll just be going straight to walmart for them
1,Product was damaged and was not usable. Only one cartridge was good to use.
1,I bought this item new.  But the film package was already opened upon receiving.  Really disappointing!
1,Dark pictures even in lighted areas
1,Wrong camera film it did not fit
4,The package of film arrived open and the box was a little smashed. The stickers inside were missing. We were afraid the film was ruined but it did work.
1,This was very disappointing wouldn‚Äôt purchase again
5,The size is everything.I love taking this camera to parties and having these small Polaroid pics strung up everywhere‚Ä¶ in ‚Äúreal time.‚ÄùThese are perfect for personalized DIY gifts and projects too.
5,Good camera with good quality. Be prepared to spend coin on the replacement film. Over all happy with the product.
5,Bought these because these are the only film that fit the polaroid camera.
4,I bought 4 films and ALL FOUR we're expired.  Definitely not good business ethic. 1 mistake maybe but FOUR of the same mistake is intentional doing. Very disappointed....  After emailing the company they informed me that the date on the box is the production date with a year to expire... Great buy
5,Got this for someone as a gift and they liked it cause it had the black frame.
5,Bueno
5,Numero considerevole di ricariche Polaroid
4,Sul prodotto nulla da dire pellicole istantanee per la Polaroid Go le foto non saranno mai perfette perch√© l'ottica della Polaroid Go lascia abbastanza a desiderare per√≤ il fascino dell'unicit√† della fotografia a sviluppo istantaneo rimane. La cornice nera √® un'alternativa elegante al classico bianco.La lamentela che faccio invece √® sulle condizioni in cui ricevo ogni volta questo prodotto con la scatola schiacciata e deformata. Le pellicole hanno sempre funzionato ma poi succeder√† che lo schiacciamento che subisce il pacco porter√† alla rottura del cartdrige.Cercate di fare attenzione e maneggiare con pi√π cura i pacchi.Grazie.
4,ACQUISTATO PER ERRORE VALUTER√≤ IL RESO. NON MONTA SU POLAROID NOW. SERVIZIO AD OGNI MODO PUNTUALE.
1,Just started using these photos in my polaroid while on vacation. All the photos inside are ruined every picture we take turns white. I think we got a bad batch!
4,La verdad que esta muy bien por que en un pack tienes varios paquetes pero podrian ponerle un precio mas competitivo ya que te sale igual o mas caro que si los compras sueltos aqui ya es comodidad y poco mas
