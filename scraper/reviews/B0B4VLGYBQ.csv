5,I purchased this right after getting my new iPhone 14 and the new AirPods. I’m not a huge fan of charging docks like this but with the MagSafe charging o just had to give it a try. And it’s at the perfect price point too!It charges fast charges my watch and AirPods case and doubles as a night light when I need to get up from the bed and don’t want to wake up anyone in the room!Once my significant other upgrades her phone I’ll be buying another one!
5,I’m not one to write reviews but I was in the hunt for reliable charging station I had purchased one before and literally only lasted 3 months before it stopped working and then his by far has been amazing super easy to set up and charging all my Apple products over night have never been easier without having to have my phone watch and ear buds all plugged in at the same time! Definitely recommend!
5,This charging station is really great. It looks nice and its a nice addition to my desk. What I really like about it is that it has a light that goes three ways and off so if you want a little light on you can. If you like it dark then you can shut it off entirely. It holds my phone nicely and my watch which is apple 7. It doesn’t ding it sticks right on and charges quickly. I really really love this it’s pretty and very very functional five stars!
5,I have a iPhone 12 with a thin clear plastic case. It holds against the magnet ok and charges fine. My Apple Watch series 8 charges fine and no issues charging my AirPod Pro (2nd gen).In all cases I think plugging a cable into the phone and AirPods directly would be faster But I think that would always be the case no matter what magnetic charger you are using.
5,This is the perfect setup for my Apple devices. I have the new iPhone 14 max pro and it fits perfectly with my magnetic phone case. The magnetic phone charger is very strong and attaches easily! The convenience of being able to charge my iPhone Apple Watch and AirPods one one area without 3 different chargers is a game changer! Buy this you won’t regret it!
5,I bought multiple chargers in one month that said they could charge all three and this was the first one that could. It doesn’t matter what kind of case you have on your phone like most chargers if it magnetic it won’t charge but with this charger it will.  Chargers quickly and the little night light is a nice feature.  I absolutely love this charger!
5,Does exactly as it states. Night light is very bright when you need it to be. Charging is super fast for watch and phone. Haven’t tried yet for pods. Only issue can be that the phone has to be at the exact right spot for it not to slide off periodically. Once you realize the sweet spot it is perfect!
5,Being able to charge all your devices with one charger is great enough of itself add to that it has fast charging too? So impressed with this product I bought another for my girlfriend as well. Tried a few others but they didn’t provide fast charging happy to say this charger hit the nail on the head
5,A great value having an 18w power brick included. Only one USB-C cable coming out the back keeps things nice and organized. The magnets on the iPhone and Apple Watch charger are nice and strong. Charges my phone watch and AirPods quickly and effortlessly. The bonus nightlight feature is pretty cool too. Overall worth every penny.
5,Awesome charger! Can charge phone watch and air pods. The air pod spot can also charge a phone. The only issue is that the base is a little light. It could use a little more weight to stabilize the charger when the phone is on it.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 if you own an Apple phone then odds your battery is low at this moment. This device will charge 3 ios devices at once and fast too.  All 3 chargers can work simultaneously without robbing power from one another. I find that a phone with a smooth case backing will charge just fine on this device. If your phone case is not completely smooth and has raised ridges you may want to switch it out.  The case for your earbuds can rest at the base of this charger and get some good charging or you can simply place another apple phone on that same spot. Your smartwatch as long as its an apple product should charge up just as good on here too.This charging station really does look sleek and modern in overall appearance and should display nicely on your desk or nightstand. Really helps to manage the amount of cords you have to deal with as well. There is a light too at the base which enables you to see where everything is when you wake up super early before the sun like I do. Don't have to fumble around for my devices in the dark or turn on a main light and disturb my slumbering spouse.
5,I went through several of these type chargers and ended up with 2 of these. The magnet is strong the charge speed to very good the layout is perfect. This is the best of the 3-way chargers I have found for my iPhone 14 AirPods and Apple Watch.
4,This is the perfect setup for my Apple devices. I have the new iPhone 14 pro and it fits perfectly with my magnetic phone case. The magnetic phone charger is very strong and attaches easily! The convenience of being able to charge my iPhone Apple Watch and AirPods one one area without 3 different chargers is a game changer! Buy this you won’t regret it!
5,This charger works well! It came packaged nicely and charges my Apple Watch and phone quickly. I use it overnight and have no issues with battery in the morning. The stand is not bully and sits well on my nightstand.
5,I was pleasantly surprised at how fast this charges my iPhone 13 Pro Max.  Way faster than the cord provided by Apple.  I love the little light at the bottom as it comes in handy in the dark mornings.  I couldn't be happier with my purchase and it was a great price!I also use it with my Apple Watch 7 and my Air Pods - they all charge incredibly fast.
5,Supports most enabled wireless charging devices such as iPhones AirPods and many other Samsung or google products (complete list in description). This fast wireless charging dock has advanced Qi CE RoHS and FCC certifications to provide a safe charging experience. There are also plenty of cooling holes in the back making charging cool and safer.Perfect length and even has a magnetic hold which allows you to adjust the angle freely without deviating from the charger center making entertainment freer. I hated the ones that made it impossible to use your phone while charging. The magnetic feature is what drew me to this specific product. My apple watch phone and AirPods can charge all at once making it easy to keep a full charge when traveling. Slick clean white color option too!
4,Awesome charger for the phone and a nice night light on the stand as well. Unfortunately the watch charger does not hold the watch very well and the Apple Watch will fall off.
5,This is amazing! It charges fast has an incredibly strong magnet!  The light has a bright and easy to turn on/off! Would recommend to everyone!
5,I love that it charges super fast and that the led light has different settings so you can see better with little light or more light. Everything charges great on it.
5,It is a small but good charging station for all iPhones. The iPhone 13 Mini fits well too. The Night light looks very good and the build quality is decent. I like the look of the white station. It's not too big so travel should be easy too but it is not foldable. The Design is great and the AirPod charging works with other 3rd party products fine too.I can recommend this Station.
5,I was skeptical purchasing this as I am with all electronics. This has succeeded all of my expectations and I plan to purchase 2 more for my kiddos!! Highly recommend!
5,Love the fact that I can just put my phone on it and not have to fumble around trying to get the perfect spot for it to change right!
5,Everything as described - fast charger and convenient for watch phone and AirPods.  Felt heavy enough to feel quality but not too heavy or bulky.  Would order again.
5,This works perfectly with my iPhone 14 pro max. Even strong enough to hold it up in the case. It also looks cool sitting on my beside table
5,The white one was glitchy so I returned it for the black one. Works great and is perfect for de-cluttering my night stand.
5,This charging station is just what I needed to combine the charging of my Apple Devices.  My iPhone 12 fits perfectly on the phone charger and I do not have to remove the silicon Apple brand case for it.  My Apple Watch chargers nicely on the watch charger.  I have not used it for traveling yet but I play to because it is lightweight and will easily fit in a carry on bag.  Highly recommend.
5,This charger has made my life a little easier and not as cluttered. Plus my wife likes how it looks instead of all the cables by the bed.
5,it is very good for me so far. I can charge 3 items at the same time and the night light is helpful.
5,The charger is perfect for de cluttering my stand. The only thing is that the USB port on mine was made too small to fit any usb devise. Other that that the charger is perfect for what I need and I was very impressed that it charges my maker wireless headphones. I highly recommended this product.
5,Love how I can charge everything in 1 spot.  Must have magnetic case on phone for this to work as it should
5,Great product. Takes all the wires off my night stand. Love the little night light helps for late night finds without disturbing my wife.
5,Product works as advertised.  I use this to charge my devices overnight so speed of charge is not really an issue for me.
5,Great all in one charging system. I only have an iPhone X so I cannot speak about the mag safe part of the charger. I do use the QI part of the charger for my phone. I bought this one so when I do decide to upgrade to an iPhone 13 I’ll be all set. The charger charges my AirPods Pro as well as my iwatch 7 all while keeping my nightstand  looking much less cluttered. Would definitely recommend!
5,Well its not expensive and it's worth every penny its charge well i like the material and overall great product
5,Holds the phone tight and secure fast charge charges all my devices. Buying one for my husband.
5,I enjoy the styling and functionality. Charges all of my devices while cleaning up my desktop.
5,This charging station is attractive and it does a nice job charging my iPhone AirPods and Apple Watch!
5,No complaints about this charger. The light has different settings too.
5,I really like how easy it is to use
5,The charger is great. Only thing I see bad is that my AirPods case gets hot after charging
5,Simplistic design easy to use and great value for money. Purchased for my wife to keep her phone and watch charged. She loves that it is so easy to use it also eliminates the extra cables needed for multiple devices
5,Its really convenient you can charge your phone watch and hand free all at once with good speed. I set it up on my office desk and the that can work as a phone stand too. Love it
5,I went from having cords everywhere to a simplify sleeping area pass the night light fantastic
5,Love this! It works great for my phone and watch!
5,I love the built in light
5,Works exactly as described. Very well built and charges great! Would recommend!
5,Makes charging my iPhone 13 and my Iwatch series 7 a whole lot easier it clears out all of the wires on my nightstand it charges fast doesn’t over heat like others and it comes with a build in night light…Best decision ever worth the money spent
5,Works great and convenient
5,Easy to use and set up!
5,Me encanto el producto es pequeño bonito y no pesa nada. Una de las cosas por cual me decidí por este producto es que a pesar de su tamaño tiene otras maneras de poder cargar otros electrónicos y su luz ajustable. No creo que lo usaría en mis viajes porque su forma es un poco incómoda de manejar para llevarlo dentro de una maleta pero por lo demás excelente!
5,Works great magsafe is strong apple watch stays on and if you aren’t charging airpods you can put another device on. night light is a cool feature too.
5,Does what it’s supposed to do.
5,Fits perfectly on my nightstand. Charges all my devices perfectly!
5,
5,Looks great. Like the night light feature
5,Works great!
5,Great product
4,I don’t like that the night light keeps turning on by itself. I keep turning it off only to come back on by it’s self
5,Easy to use great value
4,I like the charging it’s quick too but the light keeps changing the dimming on its own. Other than that it’a good one. 👍
5,Easy to use. Works great.
5,Works exactly as advertised
5,Perfect
5,This is a great addition to my desk!Overall great quality for the price.- Made of solid plastic.  Not flimsy.- Strong Magnets for my iphone and apple watch.- Great led light and the extra USB outputs are very useful for me.
5,It's sturdy and well made. Gets the job done for a reasonable price if not a tad high. I'd buy it again for friends or family.
5,I love the design of the gadget because it doesn’t take up much space. Now I don’t have to scatter my devices to charge. They all can charge in one spot. Best money ever spent!
5,I’ve been searching high and low for a magnetic charger with enough power to quick charge my iphone12 pro watch and earbuds and think I found it. This charger looks great and has some oomph. The nightlight and built in magnets are a nice touch since it frees up your Apple Watch charger. Worth a try!
4,Only downside is being light. Be careful not to hit accidentally. All tech specs are good
5,This product charges my phone AirPods and Apple Watch all at once. Although you could charge them separately this takes requires much less effort and you can avoid having low battery on your devices. I also like clean and sleek design.
5,I really like the unique look of this charging station more than the rest of the other ones on Amazon. Especially in the white/off-white color it really stands out on your bedside table or on your desk!
5,Strong Magnet the light is a nice glue the whole unit is a little bit heavy so it doesn’t slide. We charge two phones in a watch. It works very well
5,Awesome charger. Light is nice.
5,Product just arrived today but seems good - charges all well!
4,
5,Charger works really well and I like the fact that you can charge a phone on the base as well as the magnetic stand.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I really liked this 5 in 1 Wireless Charging station.It is truly wireless I mean you don’t have to hookup your watch charging cable into the stand. It is perfect for decluttering my nightstand. No messy wires no multiple chargers plus a convenient stand that organizes all my devices properly in one place while saving space.The charging times are also satisfactorily fast.It even has a built in night light with 3 levels of brightness plus it has an additional USB-A port that you can use to connect and power another device.I am very happy with this product and my purchase. I do see that the phone charging pad says it’s only for iPhone 12/13 series but I’m hoping it will support future generations of iPhones (beyond 13) as I expect all future iPhones to have the magnetic charging ability.
5,Easy to use. Quick charge.
5,Fuerte sencillo excelente 👌 carga rápida ⚡️Hermoso diseño! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
5,Just attach to magnet and leave . Fast charging . Easy to use .
5,Works like a charm! Holds all my Apple toys.Make sure you don’t have a case that’s too thick.
5,It looks great and sturdy
5,Great product!
5,Love that I can get rid of all my extra cords and have one.
5,The best charging station in the market.
5,The magnet that holds the phone could be a little bigger.
5,It was nice looking/ compact and only 1 plug .  nice for my iphone i watch and ear spuds
5,Highly recommend. Super strong magnet
5,Me encanta porque tiene luz gradual y puedes dejarla toda la noche.
5,I like it however my iPhone x doesn't stay put.  I'm hoping when I upgrade my phone the magnet will be strong enough to hold it.
5,Works perfect!
5,It Might Not Charge My AirPods Series 1 But it is an amazing and fast charger. Also very convenient. It also has another porch so you can charge other things like portable chargers etc.
3,Overall this station has a nice design. The materials dont seem sturdy enough but they look nice.I have been having an issue with it where the night light feature turns on by itself. I dont know why this happened .
5,Fired this up on my bed side table for charging my phone and watch at night.Very fast charging and the night light with 4 adjustable levels is nice too.
5,Great product. It charges with my otter box defender case still on the phone which was something I was worried about. I highly recommend this charger and will be buying other one for my office.  Highly recommended
5,
5,
5,Single cable for whole unit charges 3 devices at the same time. I use it to hold my phone there next to my bed while charging it in a call with friends.
5,
5,Charging station works great. Space saver as well.
5,Setting it up was a breeze and in 1 minute I was on. Love the leaf-like design!! Very elegant edges!!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Definitely a good base with a slim and clean design and with a nice light. The light has control and it really chargers fast. Already bought one more for my brother amazing! The magnets are also really good quality
5,Great! The quality is very rich and I LOVE how it’s magnetic. The adjustable light is awesome too! Could be a night light honestly!
5,Product look so good and able to charge 3 items at a time.I would definitely refer to my friends and family
5,Great device.. if I got a chance will order it again ultra fast charging
5,I love being able to charge three items at the same time
2,This is a nice looking charging station but the nightlight function turns on constantly without anything touching the charger which is annoying to constantly have to turn it off or have a flashing light randomly in the dark returning this.
2,I wanted to love this. It looked good but the magnet is kind of weak.
2,Doesn’t support MagSafe as shown in pictures
2,The phone charger works but the watch and headphone chargers do not.
1,We bought 2 of these (my husband one and I bought another one). One overheated and almost caused a fire (see picture attached). Also damaged the furniture that was underneath. After what happened we don’t feel confident with keeping the other. Also it has a sticker that states it works with iPhone 12 & 13 and it’s advertised for 14 too.
1,not charge iPhone 13 and Apple Watch 7 at the same time it only charges 1 at a timethe led light turns on by itself
1,Charger came fine but it will not charge two things at once. At night I put both my phone and AppleWatch in their correct spots and only the watch would charge or the phone would charge. Not both at the same time like the product description.
5,I bought this to get rid of all the cords. I was surprised how well it works. Looks great has a night light and charges all my devices no problem. All my adult children want one now.
5,Works perfectly and as advertised
5,Perfect for charging multiple devices
5,I love it it fits on my desk perfectly really love that it’s magnetic and just really holds your phone or watch!! This is a must have!!
5,Works as expected. Definitely recommend
5,Works as described. I will update if anything changes.
5,I absolutely love this charger because I hated having to fumble around with cords looking for the right charger for both iPhone and watch. I haven’t charged my AirPods on it yet but I’m sure it will do an amazing job on those as well.
5,The charging station is well built and saves a lot of space on my desk with only one wire instead of three! The led light is a nice bonus! I really like it. It charges my iPhone 14 pro fast and does not get hot comparing to my old wireless charging pad.
4,Had a problem with the charging of my watch and the next day it was the phone. Contacted the source and they sent another immediately. I do love this charger as its clean looking without cords.
5,Instead of bringing a lot of cords on my recent vacation I just bought this one charging device. The built in nightlight was very nice to have being in a new room!!
4,This has been a great charger for both my phone and my watch. Only thing I wish was different was that it was either heavier or had some sort of way to attach to the nightstand. I find myself going to grab my phone and it will fall over if I don't hold onto the charger. I do like that the magnet is so strong though. Overall I am very happy with this purchase.
5,All around great charger no problem charging multiple devices! Don’t hesitate purchase it!
5,This charging station is best quality of wireless chargers I have used in recent times ready to useI recommend this product to all tech geeks.
5,This charging station is amazing. The magnets are plenty strong to hold all the items charging firmly in place. Nice steady charge and rhe accent light is a nice added touch.
5,Le chargeur charge très bien mon iPhone 13 Pro ainsi que mes AirPods Pro. De plus si vous avez une coque compatible MagSafe l'iPhone tient bien au support.La puissance n'est que 7.5W pour la recharge de l'iPhone car il faut une certification MFI pour avoir la recharge rapide de 15W. On ne trouve cela que sur les chargeurs de 15 0€ minimum. Celui-ci est très bien pour le prix. J'ai plutôt acheté un chargeur filaire pour la recharge rapide.
5,This is a fabulous little gadget charges all my Apple devices and is a night stand to boot.  Can't comment on the nightlight as I can't use this however the magnetic pads for the watch and phone hold firm and there is an AirPod case shaped indentation on the base which although not magnetic seems to work perfectly.  As I use all my Apple devices at the same time throughout the day it is so handy to be able to charge them all from the one stand with only 1 socket required a great buy if you own all three.
4,Support simple mais pratique. On peut télécharger la montre et le téléphone en même temps en plus d’un autre objet connecté. La lumière est plutôt cool (3 intensités différentes) mais parfois le tactile ne fonctionne pas bien… Seule manière de remettre tout en ordre débrancher et rebrancher. Sinon RAS.
5,Sur ma table de nuit depuis 3 semaines ce chargeur répond parfaitement à mes attentes avec un prix bien moins élevé que les produits concurrents (j'ai aussi un modèle acheté en boutique Apple).Je n'ai aucune réserve.
5,The magnet is very strong and holds onto my iPhone for dear life charging is a tad slow but that was expected I tend to use it overnight anyway and the light is a neutral white which has 3 brightness options which goes with the room decor aswell as the white coloured casing very well designed piece of kit! I haven’t tried the watch charging station as of yet but I know that will be fine has a spare usb port at the back for if you need to charge something that doesn’t support wireless charging and it also has a lower powered wireless charging station on the bottom part of the stand!
5,Après quelques jours d'utilisation je trouve ce charge globalement bien.J'avais des soucis de charge de ma montre avec un autre modèle de chargeur d'une autre marque pas chère (il coupait tout le temps la charge) avec ce chargeur nickel. Ma montre a retrouvé un cycle de charge normal et ne passe plus toute la nuit à s'allumer et s'éteindre. L'aimant pour la montre est un peu light mais ne gène pas pour une utilisation normale.La charge pour mon iPhone et les AirPods fonctionne nickel et l'iPhone ne bouge pas d'un pouce une fois sur le support !Le petit plus est la lumière dans le socle bien pratique pour lire le soir sans déranger ma moitié.
5,Totalement conquis par cet achat.🤩🤩  Cela fait 2 semaines que je l’utilise toutes les nuits.C'est très pratique de pouvoir charger son iPhone son iWatch et ses AirPods par simple induction sans avoir tous les câbles qui traînent…De plus le chargeur USB-C est fourni avec. Le chargement est assez rapide. La veilleuse est pratiqueJe vais en acheter une 2eme pour l’offrir 😄
5,This product is superb. Its slick leaf shaped design fits really well on my bedside cabinet. So much better than all the wires i was using to plug in my phoneheadphone and watch. Whats brilliant is that i dont have to chose what i charge. I can charge it all at the same time.  Its super speedy charging is so convenient. I can even attach the phone with its case on and hasn't  fallen off. I would totally recommend this product. I looked at quite a few and this is a very reasonable price. Good qualityPackaged well and swift delivery
4,Très bon produit pour pouvoir recharger tous ses pareille sur le même chargeurLe bloc d’alimentation fournit est pas de très bonne facture mais remplacé par un autre que j’avais deja
5,Un stand de charge sans fil qui est vraiment bien construit et stable il fait solide et robuste (non pliable).Universel il peut charger les téléphones Apple ou Android à concurrence de 15W (compatible sur tous les paliers induction 5W 75W 10W)Il est livré avec un câble USB-C et avec un adaptateur secteur et ce point est important car pour assurer une charge rapide il faut adaptateur en QC 3.0 (18W) pour délivrer cette puissance globale. Avec un simple adaptateur il ne délivrera que de la charge standard sous 5W.Il pourra charger une Apple Watch et en dessous des Aipods ce qui en fait un support plutôt dédié au possesseurs de produits Apple.Je l'utilise avec un iPhone 13 Pro Max sans aucun problème et il me convient très bien car ces autres charge ne prennent pas de place inutile comme certains il reste fin et étroit donc peut se placer facilement sur un bureau ou ailleurs.En bref un stand de charge rapide avec une bonne fabrication et une belle finition stable et solide avec le bon adaptateur secteur inclut malgré tout un bémol : le prix un peu élevé mais pas de déception.
5,J'ai commandé ce produit pour le nouvel iPhone 14 pro et charger ma montre Apple Watch. Le produit est parfait le téléphone tiens très bien et la montre également. Le produit très esthétique et la lumière sont très sympas pour une chambre.Je recommande sans hésitation ce produit de très bonne qualité.
4,Le produit est top il correspond parfaitement à mes attentes. J’ai juste retiré une étoile car je n’obtiens pas un chargement à 100% pour mon téléphone (iphone13) mais ça ne me dérange pas. La fonction magsafe fonctionne parfaitement. Si vous cherchez un chargeur 3en1 n’hésitez plus il est parfait.
5,I bought this item for my new iPhone 14 Pro but I also own airpods and an Apple Watch.It’s a nice modern and sophisticated charging station which is a must have purchase for someone who owns such items.Charging is brilliant and fast with the provided plug and I love the LED ring around the base which can be adjusted for brightness to your liking.Would definitely recommend picking this over others on Amazon.
4,This looks good and works as intended. Only annoying thing is a faint electrical buzz when not charging.
5,Utilisation facile un seul branchement pour 5 appareils IPHONE c'est le TOP. en plus le design est top!
5,Conquis par cet achat. Cette station en plus d’être esthétique permet de charger en même temps jusqu’à quatre objets en même temps. Il est très agréable de pouvoir charger son iPhone son iWatch et ses AirPods par simple induction. La recharge est très efficace. La petite veilleuse en supplément est très pratique.
5,Produit utilisé à des fins professionnelles.Satisfaite car gain de place et multiples charges simultanées.Bon design et fonctionnel.Je recommande.
5,Chargeur parfait pour un Iphone 13 avec le chargeur induction le téléphone reste droit et ne bouge pas tout au long de la nuit associé à cela le chargeur pour Apple Watch et Airpods qui est vraiment bien pensé.Le plus de ce produit reste la petite led en 3 intensités qui permette d'avoir une petite lumière tamisée avant d'aller se coucher.Je recommande vivement ce produit :)
5,Je l’utilise pour charger mon téléphone  ma montre et mes air pod la nuit . C est très pratique de pouvoir tout charger en même temps !
5,Exactly what I wanted and workding well.Strong magsafe locks my phone to it (with the apple magnetic case fitted to my iPhone 13 pro) and it charges it well. Watch locks on well enough to the watch charger. I haven't got airpods so haven't tested that. The nightlight is an excellent addition too.
5,Le chargeur remplace un ancien qui avait du mal a charger l'apple watch. Avec celui-ci la montre peut enfin faire des cycle complet de chargement sans interruptions.
5,Chargeur utilisé pour iPhone 13  pro max Apple Watch 6 et air pod pro. Utilisé pour une recharge la nuit. Tout fonctionne parfaitement  Pas de chauffe exagérée constatée. Le chargeur est joli bien fini et respire la qualité.Seuls petits défauts :  lumière trop juste pour lire confortablement et prise qui paraît fragile.
5,After purchasing my first charging station from this company I was pleasantly surprised at how good the product is! Does what it says & has a super sleek design. I did encounter a slight problem that being the device had an indentation of a scratch on it. I then made the company aware to then be told they would replace my product instantly and it came in a couple of days!The customer service is outstanding & quick. If you’re looking for a charging station buy this one! You won’t regret it.
4,La charge est un peu plus lente qu’un chargeur rapide.
5,Pour les personnes travaillant sur un bureau c’est vraiment un produit idéal pour recharger tous ces appareils sans s’en rentre compte !
5,Parfait pour charger la nuit mes devices.Et le petit tour lumineux est très pratique.
5,Très bon style. Plus besoin de se tracasser la tête pour charger les différents appareils que ce soit pour l’iPhone l’Apple watch ou les AirPods tout se fait sur ce même produit. De plus si on veut utiliser l’iPhone sans les mains rien de plus facile. Il suffit de le placer sur l’emplacement prévu à cet effet et même si le chargeur est débranché il tient tout seul.
5,Si vous avez le combo Iphone-AirPod-Apple watch cet article est parfait :)Je l'utilise depuis quelques jours et j'en suis totalement satisfait.ça vous permet d'éviter 'utilisation de multiplue cable qui pendouille autour de votre lit et le design et sympathique.Tout petit reproche la lumière aurait pu être un tout petit peut plus puissant mais c'est déjà très bien.Bien évidement les apareilles tous brancher se recharge un tout petit peu moins vite mais ça ne dérenge pas.
5,J’ai choisi ce produit car je cherchais une station de charge pour mes AirPods iPhone X et mon Apple Watch.Pour le moment je ne peux pas utiliser le support magsafe mais j’envisage iPhone 14 alors j’espère que ce sera compatible.En-tout-cas facile à installer charge parfaite de mes appareils.Pour mon iPhone X j’utilise toujours le câble car sur le support sans fil à plat le moindre mouvement le déconnecte et le matin tu te retrouve avec le téléphone qui n’a pas chargé. (pour ceux comme moi qu’il l’utilise sur une table de chevet)Globalement très satisfait du produit.
5,Fantastic charger.  the pass-through is a great extra so whilst I charger my 14 Pro headphones and watch I can also power my Macbook.  I love it
5,Good does the job well. My other half is to get a matching pair so I did but only after she’d tried out hers first. So far no complaints. Will set it all up nicely on both sides over the next week and monitor the charging etc but certainly a nice piece.
5,Ich bin begeistert. Verrichtet seinen Dienst und sieht auch noch gut aus!
5,très bon produit une qualité de matériel au déçût de mon espérance très pratique sur une table de nuit évite que les câble traine de partout un très bon rapport qualité - prix
5,I love how elegant this stand looks and the fact that I can charge my iphone watch and apple pro ear buds at the same time makes for very neat charging solution. I like the addition of the night light and this is the most stylish charger I have ever owned.
5,Looks exactly as in the picture and seems to work (so far) as described charges 3 devices phone watch and AirPods all together on one wire the added lamp in the device is a bonus.

5,I’ve been looking for an all in one charging station for a while and this ticked all the boxes keeps my night stand tidy and the night light with 3 levels of brightness works very well!
5,Ce produit a un beau design. Finitions OK et jusqu’à présent fonctionne très bien.Les aimants sont bons même si celui de l’Apple Watch aurait mérité d’être un peu plus puissant.
5,Un chargeur efficace pour faire charger mon iPhone est ma montre en même temps.Sert aussi de liseuse le soir
5,Base de recharge conforme à la photo ne prend pas trop de place.Très pratique puisqu'un seul câble permet de tout recharger en même temps mon téléphone ma montre et mes écouteurs .

5,Je trouve pratique de recharger mon iphone mon apple watch et mes écouteurs sur un même support très satisfait !!!
3,Superbe produit emballage correct et bien protéger. Lampe Led ne fonctionne plus au bout de 3 fois d’utilisations à des moments différents.Pas eu le temps de tester la puissance de la charge.

5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Charge mon Apple Watch mon iPhone 12 et mes AirPods Pro sans problème. Je mettrai a jour ce commentaire après 1 mois de charge en replaçant mon câble pour l'état de la batterie.Les Leds sont pratiques pour une lampe de chevet et les 3 niveaux sont parfaits.Le stand est plutôt esthétique et semble solide a voir avec le temps.
3,La station a un désigne agréable et fait le job en ce qui concerne la charge j'apprécie l'éclairage LED dans le pied dommage qu'il n'y ait qu'une seule couleur blanc. Je ne met que 3 étoiles pour 2 raisons l'aimant de la partie charge Apple Watch est un peu faible la montre se stabilise légèrement inclinée et lorsque le smartphone est en place (aimant correct) l'équilibre de la station est limite j'ai un iPhone 13 Pro Max.

2,La charge de l’Apple Watch est pas fiable j’ai laissé charger plusieurs fois mais sans succès… vraiment dommage car l’appareil a l’air bien.
2,Un peut nul pour l Apple Watch c’est dommage le produit pourrait être bien mais non !
1,Mauvais produit.
1,75W et pas 15w comme indiqué dans l’annonce la montre ne tient pas dessus le socle n’est pas stable !
1,Lamp doesn’t work when presses
1,Didn’t charger my iwatch properly at all. Not my iPhone 14! It was updating at night and due to the charger not working properly it crashed and had to reboot loosing some data. It’s really a terribly charger. Sent back for a refund. Avoid!
