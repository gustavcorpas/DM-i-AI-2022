3,Got the HP X27q during the second treasure truck sale on July 13 2022. As you see in some of the reviews after July 13 some have reported getting monitors with a BOE panel (BIM111) used instead of the LG panel (LIM101) in earlier manufactured models that got a lot positive reviews. There are other reports of people getting a newer revision LG panel (LIM111). It's a lottery at this point.In my case I would be considered lucky and got an old stock manufactured Aug 2021 with the LIM101 LG panel and monitor FW 1.1.1.0.No dead or stuck pixels. No flickering.The colors after using a color profile file from a review and their recommended settings and in 10bit the general output from the monitor looks great. This is my first IPS monitor so it was a bit of a sensory overload with picture quality after using TN monitors for so long.But that's kinda ruined as I got unlucky with the IPS glow lottery. The bottom left is pretty bad. If there's anything dark in that corner it will look washed out if sitting in the center. I can either sit a bit off to the left about an inch from the center or sit one and half arms length away to see that bottom left glow go away so things like watching movies from a further distance is unaffected. Included in the review is a pretty good representation of what I see using a solid black color and with the monitor brightness set at 5 at about an arms length away.Horizontal viewing angles are good.Vertical viewing angles are only good looking from below. From above it's a bit washed out and gets worse when a horizontal angle is added. Looks like it comes from the IPS glow at the bottom. Compared to my Dell S2716DG with TN panel vertical viewing angle from above is much better. But honestly vertical viewing angles will never be a problem for me.Buttons in the back is just bad. Having a multi monitor setup and needing to press any buttons to switch input or make any other adjustment means I have to keep pivoting away my side monitor which I'm glad I have monitor arms. Just have the buttons at come out the bottom of the bottom bezel.The forward facing power LED design placement is questionable as the placement is just "there". By default on the white LED is not that bad during the day but at night it will be noticeable and can be dazzling to the eyes. And it turns to a nice amber when it enters into sleep mode though I it's still a bit bright at night. HP does give us the option to completely disable it. But there seems to be a bug with it. After turning off the power LED and the first time the monitor enters sleep mode the LED will stay off. But when you wake it up and the next it enters sleep mode with the "no input" message pops up the white LED will come on and stay on. It doesn't turn amber and stays white. The LED will then turn off the next time you wake it up.Warranty length is only a year. But for me after searching up my serial number my warranty started back in April 15 2022 and ends May 9 2023. So I have 10 months. Though I'm pretty sure they have to grant my warranty started at the time of purchase July 13 and not April 15 with the invoice.So to rate the monitor. During the day time the IPS glow is not noticeable and the overall picture quality is great. In the evening/night the IPS glow is there but I've found a good balance of brightness that works well that it limits the IPS glow and haven't noticed it when just doing stuff. Though for others this might not be possible. The vertical angle that I'm not bothered about but should be brought up. And the bug with the power LED can be a major issue for some. Finding out that I may have less than one year warranty really sucks so I'm giving it a 3 star instead of a 4.If this monitor was to ever drop down to the treasure truck truck price of $175 I would try and get another one and would recommend giving it a shot. It is Amazon so returns is not that much of an hassle. At the regular price of around $250 I would really be looking at other monitors in this price range before considering this X28q.Something to note is other major electronic stores don't sell this model anymore and HP's own store website doesn't even have a page for it. Is it possible this treasure truck sale was to move the last major batch of these monitors before being discontinued?
4,I bought this during the treasure truck deal and it’s an amazing monitor for the price. Gsync works great colors are vibrant and it gets 165hz no problem with the supplied cable.Hdr is a bit weak and I would not purchase this monitor if you’re expecting a great hdr experience but that’s very hard to get at this price point. I would also highly recommend you download the icc profile from techless youtube as the color accuracy is a bit off right out the box when compared to my other monitor. After icc profile and slight manual adjustment it’s extremely accurate and colors are fantastic. Watch techless video on YouTube and he’ll walk you through the color adjustment and provide the icc profile link.Ips glow was minimal on my panel which was surprising and using that icc profile also helped with the blacks looking more black than gray. Button location is a bit awkward so it’s best to set this monitor up before mounting it to a specific location. Also it force downloads some hp omen program when first installing the monitor I would recommend you uninstall it after final set up.Response time is decent but you are completely unable to use it after level 2 the overshoot is extremely noticeable and looks terrible level 2 was the sweet spot for me 3 is “doable” but I would only recommend it for fast paced games you really don’t care about graphics at all.Lastly be aware that hp began shipping these with BOE panels (BIMM111) I was lucky to get the Lg (LIMM111 or LIMM 101) I have heard of qc issues with the boe panels so make sure to test your monitor thoroughly before the return period. You can find this part number on the box or by holding power and menu buttons on the monitor while starting up.Again great monitor and would highly recommend it at the $170 price point if it fits your needs. Don’t expect good hdr you will be disappointed.
5,I bought this monitor to upgrade my gaming experience from 1080p to 1440p. I was also moving from a TN panel on my 1080p monitor and was amazed by the difference in color (mainly contrast) from TN to IPS. My monitor does have a BOE panel instead of the much reviewed an praised LG panel that these had when they first came out. I have not experienced any of the issues others have had with the BOE panel (I’ve had the monitor for less than a month at time of review). There is minimal backlight bleed that I’ve noticed but I also dialed in settings for brightness contrast gamma etc in windows when I first set it up and I mostly use it in a dark room. For 1440p gaming on a capable system this monitor is great and at an affordable price. There are other options that are in the same price range that have better panels but I rolled the dice on this one and it’s yet to disappoint. I will update this review if I begin having issues with the panel. Otherwise I would recommend this monitor to anyone wanting a 1440p gaming monitor for a decent price.
5,I got this from the Treasure Truck deal. Under $190 shipped for a 165Hz 1440p IPS monitor. The first one I got from this deal had a defect in the top right corner of the panel that was only visible from certain angles. Seemed to be a deformity in the panel itself. I returned it for another one which is perfect. It's an excellent monitor that I was lucky enough to snag for under $190 all said and done.As with any other monitor HDR 400 is kind of a joke and looks worse than standard range. Leave it disabled.Had no problems running it at 165Hz over the included Display Port cable. AMD Freesync Premium was enabled by default. The colors are not the best out of the box but are easily corrected with the OSD. There's a couple of presets which are okay but I prefer the custom RGB option to set to my liking. You can also use custom color profiles as well.The backlight is bright. This one has no issues with deformities or light bleed. It looks great. Slight color banding even after calibrating but not worth trying to return again. No dead or stuck pixels. No flickering issues.I missed it the first time it was a Treasure Truck deal but got lucky and snagged it the second time. If it comes back up again I will certainly get another one and you should too. For that price you really can't beat it.
5,This was a Christmas gift for my son. I wanted him to make sure it was in working order before wrapping it up for the tree. Well his dad helped him set it up and the box was destroyed so my son got it early. LOL He finely told me that he really liked it and that it was great for gaming earlier this week.
4,As several reviews mention at some HP decided to replace the highly lauded LG panel in this monitor with a cheaper BOE (a Chinese manufacturer) panel. It's hard to say exactly how much this degrades the quality of the panel but keep in mind that the initial wave of very positive reviews for this may not be as accurate as they were.So far it seems good enough considering I got it on sale. I had a dead pixel scare exactly on day after the 30 day return period ended but I think it was a false alarm. I also think I may have received a returned monitor though as it has some scuffs on it and the warranty was already activated 2 months before I even received it. Might have to look into what that's about.Just do your due diligence and if you can grab it on sale it should hopefully serve well as a decent monitor considering its size resolution and refresh rate.Will update as time goes on if any issues pop up.
5,The HP X27q Gaming Monitor has already been a game changer. Going from a 21-inch 1080p(FHD)/60hz to a 27-inch 1440p(QHD)/165hz is amazing. Not only I’m getting more screen space due to higher pixel count but its significantly smoother. The IPS panel with HDR also makes this screen much brighter and more color accurate. The overall look of this monitor is premium with super slim bezels and good adjustment options for height and tilt. The size and viewing angles allow me to use it as a TV sometimes when watching streaming content. I gamed a few times so far and its far more responsive than my previous monitor. Great buy and value for the premium feature set. For gaming 1440p is a sweat spot as it allows more FPS then going with 4k which would be far more resource hungry and personally at 27-inch your eyes would not notice much difference in detail. Be sure that your PC has a newer HDMI or DP versions to ensure you can use the 144/165hz modes.
4,So to start off with this is a great monitor. A fantastic monitor. Everything from the rich colors to the increased frame rate is exactly what I had hoped for. Especially coming from a brand that I am very familiar with (I had a similar model but very early on maybe 2011?). And just like my previous monitor this one rotates to a vertical display! Just make sure you tilt the monitor outward at the bottom in order to ensure you have enough clearance. Anyway as mentioned it's a great monitor and would be a welcome addition to anyone looking to expand their desktop for work or a gamer looking to enhance their gaming experience. Assembly of this item was also incredibly easy.. you literally open the box remove the cardboard and snap the arm of the base into the back of the monitor. Et Voila!I do have a few issues with this monitor though..- The cable that's included with it... it only provided a Display Port cable and unfortunately my laptop does not have one of those. I obviously had extra HDMI cables but I would have expected one to be included especially at the $200+ price range.- the connection on the monitor for the Display Port is very tight and leaves little room for actually removing the Display Port cable once attached. A better design would have been to maybe put the push-release for the display port cable on the sides instead of on top of the cable.- There is no auto-adjust display when rotating the monitor to vertical display. This might be something that I adjust on my display settings but my last HP monitor that rotated would automatically change the display to vertical.This monitor works and looks great and none of these issues are deal breakers by any means. It just simply means I can't give it a 5-star review.
5,For the money buy this! I got in off of amazon treasure truck for $180 and it is easily as good as panels that cost $285-315. It ticks all of the boxes and has good response time. Only issue would be not the best contrast but that happens with all ips monitors because it’s not a va panel. At this price it is a must buy! Even at $240 or $250 it’s a steal.
5,Image quality and viewing angles are great. I’m glad I got it. It’s an awesome value.
4,Great monitor good color resolution and refresh rate. No speakers whatsoever.
5,Couldn't have asked for anything more at the price paid.  Great value!Using this as a second screen next to my 38" ultra wide.  Switch between portrait / landscape depending on what I need.  Works perfectly.
5,It was super easy to install and the picture is great quality.
4,This should be used for a computer. I bought this for my ps5 but this has a 2.0 HDMI port so I cant use VRR.
4,I bought this on sale with pretty high hopes due to the largely very positive reviews. I'm mostly satisfied with it for the price I paid.-Colors are vibrant and overall pretty good despite not using the nano-ips backlight like some other monitors that contain the same LG panel within.-I like the looks of it; simple somewhat classy/elegant and understated (not a flamboyant 'gaming' monitor look.-No dead pixels-Performs well when playing gamesTwo things preventing me from giving it 5 stars:-Some bothersome IPS glow much more prominent on one side than the other. Backlight bleed from edges was quite minimal and perfectly acceptable but the glow on black screens is very bothersome during loading screens or very dark scenes. I don't game on PC much and never watch movies on the computer so I decided not to return.-The blue light reduction coating is something I don't like. Yes you can apply ICC profiles (which I did) and tune the color a bit from there but I felt like I could only get it a tad too warm and a tad too cool and couldn't achieve truly neutral whites I wanted. It's close enough for me I guess so again I didn't return.It sounds like I just got a less than stellar draw in the panel lottery so I wouldn't let that dissuade you. It's an okay monitor for the price but I think I'll definitely try something else when I'm ready for a second 27" to replace my ancient 22" for a dual setup.
4,Got two of these for my first computer build in ten years! Beautiful picture quality and not a bad looking monitor either. Took a star off because these dummies didn't include a power cable for one of the monitors. Cost me an extra $8 and one less day of gaming... first world problems.
5,Great for games could not have found a better monitor for the price Great prime day purchase
5,I thought I might be sacrificing a lot with the price but this has really good performance.
5,Picture quality is fantastic with refresh rates great for gaming
5,Works great for 4K gaming
5,I usually buy monitors from Dell but this monitor was a hundred dollars cheaper than the Dell equivalent (S2721DGF which apparently has the same panel) with the only apparent downside being the lack of a USB hub so I bought two.Both screens arrived in perfect working condition with no visible backlight bleeding (surprisingly) and no dead pixels. I've been using the monitors for almost a week and so far I haven't experienced  any issues that sometimes occur with cheaper monitors like some patterns or colors triggering waves on the screen.The only complaint I have with this monitor is the placement of the buttons. They are simply infuriating to use because they are at the back of the monitor and navigating the monitor's menus involves constantly keeping attention to which button you have your fingers on.Also a minor nitpick: in my experience Dell monitors come with a sturdy briefcase-like box made out of thick cardboard while these HP monitors come in a cheap box made out of thin cardboard. This of course is a very minor issue but I am not sure I will be able to use the original boxes from HP to transport the monitors because one of the packages arrived with a tear starting from one of the handle cutouts.
4,Used for gaming photo editing general computer-ing. HP pulled a bait-and-switch with this monitor and you may get a superior LG panel or a subpar BOE panel. If you can get it for less than $200 it's a steal either way and a HUGE improvement from 1080p 60hz. IPS glow is kind of bad. My lower left corner has bad IPS glow lower right is noticeable top corners are fine.
4,Purchased the legendary treasure truck deal monitor came quick. Was unfortunate to learn the one I received came with the cheaper BOE panel that HP swapped into these bad boys to save money. There is an odd green tint on the screen I can't seem to remove with any settings. But for a second or third monitor this thing does the job.
4,it is a great monitor for the price if u can get it below 200 dollar though hp already change x27q to boe panel.
5,I moved up to this monitor from a 23" ViewSonic and it was the best investment I've ever made! As a PC gamer the picture quality is important as well as refresh rates...this monitor ticks those boxes for me!Having more screen real estate is also a huge plus...it's a big screen but not TOO big.No dead pixels or screen flickering.If it was needed I'd buy 2 more of these monitors in a heartbeat for sure.
4,Got it from recent Amazon treasure truck deal. It had everything specs I wanted. IPS/ 1440P/ 165HZ(I was happy with 144hz so it was plus)/ Vesa/ Fast response time/ No crazy gaming monitor design which is perfect for work + gaming set up/ HDR/ Gsync (Not certified but it works)/ and above all crazy good price. I set it up right next to the AOC cq27g2 which I have been used about 1.5 year. It did not had dead pixel and there were bit of IPS light bleeding but not too crazy and was not impacting my gaming at all. No issues for QC. However It didn't really gave me better experience compare to AOC CQ27G2 which priced very similar to this HP X27Q. It had more like very similar color and clearness and gaming performance with AOC's VA panel. I hoped IPS gave be different feeling and experience than VA but I am not seeing much 'Upgrade'. Also when I turn on HDR I also getting high pitch sound as other reviewers mentioned as Coil whine and HDR didn't make any difference watching movies/ videos. Look other if you really into HDR.  For the price I am very very happy with HP X27Q. Recommend for entry level IPS gaming monitor.
4,They've made a silent downgrade for this monitor: it's no longer using LG panels. They now use BOE which is a cut-rate panel with much worse quality control.I've got it for a song but I'm starting to think that I'm getting what I've paid for.
5,Kinda flashbanged me the first time I plugged it in my bad for leaving the lights off I guess. Great monitor looks good performs well just a great monitor- especially for the price.
4,Purchased as an Amazon Truck deal and what a great deal. I was coming from a 34” ultrawide monitor with 75hz refresh rate and what a difference. The monitor gets really bright if that’s what you prefer. I like the simple design and low profile look. Anti-glare coating works ok. You will have to tweak some settings to get the monitor to perform ideally. Another negative is the limited adjustments with the stand. Only option is telescoping up or down. No tilting or rotating. But I plan on using an monitor arm anyway so not a big deal for me. It does come with a 6ft DP cable which you’ll need to get the full 165hz refresh rate. Is it worth full price? Hard to say without another monitor to compare it to. But not sure you’ll find many other 27” 4K 1440p QHD 165hz monitors at this price point. But I think it’s definitely worth the $180 (before taxes) I got it for.
5,Keep an eye out for the legendary Amazon Treasure Truck deal that drops this down to approximately $175. At that price it is an absolutely bonkers deal. The high refresh rate and IPS panel provide a great experience for an unbelievable price. The only thing it's really missing is a better HDR experience with only HDR400 but at this price range that's to be expected and it's still a great monitor even without HDR.
5,This is a great monitor for both business and gaming! Plenty of real estate to see everything that's going on!
5,Really enjoy the monitor - perfect as a companion to my ultrawide. Good response time clear picture and no dead pixels. WELL worth the cost :)
5,Great finding during an Amazon treasure box day. This monitor is great and the vesa mounts are amazing. I used it for my in-house office set up and was impressed about how effective it was at picking up the active sources when i was switching from my work dock to my gaming computer
5,Finally upgraded from a decade old monitor. Managed to snag it in a treasure truck deal for under 200. Great specs and great price.
5,The Hp x27q Gaming monitor is solid built beautifully designed monitor that delivers a crisp picture. I like the size at a 27” diameter as it allows me to observe the entire field of play that is presented without having to physically move my neck and minimizes the movement in my eyes. The picture is very clear and response time are very fast at 1 ms. I'm no longer at a disadvantage when competing online. It's also a great monitor to do general computing chores such as web browsing movies productivity apps etc. But it really excels as a gaming peripheral. I also found the viewing options such as tilting rotating and pivoting to be quite helpful (for example when viewing documents that are portrait oriented and then viewing power point presentations or videos which tend to have a landscape orientation. I can't think of anything I didn't like about the monitor. It suits my need as a gamer quite well.
5,I have been on the hunt for an inexpensive 1440p high refresh monitor for some time. When this popped up for $180 on the amazon treasure truck I snagged it without a second thought and I have zero regrets. 1440p has so much more real estate that 1080 and 27" is the sweet spot for this resolution in my opinion. And the high refresh is just so fluid from the standard 60hz monitors. Top it off with a nice IPS panel and backed by a name brand like HP and it is the best budget 1440p monitor hands down. Not to mention it included a nice stand with vertical movement and rotation which is usually unheard of in this price range. My only complaint would be that is only has a single hdmi and single display port and no built in speakers but that is very minor.
5,Theis monitor is great large screen awesome clarity.
5,Rcvd a very good BIM111 panel. Sharp clear display. Not one bit of ips glow or backlight bleed.  Colors are accurate as far as I can tell. Already made a big difference in my gaming. Tyvm Treasure truck. What a deal
5,Normally I'm not a fan of this brand but it was dirt cheap on prime day and I'm glad I gave it a shot. Such good picture and contrast. I was surprised!!
4,Upgraded to this from my samsung 27” curved monitor and it was worth it after playing around with the settings I was able to get the the picture to where i liked it. The monitor stand itself has the slightest horizontal tilt to it which bugs me a little bit when im not locked in while gaming but its worth the pick up if its on sale and you need a new monitor.
4,What I didn't like : image ghosting and saturation spikes when moving camera view quickly when gaming at the highest response time (level 4) image tearing when moving camera view quickly when gaming at lower response times (level 1)What I liked : easy setup and installation sturdy stand with full rotation and tilt options  good color accurate panel with high refresh rate and great OSD troubleshooting features
5,I gamed
3,Most FreeSync displays will correctly drop to about 48Hz for scenes where there is excess GPU load. However this HP will only drop to 60Hz meaning it doesn't do FreeSync correctly at the most common frame rate: 60. You see most games will "hover" around 60 FPS but no game is perfect. The frame rate may be lower or higher than 60 during gameplay. This is why any FreeSync/variable refresh display MUST allow for rates below AND above 60Hz (48-75Hz range being common for cheap monitors). If the display can't provide for this variation in 60 FPS games then the FreeSync feature is pointless. This is such an unbelievably boneheaded oversight on HP's part I suspect these monitors may be a defective batch that have been marketed differently. No competent engineer would ever spec a variable refresh display with this range as it's useless for the most common gaming frame rate: 60. So don't waste your time on a mediocre display with poor IPS glow and a useless FreeSync feature. Buy one of the cheap LG gaming displays instead that have a better variable refresh range.
5,I was very pleasantly surprised by this monitor! For the price I was expecting a decent monitor but not nearly the quality I received. First I will say the packaging was of great quality. It wasn’t difficult to open but felt very secure. The instructions were easy to follow and set up was a breeze. It is super thin around the edges and looks very high end on my desk. I have used it both for grad school programming courses and some gaming and can say it is the best monitor I have ever owned. It quickly became my primary monitor and will has definitely exceeded my expectations!
4,Picked this up in a flash sale and it's great for the price. It has the same panel as the Dell (pictured on the right in my photos).Very similar picture but the HP is a little bit more neutral. The HP didn't need calibrated out of the box unlike the Dell monitor.I can't run it at it's highest refresh setting there was a bit of ghosting. Dropping it to level 3 fixed it. Otherwise it is a smooth experience.The power button is in a terrible spot if you are right to run 2 of these or more you might want to try something else out.If the price goes down again I'll easily pick up another to run in portrait. Overall I'm happy with it for what I paid
4,I love this monitor! For $299 you really can't beat it. The HP X27Q looks great performs great and is cheap. It arrived with no dead pixels no noticable light bleed that I could see and great color uniformity. So why only four stars? The warranty practices... This monitor comes with a one year warranty BUT it starts from the day it was actually manufactured not the day you buy it. NOTE: You can email HP and get the warranty dates changed to start from your date of purchase by providing them proof of when it was purchased but I feel like this shouldn't be necessary it should just be automatic that the warranty starts from your date of purchase. That's why I knocked off a star.
4,This is a great screen out of the box. 165hz 1ms ensures gameplay is butter smooth so long as your rig can hit those frames. Product description does not mention compatibility with Nvidia G-Sync but I can confirm that it is compatible for a tear-free experience.The included displayport cable is a bit temperamental it took me a bit to figure out it was the cable. Using a good quality cable fixed the issues of HDR not being detected and sometimes the monitor not picking up that there was picture being output on power on.All in all fantastic value for the available features well worth dealing with some minor annoyances that don't require more than a quick search online for easy solutions.
3,Unfortunately didn't think to snag a photo while it was happening since receiving this item as part of the July Treasure Truck the monitor occasionally goes black or the right half of the monitor will get all staticky like an old TV. Appears I got the updated BIM111 panel instead of the LG panel that got all of the good reviews. It's not terrible but my concern is if it gets progressively worse as time goes on I'll be out of the return window.
4,I got this when it was on Treasure Truck for under $200. But even at the normal price this is a really nice monitor. It hit all the sweet spots for me. Would buy it again.
4,The power button and all of the controls are on the back of the monitor not even near the edge so you can sort of reach under or around to get to them. It's like someone intentionally placed them in the hardest to reach location.I'm frustrated that I can't easily turn these off at night when I want to shut down or put my computer to sleep.Other than that they're fine. The tiny bezels mean they're very nice side by side. They seem bright and crisp and so far I'm happy but I haven't played anything intense on them yet.
5,Bright crisp clear image. Great monitor for gaming. You will be hard pressed to find a better monitor for the price.
5,I work from home and use this for CAD modeling primarily and it works great! I love the size how light it is and how easy it is to connect to different devices.
5,I bought three of these for my wife who was complaining of eye strain after working long shifts. Previously she had a 50"  4k curved TV in the past and I have to assume it was not IPS. These monitors work great for office work have a wide range of brightness and reproduce images and text identically to each other. Additionally the side and top bezels are extremely thin I just wish the bottom bezel was also smaller since all three are in portrait orientation. The stand is also feature full and allows for 90 degree rotation counter clockwise.
4,Clarity is slightly askew compared to other 1440p monitors but overall very good. Really good value compared to other 165hz 1440p monitors and a solid gaming monitor.
5,The x27q monitor features a slim frame around the sides easy to connect to the base (no tools required). The monitor also comes with the DVI cable for superior quality. After running a couple of games on CSGO it really aids my gameplay with the quality of picture provided. The response team (1ms) is fantastic! The tilt features are nice to capture the perfect angle you need for any game. So far I don't have any reservations about this gaming monitor. It suits my needs from competition matches photo editing or daily computer tasks. The boxing of this product was great. It arrived at my door without any shifting/damage.
5,The monitor is such a game changer for me I’m replacing it over 21.5 iMac. $174 is a great price too! I’m very happy with my purchase.
4,Out of the box it was bright as hell.Colors are magnificent using it for gaming and everything looks great to me.Only con is the button placement why on earth were the buttons put halfway up the back of the thing ill never know but i have to put almost my whole arm under it to reach them (have dual setup so this monitor being on the left means i cant just reach around the right side of it without the other one being in the way)
5,I purchased this monitor for my son's PC and the upgrade from 1080 75hz has made a huge difference for him. The specs on this monitor are fantastic I'm most impressed with the brighness colors and black quality and he is most impressed with 165hz as it has immensely smoothed out his experience in Apex Legends. Though he isn't using the stand that came with it I did use it for a couple days and it's nice quality I didn't have any issues with it. For the price the HP X27q was an easy decision and would highly recommend it!
5,It’s been a while since I last upgraded my monitor an upgrade I thought was not as worthwhile as say a whole new computer or a shiny new keyboard. It appears I was wrong to underestimate the power of a monitor upgrade. One of the main features of the HP Monitorx27q is that it reduces blue light allowing one to partake in long sessions of gaming online shopping or essay typing without the eye strain that other monitor screens may give you. Previously I would have to wear Anti Blue Light glasses if I wanted to sit at the screen for more than 30 minutes without bringing discomfort upon my eyeballs. Now I haven’t worn those glasses once not even during a long Saturday night gaming marathon. My eyes have sung many songs of joy being free of the restraints of blue light. As for general quality of life improvements I experienced: 1. Adjustable height and angle rather than just the angle 2. Button placement in vertical order on the backside rather than having to fumble around on the underside looking for the right button 3. Large screen for greater immersion 4. Just looks nicer visually both the monitor itself and whatever it’s displaying.
5,This is a very new 165Hz "gaming" monitor and as such there unfortunately isn't many reviews for it out there so I decided I'd write a few words regarding my experience with it thus far.I have been using the HP X27q for a few days now and so far I absolutely love it.The screen is absolutely beautiful and in my personal opinion it feels like 27" seems to be a pretty good sweet spot for the QHD (2560 x 1440) resolution that this monitor provides. The Height Adjustment mechanism is very smooth as well.It was very easy to setup and it came with a DisplayPort cable in the box which was a nice bonus.For my use case I mostly use the monitor connected via DisplayPort to my desktop computer with an AMD graphics card.However I did temporarily connect it to my gaming laptop which uses Nvidia and while the monitor uses AMD FreeSync Premium and isn't listed as G-Sync compatible I manually enabled G-Sync within the Nvidia software on my laptop and it seemed to work just fine in my limited testing.(I should note that the G-Sync option will only appear when the monitor is connected via the DisplayPort.)I also tested my laptop connected to the monitor’s HDMI port using a "premium" Cable Matters HDMI cable and was getting a 144Hz refresh rate at the maximum resolution in the few games that I tested.The only very minor annoyance that I have is that you have to reach your hand around the back of the right side of the monitor to access the controls.
4,No user manual or paperwork. No speakers
3,Sadly as I move my mouse across the screen a bright vertical strip of backlight follows it.  It’s jarring.  It was cheap so I get it it’s not a high end display.  I guess I just expected more from the backlighting.
4,It works was easy to install and situate gives a great picture. The only drawbacks: 1) the on/off button is behind/backside of the screen so difficult to get to. 2) I find the tilt & height options a little limited. My anime looks great though.
4,Monitor has decent colors and contrast. It might seem washed out compared to higher quality monitors but for the price it is pretty good. It does come with a yellowish tint due to the Eye Care Certification. You can easily adjust this in the settings though. Overall a good deal
3,I was not able to get the settings to my liking. Both images and text did not look as good to me as on a $150 24-inch HD Dell monitor. The buttons are also difficult to use as they are on the back of the panel and you have to match them up to menus on the display. On the positive side the stand and adjustable height /orientation are great
5,This monitor was highly anticipated in our home. We have been using it for work and gaming and it is impressive. The graphics are crisp and the picture keeps up with even our super fast racing games. The overall size is optimal and the screen and stand itself is sleek and slim. Overall We are super satisfied and I would recommend this monitor to anyone looking for an affordable and powerhouse monitor.
5,Loved the monitor. I have a few similar sized but this is my first high refresh rate monitor and it's a beauty. Good colors speed and no dead pixels. Smaller bezels make me want to buy another too!
4,Typically i steer far from HP but this was a great deal. Int very quick at turning on and it does not sleep or power off as it should. But it is sturdy and the res is great.
3,I got this and I am using an Nvidia Quadro 5000k video card. I hooked the display port to display port cable and it will not work. I get a black screen saying disconnected or some sort. I hooked up both monitors my old one...with DVI port at 60hz and this one both..and both come up. Old one is default..the new screen comes up too but is secondary. So it will not work on its own. I went into the settings in both win10 and Nvidia to set it..the highest was 122hz. this video card I bought this year. SOOO I am not sure where to go from here. I ordered a DVI to display port cable adapter and we will see if that works..but that kinda defeats the purpose for the 144hz. If I cant find a solution I will return this. Just beware if you have this video card this screen monitor may not work for you. FYI-the display port cable that came with it..garbage for me. It has metal hooks on it..I assume to hold it in place in the port but...try removing it without ripping everything out. I used a different cable without the hooks..MUCH better. I recommend getting another cable unless you like tearing up your video card ports.
5,Good monitor for the money OK for gaming gear for business use.  Only real complaint like many others say is placement of the power button.  Design team missed the mark on that one.  I didn't think it would bother me but is super annoying.  Minor complaint though overall it's a good value 2k monitor.
5,Really love this monitor and for the price i got it for i cant find another monitor with similar specs for the price.
3,I really want to love this monitor. I use it for gaming and returned the first monitor initially due to the screen randomly blacking out for a few seconds while I was gaming. Recieved a second one because I thought it was just a faulty monitor but unfortunately my second one has the same issues. On both the power plug-in seems a little finicky and could be the issue but is just a little disappointing especially since I'd love it if this wasn't an issue. Probably returning and waiting for something like a gigabyte on prime day.
4,A 27 inch QHD monitor with 165hz at this price point is a great value. Could use a few more ports but I’m very pleased with its performance.
5,24g2 on the left for size comparison. Playing cs go at 165hz is great on this monitor. Playing cyberpunk 2077 at 60fps is also beautiful. Gsync works perfect. No noticeable backlight bleed no dead pixels/stuck pixels. Also don't notice any ips glow compared to other ips monitors I have used. Love the minimalist design too. 1440p is so clear that it makes my 1080p monitor look sort of blurry in games. Don't think I could go back to 1080p. If your PC can handle 1440p make the jump it is 100% worth it in my opinion.
3,The price is great the brightness contrast and color are great.  Pretty much everything about it is great except one thing...all 5 of the control buttons (power menu and menu navigation) are on the back of the monitor...and not near the edge where you can reach them from the front with your fingers.  You have to reach your hand around the back to operate them.  If you only use one source/input this is mainly just an issue when you first set it up and make adjustments.  But if you have multiple sources like I do (Xbox on HDMI PC on DisplayPort) switching inputs and modes is a pain and even more so if you use dual monitors because the buttons are towards the side and when using dual monitors one side is going to be  inaccessible (butted up to the other monitor) and you have to reach over the top and it's just awkward to use.  Great monitor for single source use but if you have multiple sources I'd not recommend buying this one.
4,Looks pretty good and performs as the specs say. Has a pretty nasty coil whine if you're using HDR but this is probably not your first choice for an HDR monitor anyway.
3,Great picture. Monitor has a weird high pitch sound from a component. It was too annoying to keep using. If it wasn’t for that I would’ve kept it.
5,I needed to purchase an HDMI to USBC cable.I fully expected that necessity. They said it was immediately recognized by the iMac. Images clear and fast and is for simple office use.
5,Very berry nice!!
5,This HP monitor is surprisingly good for its price when you can get it on sale for $250 or less and competes against the Dell S27DG21 except lacking the USB hub and blue light flair
5,I bought this for work and I love it!
5,No issues clear picture I would recommend
5,Purchased as a gift for a child’s gaming system (have no idea which one— PlayStation or X-box?? Anyway the kid (age 13) loves it. He’s over the moon about the graphics display.
5,Great monitor checked all of the boxes for me (QHD 165 hz vesa compatible display port) easily transitions from gaming to working and casual usage. I was able to get this monitor for less than $200 through Amazon Treasure Truck definitely worth looking out for those deals.The only con was that I couldn't purchase two.
5,I have Dell monitors provided by work. I had eye strain and headaches. This fixed it. I don’t know if it’s the refresh rate or just the blue blocking capability whatever it is it’s done the trick.It’s one of those purchases makes you really have you did it.
5,As good as Gigabyte and Dell counterparts. But costs less. Very good gaming monitorLimited port options and no joy stick menu might be the only downside
3,No speakers
5,Very happy with purchase (Amazon Treasure Truck deal) I've been looking for another monitor of this caliber for the same money and still haven't seen one touch it - used for gaming and general pc activities.
5,Love this monitor. Got it on a Treasure Truck special. Picture quality is exceptional.
5,Loving this monitor. What’s not there to like? It is 2K resolution (great for spreadsheets or side by side browsing and still legible for those without 20/20 vision) high refresh rate (for gaming) IPS (for accurate colors on photos) AND amazing pricing with Amazon Truck deal.
5,Got it with the treasure truck deal great monitor for the best price!
2,Look this monitor is probably really decent for its price range. I happened to be one of the unlucky ones and receive a model with the BOE panel. It was doomed from the start. Ghosting a weird blue trail behind scrolling text that hurt my eyes and head scrolling text would be blurry until I stopped the middle of the screen failed to hold color like the rest of the panel until the cursor moved through it. Odd problems. This is a highly rated monitor. Just be wary.
5,Great buy. Got it on sale so it was an especially good deal. Very good mid tier gaming monitor. Definitely recommend.
5,I really love this monitor works great for both work and playing games.
5,opened it yesterday played a couple hours of games. Perfect for the new xbox series x. blacks are not as dark as they could be  but other colors are great. do not have speakers so you might want to keep in mind for the price you have to buy some monitor/bookself speakers
5,Great addition to our workstation at home. Wonderful for work games and streaming!
5,Excellent display/color/sharpness right out of the box!  Great value very happy with this purchase.
3,The monitor is a good value but panels seems to have a defect. Had to get my monitor replaced because the first one had a blue mark the size of my hand on the side where the setting controls are. My replacement also has a slight yellow discoloration in the same spot. Debating whether to return or not since this time its very minimal.
5,Good response rate and straightforward setup. Good value!
5,I couldn't be happier with it colors are astonishing in-game details are so sharp that sometimes you don't need ultra graphics compared to 1080p and luckily I didn't get a sample with backlight bleeding or dead pixels so perfect monitor for me.
5,Son loves ir!!
5,I’m over the moon happy
5,Value for money
3,Loved it for about a week before a blue vertical line appeared in the middle of it. Having it replaced new one has yet to arrive skeptical how long that one will last. Otherwise its a very nice display and has great specs for the price.
5,Arrived on time and works great according to my teen gamer.
5,Everything
5,Great for money
1,Eveyone here hyping up this monitor must have gotten a different batch than me because this monitor isn't good at all. It looks great when you unbox but that's about it. I was really excited to have a 2k 165hz monitor to pair with my legion 7 (amd and 3070 ti) but as you can see from the images I was getting screen tearing from the start. Thought it was a issue on my end but tried on numerous laptops and desktops but still nothing. And as you can see from the amd screenshot the cpu wasn't even reading it as free sync compatible even though it says it is. So I messaged Amazon and told them about it and to their credit they replaces the item but did the item resolve? Nooppe. Terrible monitor can't even run 165hz on it and the colors on warzone look hideous as well
2,The LCD panel was originally an LG LM270WQA but recently HP switched to a BOE MV270QHM as part of the BIM111 revision.
2,The monitor works great with a PC (as expected) but it does not work well with my PS5. The graphics look bad but it runs smooth. Would suggest another monitor.
1,I purchased this monitor as part of the Treasure Truck deals. At $175 and with such great reviews it was a no brainer. However when I received the monitor and plugged it into my rig the picture quality was so so so bad compared to my ViewSonic OMNI VX2768. The blacks are washed out. The viewing angles are so awful that it is very easy to see a somewhat darkened vignette around the monitor. When plugged into my laptop dock there is significant ghosting. I didn't understand what the rave reviews were about. Then I did some research and I found out that HP switched out the panels some time between the great reviews in 2021 and now apparently. I checked and I received a BOE panel. The great reviews of the monitor come from folks who received an LG panel. Awful scummy practices HP. Shame on you. I am in the process of returning the monitor.
1,Received this monitor supposedly brand new but the box is utterly damaged. The product inside seems not to be physically damaged but upon powering on the screen flickers continuously. It's dead or nonfunctional unless you're ok with the screen constantly hiccuping to black. It's utterly annoying.Anyway I tried a new cable I tried HDMI instead of the DP provided... to no avail. I'll update this review once I receive a replacement and see if it's the batch problem or shipping problems. Really Amazon how hard is it to box up your shipment when it's electronic?!? It came in original product box so I'm guessing the monitor just took too much of a beating.
2,I'm quite disappointed with this monitor. There is bad IPS glow that washes out all the colors black in particular. I spent several hours messing with all the settings and connecting it to a couple different computers but none of this helped. I expected quite a bit better based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews here.
1,The changed the manufacturing specs AFTER getting all of their good reviews. The viewing angles are terrible the edges are all dark.Just another bait and switch where the normal people get a crappy product without any recourse. Don't bother asking HP about it. And for reference mine was manufactured in Dec 2021 with the crappy panel.
1,I bought this during the treasure trove sale a few weeks back. It is terrible. the monitor word  just fine for a month and now has temporary burn-ins every few days. Now I can't even return the damn thing.  I would highly not recommend this product.
1,The menu has an option to disable the power LED but that setting is ignored when no signal is detected. Even if the monitor is put to sleep even if you explicitly select the power LED off option it turns on as soon as you leave the menu if no signal is detected.
1,Just setup it up and this is what I got. The right monitor is the HP with the clear dark section with blacks. Whites look uniform but once I switched to blacks to match colors this became an issue. If you order hope you get an LG panel and not the BOE panel.
1,The good reviews for this monitor are for a version with an LG panel. The monitor I purchased from Amazon has a much inferior BOE panel. The viewing angles are similar to a TN monitor and the glare is awful. This is the last time I buy an HP monitor.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 See the attached video for the spectrum analysis.  This is showing when the HDR setting in Windows is off then turned on.  You can see once the HDR is toggled on there are 3 clear high pitched coil whine tones.  I've sent a request to HP to see what I should do if I don't hear back I'll return the device to Amazon.  Unfortunate because overall the color and look of this monitor seems pretty good but this coil whine is unbearable for myself.Edit: Dealing with HP was too difficult so I just decided to keep this as a second monitor and leave HDR off.  As a second monitor it's perfectly fine but I wouldn't really want to use this as a main monitor as it also has some weird ghosting if you turn up the refresh rate to 165.
1,The monitor arrived with half the screen flickering with white pixels. Amazon is refusing to replace it at the original cost despite this clearly being their fault.
1,Its good for gaming when there are no stuck pixels but after owning it for a few months and there is a stuck pixel. That is just pure unacceptable. Highly not recommended to buy. Seriously just don't.
1,Wow. This product is terrible. Monitor always flashed on and off for the first minute  after turning on. now the monitor doesnt respond at all wont even turn on. Not even that old. DO NOT BUY
1,Only lasted 2 months before flickering and dying on me.
1,This monitor's astounding well-received LG panel has been substituted for a BOE panel which is an inferior product. Shame on you HP.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The right side of the monitor appears with grainy artifacts. I have changed HDMI cables but still the same situation
1,Got it and love it but the dead pixels suck.
1,The monitor does not want to accept an hdmi input and only displays an image half the time. Most of the time it will say inactive
1,Not sure if i just got a dud but the monitor wont even turn ON out of the box. There is supposedly some power button lockout feature but following the instructions to reset that did not work either. Highly disappointing. Staying away from HP.
4,This is a nice 27" Monitor that I was considering to start my venture to 1440p.  Without anything else to compare to for the class/tier of monitor if I compare with the ASUS VP249QGR that I had before color was roughly similar and it seemed just about as smooth since we're talking about 21 more hz refresh rate but very difficult to perceive such a difference.The only thing I have noticed is since the blue light filter is just native and not controllable in the way that the ASUS Eyecare is everything seems fine out of the box EXCEPT when it comes to white screen.  It sorta causes very lite headaches if having to concentrate on that for long periods.  Some could argue about whether the Blue Light filtering is important or not.  I can only say that before the ASUS VP249QGR I started to have some headaches form on some game sessions and I got a pair of Blue-light filtering glasses and found it stopped being an issue.  After I got the VP249QGR It was bright but I did turn it to level 2 and it was the best balance of color and no headaches.Now why am I taking 1 star off? 2 reasons:This one is minor as I refused to believe it common on shipped monitors but the one I got has a HUGE scuff mark almost like someone used a buffer on the edge of the frame on the bottom and overbuffed the edge until the finish was removed.  The picture included with the flash is used to emphasize the area.  The box didn't look like it was damaged or banged but even if it was it had too much protection for that area that I just can't think of any other reason for it to have happened other than production line or packaging.  I can let this slide as everything seemed to be working so I said "no big deal."The other part is a bit way more of the reason for the star loss.  I absolutely do not approve of somehow getting the HP OMEN Gaming Hub installed automatically without my permission.  My PC is a custom Desktop build.  I give ASUS that at least you have the automatic BIOS method for installing the ASUS Armory Crate and it still at least asks you in Windows if you wish to install it.  You could turn it off in the BIOS and it never prompts in Windows.  I don't know what prompted the assumption that the HP OMEN Gaming Hub was necessary for a monitor connected to the GPU only.  What does it do you ask? Well basically 80% of the functions of the Monitor you could do physically with the buttons you can force with the Gaming Hub software.  Side note why are you telling me that I have "2" gear and the 2nd gear is my pc that looks like a laptop?Outside of that its overall a great monitor for the budget.  I feel personally there is more problems across screens with 10-bit on and I'm not sure if that is from the driver or cross talk issue but some things don't seem correct on the 8-bit depth screens I still use when 10-bit is enabled.  I'd say leave the HDR and 10-bit off.  Besides the HDR isn't true HDR as has been pointed out so I just don't bother.  Overall its good for both play and productivity!
4,The description of monitor is on point: the brightness is excellent without bothering one’s eyes.  The sharpness compare to the replaced monitor is excellent (Samsung Curved 27” a total waste of funds). Gave it as a gift to be used with a Mac Mini
1,Yeah I give up. Ordered 2 of these and done playing the panel lottery. Dead pixels on both. Returning yet another monitor.
4,The 165HZ gaming monitor has been great to play games with. It is comparable to another high end monitor that I own with these extremely favorable features. I like the height adjustment feature  and the high energy blue light. The  QHD (2560 x 1440  screen is just flawless and graphics look great.  I however find that it needs a USB port. That would be my only complaint. This is  a great monitor overall for the price and quality from HP.
5,Good spec and quality like it overall . Very good price as well
5,I'm loving this monitor 😍! I use it for my everyday browsing on the web and a little bit of gaming. I love how crisp and clear the picture is. It was easy to setup in about 5min.  Also it was a very good deal. One of the best monitors I've had.
5,This HP X27q QHD Gaming Monitor is a great monitor not only for gaming but also for business and office related programs. I game on my PC but I also extensively use Office programs and do lots of business work on my PC and this monitor is great for both! The smooth scrolling screen with it's 165Hz refresh rate is such a huge benefit and I absolutely love it. I play PUBG often and the super fast response rate of this monitor has helped me win a few chicken dinners! Also this monitor comes with EyeSafe Certification which means that it is always filtering blue light so your eyes won't get fatigued or blurry after long gaming sessions. I love this feature because the screen does not lose any color accuracy. I always hated how yellow the screen would look when using Windows blue-light filtering software. No need for any such software with this monitor and I am grateful for that. I highly recommend the HP X27q monitor.PRO’s:- High refresh rate of 165hz. It makes gameplay so smooth and also just for general web browsing. Screen scrolls so smoothly. It makes reading text a pleasure especially since I do a lot of office work on my PC.- Bright picture! I have mine set to 63 brightness and it's plenty bright for my needs. Can get very bright.- Great wide angle viewing areas - this is because of the IPS panel. I love it and I can never go back to a VA panel ever again!- Great black levels.- Comes with a DP cable (Display Port).- Easy to access menu buttons on the back of the monitor. Easy to use.- Monitor looks classy with thin bezels and the base feels very substantial. The screen is very stable and not prone to shaking. Screen can also be adjusted to a vertical (portrait) orientation.- Monitor came in a very well cushioned and sturdy box. No need to fear that the monitor could get damaged in shipping. It's well protected!CON's:- At first I couldn't get the HP Display Driver to install on my PC and the monitor was just listed under Device Manager as a Generic PnP Monitor. I eventually got the driver to install so it might have just been a problem with my particular computer. Please be sure to install the Display Driver from the HP website in order to ensure that the monitor will run optimally.I received this monitor at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and thoughtful review.
5,I'm a professional videographer and look at screens all day so when I say that this is one I like I hope that brings some validity to it. I love to play video games when I'm not working so this HP monitor is the best of both worlds for me personally. I'll start by saying that the packaging and setup were super simple no tools required at all and it took me maybe 5 minutes total. One of the first things I noticed about the monitor is that for its price it is very well built all plastic but super solid no concerns at all about how it's going to hold up long term. With HDMI and Display Port available I had no trouble finding a way to hook it up to my laptop. The quality of the screen is where it sets itself apart. Upon testing the backlight bleed HDR brightness etc. I cannot find any complaints. The high refresh rate works very well especially in games. If you've never experienced it before do yourself a favor and try it. My only complaint with this monitor is how you navigate the on-screen menu. There are five buttons on the back right side of the monitor 4 of which are unlabeled. I cannot tell you how many times I turned the screen off accidentally just trying to change some settings. Since it's a set it and forget it type of thing for me not a huge deal. But if you plan on using this for more than one device or anticipate having to use those buttons more often this is your heads up. Overall it's a win for me. The screen size is perfect the build is solid and the screen works great for my needs. If you need a monitor that's not going to break the bank go for this one.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I’ve been wanting a good monitor for a decent price this HP x27q is a perfect fit for my set up. Recommended if you’re on a budget.
3,Looks like my Asus tn panel monitor. The size is perfect but I'm a bit underwhelmed by the picture quality. I was hoping for a sharper more detailed image but it looks very tn like. Somebody please help me get a better picture. It's going back if that isn't possible.
1,The resolution is terrible.
3,I really didn't expect to have a problem with using this at a lower resolution and hz with my KVM but it just won't work no matter what cable I used. (I did use a premium high speed cable.) Drivers Software changing settings on the monitor absolutely nothing worked.it works great direct with a display port cable. luckily I have two display ports on my video card.
5,Perfect display for home office (supports VESA mounting) but I can't say how it performs for gaming really but I imagine quite well with 165hz with DisplayPort 1.4.The box it came with contained a DisplayPort cable and obviously the power cord but no HDMI 2.0 cable which perfectly suited me since DisplayPort supports higher resolutions these days.I think HP and Dell are reputable and solid for office monitors but I preferred this monitor since its 2k 27 inch wall mountable lightweight 165hz refresh rate and has 1 HDMI 2.0 and 1 DisplayPort 1.4 ports. The Dell monitors I was looking at only tended to support HDMI and VGA (D-Sub).Hopefully I'll be updating this review after a few months without any issues.
5,It works great love from the Caribbean. Bought in the US but sent it down to the islands for the years of gaming and Netflix to come. One of the most fun things in life is this monitor. It facilitates a lot of gaming and movies.
5,Its a great addition to my set up! Its quality and fidelity are self evident and i honestly have no regrets in the purchase i made. Some of the more technical settings may be a bit cumbersome for those without a background in gaming but youtube and google can very easily fix that void of knowledge!
5,No complaints at all about the monitor. Best $/performance out there.
5,The Hp x27q Gaming monitor is a solid and well designed monitor that delivers a beautifully crisp picture. It is 27 inches in diameter which is the perfect size to display the entire field of play without being so large that you have to wobble your head from side to side to be able to see everything! The picture quality is great. Everything is very clear and the response time is imperceptible. It is optimal for gaming but I’ve also used this to view multiple excel sheets for work browse the web and even pulled up a movie to review the quality. The way the monitor moves by pivoting side to side and tilting are also very helpful especially in our multi member household where I am very short and other are very tall. A simple touch moves the monitor to the ideal spot for everyone. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion.
5,Great monitor for the price. It works well for my gaming computer.
5,I originally wanted a 25" 1440p but I couldn't find any in that size range.The 27" 1440p is really great and text is much more clear than my 25" 1080p.Couldn't find any ghosting or dead pixels on mine.
5,It has everything the item description says. I don't have any dead pixels or other issues. Comes with DP 1.4 cable. I really like the monitor settings; the menu is easy to navigate and the buttons are crisp and tactile. The power indicator light was pretty bright and distracting but there was a setting to turn it off so it's all good. I love that the monitor is nice and clean and minimalistic all black with a simple logo and model name on the bottom bezel and a square base. Doesn't have any flashy "gamer" design.
5,I got this as a Prime Day deal for $170 dollars give or take a few. I think there are very few monitors out there that you can get 1440p at 165hz for that amount. TBH 165hz is a little overkill if you ask me. 144 would be plenty and my current build can't even handle 1440p graphics yet (does come with a DP cable so as soon as I can upgrade my GPU...). It looks nice. I originally had an Asus VA27EHE which is a good 1080p 27in the monitor but text can really be a sore point especially for someone with terrible eyesight like me. So far I really like it. It looks good the colors are good and it actually has a noticeable improvement for gaming. As I said my computer is very budget build. So even though I really want to play 2k GTA V my PC currently cannot handle it and the FPS drops. Even so it still looks good at 1080p. Video looks pretty good too.
5,Love this thing runs 1440p 165hz at 10bits per channel color it does a great job.The colors are great gets 90% dcip3 and does great on response times on UFOTest.I love this monitor so much!
5,I purchased this when it was on the Treasure Truck for $179.99 and I can't complain one bit.
5,$179 for a ips 27 inch 165hz adjustable 2k freesync. I don't care man as long as it lights up I am satisfied
5,And this is HP is the sweetest of the sweet spots at the time of this review.  You can check other competitors like the Gigabyte M27Q Dell S2721DGF MSI MAG274QRF-QD or LG 27GP83B and see what happens to give you the best bang for your buck at the time you buy.
5,It's a 165hz monitor with a 1ms response time outstanding! It's large at 27in anything bigger would really start to look bad at 1080p and up close. Works fabulous the base is sturdy and height is adjustable with a slide up/down and axis tilt. I am and always have been a huge supporter of the HP Brand name and I now have a good reason why that will never change!It has actual buttons you can press not those bad designed tactile sensors you touch on accident and the monitor shuts off. Color quality is sharp and clear the higher refresh rate makes it perfect! Viewing angle is much larger than any of my previous HP monitors (but those were in a completely different price range at either $90 or $120 for 22in and 24in).I am extremely happy with this purchase. I care for my equipment and protect it with quality surge protectors proper maintenance and cleaning etc. I do not for-see any issues what so ever in the near future with this monitor! I recevied this monitor at a discounted rate for my honest unbias opinion.
4,I got two of these and they are the best monitor that i have ever used.I took a star because HDR works but not without a blood sacrifice. Key Ideas are making sure you have the right cables. Cables DO matter especially with docks and adapters. Hours and hours of tinkering and I can't tell you how I got it to work with my Windows desktop. If you're buying this for the HDR don't quit what ever your vice is before this.Once HDR is on these things are stunning. bright high refresh rate and most importantly *don't look like a gaming monitor*. all of this at this price point is just the best.
5,This monitor has great 1440p quality for a very low price.
