4,I was NOT HAPPY my new phone lacked a headphone jack but in hindsight I'm just resistant to change.These make me feel better about my impact on the environment bc I was constantly breaking my old (wired) headphones and re-buying them. So yeah this is more expensive than $7 headphones from Rite Aid but I also have yet to replace them.My main gripes are minor - it doesn't always sit in my ear 100% so I've had them fall out numerous times. It can also be annoying to adjust the ear things - of course you'll need to if they don't quite sit in your ear right but doing so will pause the music unintentionally.They didn't break when I tried using them in the shower but they also stopped functioning right so I took them out. Maybe the waterproof claim was more about just dunking them in stuff. I took the included imagery too literally and was curious.I have yet to figure out how to "go forward" or go back etc by tapping - maybe it was explained in a manual I forgot about though? I wish they would list the instructions here.
4,Almost the best not the worst. Definitely a decent price I've bought several earbuds before and since purchasing these (haven't found the best for me yet unfortunately) and I think these are on par with the top-notch pricey ones. There's really only a few issues that are either fixable or not serious enough to be concerned. The case and the earbuds are white they're more likely to stain with fingerprints or ear wax or whatever but it's nothing too serious. Every now and then it's difficult to tell when the case needs charging. If the buds immediately reconnect after putting them in the case that's usually the cue to put them to charge. Lastly if they're connected improperly they tend to cut out every so often. Not sure if I need to reconnect them or charge them more just something that's good to know.But for the price and what they offer this is a pretty good choice.
5,I bought these headphones because they were cheap and i didn't want to shell out for fancy ones. They're actually my first Bluetooth headphones. That said i really like them. They get good range; i was able to leave my phone on one end of the house and still listen to music while in the other end. I haven't tested the microphone aspect much but it seems usable at least. The only downside is the touch controls. They're pretty sensitive. I find myself accidentally playing music as in putting the headphones away. Some of the advanced controls are totally lost on me like changing volume or skipping songs. The basic play/pause is the only one i use. All in all given these are line a tenth of the price as the brand name ones they're very good.
4,Getting any bluetooth earbud for $12 is astonishing. That said...FOR MUSIC these are quite decent. Like all cheap earbuds you really need to use an equalizer app if you want good sound but out of the box they aren't bad.FOR PHONE the microphone is terrible (unusable) so if you need it for that keep looking.My bias: I am a musician with high-end hearing loss so I already use an equalizer to boost the highs.But even without equalization these are very acceptable.Pros-- Round ear plug (not oval) which I like. Can be worn a couple hours before hurting.-- Reasonable sound quality.-- Three sizes of inserts included to accommodate different ear sizes.Cons-- If they have any active noise cancelling I can't notice it.-- Noise reduction seems entirely accomplished with snug fit though that does work somewhat.-- Microphones really suck for phone calls - have to speak very loudly or just give up.-- Controls are touch-sensitive (not real pushbuttons) but they work.-- When returning to the charger they often fail to make contact and therefore don't charge.  So you have to press them in and make sure the blue light blinks.Did not test...-- Usage-time on single charge
5,I love this set of earbuds!! The sound quality is great they paired easily and connect easily when resuming.My favorite part? The twist and lock feature. Most earbuds even when they fit well...have a tendency of falling out in my sleep or when bending over etc.With these you twist and they create a secure fit..they don't come out until I want them to! And they are comfy..they don't leave my inner ear sore like other brands.  Combine that with a (so far) impressive battery life....and I am in love with them. They are as good if not better than my Galaxy earbuds.
4,I found these earbuds to be very good for the price. They won't beat expensive earbuds but they provide good quality sound with fairly good Noise Cancelling. For me I they get loud enough. The bass is fine but you can always use more. I use them to listen to music TV and audio books. I had a problem with one of my earbuds and I contacted Moistar customer support. They responded within 6 hours and got a replacement set shipped out to me. You can't ask for better customer service.
5,I bought these for my son after he lost his last pair. Since he loses them so frequently I made him pick a pair that was inexpensive enough that I would not get mad when he lost them again. These were his choice. He loved the color and though I thought that was a silly thing to base your choice on I did let him choose after all. When they arrived I looked them over. These are very well made he likes the way they fit and says they are very comfortable. The sound quality is exceptional for budget-friendly earbuds and I know they are doing their noise-canceling feature well because he absolutely cannot hear when I call him and he has them in. We had no issues pairing them all the touch features are nicely intuitive and the battery life is decent too.
5,Honestly I have never heard of this company before but I decided to give it a shot. I am very glad that I did. They were VERY economical and I received them ahead of the scheduled time.They are easy to connect the sound quality is pretty good and I love the fact that they stay in my ears while I run and jump rope and all that good stuff. They do not feel cheap. I like the lights that keep track of the charging. They charge pretty quick and last a pretty good while. I love that they have complete controls (play pause next previous and volume too).The only thing that I would improve on is the call quality. The mic to be exact. I can hear perfect but I can't really speak softly with them. I don't really have to scream but no whispering. But come on . . . I got mine for $13 so I am not complaining at all whatsoever.I also really liked the touch of the seller reaching out to me to see how I was feeling with my purchase and to see if I had received them. Never once did they try to sway me for a good review or anything like that. It was just a pleasant touch that I have never experienced in all my time ordering stuff from Amazon. I've had good experiences before but never this level of attention. It was a little touch that has left a good impression on me and greatly appreciated. Reminded me of actually going into a department store and being taken care of by an actual person.I recommend this product and this seller.Actually . . . I have to all my friends and family. They can get their own though. They're so nicely priced (regularly $14.99 + tax).Take a chance and try these earbuds out. I imagine that the seller would be willing to help if you aren't satisfied.
5,I've had a few cheapie Bluetooth earbuds. This is by far the best set. I haven't used the for talking.However they pair easily sound good  have a decent battery life and don't drop out like others.My only gripe is the touch is so sensitive. I wear a beanie and time I touch my head I accidentally pause my music. Meh not terrible issue
5,I wasn't expecting much from these earbuds but these are the best wireless headphones I've ever bought. I've been using them for 2 days now and still not had to charge them. The sound quality is Great! I work in a really loud kitchen in have no trouble hearing the music even when it's turned down low. Also very comfortable and they stay secure. My ears usually get irritated after having buds in for a while but I haven't had that issue with these so far. For 10 dollars I'd definitely recommend them
4,They were great for about three days and then the right earbud started to get really quiet. And now it bothers me. It still has a little sound but it‚Äôs not very strong.
4,The earbuds work great paired easily and the sound is fantastic. The only issue I've had is they sometimes fall out of my ear even with the smallest tips. They're still great though.
4,They are cheap ear buds not noise canceling at all but I love the sound quality
4,What I REALLY like is the price after my puppy chewed 2 more expensive sets.  üê∂üòÆüò≤There is very little noise cancelled as I can hear really well someone talking in the room.  2 pairs ago this was not true & I had to remove them when conversing.Sound quality is adequate nothing to complain about.I‚Äôd wish the battery life to be like the expensive ones but I understand I get what I paid for.Looking for cheap adequate ear buds?  Get these.
4,That they don't last long and they don't take charge very well or it's slow. Great sound. Wish they lasted at least 6 hours as my last ones did. Great for working out. A run or jog walk with the dog. Great sound its clear cancels noise which is great. Another problem is you can't be far from your phone too far or the connection will go bad. They just need more improvement. I love the design and bass on them. Just need more improvement. So I give it a 4 star. They ship on time not bad.
4,I couldn't get the right earbud to even come on. The company does care about customer feedback they are very interested in keeping the buyer happy
4,Basic headphones...sensitive to touch ...hangs up on calls easily
5,I consider myself to be very knowledgeable on budget earbuds. I've bought at least 20 pairs over the past year and try to stay under $20 bc mine always seem to come up missing (I'm the mother of a toddler and teenager. I blame them. Always.) The reviews on these were overall great and they were within my budget so I figured I'd give them a shot. As far as the noise cancellation goes these are far superior than the other earbuds I've tried. This isn't something I look for in earbuds bc again I have a toddler but now I know what it's like to NOT hear my kids crying whining ect. Idk why I haven't discovered the beauty of noise cancellation before this but now I know it's importance! They fit amazingly well! They are very light and don't budge! The sound quality is phenomenal as well! As far as the waterproofing.. I'm not that adventurous to try them while showering but I will say I was caught in a complete downpour while running today and they stayed in my ears and did not skip a beat! The battery life is also excellent. I haven't kept track of how long they last but it's definitely above average. Both the earbuds and case seem to hold a charge far longer than other earbuds I've bought. I also was impressed with the seller reaching out to me NOT to try and buy my review but to see if I was happy with the product. I've purchased a lot of stuff from Amazon and this is only the second time a seller has reached out to me to see if I was happy with their product. I think that's great business and if there was a problem I'd feel completely comfortable reaching out to the seller. I've only had these a couple weeks but for the price I am saying yes! Buy them already! My teenager and finance have already tried to steal them and they both have earbuds that are known brands and cost significantly more. They were impressed with the quality as well but now I have to hide them all the time. I will be buying more in the near future just to have in case mine do come up missing. I don't think there are better earbuds out there in the same price range. All around I give an A+.
4,This could've been because I have had direct sunlight hit the earbuds but a few days after I got them noise from the right earbud couldn't be heard. Now I have to use the left one only and it has lower quality sound than when I got the pair. I'm perfectly okay with this because this has happened with a few other pairs of my wireless earbuds but not this fast.
5,Had high hopes due to other reviews. Mine will charge but won‚Äôt connect to phone or iPad. Yes I followed directions and have had many Bluetooth earbuds. Bluetooth function will say pairing and never connect. Also much bigger than I thought they would be and hurt my ears way more than ones with a stem do as stem ones are smaller than these. But it doesn‚Äôt matter if they won‚Äôt work anyway. Save for a better pair that workUPDATE***Seller reached out via email offering a refund if I remove my review. Can‚Äôt delete review so updating to five stars.
5,Was pretty skeptical with the price but they've been great. I use them on my long runs training for a marathon. So far they've gone 3.5hrs in very very high humidity and sweat. They don't fall out! Nice and secure. Good sound. I noticed they cannot be far from the phone but since I carry it on me that has not been an inconvenience.
4,My girlfriend loves them. Now I can‚Äôt get her to take them out of her ears
4,
5,I'm pretty surprised about the sound quality... noise cancelation is decent. Battery life I can't speak for yet I only used them for a few hours.UPDATE. I've use these for 9 hours medium/high volume and they've been great. Also love the touch  settings they have.
4,Most earbuds do not stay planted while exercising. This ride well. The aforementioned provided  great acuity while jogging also.  Very cost constructive product.
5,These buds are so good when you are around people you have to take one out the ear due to the quality of noise blocking cause you can't hear if some is talking to you. Love them expecially for workouts.
5,I've had one earbud in for 10 hours today while at work and haven't had to charge it or swap it out. The sound can be a little low but it has been clear listening to various podcasts. Feels really good in my ear. It has not fallen out once. This was a really good pair.
4,The ear buds are nice they could have a little more bass when listening to music.
5,My son loves these. They connected easily to his phone and doesn't fall out like the other ones do. He loves them because it is noise canceling.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†Great distance! I left my phone upstairs went outside was still playing my music! Easy connection and directions My finger does keep pressing pause accidentally though  lol so they are very touch sensitive Sounds ok it's good for cleaning working out exc but could have more base so I'm trying to set my Samsung phone volumes to see if that makes a difference so it could be better But for the price I'm not disappointed! They could be a little more comfortable I have small ears so they are on larger side! Overall not mad you get what you pay for!
4,It's ok.
5,I bought this for my son and we were both surprised at how amazing these headphones performed just as good as my oldest son's apple airpods. The only reason why I didn't get the apple brand for my second son is one because I can't stand the brand lol and two because my second son is always breaking his headphones. But we were  pleasantly surprised that these headphones performed just as good as the high end. So when he breaks these i will be buying more from this brand from now on until he gets a job and can afford to buy his own things üòâ
5,The earbuds are really good and high quality for me. At first it felt really weird and uncomfortable while using them the first time but they‚Äôre actually really comfortable the second day you start using them. The magnets are really strong which make it good for charging and the case seems indestructible  great purchase ‚ô•Ô∏è I got this so I can listen to music freely and to do my work with it.
4,Good quality for the price
5,El auricular derecho se escucha demasiado bajo al uso del tiempo tengo 2 meses con el de uso diario y de repente dejo de funcionar a volumen m√°ximo por 13 d√≥lares tienes unos auriculares para 2 meses de uso diario como m√°ximo 3 meses. No gastes en cosas baratas mejor compra algo de marca de calidad.
5,Great head phones. Nice bass to them. Stay in my ear while working and sweating. They work independently of each other and its easy to switch between them . Would definitely recommend.
4,Was a little hard to get to pair with a transmitter as neither has an interface to select or control the pairing but eventually got them paired.  Sounds good although range isn't as good as I'd like about 30ft as I wear them as I'm doing chores around the house.  Also they're a little bit on the larger side so they don't sit snuggly in your ear.  They'd be very obvious to others.
5,These are the best earbuds I‚Äôve ever purchased they‚Äôre very comfortable & they stay put no slipping out of your ear. The sound quality is so clear that you would think your talking face to face or that you‚Äôre listening to a live band.
4,Works well
5,Sound was good and they work fine only note is that they‚Äôre not super comfortable but it‚Äôs easy to adjust to them
5,The sound quality is great üëç The battery life is outstanding. I actually bought two sets in the month of Aug. 2022 .  I like the fact that I don't have to continually pair as soon as I turn on my computer and put the bud's in my ears it's already connected and ready to go.. I  RECOMMEND THEM to all who want a outstanding product  !!!
5,I work at a loud area and the earbuds are awesome the noise cancelation is a 10 and the sound quality is great they do last along time on battery life also they charge fast being at the price this product is awesome!
4,I like them because of the sound quality
5,I'm was actually surprised. I order 2 pairs for my son and I. They work wonderful for the $10 I paid. Definitely happy with my purchase. Sound is great and lasts for hours.
5,Bought one for me and one for my husband and left earbud won‚Äôt connect for eitherI got them to easily connect now the problem ended up being with my blue tooth not the earbuds. They work great now
5,I bought these earbuds because of the price I didn't know they were this good they sound like top quality unbelievable to good to be true 100 percent great
5,These are great Bluetooth earbuds! The noise cancelling is topnotch! The sound is very pleasing. I can hear on phone calls and my voice comes through clear to others too. My husband got these for me as a present and I am so pleased!!!! Very affordable!
5,Opened last night and quickly paired to my phone. Sound is decent. But for the price why not try these? Love the features too. Impressed so far! Even if they only last a year or two these are worth the price paid.
5,I'm only using these for listening purposes so can't say how they work in conversation but the sound quality is surprisingly good for videos and podcasts.  The touch response to pause is just right - easy to pause easy to unpause.  They stayed in my average size ears very well better than a pair I'd paid twice as much for (these were under 12 dollars).  I didn't test them for noise cancellation.
4,It was damaged only one works fine
3,These are great EarPods. The one negative it has is a major one to me because it‚Äôs so inconvenient and annoying.The pods don‚Äôt disconnect most of the time not even just that but 9.5/10 they just connect from the untouched case.I keep these in my car so I have them when I need them. When I get into my car they automatically connect without me pulling them out or even touching them.I‚Äôve tried opening and closing the case. Pulling them out and then putting them back in. It‚Äôs not a user error. It‚Äôs just an annoying malfunction.Aside from this these are great cheap EarPods!!The noise cancellation was impressive to me when I first got them. They hold their charge very well. They go weeks without being charged if I‚Äôm not using them as much.
5,Gave up Apple earpod to buy this earphone. Great product great value. Long long battery ...
5,Happy so far. Works great and price was amazing. Hear fine through them. I have to get them just right in my ear but once fitted they stay in good. Well worth the money.
5,These are the best earbuds I purchased for teenagers that umm always complain.. both are smiling due to the quickness on charging times and length of use!!
4,I like these they work very well. I had a bit of trouble pairing at first but after abt 20 mins of trying they finally synced with my iPhone. My biggest complaint is the earbuds are a bit too sensitive. If I went to adjust them in my ear it would disconnect the call or change the song I was listening to. I wish there was a manual on how to correct or change the settings s if you know please let know. Other than that I‚Äôd give it 5 stars
4,Not impressed but with the price it‚Äôs not bad.
5,I like the product I received very well The sound of the quality and battery life was very good
5,I love these headphonesthey are perfect for the price. Fast charging easy to use noise canceling and perfect size to fit in purse or pocket.
5,Not the best headphones but definitely worth the price of $12.
4,Bought these because i didnt realized my phone didnt come with an auxiliary port. I didnt feel like investing in a very expensive set of headphones until i was comfortable wearing wireless ones for a while first. These sound okay. Arient high quality by any means but get the job done
4,These earbuds are awesome when taking the price into consideration. Noise cancellation is not perfect but much better than I expected. Sound is fine for music. Again not perfect but definitely listenable.
4,Pros are good sound and very affordable. Cons are they are a bit uncomfortable (but not terrible) and they are not the easiest to pair and keep paired. For the money I would buy them again and again if they break
5,I like the size.
5,No me agrado la calidad al hacer o recibir llamadas se oye muy feo
5,I use my earbuds daily for hours at a time.  So far I've only charged them once and I've used the same one for two days now I love that.  They are a little larger than I expected but it stays in place in my ears once I get them adjusted correctly.  I also like that the battery indicator shows on my phone.  All in all so far so good.
5,These are my new favorite headphones.
5,I am not comparing these to high end options.  They are priced so reasonable I cannot be very mad at them for any complaints.  They are loud and honestly really clear sounding. They hold a charge well and it is not fast charging but they will be ready for you in a decent amount of time. When it comes right down to it for the price that is what I wanted.  What few complaints I had the company supported these so well I feel completely at ease recommending them.  Excellent support from a seller pushes a review to the top level for me.
5,This product worked great for 2 weeks Then it was like the volume disappeared they're all the way turned up and I could barely hear the voice.It's bad when someone talks and completely drowns out your earphones.
5,Would definitely purchase again they work great and sound quality is great too. Can‚Äôt beat the price either.
5,So for the price these headphones get the job done. Solid and battery life is good.Overall I would Recommend.
4,I love the charging station and the fit feels good put the volume just doesn't get loud enough for meüòí
5,I love everything about these ear buds. The price is reasonable. Great sound and charge quickly.
5,This is a fantastic product and has proven to have fantastic sounds quality and comfort. For the price it has performed admirably and I would definitely buy again.
5,Other earbuds like airpods stick out of the ear just enough that the earmuff is on it.  Since these are completely in the ear you dont have that issue.  Exactly what I wanted.
5,The battery life is great and the noise cancellation is also
4,La bater√≠a dura bastante pero el audio se escucha un poco bajo!
5,Worked like the add said.
5,The only problem I had was that it wasnt comfortable to wear in ears. Sound level is perfect. Battery life is long. To keep battery from running down leave outside of case when not in use.
4,Volume could be better there no noise cancelation
4,It's a hair like Skull Candy entry level buds.
5,I really enjoy these earbuds. The case that they are stored in keeps them charged. They have four lights on them that stay lit when fully charged. So when you're done with them you can place them in the case and it charges them.You only need to charge the earbuds in case when the lights go off. Which is one by one Sound quality is superb they're noise cancelling.  The only thing to be aware of is the fact that they feel like they are going to come out of your ears. Which causes you to keep up with them. I always hear about people who buy the most expensive ones and they lose one over and over again.
5,More than satisfied with the product. After purchasing a set for myself for working out in the yard my wife decided she wanted a set too which I ordered and received quickly. She too is very satisfied and enjoys them. Almost thought the price was to good to be true but the earbuds work as advertised.
5,N/A
5,For the price I can't believe how easy and how good they work.  Battery last a long time and case charges quick.. Very responsive and work great..
4,I really like them; I find them just a little bit too touch sensitive and would love if I could fast forward through a song as well. I would love to have them in while I sleep but even when the pillow touches them it responds. The price was wonderful and I would love if you had more colors. Shipping was super fast and I received them way earlier than estimated. Pairing was extremely simply... one and done.... Even the most technology impaired could pair them.
5,The fit of these earbuds are perfect for my ears. Sound and price is AMAZING. I was astonished by the amount of bass and treble when listening to Hiphop R&B and Jazz.Very dynamic sound when watching YouTube videos.This product earn more than five stars. Very well made that I also bought an additional pair for gaming.
4,Amazing price and Sound Quality. I am a Musician My favorite to play is drums if you know drums you know that they are LOUD These earbuds are Perfect for drumming I wasn't expecting High enough Quality Noise cancelation to even play drums with them but these really set the bar! The customer service was great! I received an email a few days after the purchase just to say thank you for the purchase top tier man!2 things to note: I tried showering with them put when I stepped in the water they immediately started messing up so I took them out.2nd They don't feel great for long periods of time to wear I started wearing them and I had some Minor ear irritation.I really do think these are a Great pair I have recommended these to all of my friends I really thank you producers for not making a piece of plastic that makes noise over 75 Dollars Respect.
5,Works great.
5,So far so good great product for the price would recommend
4,I'd make this 5 stars i$ they didn't always fall out of my ear. I was walk outside at work when the left one fell out and it almost got ran over by a car.
3,I tried using these in the shower and the shampoo bubbles seem to have activated the touch button causing the volume to increase decrease pause sporadically.I tried using them on a call with a co-worker and they could not hear me and I accidently hung up on the call  while taking the ear bud out of my ear because the touch area of the ear bud could not be avoided.I have decided to keep them just for listening to music while running or when I know I'm not expecting a call. The sound quality is pretty good and they are comfortable just too easy to touch the buttons.They are not good for using for making phone calls or using around water.
3,The earphones are comfortable and sound great. I have yet to have the age old issue where they wont connect or charge.However If you leave your phone the headphones my sound robotic or staticky. This has caused me to question the phone and not want to use them to listen to things while I clean up at work.I recommend these as a "for now" option before you buy more quality earphones.
5,Works as expected. Battery life a bit shorter but it's fine. Best value I could find anyway. Would buy again.
4,I bought these for my 15 year old. She loses earbuds and headphones quite frequently so I was looking for a pair that were under $30. the price is right on par for the quality! They are a little big but have a great battery life. Easy pairing pretty good sound quality. She has zero complaints and I won‚Äôt be too upset if something happens to them. Win-win!
4,THese are one of the few buds that acutally stay in my ear.
5,So light!!! Rarely fall out of my tiny ears haha
5,Everything is good except at the beginning piercing  the earbuds take really a while to figure it out it‚Äôs very comfortable compared with my another different shape of earbuds it worth the money you pay.
4,Product could have had just a bit more volume which was why the 4 star on sound quality. Why should I even complain when it's priced this inexpensive?The quality was superb. The feel of the product is definitely a much pricier product!
5,These earbuds are great for chill activity. They won't easily fall out of your ear and if you're used to pushing yours into your ears you will accidentally stop your music or hang up your call so I recommend reading the instructions. The description says " full base" but that's a lie these things are not crazy loud but still worth a purchase so I'm buying another pair!
3,These were not for me. They are good. But they‚Äôre not for me. I have small ear holes so these are not comfortable for a long period of time. The audio quality is fair to good. If you are slightly hard of hearing or you like your music loud with base these are not the best ones in my opinion.  They remind me of listening to music with volume limitations. I wanted to like these because of the price but these will be regulated to my back up pair.
5,This by far is one of the BEST pair of ear buds I have ever owned and they were super CHEAP! I was kind of sketchy on the product until I started reading the reviews--- and everyone was CORRECT! I feel like I'm riding in a car with two 15's.. the bass and sound quality is unreal! I can't turn the ear buds up all the way because they are so loud!If you skeptical on this purchase... let me just say... you will NOT be disappointed! The best 12 bucks I've ever spent! ;)
5,I could have used a digital display.... but for thr price these are as good as any.... with comparable features.
4,Worth for the money.
4,bigger than other earbuds
5,Very good for the price literally everything is great I definitely recommend
5,Sound quality is good.
4,Great on noise cancelation. Fits good in ears. Only downside is that your phone needs to be close to you.
5,Nothing
5,better than i expected
3,I like that it was smaller than most but after a few weeks it has played VERY LOW. I charged it thinking it had something to do with the battery but it's still low.
4,I mean they are okay but they don‚Äôt rlly sound as good as I would think but then again it wasn‚Äôt that much so idk
5,El producto lleg√≥ muy bien el embalaje estuvo excelente a mi hijo le encant√≥ la calidad del sonido definitivamente lo volver√≠a a comprar. Gracias
5,As described work properly.
5,The price was great. The battery stays charged for days and the listening quality is awesome. I love them
5,Very good value priced head phones. Clear good sound quality and almost perfect passive noise isolation. Battery life seems to be very good too ( never run out of juice but I rarely use it for more than several hours). The only slight complain (or more of a wish) - is the ergonomic design. After wearing it for couple of hours I can feel slight physical tiredness where the buds are placed. But as I mentioned it's more of a wish than complain for $15 phones!Update: I feel I have to add - after using it for awhile that phones are very stable even at 30-40 ft. and they are supper easy to pair and connect automatically with paired source. It also disconnects automatically when you put it away in a charger. I had to mention it because some people complained about how it's a hustle to do it - not with these phones.Overall it's an awesome phones for the price.
5,These have amazing sound quality and last a while before needing to charge again.. totally recommend it‚Äôs a great pair of earbuds made with great quality
5,I listen to audiobooks and videos at night before falling asleep and I use wireless earbuds so I don't disturb my husband. These work very well and were a great price.
5,I was worried cause the price was so affordable BUT shocked at the quality! They work amazing! I am so happy!
5,fast delivery product as advertised.. very happy with purchase
5,So far so good product is working properly.erly but not so good about noise canceling. Overall a good product at a great price
5,I use them at work all day and never have an issue with battery life. Sound is amazing quality
5,Nice headphones.
3,Disconnects frequently. Even when holding the phone close to them. Takes a long time to charge. Sound is ok.
4,My batteries last me all work day.  Sound quality is decent...not a major audiophile.... sound is drowned in bass nor is it tinny.  Disconnects randomly sometimes but relatively infrequently.  Both buds work well either together or independently. Touch features  work well enough although i don't use all ( like Google  assistant)
5,touch control
5,I was a little hesitant to buy them but after receiving them in the mail I was more than estactic when I realized that I could actually go running long distance without them falling out as well. They are comfortable inside my ears and they never get loud enough to hurt my ears. I love them!!!!!
5,Great product
3,These were fine at first but faded quickly to the point the right bud barely works.  I use them when I bike so I never wear both earbuds but I'm disappointed the right went bad so quickly.
5,Just got these for when i work. Was thinking they wouldnt b that good for 15 but these are as good or better then my jbl that i have. Cant go qrong with these for a low price
4,I bought this earbud because it said they are water resistant. I plan to wear them in the pool but haven‚Äôt had the chance yet. The sound quality is average doesn‚Äôt compare to higher priced earbuds like Samsung or Apple.
5,Nothing it's a great product
4,Is better then AirPods the only thing I dislike is that it kinda of has a annoying voice that says paring or disconnect
5,Performs well nice base if positioned properly
5,Every thing about this purchase was exceptional...Quality & Delivery
5,I love these buds. They are way more than I expected!!
3,It disconnects a lot and then they fall out of your ears as well and sometimes they don‚Äôt charge
5,Great little ear buds! Why spend money on air pods? These work great and my daughter loves them!
4,These worked great when we got them. They stopped connecting to our devices after about 2 weeks. We returned them and the second pair is working great. They come multiple ear pieces.
4,Talking on the phone and listen to music
5,Great product. But most importantly excellent customer service skills. This company will not stop until you are completely satisfied with the product.
4,Sound quality is very clear and concise..nice and loud the way I like it. Fits perfectly in my ears. Battery life is about 10 straight hours of play. Extremely great product
5,The earbuds are  good for the prize. The noise cancellation is amazing.
3,I like them but they are so big they slip out your ear when you move around. They are also very sensitive to the touch.  I hang up on people  all the time
5,Easy to use good value
4,Lil tight in left ear
5,I bought these to help me get through my growing podcasts and book lists. I work in a setting with a lot of noise and I can clearly hear over the noise. They fit comfortably in my ears and I love the touch features.
4,I bought these for my granddaughter i asked to see them one day and i learned they sent me one phony one because the right ear bud doesn't play loudly at all. Other than that their great üëç
5,The sound was too low but they replaced them n fixed the problem
3,I love the ability to tap once or double tap to turn music on/off or switch songs. The comfort level of the earpiece was so-so even after playing with the different sizes. My ears ache a little if they're in too long (not a problem I had with previous earbuds).Battery life is amazing they last a good while outside of their charging case. And the charging case didn't need to be charged until I'd put at least 4 charges on it.If you wander more than 20ft away from the device your connected to each earpiece will start to cut out independently (walking too far away in my own apartment).Sound is middle of the road.I might go back to my old earbuds
5,I paid $12.99 for these. I would have paid $50 knowing now how great they are. Sound is just OK but I use these exclusively to listen to podcasts and sport TV shows while working. They are good enough sounding for that. The reason they are five stars is because you twist them in they never fall out and are very comfortable.  Also the battery lasts all day long at work. Every other pair I've tried maybe lasted 3 or 4 or 5 hours at the most. These last 8 hours no lie. They also connect automatically after being paired. The only downside is they only have a range of about 30 ft. Again that doesn't affect my use at all. I immediately bought 2 more pairs. These remind me of the old Iteknic twist in earbuds. They have exact same shape and charging case. Again if you want to listen to music the lack of bass may bum you out. But for $12.99 these are AWESOME.
3,Good ear buds only problem is can‚Äôt just use one at a time without the other turning back on it will even play while inside the case
5,Super comfy excellent battery life. 2 out of 3 have really good range. 1 pair can barely work if I'm more than 10ft from my phone. The voice is different on that pair that tells me I'm connected so I'm guessing it was a knockoff. The other 2 are amazing and I tell everyone to order them!
5,Man where can I start. These ear buds are not just your average ear buds. I usually just use mine to mow the lawn in. These cancel most of the noise of a lawn mower and the bass is amazing. I absolutely love them and the battery life is really good. I charged them one time and they are still at 90 percent!
3,I don‚Äôt like that you can listen to music outta both of them
5,I bought these to give it to someone who actually loved them right of the box they last really long between charges and seems to be build with good quality materials!! I was surprised to see how these being this cheap perform so good!! You won‚Äôt regret getting these!!
5,I've had lots of it very expensive headphones and the sound quality on these are as good as any of them.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†I was skeptical because anytime I buy earbuds that aren‚Äôt one of the expensive name brands I hate the quality sound and the fit. 1st the feel of them are great. The case they come in are sleek. They look really good. The weight of them are nice they don‚Äôt feel like they‚Äôre cheaply put together. I love that by itself. The sound quality is really really good. I love listening to my jams with these in. When I workout in them I love the way they stay in. Normally earbuds will fallout or hurt my ear holes; these don‚Äôt. The noise cancellation on these it‚Äôs really great too. I can‚Äôt hear anything in these bad boys. If I could‚Äôve given you10 stars I would‚Äôve. Great buy for me!
5,I went to whole foods to get some coffee $16 for twelve ounces. Couldn't get a decent pound of beans if you wanted to... Yet somehow I can get a pair of state of the art bluetooth earbuds for $15. Amazing what the world has come to.
5,Works great! Excellent sound quality! Touch to skip or double tap to stop! Very awesome! Great battery life!
5,Black earbuds are Bluetooth 5.3 as well (not 5.2‚Ä¶at least on the 4 pair I purchased). Bass is very good just be sure to use the largest of the 3 earpiece sizes provided since like all buds deep bass depends on getting a tight seal between the buds and your ear canal (come with medium size installed‚Ä¶try the large size if you can and note the bass difference as you change sizes). Easy to pair and operate and battery life / case recharging is great!  These are great buds for the price!
3,I enjoy the sounds that are produced from the ear buds however it doesn't offer transparent hearing or connects to mulitple bluetooth devices. SO tuning out and listening to music or anything regarding hearing its a really good price for the earbuds compared to some of the named brands you see out there such as Jabra Samsung Apple.. but if its simply not for talking on the phone with its really decent hence this was originally rated a 2.5 stars but I will up it to 3 because if it weren't for so many complaints I received on my end while attempting to have a converse via phone literally everyone I spoke to pretty much had a difficult time hearing me and stating it was too loud in the background.
5,Battery last all night at work asking as I put in charging case on my lunch break for 30 40 mins sound great and can‚Äôt peat for the price
5,Well I like that everytime I went to you them they were charged and they stayed in my ear where others fell out and they last through the whole movie or two and shut off when put back in case unlike others I tried in past I had to manually shut them off
5,This is an excellent product
3,They are perfect for noise cancellation the sound quality is good as well as the battery life; however they do not fit very well in my ears. I would return them but that‚Äôs too much trouble for that one simple issue.
5,The sound quality is very good
5,Love my new buds!! Thank you
4,good for only listening to music
5,No need to spend more for earbuds. If you‚Äôre an audiophile then stick with wired over the ear headphones
5,Excellent for work
5,I am withdrawing my review.
5,FANTASTIC QUALITY
3,Great headphone
3,Not very loud. Don‚Äôt wanna stay in at gym
5,Sound is awesome!  I love these so much!  They are so amazing for the price!
4,Can‚Äôt beat the sound on these headphones for the price you pay for them.  The only thing I wish is the same for all wireless ear buds.  A way to locate them should one get lost.  Like a button to make them beep.
5,I liked that that work just as well as my friend's AirPods that cost a lot more than this item. I bought them especially to go on vacation with people who can‚Äôt sleep with the tv on.
5,Just great!!!
3,Sound quality very low sound
5,I‚Äôve tried more expensive earbuds and these fair better. This is my second pair‚Äî due to having list the first pair which even twice buying these are still  more affordable than a lot of other earbuds. They don‚Äôt break instantly. Sound quality is good you get more and more use to it.
5,I couldn‚Äôt afford to buy expensive ear buds but needed some for my job. I work from home and my calls have to be private. These Ear buds do the Job perfectly. I can hear my clients and they can hear me clearly. I also have been using these earbuds at the gym and the sound quality is fantastic. It‚Äôs not so terribly loud that I‚Äôll bust my ear drums but loud enough for me to get in the zone.These are a wonderful purchase definitely worth the money and well made. And the suppliers have been amazing in sending me message to make sure I am happy with their product. Be sure to give them a good rating if you are happy with their product.‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
5,Great sound and price
5,So far these ear buds have been great easy to connect and great sound. The only con is the touch controls are super sensitive so if you are on a call and have to adjust them in ear theres a good chance you disconnect the call. They do however sound amazing for calls.
4,Bass performance leaves alot to be desired
5,It works as well as some more expensive brands.
3,Great sound but horrible battery life
5,So far So Good !
5,Totally worth the money. Even though they didn't cost very much they are worth the money. The sound quality is awesome. They paired up with my phone so quick and easy. They are very comfortable to wear. One thing I really like is after you pair them the first time everytime you open the case they pair very fast. So far I don't have any complaints.I will most definitely recommend these earbuds to anybody looking for earbuds. Worth the moneyUpdate after using these earbuds for a few days the sound quality is awesome. They have got good bass and while they are not noise canceling they do block noise and you don't have to have the volume all the way up. Love these earbuds. As I said earlier they are worth the money.
5,So far these headphones are the bees knees. I have used them daily since I purchased them 2 weeks ago and I haven't needed to charge the block yet. They are comfortable and sound great. Would definitely recommend.
3,They work as well as they can for the price. They cut out a lot and it's a little annoying when your trying to listen to music and every other word cuts out.
3,They work fine for voicing but not so good for music sounds like listening in a bucket. No bass at all imho. Advertised as deep bass. However my wife likes them to use on her phone and I listen to Youtube so for the price they are good!
5,I got new earbuds because my other ones stopped charging. I needed something cheap.It comes in a thick hard case. It‚Äôs very nice looking. Sound is good. It was weird trying to put them in first but they‚Äôre great now that I got used to them. You have to angle it upwards but they fit a lot better than my last pair. They actually stay in.  They were only $13 so definitely a good deal. I‚Äôm happy
5,Nice for the money
5,They work as advertised
5,They're good for the price and don't fall out of your ears at all. I've even fallen asleep with them several times lol.
3,They are ok depending on what you're doing. No one recognizes my voice though during phone calls when I use them. They come of my ear a lot too. I end up hanging up the call trying to adjust them because the touch control is very sensitive. Battery life is very good though.
5,Great product
5,I just got the earbuds today and so far it has been great.They fit great.The earbuds came fully charged at 100% unlike some other earbuds.Easy to set up.Can use the earbuds separately.The presentation was alright.Sound quality is good though I wished the earbuds had a little bit of more bass thereby I'll rate it a 8.0/10 for sound.Battery life was alright 2-4 hours depending on how high/low you like to listen to your music. I listen to mine between mid to high thereby it lasts me 2-4 hours per earbud because I only listen with one leaving me with a spare to use.Overall I'm impressed with this product and hopefully they can last for a while. HOPEFULLY....Recommend this for those who are looking for budget earbuds despite this product not having many reviews.
4,These sound really good I wish they fit a little better I push him in until I cut off all noise but within a minute they slide out a little bit but for the price I don't think you can go wrong.
3,It's great at cancelling noise. It the battery life is good as well. However I do think the sound could be louder. I want to be able to listen to music at high volumes. I also feel like the tap feature is a little annoying. Anytime I try to adjust the earbuds any media playing stops.Overall it's pretty nice.
5,These are super nice! No way I‚Äôm spending lots of money on an expensive pair. At first I thought they looked a bit bulky but they stay in my ears very well. I recommend!
5,So far my experience with these bluetooth earbuds has been (very) positiveFrom fairly high sound quality to lengthy talk time to ease of operation and a charging box size that's small enough to carry in your pocket!So... if that's not enough I found out to my delight that they span a greater distance from my phone unlike any other bluetooth earsets that I had or still have (over a dozen)These earbuds spanned a distance of over 40 feet from my phone and through walls.. Other units can barely span 30 feet.Maybe that I will update this 1st experience in the future in respect to reliability and endurance
4,The sound quality is pretty good wish it was a little louder. Noise cancellation is not the best I can still here my surroundings which I don‚Äôt like about them‚Ä¶ other then that I love that I can use them together or have just one in my ear.
3,Good design but hurts the ears when using them
5,Syncing kinda sucks you gotta put them back in the case then take them out to connect sometimes but great for the price.
4,Good sound but hard to get the earplugs just right fit for better sound
5,buenisimo  equipo  el  volumen  es  exelente  y  la  caliudad  es  muy  bueno
5,These your speakers are fantastic prices ridiculously low
5,This product is not what I expected. I thought it would be a bad product because of the price tag. I was mistaken this product has great sound quality and excellent noise cancellation. The price tag is unbelievably fine. Overall these set of earbuds are amazing and I would recommend these to anyone.
5,I love these ear buds they are a good buy
5,Sound
4,First day at work with them and one fell in the toilet! Alas it works just fine and still charges. Still wish they would stay in the ear but oh well.
3,I bought these primarily to drown out the garbage that‚Äôs called music played at planet fitness. These ear buds don‚Äôt do a good enough job of canceling out noise. Once perspiration starts they don‚Äôt stay in my ears. The sound is very tinney bass levels could be better. They are definitely worth the price point.
5,I bought these for my daughter and she loves them. I would definitely purchase from this seller again.
5,Good sound quality and great for calls. Worth it for sure! And at a great price üëå
5,Sound quality is adequate for TV audio.  Battery life is around 3-3¬Ω hours
5,They are great :)
4,Good sound quality. I found the battery life was good enough. Fair value for the price
5,Excelente!! Necesito un case extra. Como me puedo comunicar con el vendedor para ver c√≥mo lo obtengo?
4,They are nice fit good but the right ear bud doesn‚Äôt work have the time and it‚Äôs annoying . Not super loud but that‚Äôs a good thing
5,My son ordered two pairs of these one for an extra and so far he is pleased with the fit quality and sound.
5,Could be a little louder but for the price it gets the job done
3,Sound quality is not what I‚Äôd call the best but these earbuds are good for what you pay. They fit a little awkwardly in the ear but once you use them enough you‚Äôll get used to fitting them in comfortably. Microphone quality is also very sub-par from what I‚Äôve been told.
5,I like it so far great for $12 wireless earbuds! Both music and calls works with clarity cannot ask for more.
3,Sound quality not the best they often slip right out if bend or have them in for too long or start to sweat but they hold a charge for a long time
5,Great sound quality. The earphones fit well. No fall out
4,These headphones are pretty good for the price. Sound is good and block out a decent amount of noise. They are comfortable and do not slip out of my ears. The reason i didn't give 5 stars is because they are a bit bulky and stick out of my ears.
5,These work great! Easy to use and the charge lasts a long time. Would buy again!
5,FANTASTIC earbuds. I used them in my bed and with one ear on the pillow and the other with earbud the sounds from my beautiful bride were blocked. As well I was recently in the VA hospital and they worked incredibly good. Blocked out roommate and his family. Great sound and has simple earbud controls whether using 1 or 2 earbuds. The charging of earbuds is amazing and they last a long time without recharge. I would buy again and urge others to purchase these earbuds for not only the price but mostly for their performance.
5,Love love love . They fit peg in my ear and the battery life is amazing
5,Best pair of headphones for the price I've ever had.
3,My headphones were great initially. After a few months the microphone no longer works.This is a pain because I can hear clearly but the recipient cannot hear me at ALL.
3,I guess my ears are too small so they keep falling out good for the price but I'm giving them away and getting something that fits better also as soon as you try to adjust them they disconnect the call
5,This is very comfortable on the ear...- the ear cushion is smaller and fits snug when compared to the average earbuds- the high volume doesn't "break" the ear + good bass- the playback hours are true to the advert- sound is crisp with no crackling during playback- it was tested using mobile Bluetooth (yet to test in the car)Great job team!
5,Very satisfied with these headphones. I can listen music without recharging almost 3 times longer than on previous models I tried so far. Like the design and convenience.Had minor issue with red earbud loosing charge little bit faster than left one. Customer support contacted me and provided refund right away.
5,Bought these after losing my beat headset at the gym. They are light weight and easy to use and understand. But that‚Äôs not why I‚Äôm writing this review. I have three kids so they fight a lot. While driving I decided to bust these bad boys out and put on some 2000 throwback. The volume was low and I still could not hear all three of my kids screaming crying yelling my name all because someone looked at someone or someone talked to another. I definitely recommend these to all parents!!
5,I work in the elements and generally wear a single ear piece so i can call and work simultaneously. I said screw it bought these for 15 thinking i get 2 earpieces for the price i normally pay for 1.  Normally with traditional cheap pieces my ears are killing me after a couple hours. I have left 1 of these in my ear and went to bed because i forgot it was there. The seal in my ear is so good that it basically is acting as an ear plug.For 15 bucks when i break them as long as they last a little while I will buy another one.
3,Este producto fue comprado para ser un obsequio hacia un amigo pero puedo decir que no se ven como en la p√°gina lo ense√±a son un poco m√°s grandes en realidad.
4,They‚Äôre small and will hide well but not very loud
5,I liked the product excellent sound at a great price
5,Quick and simple pairing to the Bluetooth device. Good sound quality. Long battery life. Earbuds stay secure and comfortable in ear during active exercise jogging running etc.  Package include additional 2 set of silicone ear tips for different ear size.  As soon as open the cover of the case remove them they will be automatically connected with Bluetooth device and ready to enjoy!
3,They go in and out . Drop connection..
4,Title says it all really. They are high-quality and inexpensive they are fine for the price and they fit pretty well in the ear.Battery life is fine too charging it up is pretty easy.
5,I struggle to find earphones that stay in my ear. These stay put sound pretty good and are so easy to use! Absolutely worth the price!
4,None
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†It's very nice and cool
3,Doesn't stay connected to Bluetooth well the sound cuts out a lot.
5,Not sure about battery yet but I have only had to charge them when they were opened and they still have battery power.  They sound amazing with lots of bass and cancels out noise around you. They Sound great the fit is a little bulky but is still an awesome set earphones
5,These earbuds work perfectly excellent battery life and sound quality. I am very impressed. Would recommend to anyone who needs wireless earbuds.
2,They did not pair correctly and it seems I am stuck with only 1 or the other ear bud working with sound. They to not pair up together. The troubleshooting booklet is poorly written and says to do the same actions for different issues. It's unfortunate.
3,I liked these but they were too big for my ears.
3,Do not pair together bought a 2nd pair and are the same issues... disappointed
5,Buena calidad lo recomiendo
5,Great sound quality and battery
5,They work for what you need them for! And the seller's customer service is very kind and they ship fast!
5,I wanted some quality ear buds but I didn't want to pay a ridiculous amount of money. These Hikapa wireless buds do everything I wanted out of a quality pair of ear buds. They are great for watching movies or listening to music. I would definitely buy again especially if they had a purple pair.
5,These are great. They work fine for me. I think this was a great buy.
2,Battery life could be better but at least they look nice for under 15 bucks. They kept falling out of my ears without doing anything and the touch just isn't my thing which made these terrible for me.
3,When on a call using the earbuds the call keeps dropping. But overall I‚Äôm pretty content with them because of the price.
3,Not loud enough
2,These earphones have low sound quality and volume almost no bass.  If I could compare it to something I would compare it to the headphones you would get at a $5 below store.  The best thing they do is noise cancelation. However even with noise cancelation you can't hear your own headset in your ear. I wasted money so you don't have to.. Unless you want to.
2,Each headphone connects separately and only 1 works at time.  It's fine sound quality just wish both would work at the same time. Putting them back into the charger box and taking them out has not solved this problem.
5,I have only had these about 4 days now but they were a great buy! So far so good. Sound quality is good and the battery life is AWESOME! My previous earbuds were nowhere near as good as these in regards to the battery and they were super sensitive. With these I don't have to worry about accidentally hanging up on people with the slightest touch. Would definitely buy again if I lose these or something happens to them!
5,Love
5,These earbuds were better than the ones I've had for 7 months. And I paid less for these! They're worth the purchase!
5,Will enjoy
2,One earbud burned out almost immediately but the other one works fine for 10$ earbuds if you want one earbud for at work it‚Äôs worth it but I can‚Äôt speak for whether I got a bad product which is an outlier or if they‚Äôre all trash.
5,7 year old daughter loves these
5,These earbuds stay in. No worries with falling out of your ears and they really provide great noise cancellation. I would 100% recommend.
5,100% recommended good audio quality for the price. they are very comfortable in my ear
5,These sound great and love the touch to operate functions. They fit nicely and easy to store and charge. The battery life is great aslwell. üëç
3,My original review stands. For the money these are excellent. Among the best I've used and I've used at least 10 pairs of different brands. After 5 months of conservative use the right ear bud lost about 50% of its volume. There's no obvious warranty after 30 days so out they go. Good while they lasted. Be advised.
2,they constantly fall out of my ears no matter how often i change the size of the little silicone earplug things on them to make them bigger and fit better. i rated it a 2 because sound quality is good but after a while the case couldnt be unplugged because it wouldnt charge the earbuds otherwise so these earbuds just really really suck not to mention the battery life went down by a ton  and ive only had these earbuds for 2-3 months
4,They sound pretty good for the price. I'm impressed!
5,Everything is great about them unless you care about HD sound.
5,Don't know how they sound or how battery life is. Using these as a pre-amp to connect my phone via Bluetooth to a set of custom bookshelf speakers. Bluetooth works fine. Works fine as a pre-amp
3,Definitely not noise canceling but they're okay
3,But will pair my ancient LG tablet.
2,the audio was really bad and when my hair brushes over it it will pause the music or skip songs. it's a good noise canceling plug though. so
5,Bought these to replace some ear buds that got wash. Great replacement.  Really love them. Fits great in my ear.
5,Great battery life and noise cancelation.
5,My son loves themthey work just as well as his Samsung earbuds
5,The sound quality is great! Can't beat it for the price. Definitely wasn't expecting that. Comfortable fit. 8 hours playtime usually. Can't beat the price!
2,Sound wasn't loud could hear the gym music over my music. The buds are very touchy everytime I went to adjust one of them because they'd start falling out it would either pause turn off or skip the song I was listening to.
3,Sound can‚Äôt be heard by other person during calls
5,Love the sound quality and the nosie cancellation. Battery life is 12-24 hours depending on sound level.
5,Great product for the price. So far no issues
5,The ear buds  have a great sound and charge
5,Sound is ok
5,When I got then I charged them up and then I started using them when I was watching YouTube so good sounds so great
5,Gracias
5,Great product !
2,For the price--- these are not horrible.  I noticed when I was driving or in my car they worked mostly fine (but don't really need them then) but when walking or riding on mower they cut out constantly.  The noise cancelling worked awesome (and they fit well) but the constantly back and forth between ears ultimately means I will return.
5,They work great and are comfortable
5,Battery life is not it said
3,After working great outta the box they decided not to be a pair anymore on day 2 and only play one side at a time and resetting them has no effect
5,Highly recommended
5,Been using them for a month at work and they last for the whole 12hr shift. Sound quality is great. They are small compact and easily consealed in case your work doesn't allow earbuds. Overall great product for a cheap price
5,The ear buds arrived quickly and worked as described. I purchased these for my child but they would also suit an adult. There are easy to use and affordable. I would purchase them again if I ever needed another pair.
3,They are ok at best. I guess for the price it‚Äôs a good backup if your others are dead or misplaced
2,These are very comfortable. Great for listening to music but definitely not for calls. No one can hear me on the other end. I've had to place one in my ear and yell into the other. Do not buy if you need these for phone calls
5,Bought these for a 5-hour flight and they worked really well. Sound quality is great for the price and the noise canceling is also very good. Overall they worked really well through my travels and I anticipate using them more
5,The sound quality is good I really like it and the noise cancellation is amazing it blocks out everything! I really would recommend this product this was my first time buying and I enjoy them
2,The earphones are bigger than the usual earphones and sound quality wasn't the greatest.  You get what you pay for. I was disappointed :(
2,After about a month these have stopped connecting to the charging station.
5,I've purchased several different brands of wireless earbuds and these are by far the best I've used!
5,These have been so great for my kids. They have great sound quality and very easy to set up. I'm gonna have to buy 2 more for my husband and I. Maybe even for some gifts.
5,I recently purchased this item for my elderly neighbor and she absolutely loves them. Once I showed her how to operate them you can catch her with the ear buds in her ears at all times!
1,This was purchased as a gift for someone and I couldn't believe what they were telling me about the device until I tried it today. Well to my dismay this product is crappy; and I'll explain what the person was experiencing with it. First off it wasn't connecting with their phone; they tried it with two other phones and it still wouldn't connect. They gave it back to me; and I managed to get it to connect with my phone. Let me tell you the sound was so low I could barely hear the person on the other end. So next I tried to see how it would sound with music; and the sound was just as bad. Another thing I noticed about these ear buds; was that they would not stay secure in my ear even when I changed the rubber tips. I gave this device a one star because there was nothing lower to give it. Buyer beware of this product; I brought T15 ear buds last year; and they are a whole lot better than these; so I order the person a pair to replace this crappy product.
5,I love everything about them!!
5,This was a gift. No complaints.
5,Really good product for the price. I use them at work all the time now and they last the whole time  I put them in the case on break and I typically work 9 hour shifts.
2,These definitely are not noise cancelling. The highest volume is still pretty low.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                              ¬†Muy buenos
2,The sound volume goes up and down without touching  them. Also they are extremely sensitive for example a drop of rain can touch them and they will pause.
2,I don‚Äôt like the sound i can‚Äôt hear anything of my music
5,Great pair of ear buds the noise cancellation is pretty good sound quality is awesome and this is truly a great pair of $15 ear buds would certainly recommend!
5,I bought these for my boyfriend and I and I love them so far so good no problems. I like that it can be charged by the case portably.
5,Quite Good!  Really!  The clarity charge comfort connection quality are all quite good.  The Bluetooth 5.2 connects reliably and automatically with my Android phone (which has Bluetooth 5.2 also... Though that's not required).
5,Quality construction and super portable. Very nice sound.
3,Was not clear doesn't  stay connected.
5,I would like it to be a little more sensitive but over all amazing for the price.
5,Wonderful so far easy setup easy instructions great sound
2,Good price and fits ok.  It really isn‚Äôt very loud and doesn‚Äôt block out outside noise.Update: one ear bud fell out and was lost while on a bike ride.  Would not recommend
5,For the price it‚Äôs good. Still have a little connection issues. If I move my head to much it loses the connection for a second or two.
5,Adequate sound for price paid.  Holds charge well and work as expected.
2,First they delivered the wireless ear phones to the wrong house. Then once I did get them it took a while for it to charge and instructions were confusing on how to pair it to my phone. Once I finally did get it to pair the ear phones were too big for my ears so they kept falling out. Eventually I ended up losing one of the ear buds after it falling out of my ear and never found it. The only good thing about these ear phones was the sound quality. I went back to wired earphones.
2,These were amazing for the price at first but the right earbud stopped working after a little less than a month
5,Na
2,Okay so first off I am never really one to write a review but I am going to do this one first off they feel cheap to begin with second off the make you‚Äôre ears hurt so bad after having them in for more then 30 minutes third off if you don‚Äôt have the music all the way up then you are barely able to actually head with out this weird static and they are barely noise canceling wouldn‚Äôt buy again not worth the money.
5,use these at night when I go to bed they are well worth the money!
5,Teens live their ear buds and these are a great beginning worn all the time with great play length.
5,Worth the money I‚Äôm very happy with them. If your looking for the best sound quality ever spend more money.
3,Line a lot
5,Sound quality is great and it fits comfortably in the ear. Charges quickly
5,The ear buds are great!! Highly recommend
5,Great for the price ..will order more..üòä
5,If you‚Äôre trying to save money on headphonesI would recommend these. They look exactly like the picture has great sound quality and the battery last.
5,Sound good one bad thing every time take it out of your ears or touch ears bud if keep calling people
1,Well I bought these as a backup headphones set and I tried to use them a few days ago and the right earpiece won't connect. I tried contacting the seller but no response ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. I try using a different brand for headphones but a lesson learned just stick to what I know and buy them in stores.
2,The sound is very low not noise canceling at
5,Good sound and stays in my ears
2,Both ear pieces connected separately meaning for some reason only one works at a time. Then when it is connected it keeps disconnecting and reconnecting alot. And the sound is not that good as well. Would not buy again
1,These earbuds do not have power buttons on them.  You must put them in the case to turn them off and when you take them out they turn on.  This is my 5th pair of bluetooth earbuds and I've never had any that didn't have a power button on them.  I listen to stuff all day and to extend the time I'll use 1 at a time then when one dies I'll put the other in and turn it on.  The only way to do that with these is to have the case with you.Second issue is they constantly disconnect and reconnect interrupting what you're listening to.Lastly they don't just charge when you put them on the case  you have to take them out and put them back in multiple times until the contacts sit just right.
1,Very difficult to do not say impossible to pair with iPhone SE or iPhone XR and when one side connect the other disconnects. What is unbelievable is both earpieces have the same name X9. It doesn't have X9R and X9L for example.Review Update: After I left my review I was contacted by the seller by email offering me if I deleted or modify my review they will full refund me and I could keep the pieces. They knocked on the wrong door. I do not accept bribes buddy.
5,Works
1,If you are looking for a really cheap pair of earbuds these are a great pick. They are comfortable easy to pair but the sound quality is very poor. They work well for phone calls and podcasts but if you are picky about your music quality take a pass on these.
2,Battery life sucks.
5,I brought these for my Mom birthday she loves them.
5,Very nice earbuds
1,These are cheap trash. Both earbuds have sound but only one will work at a time. It‚Äôs impossible to get both to work together. They turn off by themselves. They stop playing music multiple times during a song. Waste of money and I sadly bought 2 so I‚Äôm out over 20 bucks
5,It‚Äôs just me taking it out of the charger. Big Fingers‚Ä¶
5,I love the quality of the ear bud
5,Very pleased with purchase sound quality is very good the buds are very sensitive to touch.
5,Almost compared to Beats
2,Sound was great for 4-1/2 months until the left one quit working
5,These are REALLY nice for the price. BUT the sound is 1980's.
5,The best wireless Bluetooth headphones I have ever purchased.
5,Better than I expected
5,I got these for my son when he works he said they were awesome
1,Horrible... the ear buds won't stay charged!!! They disconnect and reconnect on it own and my Bluetooth is always on. My right ear buds stays saying it's on 10%. It's been in the case/ shell all day. The case/ shell stays charged. Horrible device!!!
5,Smooth sound easy to use
1,I didn't like the fit my husband did but neither one of us could get both of them to work at the same time. Sound would only come out of 1 ear piece at a time.
5,They work very well
5,They fit great and work better than my last pair.
1,No like the left side came to connect the right never connects nor does the red LED turn on for connection I left it charging.  and today it does not connect to the phone.
1,I got these to use when jogging.  Anytime I turn my head to the side up or down the audio becomes garbled or cuts out.  I cannot seamlessly listen to anything while exercising.
2,You get what you pay for!
5,Great sound
2,It doesn't fit in my ears and I didn't get to use them.
1,One of the earbuds never worked/connected. The other bud that did say "connected" never played any other sound other than that one word.  I bought another cheap but more expensive pair at a local store.  Money wasted. I'm sure that the returns process would have frustrated me so I didn't bother.
1,They don't cancel noise and only one worked. Both headphones connect separately and when both are connected only sound comes out of the one you connected first. Sound quality is bad as well
2,If you go one or two rooms away from your phone the connection is terrible. Also sometimes when you are next to your phone the connections cuts in and out. I returned the earbuds.
1,This product was of very poor quality  doesn't  work poor sound quality and charging.Don't waste your time and money on this itemx9 ear buds.
1,When I first got them they were great! So loud excellent battery life ect. But after day 4 Idk what happened you can barely hear them even with the volume all the way up! Sound quality went down the drain asap.
1,Mine came and one of them didn‚Äôt charge or turn on and they are literally a waste of money do not buy these for the sake of your bank account!!!!!!!
1,These are terrible and they don't stay in my ears at all let alone they don't both connect at the same time
1,One thing I hate more is when a product you order isnt one hundred percent working. The right ear bud wasnt working and would not charge. So only one ear bud works. Be cautious when buying a product thats cheap. Look nice. But looks are deceiving.Came back and gave it one star for seller doing nothing to fix the problem!!
1,Only one earbud works at a time and I had to connect the earbuds separately. They don't work together at the same time
1,I was excited to use them. but I was disappointed. one side doesn't work. maybe it's because of the price. but I'm going to keep them and I know it was a bad chance. I will have to buy another brand since I would like to have my first hearing aids.
1,These earbuds are so strange. One side would work perfectly while the other side wouldn‚Äôt. Totally disappointed with this! Not going to purchase again!
1,After a full charge they only last about 30 minutes maybe 45.
1,It was very hard to give this a rating due to the left earbud being louder than the right earbud
1,the sound it not so  good i had for 3 mouth and the  sound is so lw it so hard to the music
1,Right guys I was happy with the sound of this thing. Now (after the return/exchange buy date) the right earpiece volume has suddenly become terrible soft.So don't buy it. unless you understand it will only work well for 3 months. (and you only have 30 day return)
1,Left ear bud never worked.  Was gonna cost me half of what I paid for them to send back.... so I'm just stuck with silence on the left
1,I had high hopes because of the reviews but these dont hold a charge and the sound is TERRIBLE
1,Stopped working
1,I loved them at first great sound. Nice fit but after only 2 months of use the left earbud suddenly stopped working properly. (You can barely hear anything at max volume) the right one works fine still and super loud while the left one is like a sad whisper as I sadly whisper to myself‚Ä¶ why did I buy these‚Ä¶
1,One of the earbuds don't work and won't charge
1,Was not the best quality. Calls were echoed.
1,no photo
1,Brand new out the box and the left earbud did not work.
1,The sound sucks. Plus I can still hear the TV with these in. They are cheap for a reason
1,Garbage didn't work spend more money and get a quality product sent back for a refund
1,Could not get blue tooth to synch to my iPhone.  Useless
1,The sound quality is horrible and only one of the earpieces worked.
1,I wish I could give it zero stars. Terrible product and terrible customer service.
1,Says it‚Äôs waterproof got wet. Left one no longer connected and looked like it was leaking battery acid after sitting in the case
1,The worst headphones I have used for blocking outside noise. Music sounds fine but you hear every noise around you conversations etc. I wear headphones on the subway to block noise these don't cut it even when blasting Skinny Puppy at full volume. Would not recommend.
1,This product was Trash!Always hanging up calls
1,The right ear bud will not turn off it is staying on lit therefore not allowing it to pair even when I take it out.
1,Dislike if your out of range then get back in range the volume always maxs out.
1,Even when they are fully charged they would just automatically disconnect and turn off
1,I don‚Äôt like them whatsoever. They‚Äôre super sensitive to touch and hang up my phone calls. They‚Äôre not very loud either. Save your money
1,Garbage quit pairing after one use and when it did pair it only worked in one ear you get what you pay for I suppose
1,I ask in the questions if it would work on a Bluetooth capable TV and seller said it would. IT DOES NOT WORK ON A BLUETOOTH TV!
1,If your phone automatically starts playing audio when a Bluetooth headphone is connected you are asking for sudden and permanent deafness.
1,The volume sux pile of trash going in the garbage
1,Wanted for my TV did not work.
1,Pasada una semana no se escucha el derecho
1,Theses earbuds are horrible  the sound quality is a joke noise cancellation is non existent and battery is ok
1,Don't hold a charge very long at all. Very unsatisfactory. I would not recommend them at all
1,I couldn‚Äôt get the earpiece to stay in my ears at all
1,Dislike
1,They do not work.. period.. poor quality
1,Not that very loud
1,One works only
1,didn`t work
3,The fit is uncomfortable
5,great quality. noise cancellation is awesome! battery life is good. i went three day witjiut charging and they still on decent battery percentage.
3,These are good for a great price unless you want to use them for calls. I can hear clearly but they can't. This important to me so that has been frustrating. Most of these deeply discounted ear buds aren't good or even doable in this area. I keep hoping to have better luck. But never so far. :(
5,Could be louder but for $10:they are great!
5,I was getting tired of my on ear wireless headphones I had JBL wireless earbuds but my dog chewed one and I didn't want to spend an excessive amount of money on another pair. Found these earbuds and I was amazed at the quality. The pairing was very simple the sound quality was clear the connection to my Galaxy S10 was seamless and strong. You can use one ear and keep the other in the case I thought that was really useful. The battery life was impressive (I did a sleep meditation and it lasted all night) the only thing I would complain about (and this completely subjective) is that the touch commands on the earbuds are very sensitive so if you accidentally touch the earbud it will pause thus disrupting workout tunes. 9.5/10!
5,Thing is I bought 3 other earphones that cost 3-4 times the price of this and this sounds better lasts longer and stays in my ears better... Will definitely be buying one or two more on the future the battery life is really good especially for the long hours at work I do definitely recommend..
2,After a couple weeks of use they now keep disconnecting and keep turning off.
2,Had for a month and now only one earbud works. They also take a long time to get the sounds up once I start using the earbuds.
5,LOVE these earbuds!! Yes asI stated in my title I wasamazed by the SOUND!!Very LOUD~~ NOISE cancelling works VERYwell and the BASS is AWESOME!! FIT my EARperfect and are lightweightand comfortable too!!WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND to me theySOUND like they are HIGH END especially because Ionly listen to Rock andheavy metal music!! Bluetooth connected instantly and so far I haveat least 40 hours on 1CHARGE!! ORDER NOWbefore they are gone!!
5,These headphones definitely do the job for me to stay in my ears the sound is great and the battery last for what I need it for
3,Buena reproducci√≥n de sonido p√©simo para llamadas el micr√≥fono suena muy mal tanto as√≠ que las personas no entienden lo que se dice por llamada
3,Buena reproducci√≥n de sonido p√©simo para llamadas el micr√≥fono suena muy mal tanto as√≠ que las personas no entienden lo que se dice por llamada
5,Using them for work headphones. And I'm happy with them.
5,Incre√≠bles y s√∫per econ√≥micos la pila me dura casi 2 d√≠as us√°ndolos por las de 12 horas al d√≠a
5,Muy buen sonido y mucho tiempo de duraci√≥n
4,Love how easy it is to plug in and charge
5,I paid under $10 for these and I really like them. the sound is good they for the price you really can't go wrong.
5,I use it for school
5,Theses are great if your wanting to listen to music and on a budget the sound is clear and I can go around the house with my phone and still listen t music if  I want tune out my surroundings they do just that and my family can't here what I listening to as well I'm very satisfied
5,Ligeros y muy buen sonido bater√≠a muy extensa
5,La calidad de sonido es muy buenap
5,I've tried those earphones for few days right now  sound quality is very good  using one piece a great option specially if using it while driving. It has voice command  very easy to pair with android phones  and iphone and you can connect to Alexa or Google assistant too. Battery life is reasonable depending on what you are really using it for. Fits easily and one of best things about it that it doesn't drop of your ear. Charging case is very compact size and fast chargingusing type c charging cable ( included)All in all I'm happy with it.
5,I LOVE the sound quality appearance and size of these buds .I now consistently tap my bud once and utter "WHAT!?" to my mom as she nags or starts conversation (even when i tell her i have them in lol). THANK YA HIKAPA YOU'RE THEE BEST !!! So if you're still wondering if you should purchase these today the answer..is..100% 10/10 BUY IT AGAIN.
5,I loved that they are loud and kept charge for very long
5,My 16 year old is very picky with his earbuds. He's autistic and uses them to listen to calming music or videos when feeling anxious. He loves them! Great sound for the price!
4,You should really give these a try. I don't spend a lot on ear buds so I decided to try this pair. So far this has definitely been worth the money. They fit well in my ears and that says a lot because my ears are tiny and most buds are uncomfortable but these are not. They don't fall out and are comfortable. They paired easily with my phone. The only little thing is getting them to fit in the case so the charging light is on. I'm still figuring out what works but so far I have not had any charging issue. I would definitely recommend these.
4,Cannot use these earbuds underwater. The moment you go underwater the Bluetooth shuts off. I don't doubt they are waterproof but you cannot swim laps.
1,Headphones doesn't shut down automatically when put down into the charger box which ruins the whole experience that is the only reason why I wouldn't recommend these. Otherwise great for their price. Otherwise I would give 4/5 but one rotten apple spoils the whole barrel as the saying goes.
5,I already bought others for my fianc√®. Good quality good price.
5,These earbuds work very well. Of course they are not AirPods but they do work well for the price.Pros:- They are very easy to connect- They have good noise isolation - surroundings are very quiet when using these (passive noise cancellation- They have a comfortable fit- The addition of play/pause and volume control is a nice benefit- They charge quickly- They have a sleek compact case which also seems quite durable- USB C charging is a helpful addition- Good LED lights for indicating charge on the case- Good LEDs for the earbuds - showing charging status pairing etc.Cons:- They can be a little finicky to put into the case for charging - you just need to make sure the LED light is flashing red before closing the case and putting them away- The touch control on the earbuds is a little too sensitive and it is easy to mistakenly hit the sensor when adjusting them in your ear- Occasionally I heard a faint beep in the background of what I was listening to - it was not that noticeable but it was presentOverall for the price I would be hard pressed to find a better set of earbuds. These definitely get the job done. Probably the nicest feature is the noise isolation.
4,Let's get one thing out of the way immediately. These are not top tier bluetooth buds. The sounds isn't as punchy or bass filled as other premium buds. With that said these connect easily and the sound is beyond acceptable for 10$. I had to charge them up properly before I used them but once charged they connected flawlessly. Also the charge didn't take long. Haven't checked battery life but I will in the coming days.
5,Worth the money
5,I really like these. This is my second pair. I can highly recommend them. I have hearing loss in my right ear and can still hear with these. I also have small ears so the fact these fit comfortably is a huge plus. Now the reason these are my second pair is I like them so much I carry them everywhere. I was super tired and left them in my shorts pocket. I ran them through the washer. They got super hot when I fished them out and they will not charge now. That was my own fault and not the first pair I have killed to this way. I have worn them in the rain and can attest that they are water resistant anything with holes for the sound to get out will not be water proof. So do not toss them in the washer and expect them to keep on working. Overall well designed for a good price.
5,Good quality for the price
5,This s amazing for the cost and the company was amazing.
5,These headphones are amazing and they are good quality
5,These earbuds come ready to use from the box very simple to use and sound totally wonderful I'm s very happy camper.
5,These earbuds do a lot of different functions they are made nice and come with different ear .pieces ..the volume is ok..but not super loud ..but then again what I paid for them .what do you expect!!  But made nice .and case is nice too
5,I love these head phones. I have used them everyday for any activity. The sound quality it impeccable and they're very comfortable in my ear. I would definitely recommend this product.
5,These are such a great product!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†It felt just like any other earbuds they are small and comfortable. I like the way they feel almost like noice cancelling because of the eartips. They stay on properly and they are touch no clicking that's another plus. You can change the volume pause and skip back and forth though songs and summon Siri. What I liked the most is that it turns on and connects automatically when you open the case and turn off when you put them away. And the ones I've had before disconnect from each other and I haven't had that problem so far. If I had to say one thing that I didn't like is that it doesn't turn off right away when you put them on the case but that is obviously not a problem. Pretty good bang for my buck.
5,I bought the headphones for my husband and he doesn't take them off anymore!  He loved the quality and especially the battery life.  I recommend these headphones
2,Good sound but everyone tells me they'd barely hear me when I'm making/answering calls with the earphones.
5,I love my earbuds. The sound quality is awesome!
5,Love it
5,very noise canceling easy to work it without using a phone i‚Äôve only had to charge it once in the countless times i‚Äôve used it and it hasn‚Äôt gone under 2 bars. stays in super well too
5,Very nice. I use the biggest ear cushion for maximum comfort.
5,Bom
5,They are exactly what I was looking for
5,sleek design. Easy pairing.
5,Compact earbuds are magnetically secured to case which makes it harder to lose touch interface on buds makes it easy to control music and calls fits well in the ears
5,The battery lasts forever and they are everything I could ask for out of a set of ear buds .
5,My sister loved it and looked better thank what I expected
5,I bought these for a replacement for my granddaughter. Excellent product and great sound!
4,My kid loves em.
5,My son is always losing his ear buds so I refuse to pay too much for them anymore. These are great quality though especially for the price!
5,Very Good Sound For The Money
5,Excelente
5,I had really low expectations when I bought these. I use earbuds all day at work usually 10+hours a day and lose them often so I bought these figuring they'd probably suck but I wouldn't feel so bad losing them. Turns out they're actually great! The battery lasts most of the day and I only use one so I just switch out. The case recharges them quite a few times before needing to be recharged. I'm honestly astounded at the battery life. I can't say much about the sound quality since I only use one at a time to listen to podcasts but they have good volume. I drive a very loud truck with the windows always down and work outside and I can clearly hear what's being said. I've had others that weren't loud enough to compete with my surroundings. My standards are pretty low but they suit my needs perfectly at a price that really can't be beat. I've managed to not lose these for a little over a month now but I know that when I do I'll definitely be buying another pair of these.
1,Only one of them work. Other than that they‚Äôre great.
5,Excellent earpods
4,Buen sonido  unos entrecortes al principio pero ya no haber si la nueva version lo hacen mas peque√±os son un poco grande  pero tiene mucho volumen solo el tama√±o me gustaria mas peque√±o .limpiar la parte metalica con unos palitos de metal o madera porque se tapan con el sudor de la oreja y no cargan solucion es esa limpiar la parte metalica para que se cargen bien
5,El producto es excelente me gust√≥ mucho. Se siente bien no son molestos al o√≠do. El sonido es mas que bueno tiene buenos agudos y graves. La cancelaci√≥n de ruido pudiera ser mejor pero no esta nada mal. La bater√≠a le dura como promete esta excelente. Estoy muy satisfecho.
5,Pros:- Extremely professional seller; they proactively contacted me after the buy to inquire about my satisfaction. This alone turned a 4-star review to a 5-star review.- Good sound quality.- Passive noise cancellation due to the design of the earbuds. For anyone planning to use this while exercising/driving/using the metro remember to always keep one ear free at all times.- Comes with small/medium/large rubber earbuds.Cons:- Took a bit of time to set up the earbuds. Left side especially had a harder time connecting but the issue was resolved in 10 minutes.- Case has a hinge with 3 set positions it seems: closed barely open and open. Feels a bit fragile going from barely open to open I worry about breaking it.- 2-4 hour battery life is relatively short for headphones.
5,These earbuds works excellent stay charged a long time sounds great happy customer.
5,Good
5,Nice
5,I love the features. Very user friendly. I used it for calls and listening to my YouTube programs.
5,For me better then my iPods
5,These are just as good as the name brand earbuds. I had to buy me a second pair. You can make calls w/ voice turn sound up did I mention they sound great. I lost one earbud to my first pair and I was too hurt. But with that one it still sounded and worked great.
3,Battery on case can last damn near a week. But‚Ä¶ they are a bit Uncomfortable after 30 or so ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è3/5
4,Good quality sounds and ok quality earbuds
5,The best I mean the best earbuds. Reliable durable and comfortable. Worth way more than they cost!!!
4,Sounds good for me to wearing during workout
4,Added bigger ear tips better sound.
5,I got these for my daughter after she lost hers at school and she LOVES them. They are great quality especially for the price.
5,My mother wants earbuds and this was great price easy to pair to her phone.
5,I love the features and easy to use and connect with iPhone or Samsung. It works perfectly.
4,Not loud enough for factory workers. Besides that they are great
4,These are different than the last earbuds that I had... two things that big new about these is.. you have to disconnect your Bluetooth BEFORE you can press and hold and turn them off.. you don't know how many times they've just been ON in the case because I thought they would automatically turn off immediately. The other thing is my fault but I have dropped them a couple times.. like they have fallen out of my pocket and out of their case and out into the floor.. and now the right ear bud is SIGNIFICANTLY lower than the left one.. I can still hear it but its so low. So no matter how much I turn it up the left one overpowers it. It's so annoying.. like being in the car and only half the speakers work. If it wasn't for the noise canceling and snug fit still working pretty good I would only half one good earbud. So...yea.. try not to drop it too much. But I'm not made for the price.
5,Very happy with the earbuds.To be honest for the price I was expecting much.  But I have to say I was wrong.  They are just as good as other earbuds I have brought for 50 bucks and even sound better.  Like I said before I am very pleased with eae earbuds and for the price you can't beat it.I'll be getting a pair for my friend because I think that are that good.I think you will be as pleased as I was once you get a pair.
5,Easy to put on and connect
5,Excelente!! Se escucha muy bien a√≠sla bien el ruido y la carga dura bastante. Son c√≥modos y livianos. Super buen precio!!
5,Sounds good could be a little louder last a long time
5,Not bad for the price.
5,Love the sound quality for the price
2,You can‚Äôt even touch it to maneuver on your ear before it cancel out your call this shouldn‚Äôt be so easy to hang up a call I‚Äôm so frustrated because the ear piece do move a little while wearing
5,I bought them for my son as a gift he takes them to school and he said the sound quality is pretty awesome and the battery life lasts for quite awhile I recommend these
5,They are the best
5,So far so goodThey are not one of the big namesBut big names are generally big moneyFor the price they work well and sound pretty decentBut ifYour a picky ass for name products then don‚Äôt buy
5,Not much to say they have great battery life great range  are pretty small and do exactly what they're supposed to for a pretty low price.
5,Good bang for your buck
5,Works great  use for 8 hour two days a week
5,Perfect fit . Work great
5,No espera mucho por su bajo precio pero al probarlos son muy buenos pero si se sientes  muy fr√°giles con su pl√°stico me gustaron mucho.
5,Easy to tap and pause while I'm out walking the dog.  Nice deep loud sound.
5,Really good for the price not the most noise canceling but they‚Äôre great for hikes or the gym!
5,This works like a charm. They last for a long time before you have to charge them again and they fit comfortable in my ear. It is kind of annoying when I have to adjust my earbuds and accidentally pause the video but other than that it's great
5,Battery life
5,I am still trying to make these dang things pair up. Only the right ear bud works and the left just continues to blink red and unable to connect.Several attempts of unpairing and re repairing  seemed to do the trick a little time consuming and required a little patience but finally got it working together.
5,They were a little bigger than I expected but the sound quality and battery life are great for the price!
4,Okay ive been using this now for about a month and so far its okayLikes: great battery lifeNice compact caseOkay soundDislikes: sometimes while im running or just walking with them on the sound will get distorted.A bit uncomfortable to have in the ear for a long stretch.Isnt that loud or noise cancelling but for the price not a surprise.
5,I like it a lot .
4,Aside from the 4th light not matching the other 3 (looks smaller and off white lol) great buy. Glad it came with a charger port as my phone and small enough to fit inside a small pouch
5,Bought these for my kids....I tried them out once & thought they had a pretty good sound quality! The battery seems to last a while between charges.
5,Works great and so is the price!
5,It is small & comfortable works great and easy to use. I appreciate the variety of sizes of earbuds to change. sound is also good and its touch.
