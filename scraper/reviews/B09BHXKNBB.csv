5,I was looking for headphones to start working out more regularly. I needed non noise-canceling because I never want to drown out background noise while Iâ€™m outside or even in a gym setting. Iâ€™ve seen several people complain about that on other reviews and I wish them safety. Noise canceling has its place but for me working out isnâ€™t one of them. The sound quality is really good for the price and itâ€™s very comfortable to wear even while jogging. I have a slightly small head so the ear piece doesnâ€™t wrap around snuggly but this doesnâ€™t impact the sound whatsoever. I can put a beanie over them and itâ€™s still very comfortable so that willBe excellent in winter time. I also have taken phone calls with this headset in the middle of the woods and the call was very clear. If you are looking for a comfortable headset for working out that lets some background noise through for your own safety give these a try. They also hold battery very well.
4,These headphones are good for everyday use. Please be warned I don't use them for music I mostly use them to listen to podcasts while doing routine work.Here are my observations:Ease of use:They are really easy to pair with your phone. I really like the controls. There are five buttons that are really easy to identify. The center button serves to play/stop media and to answer/hang up the phone function. The up and down buttons are for volume and the front/back buttons are to forward and rewind. These are buttons not surface you need to tap. There are small dots on them to easily find them. I rather have buttons than touch surfaces. They provide real feedback when clicked.Sound:The sound is really good for voice. I am not an audiophile so I can't judge how good they are to reproduce music. All I can tell you is that they are excellent to listen to podcast or to talk on the phone.Phone:Talking about phone. The operation is clear and I use them all the time to answer the phone. Both mike and speakers work just fine.Noise cancelling:These are NOT noise cancelling. You will hear the environmental sounds. Something I like since I like to be aware of my surroundings. If you are looking for noise-cancelling headphones these are not for you.Battery life:I have used them for several days between charges.Comfort:You forget you have them on. One day I had a doctor's appointment. When the time came to see my ears the doctor gave me a quizzical look. I realized that I had my headphones on!Durability:The only objection I have is durability. The two headphones are linked by a plastic tube. It may be strained during use and the joint between the tube and headphone may break. This is not the first pair of headphones I buy. However even though they break I think they are worth having. If it wasn't for this issue I would give them 5 stars.
5,Not what I expected.  The picture clearly has them open but mine just fold up.  Won't stay opened. After I charge them  I'm gonna try to connect with my mp3 player to see if they work right now they won't connect to anything in am assuming it's bc I just got them today and they aren't charged.  I will fix my review once I get them working and and let ya'll know about the battery life. I've been very disappointed in my past purchases of headphones bc within 4hrs out of a 9hr day  they died 2x. Hope these will be different. ðŸ¤žðŸ¤ž UPDATE:I got them to connect with my mp3 player with no issues.  I played from 6pm-2am without it dying.  It also stayed on my ears with my glasses. I didn't cover my ears completely  bc I wanted to hear my surroundings.  Excellent buy.
5,My husband bought these for himself because his Beats headphones are too big and bulky for wearing outside doing chores on our ranch and in-ear units tend not to stay put in his ears. After using them for a week he bought a pair for me as well and we both really like them.Pluses- Lightweight- Easy to pair- Easy to use- Very fair price point- Very portable. Love how they fold over on themselves and easily slip into a pocket.- Very comfortable- Work great for listening to podcasts music and audio books and even for phone calls which surprised us both given the lack of any visible microphone or boom.- Ear pad covers seem to stay dry even when weâ€™re outside working and sweating in 100 degree weather. And an extra set is included which is nice..Minuses- Not the best sound quality for phone calls. Could use less mid/low range and more high range but more than sufficient for our needs. This is a bit surprising since music sounds very well balanced across the spectrum.- Volume could maybe be a bit better but thatâ€™s probably nitpicking. Aside from full over-the-ear headphones like Beats itâ€™s tough to find anything with enough volume to hear well when youâ€™re driving a tractor!- Would have been nice if they included a case to protect them during storage and transport- You donâ€™t buy headphones like these for noise cancellation. If thatâ€™s what youâ€™re looking for then youâ€™ll want to look elsewhere and youâ€™ll spend much more for high quality noise cancellation (Bose Beats etc.)Unknowns- Havenâ€™t had them long enough to determine battery life. My husband only uses his for an hour or two per day but heâ€™s going to start using them for conference calls so weâ€™ll see how the battery holds up. I use mine for an hour or two of chores each day and plan on using them for at least another two or three hours per day listening to audio books.- Quality seems very good for this price point. Only time will tell if they hold up.
5,I buy them because I like bluetooth headphones but headphones that go over my head hurt my head and I don't like headphones in my ears.The battery lasts so long I honestly forget it *has* a battery and doesn't just magically always run and I get annoyed when it gets low after several weeks.Really a great product. I bought a pair of in-ear headphones a while back because this was out of stock  and then bought another pair of headphones that were *like* this but had an FM radio and an SD card but weren't as good.I much prefer having the much longer battery life on these over the possibility of FM radio and an SD card.The only problem I've had with them is that my kids love to pull on them and they break. When that happens I buy another pair if I can.DISCLOSURE: I was promised a $10 Amazon gift card in exchange for my objective review.
5,I love these! I use them for remote/ facetime horse riding lessons. Ear buds stressed me out before I even got started- I have to shove them hard into my ears to prevent them from falling out but then I lose all sense of sounds that is surrounding me which is important when you are on a horse Outdoors. Often they fell out I lost the cushion one day I could not turn them on at all and that makes it very difficult to stay focused.These above ones are awesome. They are comfortable sit lightly around the top if your earlobe and are connectd in back ; the sound quality is excellent I can still hear a little bit of what is going on around me and so far they have not failed me one second. Audio / microphone works great. Can highly recommend !-for the price super happy
4,I like that these are wrap-around headphones since earbuds do not stay in my ears when out walking or jobbing or mowing the lawn.  The sound is good for listening to podcasts and music but don't expect any hi-fidelity for the music. They do a good job of delivering the sound.  The only drawback is that they are a little on the small side and don't reach comfortably from the back of the neck to the ears. They just make it but could allow for another inch of reach.
5,Just got these today. Took them put and immediately paired them with my s22 ultra. Easy peasy.I was looking for Bluetooth headphones for the gym. I HATE ear buds. I bought a pair similar to these a couple of years ago and ended up returning them because they were too small/tight around my neck. They barely reached my ears. These fit perfectly! I'll see how they do at gym tomorrow since they didn't arrive in time to come with me today.
5,I have been looking for this product all my life .. Finally a product that makes me hear my surrounding while being able to enjoy the much without something sticking inside my ear . If you are looking for noise cancellation this product is not for you. This product is meant for those who prefer to hear their surroundings and gentle on the ears. It is very light you don't feel it. I will buy another just incase they might it may discontinue. what's also nice it comes with extra cover foams which doesn't seem to break at all anyway. Love the product I use it for ice skating and running.
5,I have had several pairs of these.  I have to replace after 2 years usually.  But they're totally worth the price.  It's a real quality sound.  The noise cancellation isn't that great but I don't need total noise cancellation as I use these at work and I need to hear stuff going on around me. The battery life lasts all day. I will continue to buy these as long as they continue making them!
