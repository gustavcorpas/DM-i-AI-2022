5,I would like to mwntion  the feature where you can press a remote button to take a video or a picture. This is easy to do you don’t even have to download an app. I have an apple phone and all I had to do was go to General and Bluetooth and it automatically was listed. This was very convenient. You have to touch the remote button on the remote a few times to get it to turn on. Then on your Apple phone select camera and then photo or video. Click the button again on the remote and it will record or take a photo. This feature is extremely convenient when you have your phone in the tripod because then you don’t have to manipulate the phone in the tripod to take touch the button on the phone to select photo or video. The product comes with a book on how to use it. Make  sure that you press the circle button on the tripod to adjust upwards or downwards. I like how I can adjust The tripod in any position when creating videos including close-up.
5,- Sturdy- Everything adjusts with a quick twist and tightens firm.- Angled joint is push of a button.- The arm is stiff and holds well.- Vertical extension- Very easy to set up easy to move.I have a Samsung s5e tablet and a galaxy s10 phone. Tablet is 10.5in screen size and 14.1oz. Mount has no problem with it. I move the mount from my desk to my bed and it is quick and easy.The part that holds the device has a button to extend the support width. Thus mount is easily adjustable to fit both.Would buy again or as gift if I overheard someone needing one.
5,We bought this for when we travel so we can have a place to hang my sons tablet on pack n plays. Now that he’s out grown the pack n play this item is still great and can attach to cots bed frames tables canopy’s really anything as the “clip” opens pretty wide and twist to close it firmly to whatever it is you’re attaching it to.  I see use using this item for many years to come  great buy.
5,I've bought so many of these phone holders throughout the years whether it's for the bed desk or neck that I'm quite the connoisseur of these things now (definitely nothing to brag about).  And this is the best by far.  All the points of articulation allow you to adjust it to whatever angle you need.The phone cradle itself is quite nice as it can be expanded to hold a bigger size phone.  Otherwise in its original position it can hold up to 4 inches.The holder also comes with a remote control for your phone camera.  There's a place to store the remote on the holder when not in use.  The only complaint I have about the remote is that it's battery-operated and not rechargeable which is something I loathe.  But that's very minor.I get the feeling that this holder establishes the standard for this type of product kind of how the selfie stick went through numerous iterations until it's become the mini-tripod that is standard now.  I'm willing to bet that future iterations of the desk or bedboard phone holder will be variations on this model with all the points of articulations the expandable cradle and the remote control as well.
4,Great quality. But it might not be the best option for me. I wanted to use this to watch shows on my bed. But my bedside table wasnt high enough and this product isn't long enough to have my phone right above my head when I was lying on the bed facing up.
4,I have neck issues and I found that holding up my kindle by hand to read in bed was hurting my neck and arms.  Bought this and it was a bit of trial and error since it's attached to my bed head - vertical surface as opposed to horizontal but you can move the arm via the base so that the hinge in the middle sits sideways so I can swing it out of the way when I'm finished reading or getting out of bed. The tablet clamp and head can be rotated and bent to the best angle for reading.  The only thing I might get next is the page turner for the kindle!  LOL!
4,Im surprised by how many positions l can get to fit my needs. I use this in bed clipped above my headboard. Im using it right now typing this review laying in bed. I love it!
5,Gets the job done and is sturdy enough for heavy phones use this as a desk mount and to hold my phone still to take photos of things to trace for 3d printing
4,It's normal spring loading arms are easy to use it will not take a larger size item unless you press a button and pull the arms out longer. The extensions lock in place once extended then you can use the spring arms to hold the tablet again. Once I figured that out all was well.
5,I have some neck issues and can't hold my cordless landline phone so I use this to set my landline phone on to use.  I put it on speaker and use it like a microphone stand.  I like it because you can adjust it a little or a lot.
5,I got this for my sister not too long ago because she likes to do record her process for her nail designs and she loves it!
5,Incredibly versatile! I bought to photograph large documents for my genealogy work. I have a Galaxy S20 FE phone and had no problems at all with the Bluetooth paring and the button clicker.Actually thinking about getting one for my dad for his animation work and my sister for her photography projects.
5,Way better than my old one.  supports my phone well.  very strong.  I like it.
5,I compete in USA BMX Freestyle competitions and this stays in my Range Rover at all times as I travel to various skateparks and film my riding... it allows me to shoot from all sorts of creative angles when needed... If/when this one breaks from lots of use I will buy another I like it that much.I used it to shoot the images in the pic...
5,Although I've only been trying this out for couple of days the overall construction for the price point and how it holds a couple of different phones in cases - works really well. Easy enough to establish a solid hold at the base with the screw clamp articulate the boom arm to the right position and tweak the ultimate view angle either in portrait or landscape engaging both the flexible / sturdy gooseneck along with the 360 degree rotational adjustable device holder. There is a little bit of shake when touching the screen. scrolling etc but that was to be expected yet it works very well for me. And it's all about what works for me - maybe you. I have and have had lots of device holders and this is a great one for the cost. Well done.
5,My daughter is in the hospital an unable to hold her phone. We tried several different phone holders and this one does exactly what she needs to watch the shows she has been missing.
4,Great value for sturdy product
5,Just love you can take it with on a trip  It is a must have
5,This item has been very useful for my online gigs and holds the phone/tablet in place really firmly and tightly. I like this productive.
5,Once I figured out how to mount both the desk clamp and iPhone. I really liked it. A nice way to have the iPhone up out of the way.
4,It is as described in the description. No problem so far!
5,Muy buena inversión
5,Very easy to use.  Sturdy and stable clip on with 360 degree turn great price for the quality you get.
5,I purchased this phone/tablet holder because during the brief moments I have no choice but to leave my daughter in her crib or playpen while I run to another room and back or I have to keep her contained so I can clean the room she finds this absolutely unacceptable and makes it known - loudly! So I found that if I play her some learning videos with songs (Super Simple Songs phonics songs nursery rhymes and the like) she will stay occupied just long enough for me to complete *most* of those short tasks without too much complaint
4,The rotation of the pole is fussy. But that is my only complaint.
5,I'll admit I was a little skeptical at first not expecting much given the price.  I was expecting it to be a bit flimsy or wobbly and to have that "plastic feel" that a lot of cheaper products seem to have these days.I am happy to say I was wrong.  The arm feels solid the few plastic parts are thick and well made.  The pivot joints are tight yet move smoothly when adjusted and the extension arm moves cleanly.  While the design may seem simple it's clear a decent amount of thought went into the manufacturing and engineering to make sure it performed what it needed to do well.I use the arm for getting overhead shots for electronics repair and teardowns and I love that this doesn't take up a lot of space or get in the way. (I was previously using a full standing tripod with a camera boom arm) Not only does it hold my phone (a moto g7 with a sturdy case) but it also has a cold shoe ( a mount for a standard camera flash or light) and a standard 1/4" threaded screw hole for mounting a camera or other camera accessories (I use it with a small 4k action camera with a 1/4" threaded adapter)Even with the bendable arm fully extended it didn't wobble or sag with my phone attached and repositioning the arm was easy.All things said very pleased with the purchase.  It's always nice to see when a company decides that rather than focus on making something extravagant and full of features some may never use to instead focus on making something simple and just just making sure it works.
5,My 6 year old grandson who has his own iphone loves to call me in the morning and facetime. This little gadget holds my phone at just the right height and position on my computer desk for a good view and frees up my hands and desktop and also allows me to plug in the charger to keep the phone going during long sessions. The phone is easy to get in and out of the clamp and holds the phone securely the long flexible neck holds its shape and position.
4,It works well but the knuckle doesn’t hold the tightening too well.
5,I bought one for myself and the wife seen how I liked it and now she has one too. We both love them.
5,Very helpful because I read  books on my phone
4,I like it for studiness but it does shake when you touch it.
3,I have a thin case around my 9.7" iPad for protection during normal daily use.  It's a common case... thin back with the cover that flips over the top... had it since I bought the iPad.  The holder does not account for the width of the case so I could not manage to have it securely hold the tablet without it slipping out and falling.  I'm sure this holder would work fine on an iPad with no protective case.  Will be returning and trying something else.
5,It keeps the tablet and phone in place since I've been using it I have had no problem with it at all
5,Must have for getting hands free video content. I make candles and use this while filming overhead videos of pouring
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I've been wanting a tripod to do over the head videos but I couldn't decide which one to go for. Finally decided for this one and I'm so glad I did. Very steady and easy to use. I didn't need the instructions. A super thing is that it also holds my iPad pro!! So exciting the little remote works like perfectly too!. If you've been thinking about it like me go for this one!
4,Does what it says it will do. Easy to assemble.
5,This is works perfect with my kindle and I love how adjustable it is.
5,I purchased this for my iPad Pro 11" 2nd Gen and it has been fantastic!I usually mount it either on my desk to use as another monitor or on my treadmill as a screen to watch videos/workouts while I'm running. It's really sturdy and holds it my iPad very secure. It does shake a little when you touch it but what can you expect for a ~$15 mount?Overall this has been a great mount to use with my iPad!
5,Practico y muy fácil de usar y ponerlo donde quiera.
4,Tablet and phone for servelance camera
5,great product
5,Very impressed. Well designed and manufactured. Much sturdier than I expected. Using it with my Kindle Paperwhite and Android phone.
5,Hard to believe this thing only cost $14. It's easy to use the joints feel sturdy and the Bluetooth remote was an unexpected surprise.Unfortunately I think I bump my desk around a little too much for me to use it with my iPhone 12 as a webcam. It does shake and wobble a bit when I type. Not sure if I'll keep it myself but if you're on the fence I highly recommend checking it out before you spend 2 or 3 times as much on something else.
3,I'm so disappointed! The grip to actually hold the phone would not grip so my phone would just slide out all the time. I really wanted to like this but it just did not work for me. I have a samsung galaxy s21 ultra if that helps other buyers. Everything else worked fine on the stand aside from that I really wanted to keep this but it juat didn't work. The grooves are too small.
5,It's working perfectly and satisfying my needs! I'm not usually interested in writing a review but this one definitely has an amazing quality that worth my time writing this. I'll use this when taking selfies or doing live channels and I can't be successful without this product
4,
5,I use this product for my iPad to watch videos while working from home- does the job nicely sturdy enough.
5,I've used this on my headboard for my Pixel phone with a small encasement and it's awesome. I have tried the remote for photos. The build quality is excellent and even though it's very easy to move around I'm buying another for a Galaxy tablet for the kitchen counter height breakfast bar area if it fits. I'll update tomorrow if it doesn't fit. I thought to buy a wall mounted unit for the kitchen however i like the option to adjust to a standing height at times. This is a very useful gadget that is definitely worth the low cost.
3,Cheaply made does work tho only real issue is the locking mechanism by the right angle when u lock it so it doesn’t spin around it doesn’t lock accurately it moves slight back and then locks
5,Works great
5,Love. It
5,I work from home and there is A LOT of time spent hitting the "refresh" button waiting for jobs to pop up. I use this holder to watch videos on my phone during that time. It's sturdy and does what it's supposed to do.
5,The Phone & Tablet Bed Holder works very well for the price. I recommend it. It is sturdy.
3,This product does hold up and is very sturdy when attached to a sturdy base. Unfortunately after a week mine detached from the base and comes out easily when pulled on too hard. It is still functional but I have to be extra careful when I move my phone to different angles! I attached mine to my headboard to hold my phone when I am watching YouTube in bed. Good but not great!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This phone mount has to be placed on the edge of a desk table shelf etc. It basically clamps to whatever surface you are filming on. It is very versatile and has a wide range of motion and comes with a button you can carry to press which will take a photo start or end a video and record voice memos. Please refer to the video I have uploaded
5,This is the best phone holder I have ever received before!! The design is so convenient. Everything is perfect for me. Especially the quality!! I’m gonna order the second one!! Thank you for this awesome product. The price also is very reasonable.
5,I order this item for my Umay home treadmill. Absolutely loving it so far. It’s sturdy long height and super easy to install. No assembly required.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             This fits both my iPhone and iPad perfectly! It’s not wobbly very sturdy in fact… super happy with this purchase because it is way more than what I expected 🥳
5,Depending on what you attach it to it works great
5,The Lazy Bracket product arrived in a well protected package.  I mounted the product on the side of my bed headrest.  Its mounting base is wide enough to clamp tightly on a thick wood frame.  The base and middle sections are made of metal tubes which are sufficiently strong to retain its configured position with the weight of the device at the end of the gooseneck clip.  The gooseneck is long enough to facilitate bending to a desired position; while the ball-end of the clip allow finer adjustment for a perfect viewing angle. For a little additional attention to details there’s a wire clip on the smooth gooseneck to allow for a clipping of the charging wire.  The bluetooth remote control for a mobile camera app is a definite plus.This is a solid design.  I think it well worth the price especially with the Amazon coupon that you can select before adding it to your cart.  This product works perfectly for my iPhone 8+ and my Kindle reader.
5,Easy to set up and simple to use.
4,i bought it for my dad's bedside so he can read kindle/tablet lying down.  he's normally hard to please but was happy enough with the product which allowed him to read hands-free.pros:-- high quality product for the price.-- lots of adjustable parts that can then be locked in place.cons:-- the extending arm wobbles a bit it wobble less at certain angles and more if arm is angled in between.  a minor annoyance on an otherwise perfect product!
5,Satisfied at this item. I use it in bed very helpful for lazy people.
5,Very nice quality. Highly recommend!
5,Works for me !!
3,The quality seemed good but the length was way too short so I had to return.
3,I use it for my bed to hold my phone. It works well but the neck it came off for some odd reason. I just stuck it bk on but it's finicky now.
5,Excellent product
5,Met the needs for my use.
3,Very nice I really recommend it
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I used it to film this review! It's quite flexible and expandable. I haven't used the remote it came with yet but I'm sure I will!
5,Tremenda inversión!! No más golpes en la cara😂😂Buen material…me encantó
5,Works great! Very tall and the extension flexes nicely.
5,I love it a lot
2,I was excited to get this product.  It installed just fine but it’s not as versatile as it seems.The flexible part of the holder is very stiff and the holder itself just barely holds my phone.  I like to listen to stories or nice music to help me sleep. I wanted something that could be away from my body and still be heard well.  I will say this worked good.But getting the holder to actually hold the item doesn’t always work  they need a better ratchet type system to hold even my phone let alone my iPad.I would not purchase this again. They need to upgrade their product.I am not sure why they limited 1 item per person  but I am glad they did as I almost bought 2 of them!  So I am thankful I was not able to purchase two.
5,Just what I needed. It's a easy to use and strong built. It can hold my cell phone and my tablet.Thank you.
5,Sturdy and you can move it to different lengths/ directions. Holder extends to fit my ipad. Very nice.
5,This gooseneck phone holder is better the expected. It is very stable flexible and can be bent to the shape I need easily. Its great for watching programs hands free. No more fussing with awkward angles. Its designed to conform to any angle. The first gooseneck is flexible to adjust angle. The last two alloy aluminum rods make it more durable. Pros - 1. Very sturdy no sagging.  2. Angle without limitations. 3. The clamps for the table can be screwed down tightly anti-slip pad can avoid scratching your furniture. 4. The remote on the base can take photos or videos. Cons - If you use your phone case with thick popsocket you need to remove your popsocket to use. But that's fine to me really like this design.
5,With so many choices on Amazon I didn’t spent too much time doing comparisons thought I anyways just need one that would work. But this stuff came really nice!!Firstly it’s shipped with carefully packaged product even with small duct tape protecting the details.Secondly it came out to be much sturdier than I thought even than the promotional pictures!What’s better I found it easy and flexible to use you don’t even need that instruction booklet…And it can hold my iPad Pro… I didn’t expect this as well!I don’t usually write reviews but this is such a A BIG SURPRISE for me!
5,I purchased this to record TikTok videos for my nail designs. So far I don’t have any complaints. Love it!
5,10/10
5,Love the product it’s amazing my only suggestion is that I have a iPad mini but it has a putter box case if the opening 2 the holder was just opened little bit more 4 the devices with cases it would be perfect .. ( I’m clumsy & afraid of Taking my device out the  case 🤦🏾‍♀️🤣)
5,The phone stand exceeded my expectations! It is very stable and can easily bend into the shape I want. You can look at your phone or iPad without holding it in your hand. Its design is very delicate each corner can be flexibly adjusted Angle. You can also remote control you iPad or phone to take a picture or video. the Advantages for this: 1. Very strong and stable will not sway due to heavy. 2. Can rotate 360 degrees no dead Angle. 3. The remote control on the base can take photos or video remotely.
4,I love this tripod it’s sturdy and adjustable. Worth the price.
5,Me encantó
5,Great loved it!
5,Better than expected!
5,Use this to watch Netflix while on vacation or visiting relatives.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This is exactly what i was looking for. I've bought brackets before but none of them work as well as this one this one is totally exceeded my expectations my iphone can be mounted on the clip tightly that i don’t need to worry about sliding. This tablet holder is very flexible i can easily bend and adjust according to my needs so helpful for me to see movies on bed well made producthighly recommend!
5,I love this product and I use it all the time for my TikTok videos super easy to move @pandababyss
5,I love this product so much! I used this phone holder on my bed headboard to watch movies or read hands free. It held my phone very sturdy. I could rotate my phone vertically and horizontally super easily because it has a 360 rotating ball head on the clamp that allows me to flip my phone in all directions. I would highly recommended this product if you are looking for a phone holder!
5,works great.
5,After having a cheaper version break on me quickly I opted for this design where the wire doesn't need to be twisted to get into position. As long as you use as design it has worked well for me for the past 2 months without issue.
5,It's soooo good cuz I can use it anywhere to hold my phone ipad and even my mirror! Extremely flexible and has so many ways to change to different angles. Will definitely buy again in the future!!
5,I just loved it.  excellent quality material.  have my recommendation.  100% approved.
5,Nice quao
5,The product comes with a secure package and the product itself looks pretty nice the quality it has is way more than its price!Pros: it covers almost 360° angle pretty flexible for various use scenarios.Cons: if the holder part can be wider then it will be more friendly for the iPad users!
5,solve the problem of playing with the phone in bed by the phone smashed into the face. Can be adjusted to different angles. Very good product love it.
5,I really like this cell phone holder. The gooseneck is great . It  swivels in all directions. I’ve used it for both my cell phone and iPad. I have even purchased one for  each of my siblings .It’s a great product for the price! Three thumbs up!
2,I bought this to film tutorials but it is so wobbly and the arm thats supposed to be bendable is very weak and feels like it will snap at any moment. Not a fan!
5,I’m impressed that this holder is very easy to use and sturdy. The remote camera switch is also convenient. It’s different from another similar item I bought a few years ago.
2,So super bummed it didn't fit my 9th gen IPad even though the listing said it does. It seems super sturdy and worth the money had it worked for my iPad.
5,Hook up to the bathroom door and watch a movie it’s awesome
5,Pretty great holder for bed and table. I could watch movie on bed by using iPad and phone without my hand.
5,I buy it cause I want to watch recipes and videos during cooking and I found I could also use it to hold my phone for playing fitness video! Really easy to use I love its material and flexible angle.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 It’s soooooo convenient and easy to use I was watching a YouTube video and learning how to make a cake from it and this phone stand allows me to release my hands and watch the video in a comfortable position!
2,Doesn’t have a very strong hold. My phone slides out of it.
5,Very easy to use hands free can lie on the bed to play with the phone
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This is a very practical phone bed holder. It's easy to place and adjust. It can be placed very firmly.
2,Its $20 so i did not expect much... and thats what I got
5,Can hold still my iPad and very easy to set up. Good quality worth the price
3,The plastic parts have wiggle room which makes it shaky if you bump the desk or holder.
5,Easy to use. It is stable flexible and convenient. Hold my iPad very well
5,Great holder for my kindle/iPhone using before bedtime.
5,First time to use such a phone holder on bed. A very nice try!!
5,I've had the type with snake arms & they never stayed where you placed it. This STAYS!
2,Limited movement
5,Easy to use handy for recording handwork process. Adjustable.
2,This thing felt really cheap. Lots of shakiness and super hard to change its positions.
5,I have to say this one has very good quality. It's super convinient
5,It's very convenient and easy to use for everyday life.
5,everything.
5,Nice holder! Stable and convenient!
1,Super hard to move around. The camera function doesn't work. Nowhere near the versititly the description implies. I couldn't find one surface it would even attach to properly.  When it is attached the weight of the phone makes it very unstable.
1,Product came broken and a free shipping label was not given. So to send it back I have to pay more money for a piece of garbage. Don’t waste your time on this at all.
1,I bought this to use as a perpendicular overhead phone camera mount for crafting videos. The big button joint is very floppy and the tiniest vibration made the video shaky. There also doesn't seem to be any way to charge or replace the battery. I returned this item.
1,It holds my phone okay but it does not hold tablets the tablet is too heavy for the the top handle. Makes the button press and the whole thing falls down
1,I opened the package and was excited about trying the mount for the first time. However when I lifted it out of the box the first hinge had no tension and immediately just followed gravity. I tried tightening and pushing the button to see if it just arrived unscrewed but I can't find anything wrong. Disappointed in this product and will definitely be returning it.
1,This seems to be an instance of "you get what you pay for." Testing this right of the box by placing my tablet in the holder it shakes and sags. Sure there's a tightening mechanism but it's not great for the weight of a larger device especially if the plan is to create overhead videos or still images. Overall if you're looking for a sturdy holder that doesn't (very literally) feel cheap and easily breakable and will actually hold your device steady this is not the product for you. If you have the ability to spend money on a better quality holder I'd recommend that option.
1,I don't recommend this product if you plan to use it for the Galaxy tab 8 ultra. I tried and would not work. I'm looking for something that would work.
2,Just too big and bulky and not easily adjustable.
1,it  broke before i was able to use it
1,It has very bad clip to hold phone. Not trust worthy to use and had to use rubber band to secure. Bad product.
1,Do not purchase
1,Doesn't hold onto my phone.
1,Does not hold my phone. I returned it.
5,Great product! Very versatile can be attached to almost anything and positioned in any direction. I use it for my IPhone and I’m pretty happy about this purchase.
5,Es muy útil este artículo además versatil. Puede sujetar celulares normales hasta tablets. Muy buena calidad!!
5,I was looking for a phone stand to use for reading in bed without needing to hold the phone up with my arm. I chose this style because it could swing away from the bed when I finished reading. The knurled knob that loosens the rotation was very tight when I received the item. I used a silicon pad to loosen it and then it worked flawlessly. The spring on the phone holder is quite strong. Handle the cradle by the edges when inserting the device to avoid getting fingers pinched. The fit and finish are perfect and the price is reasonable. I have been using it for 5 months without issue and would definitely purchase again.
5,If I was lazy before I certainly am now. Totally hands free staring into my iPad. No more taco neck or arms falling asleep. Straight up horizontal going deep into the abyssal rabbit hole on YouTube.
5,I first purchased 1 last year from a different co. to replace a less sturdy version. My daughter requested a gold 1 for her birthday however I should've ordered black on black since I received a chrome 1 instead of gold "/ she was pleased regardless but now we basically own 2 of the exact same style. Anywho that aside mine from last year still functions superbly therefore I would highly recommend ")
1,Works for a while but breaks after you bend it lots of time.too expensive
5,Its worth the price. Love it!
5,Excellent little product. I use it to hold my cameras over the lasers. When in use allows me to walk away momentarily and still have a visual on equipment.
5,I received it today and have used it in my bedroom. I guess I may be able to use it in my bath tube.It is easy to use and the arm joints are well designed. More important it is of great value considering its price. I had planned to buy a similar product a long time ago but hesitated before high prices until I saw this one.
5,This is the most sturdy phone holder I have found. It has plenty of ways to adjust and helps me a lot avoid more hand numbing and tingling pain.
5,Funcionó bien los primeros días pero la parte flexible es de metal y sé rompe queda inservible.
5,I’m using it right now. It’s sturdier than it looks. The bonus was the remote shutter button. Suppose you could use it as I selfie stick in addition to a stand but the remote and stand makes scanning document without jitter a breeze.
5,A little tricky to figure out at 1st since there’s only instructions for the phone/tablet clip. But had it set up in about 5 mins seems well made a little hard to bend but that means it doesn’t slowly sink/fall with the weight of my device. I love the adjustability of it both in height and angle. And it comes with a cute little Bluetooth camera button with a spot to hold it in the base.
5,Good Material and Sturdy
5,Great product.
5,This product is very good. I can use it anywhere on the bed floor table and sofa. Both iPhone and iPad can be used on this product. I use it very often when I go to school and take classes. It helps me complete many recordings for my video creation. It is the best product I’ve used ever. You should definitely buy that.

5,I LOVE to just lay in bed and watch shows or read my kindle or whatever. This holder is perfect. It clips right onto the side of my headboard and allows me handsfree media from whatever angle I want! I can lay on my side my stomach or on my back and easily adjust my device to be in front of my face. This is a game changer. So glad I discovered it!
2,I went to tighten the arm gently and  heard a crunch. I didn't  over tighten it at all. Now it won't stay in place.  The arm just falls down.Barely 3 months I've had this.Buyer beware.
5,This product is easy to use and easy to pair with my phone. Good quality and you can position this holder however you wanted it.  Most of all you can also extend like 3 to 4 inches more. I loved this purchase and highly recommended it.
5,I purchased this holder (I’m not a testers) and I was very surprised it was inexpensive but the quality is outstanding.
5,Finally I found the one that is long enough so that I don’t need to hold my phone in my hand when I lie on my bed!
5,I like that it’s takes a little bit of effort to adjust. It doesn’t slip or fall when using it.
5,Quick shipping! The phone/tablet holder is very sturdy easy to use and easy bluetooth connect to zoom in!
5,I love the way this was put together. You cannot go wrong by purchasing this cellphone or tablet holder. I didn't know it came with a little bluetooth button to take pictures or video.
5,I can video call like a professional and my hand is free to do other things.
1,It it limited on the main attachment. If you do not have a headboard this will not extend far enough to be of any use.
5,I bought this tablet holder to help me record a conference I went to and I was not disappointed with this purchase. I  gave it 5 stars all across the board. The holder is compact enough to fit in my shoulder bag big enough and sturdy enough to attach to a chair reaching over everyone's head to record the whole conference on my tablet. Recommend.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 It is pretty good and meet my expectations. I use it for my phone. The quality is also very good.
5,The only one of this kind that will hold up the phone and tablet. It's sturdy and well made.  The design keeps your phone up and doesn't fall down like others I've bought.  You won't regret buying it!
5,I love how it help my lg v60 thinq nicely!! My phone is very heavy so this is just what I am looking for!! Finally an item that I would recommend!
5,Yeah. This holder is very good. It can be turned any direction you want . And also it’s steady.  I like it~
5,is waaay better than I thought it could be. for 18 bucks it's worth every cent. the little Bluetooth clicker thing was of no use to me. nifty add on that some may enjoy but as a stand works perfectly.
5,This thing is awesome. It holds my phone secure plus it can be manipulated to just about any position I can think of. The mount is sturdy and the whole unit is made well. It also holds my small tablet well. I've had it a couple of weeks now and I have no complaints.
