5,nice 3-way plug
4,I needed a solution that would allow me to plug things in where the prongs were aligned differently from the wall plug. This device does that! Fits tight allows my appliances to plug in securely and I don't have to fight with plugging something in with a plug that is angled oddly.
5,Works great
5,Great value. Many uses.
5,More room for larger plugs without blocking next socket.
5,Not the best 3 way I've had but they worked fine.
5,No risk here- they are totally functional
3,Gets the job done generally. Wish it gripped the plugs a bit tighter.
4,The product works well and solves the need for plugging in multiple plugs when there is only one outlet. The only minor quibble is the shade of white. It is a bit on the duller side. I think something close to “pure” white would have made it perfect. However for the cost you cannot get better value.
4,The devices seem to be good quality.I have found there are a few different orientations of outlets on similar adapters.I recommend you take care to consider the orientations.  See photos.You should select based on things like whether you will be plugging in big AC adapter blocks and the prong orientations of them just extension cords or something else.  I bought some of two different designs.Sometimes I find it convenient to extend the first adapter with another one or two to make additional outlets.Note what happens in the photos when I do that.  The outlets are are not designed to maintain the same orientation to each other when you plug another one into the outlet on its face.UPDATE: Size matters!In trying to use these I have realized they are significantly larger than the traditional triple-tap adapters I have used for years (Leviton still makes those).  I guess they were interested in more modern styling for these but the end result is I cannot use them on outlets that have 2 USB ports between them because these block the adjacent USB port enough that I cannot use it.  Of course no problem if I don't want to use the port.
5,Vary useful!
3,The outlets are rotated so the were useless for me.  I needed the plugs to be oriented similarly to the wall not sideways.
5,I specifically got these because my daughter's mattress would continually slide up against the one outlet and hit the plugs. Aside from that being a potential fire hazard she was ruining the plugs of the things we had plugged into the outlet. I got this so we could plug it in from the side and so it is parallel to the mattress. Then I plug the other outlet openings with child safety plugs. It works exactly how I was hoping.The quality is not the absolute best but for the price you can't beat the value.
5,Sturdy and good for the small spaces in my old house that doesn't have many outlets.
5,Good for use of Alexa and appliances in my house.
5,Does exactly what it should.
3,Overall larger than I expected. Feels hollow and cheap not solid -- like it will break if you drop it. Doesn't give the impression of being sturdy at all. The prongs aren't centered vertically so the top may stick up and block the next outlet. I have a CM 3-outlet pivoting tap and that is solid plastic well made; not like this. Probably the worst Cable Mattes product I've bought. You get three of them though.
2,Very cheapplug-in feels like going to break internally. Great ideabetter if made right
3,The second bullet of the description states that 2 adapters can be used in an outlet.  Not true…. Adapters are too large for a standard US 117v outlet.
3,It's fine except that the outlets are turned 90 degrees from the plug. I can't use it with an air freshener because it would be sideways. I'll have to find a different adapter.Otherwise it's compact and inconspicuous.
3,These things are HUGE. Too huge. I wanted to have a bookcase in front of this but it forces the case to be too far away from the wall.
3,El producto funciona correctamente pero uno de los tres estaba dañado y es inutilizable
5,Great product for the price.
5,Works great!
5,Need all 3 to be able to use all the receptacles on a UPS (uninterruptible power supply). China designs a/c adapters to fit the wrong way so we have to but more products.
4,Good value arrived as described. Shipping took longer than the usual 2 day prime shipping time
5,Behind furniture
2,They are a nice piece.  The only thing I didn't like is that only one will fit in a standard outlet due to the size of the body.
5,Using these to run a few LED light strips from a single Z-wave power outlet and they work as expected.
5,So far so good.  Wish it had a usb port but the price is right so cant really fault.
5,Great for our bathrooms to add additional outlets for low draw rechargables - his/hers Braun toothbrushes and my shaver. Solid built
1,I bought these because I was going to use 2 in one outlet behind my couch but found that only 1 fits and then the other socket is partially covered. This is a major design flaw and I returned them.
5,Great item to have multiple plugs in an outlet.
5,Nice and versatile
5,It seems almost every plug in our house is host to one of these little magic cubes. They are tough and relatively unobtrusive (much less than extension cords). Bravo!
2,On one cube one side did not work. I checked inside and it was missing metal connectors that receive the prongs.
5,me gustaron
5,Bought them to install behind furniture where I needed to plug power cables in. They are a great size for providing enough clearance for most things and not forcing you to stick your furniture out too far. I chose these because they returned the ground prong and was very pleased that they are able to accommodate smart outlets. I haven't used them all yet but I will definitely buy more when I do.
5,Bought these to replace a defective "other brand" adapter and this appears to be a much better quality one. This one works as intended and is UL approved.
5,Perfect for my needs. 3 pack is the way to go!
5,These stick out about 2" but they're good for redirecting the outlets to the side for when furniture blocks the outlets. I used it to plug lamps into an outlet behind sofas. This minimized stress bends on electrical cords that caused the lamps to flicker when sitting in the couches.
5,After reading some reviews here I got freaked out - for no reason as it turns out. I have no idea what happened to one reviewer but these do NOT get heated or anything when in use. My toaster oven didn't heat the plug nor did a vacuum.I also tested every single outlet on all 3 cubes and they all worked for me. I actually just have no complaints about this product.
5,Did what I needed without taking up a lot of room. As far as a plug they are as attractive as I think you can get something that is so functional. Looked at a number and these were well as well priced as any I saw. When I looked through the ones that had USB's in them I was interested until I saw the very limited power from them and decided that this made more sense. Work fine stuff plugs in easily. No issues.
4,I was planning in putting two of these back to back in both sockets to create six sockets from two. Turns out that they are slightly too large and interfere with eachother so I'm not able to put one in each socket. Only one will fit in at a time. I tried a couple different sockets and same deal. The cubes themselves are good quality just disappointed that they both don't fit side by side.
5,I’m so glad these plugs do not have a little dot of light when in used.I absolutely detest the plugs/extension cords with light turned on when in used.Drives me crazy with the luminous at night.
5,After renovating our ensuite bathroom and taking out the old countertop the only outlet in the room was now halfway up the wall with nowhere to put our electric toothbrushes...This was a great solution that allows us to have 2 things plugged into a single outlet and doesn't take up a lot of space. It's not exactly elegant but considering how limited our options were we're happy with the results.
5,Great product. Wish it was slimmer. You can only use one per wall jack. They are too big to have one on top of the other. Otherwise great product.
5,Très pratique
4,Great product however you can get this at a fraction of the price at the dollar store
5,Bon produit
3,It’s ok but to large to use side by side in same wall outlet!
4,Suitable for plugging in all directions.
5,Arrived quickly and look good work well to split a single plug
5,Great for using on my outlets!
5,fait la job comme voulu
5,Works as it should...
4,Good ValueThanks
5,came very quickly and works fine. A solid buy overall!
5,perfect
5,Exactly as described
5,Works fine
5,Quality is good
5,Works as it should. A bit bigger than expected but no big deal
1,This product is faulty. I was only use one of them and 2 outlets worked. When I plugged the other 1/3 plugs did not work I tried the another and same thing and then the one I was using only had 2 word. It’s extremely poor quality avoid!!!
1,Bought these to replace a more expensive version from another brand. Clearly a budget brand. Once plugged in it began to emit a high pitched squeal that doesn't stop any time it is drawing power.
5,The product looks good helps with cable management. I don't like the look of extension cords or any cords on the floor. This Power Cube keeps cords of the floor. I currently have my Playstation Speakers Tv and still have room for more.
5,well built cute discreet versatile n takes up no space will follow up if any issues arise but I don't think this will happen
4,Not bad
5,Solidly made exactly like image
4,Solid build but it is bulky.
5,Good quality. Thanks
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 See the video. 5/6 units were as expected. 1 unit had loose metal in it. Loose metal in a power supply is very dangerous. I would recommend not using it.
4,Package of three good value for moneyGreat quality
3,looks fine and works well. issues are that it is bulky and it's a bit pricy for what it does
1,On the package we found a p65 warning saying “cancer and reproductive harm”. It had no other description of what might cause cancer or reproductive harm or why the warning was on the package.In addition on Amazon there was no indication of this - so no way we could have known when we ordered the plugs.  Not a fan.
5,I have no complaints exactly what I expected
5,These seem to be reasonably well made.Nice and handy.
5,Prefect for what I need they for.
5,Great product
5,Used these splitters to add additional units to my power line. Work well!
4,Used to add more lamps in rooms
3,On ne peu installer qu'un seul bloc par prise de courant.
5,Just great.
5,works as i had intended to use it.
5,It's perfect
5,I love this. Works great.
5,These are nothing like the cheap 6-packs you might find at the buck store they are solid well built adapters that can handle larger cords or higher current flows without overheating or popping out of the wall.Very good contact on all plugs.If you need an extra outlet and you don't want to have to be concerned about overloading and fire safety these are a good choice.--Even most of the power bars I have used don't have this good of electrical connections.Well done.. (UL Listed)
2,It's not bad. It works but one of the three plug is loose inside so I can't use it at all.
5,Had no problems with it works great
3,this is a design issue.
5,Good
4,Quality looks good enough. However they are gigantic.
5,Very easy to use and makes room for other devices on the outlet.  Would buy again.
