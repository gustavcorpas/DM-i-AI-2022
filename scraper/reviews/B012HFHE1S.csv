5,Absolutely the coolest Halloween decoration. I loved this so much I bought two more atmosfx DVDs. Set up is easy and had a decently long run time.
4,Bought the video to project inside a room for halloween using a screen tacked to the inside of the windows.  The room has two 3x4 windows separated by a 10-inch section of wall.  I didn't buy the gauzy fabric stuff sold by this vendor because it's expensive compared to alternatives.  Just go to Walmart or a discount fabric store and buy something like wedding veil material where the mesh is a bit tighter.  The two yards necessary to cover my windows I bought for $5.  The video is super easy to use and the production value is high enough that it really does produce a nice image.  My only complaint (and why it's 4-star instead of 5) is that many of the snippets begin with the ghost entering the screen from one side then stopping and doing whatever they're going to do.  But they stop in the middle of the screen.  So if you have a set up like mine (two windows separated by a narrow column of wall) you have to aim the projector at either one window or the other because if you center it the "action" from the ghost will be behind the center divider.  It would be nice if the video had the ghost do things across the range of the screen not just (usually) flying in from the edge stopping in the middle doing something ghosty then flying off the edge again.  As a result the ghost will fly off the screen but not appear in the second window which looks kinda strange from the outside so you have to have drapes or blinds closed on that other window so the outside observer thinks the ghost flying by that window is obscured by the drape or blind.  It's still worth it but could be just a bit better if not everything happened center screen.
5,This is such a fun and easy way to decorate for Halloween. This DVD doesn't just give one way of having spooks come visit you during the haunting hour. I love that I can easily switch this over to have a "haunted" TV wall window mist empty body entity or whatever! I used to go all out for Halloween but cut back due to some vandals messing with my stuff  when my entire household would go out and have fun with the neighbors. With this I can still give a very cool FX and have deco without fearing that someone will be messing with my stuff. I kept the projection inside the house and shot it out the window.  If I had a party I can easily put it towards the wall or TV or anywhere else. The pictures are really crisp not to grotesque or scary but enough to give you a startle. It's not just pictures either there is sound. I think this is such a great unique way for people to decorate. and bring your house to "life". I know many people who can no longer decorate due to health but having something like this FX dvd can at least help them participate in the fun of Halloween without having to get too overwhelmed.I definitely want to make a chicken-wire  body/entity and have this project onto it. I would definitely recoommend this and even look forward to seeing any new ones coming out.
4,Would like this better if it was on a USB drive. However the short videos you get are amazing!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†This was so much fun. Parents of trick or treaters stayed to watch the whole video. This wasn‚Äôt even the scariest DVD and some kids were still scared of it. Might have to get the pumpkin DVD next year. We had it in our upstairs bedroom window and it was super clear and realistic. It looks a lot better in person than the video.

My screen was only big enough to cover one window vertically but the blinds on the other side add a lot more than I was anticipating. Like the title said I got a text from my neighbor across the street 5 min after starting the video asking where he could get it
4,Always was a huge fan of atmos. Really thought I was getting a great value.  But after receiving the DVD they are written in a format that most DVD players and most computers have trouble reading. All the files are there so its still worth the price. Just don't expect to put it in anything and just hit play. Because of its Format you have to choose only 1 video to play then stop that if you want to change videos

So this skeleton was a download purchase directly from the AtmosFX site.  I started with making my own video on my computer (Including the floating ghost in this DVD from again a download since I could not download from DVD)...then connected my computer to my projector.  I projected the sound outside via a bose bluetooth speaker. It was a learning curve for sure from someone who is not techy.  Not sure why I had a shadow on the skeleton but overall strongly recommend this company but may be easier just to download their videos then make your own in the order you want.  (The window treatment - I used $.99 yard beige tulle from Walmart...may try white color next year but was $4 yard)  Great quality and fun for the kids.  Definitely recommend this company.
5,This product was received as advertised. Creepy ghastly phantoms to haunt your soul or window via a projector. 10/10
5,I didn't really care for this one . Graphic where great but subject manner not for me
5,Very awesome graphics and works great for my projector and the sound is awesome and I will be looking to get more different ones in the future!!
5,The seller was great.  Thank you
3,What's most important thing is...In order to use with the projector you must have a DVD player that can hook up with an HDMI. Older DVD players will not work except on a TV.
5,Worked great this Halloween üéÉ awesome everyone loved it üòä
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†This is the 2nd DVD I've gotten from AtmosFEARFX and they're honestly the coolest Halloween "decorations" I've ever had! Even my nephew who is usually like "oh yea cool whatever" thought it was awesome.Everything is bright vibrant and clear although that's due in part to the mini projector I got to go with the dvds. I ended up getting a roll of white plastic tablecloth to go over my window to project onto which served its purpose very well (and I didn't have to deal with any creases like you would with a folded tablecloth).There's great variety in content and the accompanying noises are pretty awesome as well. I can't wait to buy one of their Christmas dvds when the time comes!
5,AtmosFX has done a great job with all of these holiday effects used with projectors.  Depending on how you plan on projecting it might make sense to just buy and download the digital versions off their website instead of buying the DVD if you prefer to run off a thumb drive or other digital means versus running off a DVD player.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I think it‚Äôs great! Easy to set up and very effective!  I don‚Äôt understand reviews were saying there is not a lot of content‚Ä¶ There are 6 or 7 charavter ‚Äúthemes‚Äù (or play all) and then when you go into each theme there are several  subcategories also and a ‚Äúplay all‚Äù option... there is plenty  of content‚Ä¶ Also many reviewers stated there is a lot of time between ghosts‚Ä¶ I think it‚Äôs maximum seven seconds. This is just a pre Halloween test run video. I plan on scary music I play every year outside on 2 Bluetooth speakers. I just ordered ghostly apparitions. I plan on3 windows for this digital decorating!
3,Hard to use. You have to select viewing mode either horizontal or vertical. Since I am using on a window I select horizontal It then plays the scene horizontal then again vertical. I can not get it to spot and only play the horizontal clips. No matter how I choose to play it Window mode wall mode screen mode it always ruins the effect by turning the screen. It want let me put the scenes I do like on repeat without doing them vertically. The only ones I can get to play correctly is the ones for the door. But the scenes are narrow and dont fill a window.  This is one of two dvds I got at the same time. both have the same issue. I would not buy another or recommend.
3,I decided to stick my toe into the Halloween projections arena this year since we had a projector that we used for watching movies in the backyard.  I looked around and liked AtmosFX's videos the best by far and decided to buy the Pumpkin Jamboree and the Phantasms DVD's for two totally different effects.  While the DVD that came from Amazon was good and the videos as expected I was disappointed as the DVD's project in 480p and are not HD.  I went to Atmos' website and sure enough the DVD's are not ever HD (so this isn't Amazon's fault) and to get HD you have to buy Atmos' digital downloads.  I wish I had known that before I bought the DVD's as I would have spent a few bucks more and bought the HD version directly as a digital download.  I wish the description for the DVD would have made it clear to have avoided the disappointment.
3,I wouldn‚Äôt buy this again
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†This is the second year that I have set up the AtmosFX dvd...and once again the kids and adults loved it.  It's great watching everyone try to figure out how it's done.  Last year we had it in the window but this year I placed it bedind our door.  My son downloaded the zombies banging on a wall....it looked exactly like they were trying to escape from our house.  A few kids actually asked if they can escape?  We told them the truth.....
5,This is so cool! We love this. We have had it for 3 nights and our entire family loves looking at it from the inside of the house or the outside. We are hoping our neighbors will start seeing it more when they drive by and those that walk as well. It looks very realistic. It looks much clearer with the cloth put up. We plan to buy more to switch it up and the Christmas ones when December gets closer. Highly recommend!
4,I have purchased several of these dvd's from Spirit in the past.  I ordered it on Amazon because it was cheaper than picking it up in the store.  This one is better that the others that I have (creepy crawlies blood walls and Zombies).  But as the others they are too expensive for what they are and what they offer.  I do like some of the options this one offers like the prop feature (where you can project on an object).  Summary:  When compared to to the others this one is the best one I've used.  But like the others...not worth the money.
5,This thing is AWESOME!  I paid the crazy amount of money for this based on the reviews and I am glad I did.  I already had a home projector system (where the DVD player is build into the projector) and I hung up some sheer cloth in the window and projected this video in holographic mode... and I was blown away at how real it looked.  I had so many compliments on this and I can't tell you the number of people who asked me about this on Halloween night.  I had previously purchased the Bone Chillers DVD and loved it so I bought this one and I have to say that this one is the best!
5,Well this sure went over great for halloween. We set it up on a projector along with the lap top and the kids loved it. We had it showing through our front living room window. We just did one set to have it repeat over and over.The quality appeared to be really good. We will use it again next year and buy a couple more as well. AtmostFEARfx has really good quality products. We are very happy with this purchase.‚ñ∫ I did NOT receive this product at a discount nor for free. I paid full price. My opinion is my own and I was not influenced by anyone in any way  of my opinion of this product.
5,Love it so easy to use nice piece of kit
5,THese  videos are wonderful! I projected the phantasm vids onto my closed (white) curtains (with my Epson portable projector wired to my mini DVD player upstairs. The affect was GREAT!! Ordering another one. üëª
5,Finally found an USB that has 4 plug in types sd card fits perfectly.  And got it to au thru progector happy now
4,Looked great on mosquito netting! Used the ‚Äúproject on a mannequin‚Äù setting to get a great  floating apparition effect. Can‚Äôt wait to unleash it on the neighborhood next Halloween!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Such a great addition to our Halloween decorations. I discovered these videos during the summer and couldn't wait to try it out. Purchased an inexpensive mini projector from Amazon hooked it up to my laptop and viola! It's such a simple way to add-on some fantastic effects. Will be purchasing more.
5,Easy to use with a projector & a DVD player. We set it up in our upstairs window & it ran continuously all Halloween night. Everyone commented on how real it looks! One tip- we lined our window with parchment paper as we couldn‚Äôt find the recommended window cover. It worked perfectly!
4,As advertised...neat Halloween decoration!  I just believe it is overpriced badly for a niche product you are only going to use this one day to one month a year...We can buy brand new Blurays of Hollywood movies that just came to video for much less - what makes their niche product worth $30-$40 ????
5,Everybody loved it at the Halloween party played it on the side of garage during pool party October 31
4,I liked the different versions of the ghouls and witches. I used it for Halloween and kids were totally not headed to my door. It was very lifelike the maid was the best in my opinion. She would walk in my doorway side to side and it looked as if she was floating on air. Great fun and loads of laughs.
5,This was our best Halloween decoration this year. Everyone loved it (except our niece who was very scared). We set it up on our wall in our sliding glass door and on our garage.It worked great and looked so real! Such a cool idea and I can't wait to buy more dvds.P.S. I have a projector to hook the dvd player and this is what helps make the effect so cool. Just playing it on your tv is not worth the price.
4,All of these AtmosFX things are overpriced especially for the amount of video you actually get. But it makes for a cool effect and we definitely had people stopping to watch. So yeah I'd recommend it.
5,I use this with my projector with a window screen and it looks great! The best one we have.
5,I like the effect on my bay window.  I used two 1800 lumen projectors and frosted shower curtain on the windows to get them to come to life. I used the audio out to connect to a portable speaker and made it even spookier. Was so good our house won 2cnd place because of our ghostly specters in the Windows. (I wasn‚Äôt even done with decorating outside). I would definitely recommend.
5,I bought this item along with a projector after seeing a video on Facebook and I gotta say it's really been a big hit around the neighborhood!  I have it projecting directly on my front door and have had people driving by slow down and stop to watch the show!  Couldn't be happier!  I think next year I'll get the big 3D Prop and maybe an extra projector to step up my Halloween game once more!  Highly recommend!
4,Nice effects not too scary for the little ones.
5,Now that we've used it for Halloween I have to rave. The only down side is that no one could see it at the start of trick-or-treating as it was still too light out. Once it was visible people stopped and watched and even took video. Small kids teens and adults were all very impressed (although 2 kids needed to be convinced it was safe to approach the house). Considering getting another DVD to add for next year.
5,We set this up to show in a front bedroom window for Halloween. Several ghosts make appearances and the sounds are cool. Can‚Äôt wait to use it again next Halloween! Very happy with it.
4,Great visuals for tv door or screen. Scary for sure.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†My house was the talk of the neighborhood on Halloween because of this DVD. I just projected on to sheer curtains in our front window and it looked awesome. I ran the audio to a powered speaker outside along with some additional lighting and sound effects of my own and the results were amazing.
5,Well - I never disappoint the neighborhood when designing my yard for Halloween. THIS was the best addition. Ghosts looked like they were breaking through the siding of the house.
4,Great. Really added to our Halloween
4,This is a fun DVD to add to your home haunt. A little on the pricey side but once you own it you can use the different character creatures around your haunt. Little kids were scared and the big  kids thought it was very cool.
5,We love this product! The neighbors were blown away by the effects. We had our own cheap projector got a shower curtain and cut it out over our door - and projected the cd on to it  - it was phenomenal! We had people coming up to the door and using their phones to record it and take pictures - very economical way of adding to your 'haunt' during Halloween!
5,A worthy addition to our Haunt this year. I've had good success with the other Atmosfearfx dvd's and I like the way the scenes can be modified to fit certain items/scenes. I set these up in our bay window while the trick or treaters come by and with a slight addition of fog these scenes bring traffic in front of the house to a halt.
5,Awesome product
5,Little pricey for a dvd but this is the second dvd from this maker and like them for my Halloween display every year.
5,It was a big hit this year. I set it up in my large picture window and everyone in my development enjoyed it. I received many compliments
5,I've already tried this video out on my pro-rear-projected sreen I'm going to use for Halloween this year.  Incredible!!!!! I can't wait to see our little visitors reactions to this.  It really does look creepy and scary.  I HIGHLY recommend this DVD to anyone that wants to create a realistic ghostly apparition scene for their home.  Very effective and I've also purchased Bone Chillers.  Just as much fun!  Get them before they're gone!
4,This is awesome - especially when used with a holographic screen! My only issue is that when you opt to "Play All" there are such long gaps between each section. Other than that it was an awesome effect for my Halloween party!
5,Looks great many videos very happy with it.
5,Absolutely love this! It's a bit different from Ghostly Apparitions (most of the spectors are or were once human). On this DVD the creatures are animated but awesome. Only the spooky grandmother is human (dead human). The sirens are the best on the sweet screen I bought supplied by AtmosfearFX. I've heard you can purchase similar fabrics for much cheaper but I just went ahead and bought AtmosfearFX's product. I am a real fan of their goods.
4,Love the dvd for Halloween!!
5,Stop reading and buy this. We used a low cost projector $75) and frost shower curtain liners (3X at $4 each) to get 130 inches of coverage over three windows in a second floor turret. OMG - it is AMAZING. Everyone loved it. If you are committed to doing a haunted house and you want what looks like professional grade special effects then hand over your money.
5,Wow! Throw this on the projector and prepare to completely spookify your house for Halloween. We bought a roll of semi-transparent plastic sheeting to project the images on after dark and holy moly it looks like a hologram! Have fun!
5,This is a great addition to any home or professional haunt. The AtmosFX Phantasms DVD is easy to set up and use for your haunt. I have had great results in my prehaunt testing and setup.  Great effects.
5,Purchased this for the front windows on our home.  Halloween evening found parents video-taping our house while the kids walked up and ran away screaming.  We added outdoor speakers with Blu-tooth and they were amazing.  We had a dozen people come up and ask us how we did it.  Will be purchasing two more with projectors for the upstairs bedrooms.  Too awesome!
5,Amazing a must have for a Halloween display
4,We got this since we've been using the ghostly apparitions for the last two years. It's good but there is a bit of lag in between spectres. Have to wait until Halloween to see how the kids like it.
2,Not much content for the cost
2,Not much content for the money. There are a lot of tracks on this DVD but they all repeat themselves. So in the end you have about 4 different tracks. Another problem is the content is all very simple and takes up only a small portion of the screen reducing the overall effect. Why not have more phantasms running around? Why have so much blank screen time on the tracks? Why not have more variety? When they have one phantasm on the screen (almost every track) why not make it fill the screen more? The quality of the effects themselves is good but unfortunately the execution leaves a lot to be desired. In the end it just is not worth $40. This feels more like $10 or $15 of content to me.
3,Although the graphics are impressive the images were too dark for rear projection onto a window.  My projector is 2000 lumens.  Also I have double windows (2 windows side by side) and these projections are created to use on a big picture window.  Some of the "Phantoms" float around but always end up directly in the center of the picture. Needless to say I was unable to utilized this DVD in this years Halloween display.
5,I have a huge window and I filled it with this video for Halloween and it was freakishly good. I did not use the audio from it and that was even creepier. Good stuff
5,Fun to watch and if I could I‚Äôd have it play in my wall all year long
5,My family and neighbors loved this one! I even had a few parents jump while watching as their kids picked out treats. One parent commented to my wife that our house was the best he'd seen all night. The troublesome energy ghost was a favorite with the kids that came to the house.
5,Right out of the box easy to set up and picture looks great. Very excited for Holiday DVD props and watching shows out doors.
5,This was a hit for Halloween. We had it projecting on our garage. The kids and parents loved it!
4,Great for Halloween too bad pauses in between are so long
4,worked awesome in the window.  I had a little trouble with getting it to look cool when on the wall (bigger) and I used a good projector.
3,Way too much lag/pause time between animations/scenes. Graphics are great audio is great. All in all a good video for projection but it needs more variety after a while it is noticeably repetitive. Also less 'dead' time between apparitions would be great. The effect was lost on guests who approached my house 'in between' ghosts. As they left it was new people reacting that got their attention and had them staring in shock.
5,It's fantastic! üòÄ
5,THIS is Amazing.  Out outstanding.  3 -17 girls thought it was Scary!  Thoroughly enjoyed this!
5,Great
5,I can‚Äôt believe how great this worked! I used a projector aimed at a window. From outside it looked like we had a ghost. Kids LOVED it in Halloween.
5,We are loving this as part of our Halloween decor.  The only problem is our projector is pretty inexpensive and not very strong  so in the future we may need to invest in a better one.
5,Great video and easy to use. Received great comments from adults and children.
5,Great effects video for Halloween.  Works great with my existing projector and white window curtain sheer.
5,Very good if you have a decent quality dvd projector.
5,The quality of these videos blew me away. Used my existing projector with some 6 mil plastic sheeting I had. Taped sheeting to the window dropped in DVD powered on projector and enjoyed the show outside.
5,Product arrived quickly without any damage. Husband absolutely loved this product and used it to create some amazing Halloween special effects. Great product and value!
5,This helped to make my Halloween that much more fun.  The film screen that I used was simply a curtain sheer layer and it projected my ghostly images beautifully.  Even with my lower end projector it worked nicely.
5,great video with a great variety of options and wide selection of ghosts!
3,A few of the images are very good. A lot of it is repetitive (extremely similar to other cuts on the same disc) or just dumb (the black&white movie scenes are totally useless). But the few that I used were of excellent quality and overall it helped with the Halloween display.
5,I got so many compliments this Halloween for my window display these discs have so many options you can make use of it in so many ways if you have or have access to a projector pairing this with the right material hung on a window/doorway makes the most amazing decoration.
5,WOW.... Where do I start seen this at a friends Halloween party and had to have one. Only received a few days before my party didn't realize what all you could do with it. Used it in a window on Halloween and had people stop and take video of it.
5,The product is very well designed and the image is high resolution only the timing is small...around 2 or 3 min per scene
5,I hung a bed sheet over the window and it looks great!
5,Love this effect from atmosFear FX. Has great detail and fun for the kids during holiday season
5,It's great even with lighting in the area it looks great.
5,Great buy for and added Halloween scare!
5,Everyone at our Halloween party thought this was awesome
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Love this DVD! There is a lot of features that make it customizable to your needs. Just wish they were cheaper! I would buy the others then.
4,The disk works but we expected more materiel for the price
5,Excellent for Halloween. It was a hit and I'm happy that this DVD was added to my existing AtmosFEARfx dvds. The graphics are excellent and so is the sound. My only wish is that the clips/chapters were longer but at least it'll automatically replay on its own.
5,This idea is a little more dedicated to the PC... rather than using the ATMOS projection system. That aspect to it could be better promoted.
5,Awesome totally awesome . The trick n treaters got stuck watching our window.. some even forgetting why they were there! And their parents too! Made the night memorable!
4,Wish they had a play all option on the DVD. The play options get redundant.
4,these are pricey but have received lots of compliments
5,Projected against my white garage door on All Hallows Eve -  great display for the neighborhood trick-or-treaters!
5,Loved your product I will definitely use again
4,Its what i expected. Works as advertised
5,Very easy to use.. Recommend for all ages. Really looks creepy projected in my bay window
5,The trick or treaters loved it!
4,everything i expected
5,Set this up at a party with a projector on the side of a house (no screen) and it worked flawlessly. Highly recommended. I will be buying the other versions for next Halloween!
5,Been a loyal fan of atmosfear fx. You want something to impress the neighbors and entertain the kids this is it. Just don't go cheap on the projector and projection material.
4,Very cool  just wish there wasn't such a wait in between each showing
5,Great Video for Halloween.  Used it both for a Door 3d Hologram and for a window display it was an absolute hit in the neighborhood.  Couldn't be happier with this purchase!
4,Pretty cool we used this on Halloween.  Only 1 complaint I wish it didn't take so long inbetween the scenes.
5,Looks great my daughter loves it
5,These Ghost effects were great perttey long viewing them than what people said about it being too short on clips. i even fell asleep after an hour of viewing.
5,A must for your Halloween set up.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Good price and works great!
4,Not quite bright enough for projection but it may be the projector
5,Had trouble getting on a usb but finally got it. Great video
4,The 3D character doesn't really work. The rest of the stuff is pretty awesome.
5,Best Halloween decor out there - people driving by would stop their car just to stare at our window. Great product!
5,Really professional quality video.  Worked great with the projector and was a welcome additional to my Halloween display.
5,OMG we had a haunted house this year and these phantoms were a huge hit! People kept coming back to see what else they saw on the screen!
5,Suitable for kids watches
5,Worked great
1,Start off by saying the images are great but the package is very misleading.  My projector (which is a WindowsFX Atmos) has a port for the SD card and a USB port.  I assumed that I would be able to transfer the images onto a jump drive and play them through the USB port.  NOT SO.  This DVD is copyright protected and it is against the law to transfer these images onto any other medium.  I have an email from the company stating so.  Therefore If your projector does not have a DVD player it wont work. By the way I have an external DVD drive which I also tried through the USB port did not work.
5,I have 4 of these Halloween DVD's now from AtmosFX  and this one is overall my favorite !!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†Actually scared a few kids with this for Halloween.
5,Looking forward to projecting ghosts against are big picture glass windows and scaring the bejesus out of our neighbors.
5,So creepy
5,Works well I just used white opaque shower curtain to project on in front of window
3,It was cool to have but wish we had waited for it to go on sale in the store after Halloween
5,Good video's and does have a couple of different video views. Just wish they had a mode to keep it set on some of the video modes.
4,AtmosFX makes a good product!
5,Great Halloween decoration brought my decor to a new level
5,:)
4,Price sucks for what you get.
5,Spooktacular!!!
5,The AtmosFX digital decorations are the bomb at Halloween!
4,Projects as promised. Fns at Halloween!
5,Cool effects
1,iwish it looked like more coming out of the screen like a poltergeist
5,So good a lot of kids did not come to my door for trick or treating.  And some of the moms didn't either
4,This is a great way to further spook out your house for Halloween. Good product.
4,So freaking cool!
5,Five stars!
5,I Love this DVD!  Excellent special effects. The Best Halloween item I ever had.
4,Great
5,Fast shipping and was a big hit for our spooky Halloween display! We can't wait to try out the Christmas versions!
5,projected the image on a cheese cloth.  Worked GREAT...  Will be doing this every year.
5,I bought this for my Halloween party and my guests loved it. It was a big hit.
5,Immensely popular in our halloween display. We are going to have to try another one next year. The kids love it!
5,Great! Worked perfectly with my gates of hell display. Used it to project souls rising behind my Cerberus animatronic.
5,Awsome product!  Bought several others from this company really enhanced my halloween decorations.
5,Absolutely loved the images on this one!  It was a neighborhood hit!
5,A must have for projectors
1,What a waste of money. These Phantoms couldn't scare a four year old.  What is worse there are only about 6 scenes on the disc.  They are just arranged differently the "changes" could be done by anyone with the free software that comes with any computer or laptop.  Do yourself a favor go to any one of a thousand scary movies and take the 10 second clip you like and use it instead of buying this disc.
5,Great quality. Trick or treaters loved it
3,For the price I expected better
5,One of my favorite AtmosFEARfx DVDs and we own several. Look great on form.Using for our outdoor Halloween display.
1,Bought this to shine on the wall during my private DJ show while entertaining house guests.I thought it may add a little something extra to the lights and lasers.I'ts amateurish at best and actually quite boring. especially in the loop mode.I suppose it could be useful to scare the kids on Halloween providing they are ages 6 and under.But then What can you expect for the price? Something that actually works??
5,Great product  worked awesome!
1,I bought this in August and tested it before my 30 days was up. Worked fine. Now it won‚Äôt. The disc won‚Äôt even load and I‚Äôve tried it on multiple players cleaned it tried toothpaste etc. I‚Äôm a single adult and children haven‚Äôt ruined it etc. It has been handled carefully. I‚Äôm very disappointed.
1,I was super excited to get this. I've had my eye on it for a few years now. halloween is my favorite holiday! As soon as I got it I opened it and saw that it's broke!! I've seen other reviews where they said theirs were broke but I still ordered with fingers crossed. So sad.
5,I am happy with this purchase. Everything was as expected through entire purchasing experience and video images are great!
5,PEOPLE DRIVE SLOW IN FRONT OF MY HOUSE TO WATCH THE WINDOW DISPLAY
4,really cool pretty scary
5,Great scenes... made my house the talk is the block
5,Very cool and creepy. The neighborhood kids loved it as did my husband and I.
5,good to use during halloween time to show off from your window.
5,great for our projector.
1,I ordered this and was very excited about it. I ordered 3 different ones of which 1 worked and the other 2 did not. I am very disappointed. I also only got directions with one of them. The other 2 only had the disk.
5,Great for Halloween Party!!
5,this ones good maybe a little pricey for what you get but this ones the good one
5,Love these! Big fan of all their products just wish the price point was a bit lower.
5,fast shipping great video project on side on neighbor's house tons and tons of comments thank you
5,Fun
5,excellent special effects
1,When attempting to use this -the files from the DvD display with artifacts that ruin the picture. We did troubleshooting with multiple file players in an attempt to get at least one useable video and have had no luck. I had to go directly to the AtmosFX website and purchase a digital download to get a format that played cleanly. Should have just done that from the start. Live and learn.
5,Used it Halloween night. The kids Loved it and so did our neighbors! lol
5,We love it - soooo funny to see people go by & take a 2nd look!!
5,this was a hit this Halloween! my kids loved it and so did my neighbors :)
5,Great effects!! They looked great on our window for Halloween!! I Highly recommend this product!!
3,Cute but kind of boring.
5,Perfect!! Just what we needed! Hit of the block!
5,Great graphics.  Super fun at my halloween party.
5,Great Halloween video. Can't wait to get more use out of it next year.
5,Just as expected and came on time.
3,Pricy. But pretty kewl effects.
5,awesome in window for Halloween.  I used a shower curtain liner worked great.
5,Great
5,So scary I can't even watch it.
1,I have other AtmosFEARfx DVD's and especially like the Zombie Invasion one. This one I thought would be just gouls and I guess it's my mistake not investigating it further. Yes Phantasms like the movie Poltergeist with too much TV use in each video instead of just the phantoms. Won't be using it and it came with a large scratch on DVD and because I didn't open it until October I can't return it on that basis so I am stuck with a worthless boring DVD.
5,Great way to scare the Neighborhood Kids.
5,Great product!
5,Love it.
5,Everything it was suppose to ne
1,Don't buy this DVD most of it is some old movie that lasts about 10 min. with a Phantasms pop up here and there but most of it is the old movie that takes up most of the time !!! Which the movie is not shown on short clip they give you on Amazon site !! Stay away from this ! The Bone Chillers Digital is much better I got that first..
5,Our absolute favorite Halloween "decoration" !
3,too much time between ghost
3,not worth the price
5,This proved to be a simple mechanism for Halloween decorating.
5,Very real and very Scarry. The audio is right on point!!
1,Three different media players - including the VLC one recommended - and I still can't get the damn menu for this CD to come up.  Only time it has was when I walked away from the machine while I was fighting with it for about an hour leaving me to believe that it does work just takes 20-30m to load??  Very unimpressed.
5,Very cool graphics! Will be using for our 2017 Halloween display.
5,This is awesome! I can't wait to purchase the other videos!!
5,Looks great in the window and on the walls!
5,The perfect finishing touch to our front yard for Halloween!
5,Super cool very happy with it cant wait until Halloween
5,Awesome effects. It was the talk of the neighborhood.
5,Great product would recommend

2,Cool images but I think it was over priced.
2,It was not what I expected for 70.00.
1,Second ATMOS FEAR FX Disk I have purchased that will not loop play on my DVD player.  Already processing a return on the item.
5,great special effects!

5,perfect to help scare at Halloween.
1,Broken missing CD & used!!! This is just a broken box with nothing! Total Scam!
5,Great everyone loved it.
1,This product is INCLUDED in the Windowfx package. There is NOTHING useful in it because it is included with the projector package.
5,Thank youKurt
5,Awesome effects!
1,I receive the christmas one instead this one
5,Great!
1,It came broken üòí
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Some tips that I have picked up as this is my first time using a digital decoration. 1. After reading some reviews and some people saying that the cost was too high for only a few scenes. I did a little digging. I only wanted to use the digital decoration for my window display only and the DVD offers all different kinds of display modes I didn't need and some scenes I didn't care for. I decided to get just the digit download of Phantasms "Wicked Wraiths Window/Hollusion" for $9.99. which has 4 scenes and 1 scare scene for a total play time of 3 minutes.2. I downloaded the scene onto my laptop (cant download onto a tablet or cellphone)and then transferred the scene to a $5 flash drive. And plugged that into my projector. This was the easiest and simplest way for me to be able to add more scenes from different AtmosFEAR digital downloads. Some people complained that each scene doesn't give a lot of run time so I also downloaded "Ghoulish girl" from Ghostly Apparitions and "Seductive Sirens" from Phantasms to give me a total run time of 9+ minutes.3. Some people complained about there just being empty blackness for a period of time and I found that with the digital download you can choose to download this on to your flash drive separately and its called "buffering". I chose to omit that so the scenes run back to back smoothly.4. I'm a girl on a budget so I used a $5 frosted shower curtain liner as my projection material and hung this on my patio door for the purpose of the video I have attached. due to the size of the video I trimmed it down to only show the Seductive Sirens. My cell phone doesn't do to good in the dark but the graphics are amazing! Its absolutely stunning and the neighbors love it!
5,I purchased a WindowsFX (now ATMOSFX) unit from Home Depot back in 2016 I know it still works! I love it and it's super easy. Is it the best quality sound most tech advanced...no. Is it reliable easy to use and set up and gives great visuals every year for my neighbors? Hell yeah.I found that my original SD card and some corrupted files making my images pixelated when projected and I reached out to AtmosFX's email customer service and I was really impressed! Not only did I get emailed replies within hours but after showing my unit's model number by snapping a pic of the underside of the projector I was sent a link to download all of the files directly from their site!This really impressed me and I will definitely be purchasing from AtmosFX again!
5,Thanks for perfect product and delivery
2,Not scary at all
1,If you are a super geek the download is for you. Be prepared to purchase third party conversion programs compression programs special mp4 readers and jump through all manner of other geeky hoops to get a download to work on a TV. And this company has NO CUSTOMER SERVICE line so forget about getting any help.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†So happy I received this before trick or treaters started coming. One little princess asked if that was my mom. LOL perfect the adults (including me!) loved it and the littles weren't frightened.

You‚Äôll need a projector and also material over the window‚Ä¶..we used a sheer white curtain from Home Depot and taped it tightly around the window. Tons of different ghosts pup up.
5,We had thought about getting the package that atmosfx offers. I decided to get my own projector after watching some you tube videos.  Bought a couple of these cds . So happy I did... has more choices of which ghoul we want to project... we'll be loving this set up this Halloween....Oh the shipping was very fast too... Thanks !!
5,Would have like some instructions on what type of screen to project onto.  Using for Halloween decorations.
5,Very nice production quality
5,H√§tte mir f√ºr die einzelnen Phantasms ein paar mehr Animationen zur Auswahl gew√ºnscht um jede einzelne Figur abwechslungsreicher in Szene setzen zu k√∂nnen. Aber wenn man sich nicht auf eine Figur festlegen m√∂chte und die Clips einfach random abspielt hat man definitiv genug Abwechslung f√ºr einen schr√∂ckl√∂chen Ob√∂nd.Sollte ein toller Halloween-Spass werden - hoffentlich ruft hier in Deutschland nicht gleich irgendwer die verdammten Ghostbusters weil da ungefragt gruselige Wesen im Fenster rumfliegen...! ;-)
1,I bought this thinkin I could put in my projector and it's just a CD.  don't buy unless you just want to play on your tv with a DVD player.
5,Honestly this was amazing.  The projections on the window were great  the neighbors loved it. Sadly we found the same recording on YouTube for free.  Do your research.
5,We purchased the AtmosFEARfx Phantasms DVD in time for Halloween. I used a white sheet as some websites suggested and it worked great! I didn't purchase the film sheet that the company sells for it so I can't comment on that part. It may work even better. We were really pleased with the quality! We are looking forward to purchasing the zombie edition for next year :)
5,Great!!! We used on our window for Halloween and it was amazing!! A neighbour asked where we bought it because she really needed it.
5,Works great at Halloween it scared a lot of people
5,I was bummed out it wasn't on usb it was on dvd but luckily I had an hdmi cord and it turned to out it was easy to set up
1,sound was breaking up the whole time throughout the duration of the video. video quality was good tho
5,Absolutely love this DVD. Everything and more than what I expected.
5,Brought this for halloween great effect and can't wait to use it.
5,works well  great images
5,The older kids thought that this was so cool that we played this at our holloween party.  It will repeat or it can be played individually.  Very good for windows.
5,Great product. Already bought a different dvd from them.
5,good
4,An awesome Halloween prop!! Lots of scares!!
5,Going to be great for Halloween
4,Great Halloween decorating ideaüòÅ
4,Overall very nice. Think it could have been a little more less witchy.
5,Ease of use.
5,Looks awesome in my front winow on a projector.
5,Wow it's amazing !!!
5,Everything was fine.
5,Very good quality picture  worth the money as can use for years to come on Halloween or spooky parties
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†The dvd was a tremndous success. Was worried that there wouldnt be much on it but there are 5 modes you can choose from- window tv wall hollusion and 3d prop modes. Each with 4 phantasms= sinister spinster seductive siren gruesome wicked wrath demonic poltergeist.We played it into our vertical blinds and it looked great. Animations and sounds are fab and trick or treaters loved it. Looked like ghosts in our bedroom!Definitely buy another one
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†DVD works really well and just what we wanted for the front bedroom window at a Halloween. Looks really good people stood and stared for ages watching each clip go by. This is for a DVD only. You can buy the really expensive fabric to go over windows etc I didn‚Äôt bother. I just used a white bed sheet and stuck it up in the window. As you can see in the video works with no issues at all after pointing the projector at the window. So my advice is buy the dvd (check out seller rep though as the one we chose took about 5 weeks to arrive!) but don‚Äôt bother with the fabric. Get a white sheet!
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Yes expense but a great idea and does what it says..spooktacular!!I would recommend the plain ¬£3 shower curtain from Amazon when you buy this as it does the same thing perfectly well.A little too much for the real small children as the video images are rated 12 years and above.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Phantasmically phenomenal ! Videos and pictures really don‚Äôt do this product justice when you see it with your own eyes you can‚Äôt help but be super impressed with the quality of the images projected! All my friends and family have loved it and it has given the desired effect I was looking for which was one of wonder and a slight tinge of fear lolI‚Äôm definitely going to purchase more of these products for other holiday periods can‚Äôt wait to see everyone‚Äôs reactions to them when I get them.
4,The dvd is good but felt expensive for the amount of video on it. I have tested on my TV and projector. Not sure how effective it would be on the TV in a Halloween setting. However - when used with a projector the effect is magical. It has several settings to use the effect on wall or window hologram or tv. Hologram was good projected onto a net. Not so scary that you couldn‚Äôt use with younger children.
1,We have been using the Ghostly Apparitions DVD to great effect as our Halloween window display for the last few years and thought that this year we'd try the Phantasm DVD.  However it doesn't include the horizontal/vertical selection function so you can't use it with the projector on its side.  Therefore if you have portrait style windows you lose half of the image.  The Phantasm DVD is useless to us - we had to go back to using the Apparations DVD instead.  We won't be risking ordering a Christmas one.
5,Toller halloween üéÉ Spa√ü
5,You‚Äôll be the envy of the street with this if you can project.  The menu options allow you to select the best displays for your scary party night
5,We used the DVD with a projector to create a great background for a Halloween party. We used the TV option that played a black and white horror movie interrupted by ghosts.
5,Wow my neighbours and visiting Halloween guisers were amazed. Really looks the part. Projected it onto a sheet on out living room window. Very scary.
4,Ok
4,Tolles Produkt
5,Very good
5,These disks may be a little expensive but they are worth it! Fantastic selection of creepy characters and a multitude of projection applications. Would recommend using projectors with 1800 lumens or more. Not really suitable for any under 1500 unless using in a darkened room.
4,Awesome on a projector but really pricey for what it is
4,bought for daughter. The people in street loved it
5,Entspricht genau den Beschreibungen!
5,So excited for Halloween üéÉ Tested it out tonight on the projector with just a bed sheet up at the window and it looks amazeballs!! Can't wait for the trick or treaters to see it!
5,Alles ok
5,Excellent perfect for Halloween love it
5,Enjoyed using this over Halloween and by the number of neighbours watching outside the house so did they.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Loved it it stopped people outside my home to watch it.
5,love this works great scare the crap out of kids and a few adults lol tip dvd.s work better than downloads
5,Will use this to be totally different to everyone else in the street!
5,Tr√®s r√©ussi pour notre Haloween une voisine n'en a pas dormi !  C'est vraiment tr√®s bien fait il faut un projecteur et un lecteur de dvd tout de m√™me pour l'utiliser (voire un ordi..) mais le r√©sultat est √† la hauteur de l'investissement.
5,Alles in Ordnung und wie beschrieben top*
5,Sehr coole Effekte.Freuen uns schon auf Halloween üòè
5,Super geil. Der Sound die Geister. Alles top
5,W√ºrde ich jederzeit wieder kaufen. Top Effekte. Die Kinder waren begeistert
5,Adepte de la f√™te d'halloween ce DVD √† projeter sur les fen√™tres fera son effet je recommande
5,Tolle Animation. Freu mich schon auf Halloween.
5,ich bin sehr begeistert √ºber die Sound und Videoeffekten.Mit dem richtigen Beamer hat man eine tolle visuelle DekorationEinfach gruselig
1,I really wanted to like this product and the projector that I bought with it.So it cost me a new DVD player a whole collection of leads and still it wouldn't play.If you get irritated by technology do not waste your time or money because I've since discovered that you can download it off the internet and play it through your own computer. I am disappointed and disgusted.
5,Fantastic item can't wait to scare everyone on Halloween. A1 Seller ++++++++
5,DEAR FOR A DVD BUT EXTREAMLY GOOD.HAD REAL FUN AT HALLOWEEN.
5,Great fun worth the money
5,Great
5,Fab range of spooky animations which look and sound amazing.
5,Great did the trick
5,After a long wait this was amazing thanks
5,Super illusion
1,Doesn't work on a laptop which is what I intended on using to hook to our projector. Now we need to buy a dvd player just to use this disc
5,The images and sound are awesome. Being able to run all video clips means more time enjoying Halloween than running to restart the projection.
