5,Charger comes equipped with a cable with dual USB C male plugs which I wwould recommend you use when travelling.  It is  are designed to supply a proper electrical current to the computer.  I had initially tried using another USB C cable with an adapter and it didn't work but with the supplied cable it did just fine.  Also when travelling in foreign countries because mny of the electrical outlets are recessed make sure you have a proper adapter  plug in which to insert the two prong fold away plug in on the charger.
5,this is exactly what I was looking for. a 65W wall charger with a longer USB-c cord to charge and power my steam deck. I used it for several hours in a hospital waiting room and my steam deck remained at full charge.this unit is smaller then the block that comes with the steam deck and has a longer cord it fits perfectly in the well of the case it is the perfect companion to the steam deck
5,I used it for about 15 days so far no complaints.  I didn't measure power output or anything but it seems no worse than the OEM charger that came with my MacBook M1.  It doesn't overheat either.
5,I used this for my I pad. Upon connection instantaneously turns on if dead. So impressive.  Also the light on the charger to let you know that you are getting power.
5,Extra charger for my Jackery 300 ... excellent especially combined to other charger port. Makes for two simultaneous charging system to 1/2 the charging time!
5,Short primer on "GaN charging". GaN uses Gallium Nitrade for its semiconductors. Chargers are usually throttle limited by heat. The warmer they get the less power they put out.GaN helps with that by allowing components built on it (like the stuff inside the charger) to run well at a higher temperature often with some higher efficiency levels and potentially cleaner power at least when the power brick is running at full speed charging stuff.Its a few extra dollars but worth it.This doesn't have a lot to be said about it other than its GaN has a good 65W level output and the light is pretty. If it behaves badly I'll update the review.The one thing I noted is that the charging cable it comes with is HEAVY. Heavier than two other similar 3 amp charging cables. That's a good thing unless you're planning on carrying it in your pants pocket. It means most likely some nice thick wires. Which you really want with a high watt charger unless you'd like to see the charge wire smoke and catch on fire.I should have put it on the kitchen scale. Suffice it to say that if you flung the little box it comes in at someone they wouldn't be happy about it!! :)I figured the cable it came with to be a throwaway. Thats where a lot of products try to save a buck or two but offer an extra to help boost sales. I bought this over a similar one just because it had a cable included so I guess that strategy worked?Nice work to the manufacturer for not cheaping out on a small item. It was noticed!
5,A USB-C charger that does exactly what you want it to!
5,Works good for android
4,No problem
5,This amazing and affordable little charger surpassed expectations. I use it on my MS Surface Pro 8 and I love it. It charges faster than the included charger it's more compact it's more rugged. The only thing that the included MS charger has that this doesn't is an additional USB charge port but that doesn't really matter to me. I did shop around when looking for an additional charger for my computer I even looked at Microsoft's shop. The MS-branded USB-C chargers are expensive and don't offer any additional functionality. If you're looking for a reliable charging solution for a computer that can charge through USB-C this is the one.
4,My Samsung Galaxy original charger got faulty and it takes almost more that 10 hours to fully charge my cell phone. after getting this charger now my cell phone charge with in 1houre and 30 minuets.
5,Works well
4,5th star for a regular USB B port
3,It stopped working and one of the ports had a short fast charging never worked
5,Charges my Macbook quickly! Love the nice long protected cord.
5,Heavy duty great product
3,This doesn't charge "Super Fast" this is just a regular "fast charging" charger and cord.Decent but not what I expected to buy
5,Charges phones and laptops very versatile long cable great value
4,My pixel Chromebook always had an issue with chargers and this one has taken care of that problem. The only issue I have with the charger itself is that it seems top heavy and doesn't always like to stay in the outlet but if you flip it around then it blocks the other outlet.
5,Needed a second Charging cable for my LG Gram and decided to go with a USB-C so I could also charge my iPad.Charges both with any issues.One thing to watch is how hot the charging block gets during charging... With this unit I have not notice a High Temperature on the block.It does get warm but not HOT.  other chargers I had actually got hot so this is an improvement.
5,An excellent charger. So far it has not shown any issues regarding power output. Its cable can be bent pretty easily and it adopts any form you want since the material itself is malleable.
5,I'd been using a 35W charger with my phones for a couple of years and didn't know any better - the phones always entered the 'rapid charging' mode - I thought that's all there was.  NOT!  I recently purchased something that needed 45W for full rapid charge so it was time to upgrade.  I decided to go for the whole enchilada and buy this 65W charger to at least hopefully delay future obsolescence a bit - GOOD CHOICE!  This charges that 45W battery hog without breaking a sweat and my phone charges faster too - WIN/WIN!  The cord that comes with it is long - 6 ft - and heavy duty I can believe it can pull a full 3A with no problem.  Small form factor too.  This one's a WINNER.
5,Super compact. Compatible with my go elite book and with my iPad pro
4,The charger has worked well and comes with a cable where most USB-C chargers on Amazon do not at the present time. The only drawback is that the cable is solid stranded which means it is stiff a bit unwieldy and is likely to fail sooner than standard multi-stranded cables.
5,Fast for a price
5,Bought this charger when I lost the one that came with my ipad. Wasn't sure it would work as well but it charged so quickly.
5,This charger works has advertised.
4,Like
5,The charger is fast cable looks solid and after a few month even if it looks in perfect condition esthetically it stopped working.Very hard to find high quality and durability cables.I wrote to the seller very responsive sent me a new set under warranty.Excellent customer service backing up on their product!
5,Charger wire is very sturdy and durable. Nice length too. Charged my iPad Pro very quickly.  Very happy
5,My college kid left her Macbook charger at home when returning to college. This charger is such a great value and ships so quick that it was quicker and easier to order this charger from Amazon rather than ship the original charger to her. Plus now she has a spare. Win-win!
5,Needed this to charge my NOCO jump starter and a couple Anker backup battery packs…works great
5,This charger is great for a Geek Vape Obelisk 120 FC
3,Fold out plug does not engage wall plug properly.
3,This unit is a good size and feels quality and solid... Until you get to the plug prongs.  This unit falls loose from the plug (and stops charging as it should).  I wouldn't recommend this product until prong issue is addressed. ..
3,The charger is really loose it doesnt fit the outlet properly and fall at the slightest tug.
2,My HP Elitebook worked well with this for the past several months. But in the past 2 weeks my laptop was randomly locking up. I thought it was a software issue but after lengthy investigation I found this adapter was over-surging my laptop and the protection was kicking in.I went back to the original HP charger and no issues. Other reviewers mentioned the same issues by the way. Now I have a useless brick I'm afraid to use. Buyer beware.
3,This charger seems to work okay but the fit seems to be off when I plug it into my iPad. It feels a bit too tight. No issues with function so far but the match just feels off. I worry it could cause a problem later.
5,Exceeded my expectations
5,More compact and cable with cloth outside seems to flex better
2,The description implies high wattage but when one does the math at the voltage of usb-c  the wattage sucks for this unit.  I expected high wattage/amperage I got 2 units that do not charge an iPad. Reading the documentation reality sets in. These units are Caca Poopoo for usb!  I said it I mean it.
5,I bought this to charge my HP laptop so I don't have to carry the original (Larger). I did have an issue with the original but they quickly fixed it for me. Very pleased with the service I received and performance of the charger.Great to have in your bag during your travels.Used to charge my HP Elitebook.
3,Only fast charge if the charger is fast charge
5,I use it to charge my iPhone and Nikon camera.  The USB-C charger charges the iPhone 12 very quick.
4,Product arrived quickly. It makes for a great replacment for the original charger.  I enjoy the 6 foot length and the fast charge!
5,This charger works flawless and the traveling case doesn't take a lot of space whenever I'm on the road. I use this item for my two MacBooks and it charges them quick then I expected. I am pleased with my purchase and I definitely recommend pruchasing this item!
4,It works well but it is sometimes hard to stay plugged into the wall and gets very warm.
1,I was very happy with the compact design until it stopped working unless right about 5 months in. The blue light indicating power doesn’t show and the device gets no power unless I hold the plug against the outlet. Seems to be a durability issue with the foldable plug that no longer keeps contact unless external pressure is applied.
5,I used this for my MacBook Computer.  I left the original cord at a hotel by mistake and they've not recovered it.  But this new charger and cord is much lighter and easy to use.  The cord seems very durable and the length of the cord is very handy.
4,Quality Looks great particularly the cable which was my main concern charged galaxy tab and mit z2 phones in turbo/fast mode.
2,Definitely not 65 watts has the highest supposed watt rating of all my chargers yet only charges slightly faster than my 25 watt charger. I also can't charge my phone with it's case on with this charger which I can do with all my other ones. Looks neat seems durable just doesn't meet the standards the company claims it does.
5,This charger is able to charge my laptop as advertised and it is a lot smaller than other 65W adapters. The provided USB-C cord is a nice 6 foot length and has a solid feel with a durable braided cord.
2,It was good at first worked and convenient due to not having to carry the bill original charger. Used it for about three months and only three to four times a month. Then the other day it suddenly stopped working. Had an error / power issue message on my laptop. Stopped working ever since. Tried different outlets. Same results.
5,Like the small size of the block. Fits will in backpack. Cable is a little less flexible than I'd like but does work well and rolls up in about a 4-5 inch round bundle.
3,Worked fine for the first month now the plung doesn't work properly switching from charging to not charging
5,Love how fast it charges
1,Stay away. This could kill your kids or burn your house down. Bought multiple units and after the first one fell apart making zapping sounds and tried to plug and unplug the others to see if it was a one time issue - they all fell apart the same way with the grey portion of the plastic delaminating from the rest of the body exposing wires. Terrible design the company should be ashamed of putting something this dangerous out as a consumer product.
5,lot of charger for the money.
3,Not 65w at all
5,Time will tell its durability
1,This chord worked for about 4 weeks and then it stopped charging my phone it was quite expensive for a charger and it was very disappointed at the fact that ithat it stopped working. It was out of the warranty time and I was told to send an email which I never received a response so I feel like I was out $30 for a charger that only worked for 4 weeks
5,very good charger pretty quick too
5,It's a charger. It charges things. Can't ask for more.
5,Charges pretty quick.  Not to bulky
5,Fast
5,Works great for my Samsung galaxy 9 plus. And also my lg velvet.
5,Same as the Apple version.
5,I like using for my office
5,Work just as advertised. Build quality is superior.
1,First of all the charge speed is medium at best.  So don't trust the fast claim. More importantly  it does not have good tines on the plug.  Falls out of a NEW outlet constantly other plugs sit firmly in place.  Can't charge if it won't sty in the wall.
5,Perfect size for travel
5,This product is awesome and charges very fast!
5,Chargers exactly as it states. Very fat!
5,Nice
1,The charging power is great however the brick is fairly heavy and the prongs on the plug are so small.  It constantly pulls out of the wall it's a terrible design that was clearly never tested once.
5,Works good
1,The charger stopped working after only 2 months. When plugging in to the socket it would charge for 1 second and turn off. The mechanism where the plug slides out is also really flimsy and never secure. I would advise buyers to find other alternatives.
1,Doesn’t work
1,I doubt the reviews. It's not working very soon after several times charging of my phone.
1,Although not listed this charger works well on my CANON EOS- R6 camera .UPDATE 8/6//22 I tested it once to see if worked and it did .UNFORTUNATLY IT ONLY WORKED ONCE IN AFRICA THEN FAILED. My other charger worked fine for the rest of my two week trip. SAVE your money .
1,Sparks flying out of the socket its plugged into
1,The charger worked as intended for about 3 weeks and now isn't charging my devices. That's my biggest complaint. The cord is 6ft long and paracord wrapped which is nice but is really stiff. Can I recommend this? No. Look elsewhere or gamble on one from a local retailer near you.
1,Worked great until it didn’t.  Don’t recommend.
1,After further review because of lack of documentation due to open box . The wrong app was used. In addition someone else's  wifi name and password were in the devices. With the correct App I could clear the  other customers access and enter my own with success.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Loved the product but only 2 months after buying product it failed and shorted out causing sparks and smoke when plugged into hotel room’s wall outlet.
1,The cable looks like it should be of good quality but it randomly would not provide power.Poor quality control.
1,Miss information wrong product descriptionIt works but it's not what I'm looking for the description of the item is wrong
1,It doesn’t fit my iPad
1,It says 65 watt I have two different 45 Watts one Samsung and one another brand and it's 20 minutes slower than both of them. Watch out this is a scam.
1,Was wrong For my IPhone can’t return UPD Wouldn’t except my computer Printed label
4,This is a good product to replace your worn out original charger.  It adds much needed length and charges devices very quickly. Took a star off because it tends to get very hot from time to time.  I recommend this product.
1,Doesn't charge
1,Worked great for ten whole months. Ridiculous.
1,Came broken and not sealed.
1,The build quality was promising but it stopped working after a week.
5,This was exactly what I was looking for.
5,I was forced to buy a new computer and unfortunately that means restocking my travel computer bag with all the necessities. I often take my computer from my office down to my craft room to use with my cricut and my sewing machines. I like to have a second cord so that I don't have to remove the ones on my desk (major hassle). This was reasonably priced and I love the size as it fits cozily in my computer backpack. I did test it out on the new computer to make sure it worked and all is well.
5,I was pleasantly surprised by how small this charger is it's great as a back-up and for travel. The charging cord is also cute. I am using this charger for a MacBook Pro that uses USB-C.
4,Surprised by how much heat this puts off. Sometimes it gets very hot so be mindful of where you put it. But it is a good charger and does the job.
5,Love the long sturdy cord and is a perfect replacement for my MacBook Air charger that I lost!
5,Nice size and charges fast
5,No problems. Keep one at each outlet that I use to recharge my devices.
5,Fast charging for my S20 Ultra
5,Using with my Google Pixel 6 Pro. Charges quickly and the cord is very durable.
5,it's ok
1,I’ve tested this with a professional meter gauge and this most definitely is not close to the posted output wattage they state no where even close to it this thing only was getting between 5 watts and 7 watts with and average amperage of .7 - 1.9 amps it’s no where near a high out put charger it’s less powerful then my iphones phone charger
5,The charger is durable excellent charging power and the cord is long.  It was shipped to me the same day.  Excellent service.
5,I bought this to quick charge the new portable car jump starter I bought. A normal usb charger would take hours and hours this charges the battery pack in five minutes. It came with a 6 foot long usb-c heavy duty cord. It works as advertised.
5,Fast shipping nicely packaged good quality charger and cable!
5,Heavy duty cord and charges very fast.
5,Much easier to carry in the Lenovo brick with two cords. Very “Apple like” and I really enjoy the 6 foot cord thanks for not being stingy!
5,Sonos Move won't charge with just any USB-C charger like I originally though this one meets their specs though.
5,These chargers are compact and sturdy. Much better than the brick that came with my MacBook Pro. Seems like it might charge the phone a little slower when charging the laptop. But the apple charger doesn’t even do that.
5,This is the first charger that I have bought.  Charges fast very good cord.
5,Just what I expected and needed: 6’ long is just right for me need.  I didn’t need the common 10’ kind. The cable is well made with strong.  It’s stiffer than expected but not a problem so far. Will recommend this to anyone needing a faster and stronger charging cable.
5,I love the box for packing it is SOLID! The charger plug fits tight charged quick.  Love that the plug is narrow too so won't fight for space on the power bar.  Thanks!  :)
5,Needed a 60W USB-C to USB-C to fast recharge the NOCO GBX45 Auto Charger as it isn't provided with that unit. They only give a standard cord that is slow as molasses. I left it on all night and it did nothing. Finally stumble across this charger which not only provides the charger it provides a very substantial USB-C cord. It charged up the Auto Charger in 15 minutes. Now that's what I'm talking about!
5,I like the performance of charging but I wish it had the old style USB type port with the type c port.
5,This is finally what I was looking for with more than 4 type -C charge items at home this charger is super fast reliable extra long and durable wire sturdy fitting connections. Now my phone tablet earbuds and wearable light source is always charged. Great item...check it out....
5,Performs as expected.
5,Feels beefy.  Nice coating on it makes it non slip-ish.  Charges good.
5,what can I say it did what it was supposed to
5,Charges fast it's durable too. I was extremely paranoid at first but I'm happy with what I got
5,It charges faster then the charger that came with my samsung a32 5g.  So no complaints yet
5,Vite
1,Pas compatible avec IPhone Pro Max 13 et IPad 7 contrairement à leur description
5,20 min get you to 50-60%. Full change in 45 min. Recommended you buy this for your top end phones
5,Works great on my S22+ and charges it fast while I watch a movie I wish it came with a 10 foot cord.
5,petit et pratique fait la job ok
5,It works well !
5,Product functions exactly as promised with a high quality finish and a high quality charging cable in the box.
5,petit et pratique fait la job ok
1,I tested the charger with a power monitor using it to charge a Samsung galaxy tab s7 that as a 45w max charging capabilitie this charger only went to 15w I wanted to upgrade from an LG 25w charger. You can see the difference of both charger in the picture. So a waste of time and have to return this product.No more PowerLot products for me..
1,Does not charge at 65watts
1,Read all the other reviews! Wouldn't even put my S22 into super fast charging mode so I put a charge meter on it & it's only got a 30 watt internals!
5,Fast charging very satisfied
5,Medium speed
4,No complaints at all about the charger itself. Provides the advertised power to keep my full-size laptop tablet and phones all charged up. Weakness is the cable... It's very stiff and doesn't lay flat on the table. Not as important for a device that isn't moving around like a laptop but makes using a tablet/phone while charging a bit awkward.
1,Do not buy this.  It worked for 1 month then stopped charging.  I have tried different outlets and different devices.  This is defective.
5,Does what it should is small and the provided cors seems pretty good.
5,The size power and finish quality are really good.
