4,At first it didn’t seem like it was going to be as easy as other reviews mentioned because the suction tool to take the bad screen off wasn’t gripping very well (the bottom half of my screen was thoroughly shattered which didn’t help its grip). I had someone who’s more tech inclined do most of the process for me so I was sure it was done correctly and they didn’t seem to have any issues with the process but now my screen randomly does it’s own thing (adds words or letters randomly/excessively scrolls or lights up without being touched or won’t register something I’m trying to do). Typically happens every other day for an average of 15 minutes and is usually resolved by restarting it. But I Can at least see clearly what is happening on my screen without worried of losing pieces or pixilations.
4,Screen works as it should. No issues. Installation was fairly simple 5/5. However the tools get a 2/5.  They may get the job done. The screw driver bits chipped on me. Barely made it through the install. The suction cup kept popping off couldn't get enough suction. Used a cup from an ifixit and packaging tape on screen and wet it for better suction and a 2nd pair of hands we were able to pry it off.
4,Would be 5 star if there were reasonable instructions.look at several different videos on the internet caution on the sealing adhesive.  User is truly left guessing for any instructions.
5,Updated review. Seller contacted me to offer refund or screen replacement. Considering I had already installed another screen on my device I opted for a refund. I’m updating my review to reflect the seller’s willingness to rectify the situation. Overall I still would not purchase this item again. Screen installation was not difficult. The suction provided was worthless have a backup. The screen started glitching immediately upon installation would type things without being prompted. After installing I noticed that the screen popped up a little and did not feel secure that’s because it was separated from the backing. Replaced with another screen less than a week later. Save your money and shop elsewhere.
5,UPDATE: seller sent me a new screen and it works great I had the screen installed the next day it was delivered !!!’ ////////////////If I could give this a zero star I would the first screen that was sent to me was a defective screen which I let the seller know seller shipped out a replacement  screen for me which I got it installed professionally and 2-3 weeks later the screen completely blacked out phone rings still but the screen is completely blacked out
5,Good product works as described!  Will update if anything changes. Easy install instructions included tool kit is ok but does the job.
5,Everything you need for the replacement comes with this LCD quality it’s really good I’m happy with this product and seller
5,Quality LCD as advertised. If you’re having issues with display. Always disconnect the ribbons and reconnect
1,Well I bought this and it failed. it should have been easy to do because of the color codes and videos BUT its not even labeled properly and if you use the wrong screwdriver on the screws it will strip the hole.So I am down to my last screw and the screwdrivers are not properly labeled for the screws. the color code is off. when it says use a yellow screwdriver it may be red so you are using the wrong screwdriver stripping the holes!!! Now I can't get the las t screw out and I can't fix my phone...been working on this for 3 hours!!!! Not happy. So I bought this and it looks like I am going to have to spend $200 plus the cost of this screen to go get it fixed.
2,Touch screen is horrible
4,I actually like how the screen comes with everything you will need for the replace but my only problem is the screen is dark after reinstallation.
5,I’m not tech savvy in any way Or knowledgeable with tools.  I’m just a mom who was trying to avoid spending $200  on getting my screen fixed.  I was able to use this kit plus the how to videos that was sent to my email and fix/replace my screen all by myself.  It did take me an embarrassingly long time.  The only difficult part was taking the screen apart I used a blade to help but other than that it’s pretty self explanatory and if I can do it with this kit then anyone can lol.
1,I bought this for my iPhone 11 I installed it everything was fine until I turned on my phone the settings it as you can see in the pictures it will not work with the Face ID it is not compatible with an iPhone therefore is probably voided my warranty on my iPhone so thanks guys that was really crappy of you too send me a $50 piece of crap screen replacement that is messing my iPhone up!!!
4,It was a easy fix!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I recently had an issue with my screen and after looking at third-party vendors' service costs I decided to buy this screen replacement kit and do it myself. The whole kit comes as it's described and the video really helps. If you're not sure you can always go on Youtube and find a second video to double-check your process.The screen works perfectly and the resolution is very neat. Great purchase. I'll encourage anybody to take this challenge and have fun during the repair!
5,Perfect!!!! Came with everything I needed. Was delivered earlier than expected!  The seller even went out of their way to email me links to the instructions and customer support numbers.  First time replacing a screen and did it in 30 minutes with no issues.  Thank you.... Y’all saved me over $100 on repairs.
4,Great product ! 10/10 fixed phone completely takes time.
5,Good product and also I received support at the time to install the item the IPhone it’s working perfect .
5,This kit was pretty useful!That magnet cover that shows u a quick diagram of the screws u will need to remove to perform the repair with!Screen looks oem like haven’t noticed any issues so far so this review can changed after a few more days of using it
1,Installed quick and went out within a month. Screen just went blank and nothing works. No customer service at all to help.
1,Product did not work!
5,Great product
5,Easy to install most screws already assembled I finished my repair in 10 mins (after losing a part for a few mins) definitely recommend.
5,Felt like I was performing surgery the whole time but everything went smoothly. Came with everything you need as well as an extra screen protector. Good buy.
5,I've replaced my screen a few times works well! Just like any other I've purchased no problems if you install it right.
5,Screen quality is outstanding. Respond flawlessly to the touch and the easiest to install. Also provides insulation videos if needed.
5,It was really easy to install and I’m surprised it works as good as a genuine apple display! 10/10
1,screen wont turn on and bad customer service
5,This is a good item I recommend buying very satisfied
5,This is a great quality screen. It was very easy to install.
5,I liked how it was easy to install
5,Got the job done replace the screen
1,I installed this for a customer. The installation went great with the usual transfer of parts. After the installation the screen's right side and top middle wasn't working. Normally i would be able to return it but in my case the customer waited so long after i bought it. Sooo yeah... now i got to waste more time and they are stuck with a half working phone until a new part arrives.
5,easy to install great quality
5,Item works great product
5,Perfect fit and quality.
5,EXCELENT HIG QUALITY
1,Seems to be cheaply made. Screen goes black a lot during phone calls and you can’t get it to light back up to hit end call or numbers. Screen goes black and takes a while to turn back on when in the middle of a text. Kit screw drivers stripped out after one screw and had to use someone else’s. Would not pay $70 for again
2,
1,I don’t know if the sensor is off or what but texting is hard to and annoying because it adds extra letters and or words that I was not trying use
1,My Face ID no longer works. Had I know that previously I would not have bought this screen as it’s not compatible with Face ID
1,LOS DESTORNILLADORES NO CALZABAN CON LOS TORNILLOS( solo me sirvió el azul para abrir la pantalla)
1,There is a black part at the top of the screen I would not recommend anyone buying this!!!
5,it was easy to install
4,Pretty good optionHad the screen adhesive and screen protectorFirst one had issues but got a replacement quicklyBut the second one has a single pixel that doesn't workBarely an issue but its still a good option
1,Wouldn’t recommend. Yes gets your screen temporarily fixed but the screen is very thin cracked very easily screen glitches a lot which got my phone disabled right now. Also came missing a piece so now my Face ID do not work.
5,This was a really good kit at a good price. It provided literally everything you needed (except for a hairdryer/heat gun if you have an iPhone 11 or the glue to glue the plastic sensor holder which I just placed in there without the glue and hoped the screws for the entire earpiece will hold it down). The video got a little confusing for me in the middle but once I took a break and came back everything made sense to me. The video is really helpful just important to follow the steps as shown in the video and pay attention to what they're doing. Only hard part for me was taking the glue off and putting the screen back on. Because I was eager to put the screen back on I ended up cracking the bottom part of it. But everything still works and was half the price of taking it to the shop. Took me about an hour tops for my first time doing it. Overall good kit and definitely recommend it. Just have patience.
5,Nice screen quality! However the touch function stopped working after I turned off and on the phone. They sent me a replacement though so Im happy!
