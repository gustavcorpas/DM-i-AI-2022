5,I was amazed by the quality of the recorded audio. The unit makes the 2 AAA batteries last a very long time.  For playback I keep the audio level low and hold it to my ear like a cell phone but it plays back plent loud enough.
5,Very easy to set up and use. My best friend in here. Thank you for something electronic but easy to use. I know!!!
5,I love this it was exactly what I wanted.  I needed an mp3 player for running.  I wanted an iPod but they are way expensive and I worried that they might make me make certain upgrades just to download music I already paid for.  I decided to gamble on this Sony player.  I already had a cheaper model and knew that at the least it would hook up to my computer through 1/8' cable and it could record songs.  This one came with a USB port but I didn't think my computer would recoginize it.  My computer is an old mac High Sierra or something.  But it worked!  With all my songs on itunes I was able to drag and drop them into the Sony.  Some of the songs won't copy over.  I think it happens because iTunes or the record company puts code that limits file sharing into the song file somehow.  Mostly it was just a few major artists that wouldn't copy over.  I can't say what would happen on Windows or a different Mac operating system or a different itunes version (mine is old there too).  I believe that I could probably get decent song files if I recorded 1/8" cable style for the songs that won't copy over.  The sonic quality is flawless also.  Other good things about this is that is comes with 2 AAA batteries and that's what it requires to run.  I like that because devices that have to recharge over and over eventually run down.  As long as the batteries are good this device will probably work.  The interface inside of it is natural easy to navigate.  Hit play for enter or back for the previous screen.  I haven't actually used this one to record anything but the other Sony was a cheap version and it sounded great.  Plenty of recording time on it's internal memory.  I made 7 twenty song playlists for my runs and there is still 29 hours of available recording time.  Another thing i like is that the device is not so small and light that it's flimsy and it's not too big either.  For runners like me you'll like the hold button while you run which snaps in or out as you want.  The device turns off or on by holding the button which is good for avoiding accidental shut offs or ons.  The volume level on playback is the same as with an ipod or iphone which is that it can get plenty loud.  After using this a few days there is no noticable decline on the battery usage which is good.  For audiobook people I can't say if this will transfer for any specific system.  I believe this item is an excellent value.
4,Obviously the mic is crap - they are charging $3 extra to include it and I didn't expect much.  I only got it because the one without mic wasn't on prime and I needed it right away.  But Mic did work (with mic the recording the volume is about half and clarity about half compared to the mic on the unit).  The recorder itself has 2 mics (stereo) and works great with good clarity.  It does have voice activation (they call it VOR) which also works well but the menu is a bit hard to find (google it).  Once set in that mode it stays in that mode even when turned off and on which is nice.  Note that to get to the main menu for everything you can simply hold the back key home button for 2 seconds.  From their you can set VOR.  For double speed playback stop the playback and hit the up arrow for that menu - you have to both set it to "2" and also turn it on.  Double play back does not change pitch - which is good.  I am pretty happy with this buy and did not expect a $50 mic for $3.  The thing does not need a mic for most uses.  I wish there was a decent mic I could buy for $20.  2 AA alkaline batteries last about 20 hours or so in it on record mode.  I would buy again without doubt.
3,This item was purchased for a gentleman in his mid-90s. Unfortunately the technology is too complicated for him to use. I’m sure it’s an excellent product.  Sorry
5,A great recorder on different sides brand new at good price.
5,I bought this to record some voices for auditions and lecture classes. Tested it out and I am really happy with it. It is very sensitive and picks up sound extremely well. So well that if there is the slightest noise it will pick it up I was recording in one room and it picked up the water running in the kitchen. So gotta mess with the settings to your sensitivity preferences. Also it can record long periods of time left it on after a lecture without realizing it and when I did it was 4 hours later without turing off. Great battery life going back to the quality I recorded a conversation in a car on a busy highway after learning how to set the settings to my liking. Gotta say best thing ever I have used more expensive recorders in film classes and this is a great alternative for beginners who want to mess with this. It is cheap good quality and fun as well. Sorry I ramble just wanted to share everything I could after testing and having it for a few months now. Highly recommend.
5,This audio pickup lots of background noise. The  Lav mic that comes with it is a complete waste.
5,I love this a dictation recorder a lot. It’s good for dictation and even better for recording music. It has many features mostly found on music players like random playback can move files around it will play file after file with one song on each file or just one file or repeat just one file or all of the files you like. It also has different modes of music play back depending how you like to hear the music. I just used a a regular auxiliary cable to load the music in from the music source. The quickest way to learn how to use it is to press the options button then browse around in there. I really love how it can hold 360 hours of  very clear 190 bd music using a 32G micro storage chip or 180 hours with a 16G chip but not the storage chip used for cameras the other one. It also has 55 hours of battery life. I’m really glad of having it!
3,EASE OF USE SOUND IS EXCELLENT BUT NO SCREEN LIGHTING IS A MAJOR DOWN-FALL. NOT REAL DURABLE BATTERY COVER CAN RELEASE EASILY & BATTERIES WOULD FALL-OUT . A GOOD PRODUCT. BUT W/O A BACKLIGHTED SCREEN & BATTERY CASE ISSUE. YOU MAY WANT TO SEARCH FOR A DIFFERENT PRODUCT. MOST DISHEARTENING FOR A SONY RECORDER OF THIS QUALITY TO HAVE 2 SIMPLE ISSUES  TO KEEP YOU FROM BUYING THIS MODEL
5,I really like this recorder. Great sound easy to use. The only downside is it requires b batteries. There is no spit for a cord to charge it.
5,La limpieza del audio.
4,Sound is not as good as expected. We are using this for meeting minutes and it's hard to pick voices up. Then trying to transcribe is absolutely worse. Have to hold it up to ear to hear the recording.
4,Received it without a MIC and it did not turn on replaced the batteries and still deadRequested a exchange for a working one and because of Prime I got it the next day.Still have not received credit for my return device.The sound is ok not great.  Clear and understandable however it does have a small tunnel sound.
5,I purchased 5 of these recorders for my students to use in class and practice for testing. The podcast teacher had other that were way nicer (and expensive) and my students found these one more user friendly we used both the Integrated mic and we also used these headphones with mic we have in class and the sound quality was good in both. Also to download erase and find the files stored is very easy.
3,I purchased this particular one because of the line-in microphone which I really need for my particular application. Within a day or two the mic literally just fell apart. I had only used it one time and have kept it in a study computer bag inside of a little protective case I had repurposed. The line-in mic is terribly cheap. With that said I LOVE the recorder. It is simple to use and has great audio quality. But I really need a line-in microphone and this particular one is no bueno. I'll be looking around for a better quality line-in mic and I would advise you to just buy the recorder without this microphone.
3,Unfortunately this machine was not what I wanted to order but it is what I did order. I misread the feature write-up. It is not useful to me or my business.
4,I did not have to read instructions so that makes it user friendly. Does pick up background noise even after adjusting setting. Have to have a micro-SD 32g Card; will not take any other size. It records well using internal mic but provided lapel mic works better.
5,I have only used this one time. I found that the audio is crisp and clear using the mid range recording quality. It has great pick up range catching sounds from 30 feet away. This was with the wide angle recording pickup not focused. Operation is simple and straight forward right out of the box. the playback is clear and easily understandable using ear buds or head phones.  I was surprised that the USB connection is retractable and when extended will plug right into a USB port. It would be useful to have a cord (not supplied) to use in situations when there is not enough space to plug it in directly into the USB port.
5,Compact and easy to use. Price very reasonable. Glad I picked it.
5,When you record and replay audio there will be a large difference in quality between the built in speaker and playing the file on a computer. Will sound poor on the built in but surprisingly good on a computer.Small easy to use decent battery life. I am happy with it.
5,It’s great
3,This new model PX470 is worse than the prior PX440. They apply compression to your recording now which makes the voice sound distorted and fluctuate in volume in response to the overall volume. This also causes fade-ins and fade-outs to control the overall volume. All of this negatively impacts the recording which wasn't the case before with the PX440. They made the product worse with these new voice modulations.
5,I use this with my Speeder Rail Car that runs on the rail road.I tuck the microphone in with my headset to record onboard conversation and radio transmishion works fantasticJust what I wanted the mic has a nice long cordI recommend if you are looking for a easy to use quality recorder.
4,Exact Item and Shipped in a timely manner. Easy to use. OK sound. Easy to transfer audio files to computer
3,The item works. I get feed back when I used it to voice record in the aircraft so I am still back testing the noise cancellation. As of now it cancels most but not all noise.I spent lots of time trying to connect the device to the computer unsuccessfully.The usb port set me back a few months!  How to slide the lever to release the port was very unclear on the product description and  not explained by customer service.You will be disappointed if you don't know how to find and use the built in usb port. No one explains through much deliberation.
4,Great compact unit
5,Easy to use. Not my first recorder. Replaced lost recorder.
5,
3,I thought the sound quality and range for recording would be much better. I did not return this item because I needed it ASAP for several meetings. Fortunately for my Board meeting for which I am the Secretary Zoom has a recording feature which has sound quality far superior to Sony recorder but where no Zoom recording available Sony is adequate.
