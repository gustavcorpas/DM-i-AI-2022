4,It works as it should except every so often i have to push the device back into the port because it shakes it's self out of the cigarette lighter port just enough to lose connection from just driving around over time. I don't have that issue with other things i plug into the cigarette lighter port and none of the wires are under any sort of tension. I have had it in my car for a little over a year and use it regularly and the usb ports still both work and both still grab the male end of the wires firmly so that's nice.
5,We are on the road camping often and wanted something that had a better charge time to it - this is a must-have! Nice quality and fast charge.
5,I love that it has 2 ports to charge at the same time. Works great.
5,Bought 2 of these and LOVE them. Works very well and is low profile so it's 3sticking out enough to be in the way.
4,Glad I picked this 1 it works as described.
4,For my purposes this does the job for car charging use. Feels like a solid charger looks aesthetically nice cord is cool looking small (but not too small) in design... just right. Only reason it's not 5 stars is that it states it's a fast/quick charge & it is not. I'm assuming that due to the cord not being quick charge capable. Doesn't charge slowly at all just not quick charge. Worth the buy though!
5,I love this charger for a fast charger but My daughter loved it more! The only dislike is that its flat with your car and tough to get out.
4,This charger is worth it better than my old car charger! I'm  so glad that I went ahead and got it as a replacement! The material is in really good quality and it really charge my phone fast plus the charging chord that comes with it is a plus! I'm happy with my purchase and definitely will repurchase. highly recommend this product! It is worth every $$!
5,I drive Uber and Lyft and their apps suck the life out of my phone. I now drive around with 100% power running both app and Pandora at the same time!
5,Nice size seems to be very durable.  Also will charge two units at the same time.
5,My son weàrs out his phone on road trips and some chargers can't keep up but not this bad boy it's got enough power for fast charging and it's build very well.
5,works as advertised
5,excellent product and service!
5,Very well made with a metal body that feels substantial.  The two ports work as advertised and charge my phone quickly.  I normally buy the cheap ones (>$5.00) but am glad I spend a few dollars more for a much better and useful product.  My other dual chargers only have 1 2-amp socket.  The second socket is 1-amp which won't charge my phone if I'm using it to navigate.  This one has two fast charging ports which is a great improvement.  My only complain (I won't deduct stars because it is more of a personal preference) I wish it did not have the power on light indicator.  I find the light distracting when driving at nigh.  Also I use it in a camper van and have to unplug it at nights because I find the light too bright.
4,I needed a car charger that supports quick charge and I previously used the Anker roav car charger that had an app that drops a pin location when you disconnect and reads your car battery level.  I was very happy with that until the app just stopped working and i ended up losing it.  I couldn't find that model anymore and the newer version was too expensive for me so i started looking for alternatives and came across this one.  It looked good and was a great price so i gave it a shot.  It worked out very well.  The charger charger my galaxy s20 ultra really fast.  Did i time it?  No but it always topped out my phone pretty quickly when i plug in and it feels a faster than my previous charger that supported quick charge 2.0 enough to be noticeable.  The build feels good and durable and it sits flush in the port so it looks really slick.  I couldn't give it full 5 stars because more than once I popped it into the lighter port and plugged my phone in only to realize later it was not pushed in far enough so it never charged.  Obviously that's on me for not paying close attention but I feel like it should be more self evident that it hasn't clicked into place.  Plus it is sometimes difficult to pop it back out of the port because it's so flush and tight.  But hey maybe some people will prefer that.  If you leave it plugged in all the time that's probably a good thing but since i do not kick leaving it plugged in when not in use for extended periods of time it is a tad difficult for me to remove and reinstall.  But otherwise it works beautifully so 5 stars for the other features.
5,This thing is heavy which makes it feel like a durable quality product but what steals the show is how fast this charger juices up phones! Seriously it charged 2 phones nearly 50% in maybe 10 minutes. Will buy again!
5,Like the fact it saves space and came with a coed
4,The quality of the product seemed very nice and sturdy unfortunately it didn't work with my Pixel 6 Pro with a Qi wireless car charger but the seller was very polite and helpful to get it refunded.
5,Fast charging is fantastic and works perfectly. My issue is the fitment is a bit tight for my car's charging port and makes it difficult to insert and pull back out. If you are planning on plugging it in and not removing it each time you turn off your vehicle then it will provide a very secure connection and wouldn't be an issue until it comes time to transfer to another vehicle. It is so tight for my vehicle that I'm afraid one day it may just pull the charging port right out from my car.The cable that comes with the charger is a bit stiff and rigid but feels sturdy and made to last. I replaced my cable with a thinner lighter one that came with my phone. Overall it's a great purchase quality built heavy use fast charger that simply works each time you plug it in.
4,good value
5,It really charges fast saved my life as we rely on gps
5,Works very well.
4,Perfect for what I needed. I need one that didn’t protrude much from the cigarette socket so I could still close the cigarette tray in my Mercedes
5,This does a decent job with a fast charge. Better than the standard lighter adapter.
5,The size for me and the fast charging
5,Is a very good charger works great fast charger. I like it
5,This is for the AV829 Ainope Charger. (and the model before it)  These are the BEST chargers.  They offer clean fast power and do not get hot.  I have one in my car and one for trip rentals... lost it bought another.  Considering $ for satisfaction: this is one of my favorite best buys!  It also does not stick out so there is less chance of busting it.  Metal case solid state.  Fast Charging...  Love it!I was not paid for this review... I only endorse what I really like... expect to be disappointed hope to be wowed.  This is a wow.  Get it!
5,I have a dashcam and a fast charging Qi charger connected to this. Both require QC ports and I can run the camera and fast charge my phone wirelessly at the same time. I've only had it a few days and no problems have crept up. I'll review more if it has any issues otherwise assume I'm still happy with it!
4,I bought this because it was a low profile car charger but unfortunately it's fit it so tight that when I pull it out it pulls up the dash covering with it. I had to pop it back into place this doesn't fit a 19' vw jetta. Bummer. With that being said it does charge very well. A lot faster than most.
5,Very fast charger.
5,It charges my Galaxy S20 fast.  Product is as described.  I'm happy.
3,Would not fast charge my Pixel 6a.  Used the supplied cable.  Tried another working cable.  Neither worked.  It did slow charge it looks solidly built and maybe for other phones it will charge rapidly.  So I give it 3 stars but I returned it.
5,The charger feels well constructed and works as advertised. When I plug my LG V40 in it says it is fast charging and indeed even if I am using GPS and have the screen brightness cranked up it still charges faster than the phone is using power.My old car charger died on me a while ago and bought this to replace it just in case. I am glad I did. I had to drive somewhere about 45 minutes from my house and needed my GPS so this easily kept my phone topped up. The charger is compact as well so if you keep it in your glove box or something it won't take up much space. Plus the included cable works as intended. Given that quality of the charger and the fact that it comes with a cable if you can grab this for around $15 like I did then it is definitely worth the purchase.
3,So this a super durable product and it is still working since i purchased it however it is slightly to big and is forever stuck in my 12v charging port.
5,Compact product wicked fast charging. Phone doesn't feel like its overheating. Great product when you need to quickly get some juice into your phone in a short amount of time
5,Bought this for my new iPhone 13 to get rapid charging while using turn-by-turn navigation. My older Anker charge lasted for years but only maintained the current charge level while using navigation and music. This little baby charges my iPhone full with this heavy usage. The cable works perfectly for my daughters Samsung S22 and if very high quality. Highly recommended!!
5,Very happy with this charger.Charge my phone quick.Fit for purpose.
5,Works great for my car. Charges my phone's and I'm off to the races!
5,Exactamente lo que se ofrece buena calidad y precio
5,this is a nice piece of kit not junky
4,This charger has proven to work on 2 smart devices at one time and still have them charged within an hour. Unlike other car chagers when it took as much as 4 hours for a full charge.
5,I needed a charger that fit snug in my cigarette adapter didn't block my cup holders and was able to power my phones.  This unit met all that and was a very solid build however it stopped working just under 6 months of use.  It happens so I contacted the manufacture by email and in less then a day I had a response and in less then 3 days I had a refund.  Customer service's response time was exceptional and very much appreciated.
5,Lov that I can charge 2 products at same time
3,This does not fit flush to the car like others do. Also the LED light is always on and always drawing power so if you use it in a cig lighter that is always on you will drain your battery down.
3,Photos were just a little misleading. It does not sit flush to the dashboard (Chevrolet Silverado) when plugged in my cigarette lighter socket. Stands out proud by about "¼.. but it's well made and charges devices quickly
5,Just what I was looking for.
5,Works as advertised and cord is perfect  .
3,Know it is Not compatible with iPhone 11Pro
4,The charging speeds are a bit lower than advertised 0-80% my S10 took about 45 mins.. still better than most I've used and the quality is fantastic. It doesn't stick out very much it's nice and heavy bc of more solid materials. So very durable which is nice since my past 3 faster ones broke easily
4,Works as advertized! 9nly real downside is that you really have to make sure it's plugged all the way into your device or it won't charge.
2,I've plugged my phone into both of the fast charging outlets on this and it won't fast charge my phone. Lame.
3,Charger works really well I have not had any issues with it. I can quick charge two devices simultaneously. The cable on the other hand no good. It stopped quick charging after 3 months and the devices detect it as being improperly connected to the charger. If you're looking for a car charger alone buy one individually and buy a good name brand cable elsewhere. You're going to pay double in the long run.
4,I've got no complaints about the converter but the cable just tried to burn down my semi truck. The end must have shorted.
5,A little expensive but a very solidly made charger. It is actually made with metal instead of plastic and has a very good feel to it. Works very well
5,I love that it charges really fast if not faster than the actual cord that came with the phone. The cord itself is well constructed and seems to be made of a high quality material that can stand up to regular use. Its small size also makes it easy to drop into my purse and take with me.  I have no complaints as it has been working perfectly.
5,Do you have a flagship phone? This is a flagship charger! Powerful output on two ports. A must have for every car! All metal construction was desired because my last charger split in half. This one will not have that problem. Buy it now!
5,Fast charges LG Phones confirmed 👍Sits closer to flush with 12v port than others.Has 2 fast charge usb type A ports.Comes with a 3ft usb C cable which is braided.  Seems durable.Im very happy with this purchase.  Now I can also fast charge my phone while driving.Good stuff
5,Good quality
4,I installed the charger in my wife's car in the center console. Unfortunately the console has a closing cover that has to remain open when the cable is connected. To close the cover we have to remove the cable. The charger works great improving the charging capabilities over the the built-in charging. We are very happy with the upgrade and it allows charging of my wife's Samsung Tablet.
5,I love this charger for its flush mounting and its very fast charging ability. The only down fall I've found is that it requires certain cables to be able to fast charge. The cable that comes with it works great. But when I used a different cable that is much longer it was not able to fast charge. Most likely because that cable was unable to charge at the same rate.
4,The charger works great in my car.  Fairly fast charge.
4,Good value for the performance.  I only had it for a few months.  So far it's working well only four stars because I don't know how long it will last.  If it last couple of years then It deserve  a five star.
3,The charger is not compatible for all cars. I have a Cherokee and had to push it hard to put it in and to remove it. I see why some showed pics of it broken because I think its possible. I did not put it back in brought another one and use just the cord.
1,Very disappointed in this product. It does not fast charge a Samsung S20 or any compatible device attached. It fit very poorly and I doubt it can be removed with pliers. I should have never installed this when it had to be forced into my 2020 Kia port.I'm going to stick with name brand from now on. These vendors that Amazon allows to sell here are not ethical or truthful and overstate every aspect of products. The 30 day return means you must be quick in testing all claims of products or be like me and stuck with subpar items.
5,Used this product to fast charge my iPhone and my usb fan in my camper van what use to take all night takes an hour excellent quality fast shipping well worth every penny
5,Okay this is a great little purchase. The little power  thing feels sturdy and it's slim too! It charges fast! Great part is that it charges while you are using it so it's good if you need to keep your gps on or for passengers that need a charge. Cord is the perfect length.
5,This is everything that I wanted. It is small but mighty! Charges fast is well make fits my phone (Samsung Note 10) I would recommend to others. Price was good too
5,I like how this adapter fits into the power socket without sticking out.  I can leave it plugged in and it's never in the way.
5,Well made product.  Yes it will fast charge your phone and you can charge 2 at once.  Worth the money and seems built to last.
4,The metal charger fits nice and snug and is low profile. But the braided cable is too stiff and inflexible. So I prefer to use a vinyl coated cable in my car instead.
5,this item shipped quickly when I used  it I was very suprised. This offers a truly rapid charge and I use a work phone and personal phone along with my galaxy 3 watch and this takes care of all three from our work truck.
4,Sits low almost flush which is good for not being in the way but makes it a little difficult to pull out. I just put it in the car to try to see if it works at all worked fine.
5,Charges my wife's Samsung and my LG extremely fast compared to any car chargers we've used in the past.  The low profile allows me to close my center console and leave the charger in place.
5,This is a great charger.  Good power output.  Very flat design it almost looks like it's built into the car.  Most chargers I've had feel like they're about to break from the time I buy them this one feels solid I'm hoping to get a lot of use from this one.
4,Charger works great but did not come with a compatible cord for an 11 pro. Works well with lightning cord for iPhone
5,Stylish. Great quality. Charge the phones fast.  Great size. You won't regret it.  I definitely buying it again.
5,Works great length of cable is enough to reach from almost floor level of car to my dash where the phone holder is.
5,Love that it is flush with the dash and non obtrusive to the look of the dash.
1,Ordered two of these in the product description under compatible devices it clearly states I phone 11 when I called Amazon to start return I informed them that description was wrong they said they would update it. Hopefully they will update item description so no one else orders thinking it will work for a I phone 11.
5,Excelente cargador muy buen material y pequeño lo que lo hace muy conveniente para que no sobresalga demasiado del conector.
5,Does not sit as flush with outlet as expected but no obtrusive.
5,Charger was so good my husband took it for himself! Lol great and charges super fast!
2,Bought for my wife to keep in her car.  Two weeks later does not work at all.
5,This charger is the fastest car charger I have ever used! Highly recommend!!
5,Works like advertised.  Fast charging for my car which is exactly what I wanted.  Had an app running screen on during my ride in to work (20 min) and my phone still gained power.  Perfect.
5,Well made very heavy and solid.
1,Plugged into my car to power my charger-mount.  The mount worked fine and was powered but would not charge my phone.  When I plugged the cable directly into an in-dash USB everything worked great.  Sorry going to have to get my money back on this one.
5,I like the snug fit. My previous charger came loose without me noticing.
5,Very nice charger. No problems so far. Charges my phone fast!
5,Really simple design and fast charging
4,I don't charge much in the car but this fast charges S20+ when I need it. Seems to be good quality.
5,Works great but does not sit flush. I was hoping to find a plug that I could retain the stock cover for the port. I haven't found one that would fit that flush anywhere else either so maybe nobody makes such a creature.
5,Great product and works great
5,We all love the 90 degree end on the cord.  It helps prevent breakage and is more comfortable for holding in your hand when using during charging.  Fast charging also.
3,The charger works fine but the charging cord does NOT fit iPhone as indicated in description.
5,Then this is the charger you want to get. It charges faster than the "fast" charger I got from Verizon (which is pretty fast...) and it has a smaller footprint meaning it fits much better where I have it. An excellent value!
5,Works as intended
5,I really liked how substantial this is! Great heavy cord seems like it will last way longer than the old plastic kinds. I think it is a nice color. I bought two for each car!
5,Solid connection to cig lighter charges phone fast when in car. We love it
1,This item looked sturdy but didn't work at all.  The cable seemed to work but the mechanism seemed to be the problem.  Returned it right away.
5,This charger is truly as what it says. It charges my phone fast and I love it. Recommended for people to buy. Awesome!!!
5,Great quality charge really fast
5,I should have been brought this Car Charger. It's compact and fast charges. Doesn't get warm or hot either. Yes I'll buy it again.
5,Excelente producto!!
5,Really good charger compact nice design and works well.
5,it looks premium it has a weight to it that feel solid on your hand plus it come with charging cable alsoI would recommend to anyone who is interesting and buying one for there smartphone
3,Felt like a high quality product in my hand did not work with my apple products returned.
5,charges phone pretty quick
5,Works great. Stays in the port and charges my phone quickly.
5,Excellent adapter just get a fast charge cable too. Charges my wifes v40 fast doesnt get hot. Very happy with this charger excellent value and build.
5,Fits tight. Small. Dim light doesn't impede night driving. High amperage x 2.
5,Really well made low-profile powerpoint charger. Has twin QC3.0 chargers (that provide "turbocharging" for my motorola phone). The build quality is exceptional--just feels solid and well built!
3,Misleading when it states it works for an iPhone 11. The charger itself does but the cable that comes with it does not.
5,Perfect for converting the classic “plug” to a modern power house to keep your phone or table or any USB device Happy.
5,Fast charging high quality product. The cord feels heavy duty and I expect it to last. Very satisfied customer.
5,Charges as advertised and quality material. Not quite flush though but I like it.
5,High quality materials. Fast charging too even for Motorola.
5,awesome better than i thought
5,Only have used it once. Seems heavy duty well made and charged. Just what i needed.
5,Great fast charger. Best one I've ever used
1,The picture shows 36W at both ports but its not even 12W on a single port. The amperage varies too much ready to burn your phone's battery.
5,It does charge quickly!
5,solid build.
2,The charger itself supports fast charge but the cable that came with it does not. Buy the charger separately and then also buy a different cable that actually supports fast charging. 2 stars just for the charger
2,Good quality. Doesn’t fit into any of my apple products sadly!
5,its made of metal and compact and charges like a rapid charger should
5,good price and rapid delivery
5,works great but it stays on when plugged
5,works as described
5,Nice compact size with good power
5,Need extra usb charger
5,Works good
5,Trabaja perfectamente
2,Little disappointed.  I have to kerp playing with it to get it to charge.  I have to hold the charger down and reinforce (press down) on cord every time to charge my phone.  Once it charges it works
2,This thing charges slower than my 2.0. Waste of money.
1,Original order I got a red not flush fit charger without a cable so I returned for replacement.  The replacement was still the wrong item.  Got the same red charger as the replacement.  Still wanted the other so ordered a third and STILL received a red not flush charger without a cable.  Three deliveries all the the wrong item.  I noticed that the boxes had labels for the red item as well as the listed item so I don't know what's going on.
2,Does not supply the wattage it states.
2,The cable itself malfunctioned shortly after purchasing the product.
5,The charger is a heavier made charger. And the cord is a thick good quality.
5,Super fast charging!
1,Great at first but stopped working in less than 2 months….
1,This charger stated that it fit an iPhone 11 and it did not fit it.
1,This does not fit into an iPhone 11 like it says it would
1,The cable was not compatible with an Iphone as the ad stated.
1,Dislike it did not work in my car
1,El producto no llegó completo ni el.color que yo quería
5,Must have. You wont regret it.#samsungnote10plus
5,Charger works good charges fast. The cord and charger both seem to be made of good materials. The charger is solid and has some weight to it. This is the second one I have purchased 1 for my personal vehicle and 1 for my work vehicle. If I get any more vehicles I will be purchasing more of them.
4,Son buenos pero ay mejores precios en el mercado
5,I like this charger. It is fast and very small. I'm surprised at how fast it charges!  I highly recommend!
5,Small bullet style. Works well fast charges my phone
5,Happy with time on charging!
5,Use it in my work truck to keep my power hungry iPad Pro ready to goWorks wonderfully
5,Perfect!!!
5,Poder de carga
5,Charges quick. Very pleased
5,Compact perfect size
5,The charger works very well and very fast.
5,Perfect it doesn't stick out like others I've had. Works fast great product.
5,My fiancee kept complaining that my car charger sucked. So I got this product and it's awesome. Im so glad I got it my old charger definitely sucked. This new charger gets my phone charged fast.
5,Update . I have brought 2 of these they worked so well .Customer service is awesome.It's very heavy duty.  Nice and compact.  Light inside is in no way ignoring.  Charges faster than any charger I have had aftermarket or from Verizon.  Using the C cord and lightning cord.
5,Heavy metal  low profile nice LED lights fast charging
5,We have bought 5 of these chargers over the past couple years and have had only one issue with them. You need to make sure you have one for each car. If you don't it will get taken out and put in whatever family member that didn't have one in their car. That's why we have 5. They charge really fast and once you get used to it regular chargers feel like dial up or 3G for our younger viewers. They are heavy and feel substantial. We have no problems with one or both ports not working which is common on lesser chargers. I also like that they are low profile they don't stick out of the lighter.
5,perfect charger!!!! for the quality i give 6 stars!!!!!!!
5,Purchased 2 of these so the kids could charge at the same time. Charges fast and I like how they are flush with the outlet so it doesn't get damaged when the cords are unplugged
5,I liked this product very much
5,Charge's my phone in no time! Make sure you have a good cord to use with it also!
1,i needed one that sits flush or at least really close but this one isnt even close it sticks out over an inch maybe even 2 so if you need a flush one dont get this one
5,Fast charge
5,Got tired of my GM usb plugs would only keep my Samsung S20 at the percent of charge from when I plug it in to the time I finish a road trip. Needing the extra power to at least charge my phone. Small and compact. Lights are not obtrusive.
5,Amazing!! Compact powerful and love the extra cable!!
5,Very well made no complaints here.
5,High quality.  The charging cord is very heavy duty and has a velcro strap.  Nice!
5,I love how small this thing is but it still feels pretty robust.  It charges fast and it came with a really nice cord as well.  Glad I bought it.It charges quickly.
5,Use it in the car with waze. Keeps my phone charged at 100%
5,The best out there. Heavy duty.
5,I bought two of these for our two cars. With the proper cables our phones quick charge as if they are plugged into our home "quick chargers".
5,Works as expected.
5,I got tired of plugging my phone into the charger that have it charge 3% so I bought one for my wife an one for me.  They charge super fast as long as you have the high-speed cables.
5,- Good connection.- Fast charging speed.- Low profile.
5,Like the aluminum construction. The fast charging is nice. Came with I charging cord also.
5,Time will tell
4,Charged phone well. Quickly. But fits very tightly in 12v car outlet
5,Another review in 1-2 weeks
