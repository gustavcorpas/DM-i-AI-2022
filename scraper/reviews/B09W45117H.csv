5,We purchased this projector screen to put outside near our pool for a movie night pool party. It was easy to assemble and I  was able to set it up by myself in 5 minutes. Since we are using it outdoors it‚Äôs also easy to take apart to store inside while not in use. The picture was great on it nice and clear. We‚Äôve since used it multiple times since we had such a great time the first night and will continue to use it indoors now that the pool season is wrapping up.
5,I like the fact that it has a semi-waterproof black bag to put the stand and screen in. (We have a big storage box on our back patio) That way i dont have to worry about water damage ir staining. Set up was super east as well! Im still waiting to test the projector we bought for the screen but the screen itself is great!
5,This was easy to put together and take down! Love the carrying bag too. We used this at the campground in the middle of the playground and the kids enjoyed watching it from the front and back! üòÜ The picture was clear and a great size. A fun good purchase.
5,I like it easy to set up light weight makes movies look good big enough to feel special but not so challenging to load and unload. Another thing I like is that we can easily fully assemble it and put it in the garage if we don't want to use it.
5,This is a surprisingly simple screen to use. Just set up the tripod place the screen on it then pull up and down to open the screen. The screen was large enough and the video was clear enough for my whole family who was watching it. Great quality screen.
5,Perfect for my family movie night or watching a late night boxing match out in the yard. I never used a screen when using my projector and WOW! does it make a difference. Perfect size easy to setup  and is rinkle free if you stretch the corners good. Love the carrying bag makes for easy storage. 100% recommend.
5,This movie screen is seriously awesome!!!  The movies look fantastic on this screen when we watch outdoor movies!!!  It has a heavy duty sturdy aluminum frame and legs that you can snap together in less than 5 minutes flat!  And with absolutely no tools or screws at all!!!  The screen is also super lightweight so it is very easy to transport or travel with if you need to take it to a park or family event.  We love doing outdoor movies for family parties!  Other movie screens we have had in the past we‚Äôre either way too flimsy or needed a bunch of hardware or tools to hook them to a wall‚Ä¶ Etc. Another awesome thing about this product is the foldable frame and legs . You can easily move it to anywhere you want‚Ä¶indoor or outdoor!!!  It also comes with a nice carrying case with handles for transport!  That is a definite bonus!  Also the picture quality is fairly close to what you see in the movie theater!  We have used this portable movie screen in our backyard and have also taken it to a park for a family event! We love it so much and know it will last for a long time! It is well-made and durable!!!  If you are looking for a movie screen for indoor or outdoor this is definitely the best one for you!  GREAT PRODUCT!!!!
5,It's a great portable projector stand. Excellent size to carry and easy to place it in anywhere. I used it for my work to make training classes indoor and outdoor. It's really  wrinkle free this is a great option. The colors quality is amazing. very stable even in outdoor. the design is models and simple.  I'm very happy to have it in everywhere.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†This HD projector screen really aids in showing movies clear and crisp outdoors.  We use these when all the kids are over usually in the evenings to keep them entertained yet still outdoors.  I was most impressed to see the screen delivered free of stains and any kinds if inconsistencies. The entire set up with all the rods and clamps went along like clock work once I got going. I set it up earlier in the day to stretch out any wrinkles or lines it may have had from packaging but it really wasn't that bad as far as that goes. The overall size allowed for quite a big display for all the kids and even adults to see. Plan on doing a horror movie marathon up at our camp with this later in the summer !
5,Great projector works well for my loft small cinema!Its easy to set up and it works well for the projector
4,Edit.  I had an issue with the screen originally sent.  The seller was quick to respond and rectify the issue.
5,Works great
5,We used to project onto the side of my shed but it sucked this made our last movie night perfect and I am super happy I got it! Can't wait to use it for the next (and it's portable so we can take ot to a friend's house too!)
5,Ever want a movie theater at home? This projector screen is the answer! Simply amazing! Installation was quick and the quality is great!
5,muy buen producto
3,We bought a projector off Amazon a year or so ago and have been using a sheet hanging against our garage when we watch outdoor movies‚Ä¶. We decided it was finally time to purchase an actual projector screen because we were annoyed with the wrinkles of the hanging sheet. My kids watched the new Sonic movie outside tonight and this worked well! Installation/set up was easy (fyi- the instruction sheet is folded up in the white projector mat. We had a hard time finding it at first).I‚Äôm only giving it three stars though because stability is a problem. I‚Äôm currently updating this review after having used it several times because the tripod stand falls over with just a little wind. I‚Äôm including a few photos just to provide a closer look at what to expect hope that helps!
5,It is working for my backyard. I will use it for camping.
5,Appropriate for those who travel
5,Nice screen!  The tripod it comes with is really nice and works well too.I like how easy it is to setup.  Seems very straight forward.The screen is light too!  So easy to transport and carry.  Makes life really easy
5,The projector screen fits in a small carry case. The setup time takes longer than the roll in projectors but is good for the value.
3,The screen is just ok. There are no anchors or any way to hold the corners tight on the screen. This has the effect of giving the screen a wavy look when use if for movies or presentations. Screen where tight looks good but find a better option. Watch the video and you‚Äôll see there are no ways to lock the screen corners.
5,This is an excellent portable screen to have. I needed something light weight that would collapse into something small and easy to store. It is exactly what i needed. Great size screen a bit tricky setup at first but after the first time you go "OHHH" and you understand. It is not complicated. Screen is durable and easy to clean.
5,Works well for our projector my kids love it.
2,This is not a very stable unit.  It's a balancing act.
1,I didn't read the description ordered it for my school wasn't happy with it but my return time-frame had elapsed.  Wrote a negative review got a response and they refunded the money right away.  Top notch company with their customer service!
5,I love it
1,At first I used it with love but over time I realized that the quality of the product was very bad.
1,The quality is very poor. I was very disappointed when I used for my daughter‚Äôs bday.
1,A rubbish product should be embarrassing to sell something that is of such poor quality and also arrived 2 weeks late
4,Easy to set up with the sticky hooks. Good size and pic quality. Recommend it for the price.
5,This review is for the Towond 4K 16:9 HD Foldable Anti-Crease Portable Outdoor Projector Screens.  We enjoy showing outdoor movies for the family and neighbors and already use a big blow-up projector screen.  However sometimes setting up the blow-up screen is overkill or just not convenient for the situation so I decided to give this particular portable screen a try.First of all the size is nice and large with a great 16:9 ratio dimension.  It has binding all around the edges for durability with metal grommets that are used to hang the screen along with ‚Äústicky‚Äù hooks.  These hooks don‚Äôt use easy-release adhesive so be careful where you place them.  You can use the hooks or nails if you prefer.  There are also 2 long pieces of rope that can be used as well.  What I found that works best is to hang the top part fairly tight using whatever method you prefer and then us the 2 included ropes on the bottom corners to tighten the screen with either weights or yard stakes to get as flat a screen as possible.From a projection perspective the front projection onto the screen works really well.  The bright white fabric does a great job reflecting a sharp and vivid image from a projector.  While you can also project from the back I don‚Äôt think the image is as sharp and clear because the fabric is going to mute and distort the light just a bit when it passes through the fabric and not be quite as sharp as a front projected image.  This will be true of any portable screen like this one.For us it works great hanging on the side of the house or in front of garage doors for projecting a movie.  It is highly portable light-weight and doesn‚Äôt take up much room at all when stored.  I really like this screen as an alternative to our blow-up screen and definitely would order it again.
5,I got this for outdoor movies.  I went down to Home Depot and bought some PVC pipe to build me a frame for the screen.  Took a couple measurements and glued it all together.  With in 30 minutes I was able to set up a big screen to watch the big football game.  I invited most of my friends and family to come and each of them commented how great it was to watch on such a big screen.  The material that they use to make it does come wrinkled.  But I put an iron to it and now it is perfect.
5,Pretty nice screen for outdoor movie nights.  Picture on it was pretty clear.  Seems sturdy and well made.
5,This is a perfect jumbo sized screen.  It's nice and light weight and it's perfectly white from edge to edge.The rivets are all locked onto the bezel well and they're great for distributing tension without damaging the material.The hooks are just okay.  They're made well but the adhesive falls off of the hook.  I used some stronger mounting tape on the same hooks and that worked much better.It provides a nice flat and sharp image.Overall a great screen.Highly recommended.
3,This is an OK screen but the "wrinkle free" claim is a bit misleading.  When we unpackaged it it was quite wrinkled as expected after shipping.  So I carefully steamed it got the wrinkles out and we're good to go.  When we hung it (as instructed) completely taut it still had some imperfections.  Not wrinkles from uneven hanging but wrinkles in the fabric itself.  It wasn't as bright white as some of the others we've used so the images didn't really pop as much.  Overall it's OK but not great.
5,Arrived on time the frame is better quality  than expected pretty simple assembly the screen is made of cloth i expected plastic so that was great its not 100% wrinkle free its about 90% over all im happy with my purchase definitely work the money it alsome comes with a travel bag
5,I bought a projector from amazon about a year ago and i was just using a big white wall i my living room to play movies but it didn‚Äôt quite work well and the quality would come out a little faded. I did‚Äôt realize that a projector screen really helps make the picture quality crisp! Now that its FOOTBALL season i decided to buy this projector screen and the difference is night and day Literally! Now all my friends want to come over to watch the games on sundays because we get high definition games on this huge screen! Great tip: you can use this screen in your driveway with a projector and create a home made drive in movie theatre!!! My kids LOVE it. The screen itself is VERY easy to put together in fact my kids are able to do it. The quality is GREAT and assembling and taking apart to store is very quick and easy. it even comes with a storage bag so that you dont have loose parts to store and prevents losing pieces! This stand is a slam dunk perfect purchase after buying a projector.
5,What I love about this screen is unlike my foldable one I never have to worry about creases in the middle of watching whatever we have on our projector. This whole thing is a lot lighter than what I thought it was going to be and is really easy to store and take with us on trips. We recently had a family reunion out of town and we were able to set this up to watch a picture slide show and some old home movies on this. Not only were we able to take it without it taking up too much space but setting it up was a lot easier than we thought. When it came to taking it down. We just rolled the screen back up and folded the stand up. Really great for watching movies and the screen is a bright white so the colors really do stand out better than we thought.
5,Good Quality of Screen.Stand is really easy to install and uninstall.
5,I bought another projector screen before. It was bad quality. And then I bought this one. I was worried about the quality. But I‚Äôm glad I bought this screen. Everything in the package is good quality. It is not too heavy. it comes with a carrying bag so your able to easily carry it anywhere with you. Perfect for family movies or movie parties. This projector screen is portable and easy to set up. My family love BBQ now after sun downwe can watch the movies in my backyardand enjoy the BBQ. I love this 100 inch screen.
5,Very nice portable movie screen. Nice quality to watch a movie and  easy to put together.
5,I honestly thought that this would come in the same size as those projectors that your teacher would pull down from the top of the blackboard when it‚Äôs movie time on a rainy day but no.  It fit in a small package the size of violin case.  The texture of the screen prevented any glare.  My buddy RB tested it at my house with a video he made that was recorded by an older man who paid him to star in it.  It was remarkably clear but very disturbing.  But there‚Äôs nothing a good therapist can‚Äôt fix.
5,I put this projector screen in my daughter's bedroom.  My daughter likes the screen so big and so clear.  Now she can watch movies in her own bedroom and feels like in movie theater.
5,Good quality projector screen I was really impressed with this I wasn't sure what to expect as we hadn't used a proper screen before but it was great. It does have some creases from being folded in the package but once opened and hung they become less noticeable especially once it has been hung for a while. I'm sure you could iron them out with a low flame if needed although I personally don't think it's necessary! The great thing is that it is a great product. The big plus for me is that it is portable and can be used both indoors and outdoors so in the summer we can have barbecues watch movies and have drinks outside.Overall I am very happy with it it displays the projector image well and it is a good value for the current price.
5,I bought a projector and a curtain on Amazon and built a small cinema at home. I haven't been to the cinema for a long time due to the reason  of covid 19. The curtain is very easy to assemble.It's very big almost as big as a wall. The font of the manual is very small but fortunately it can be assembled  without reading the manual. Stability is sufficient for the case that there is no wind in the room.
5,Easy to assemble! The stand is steady and upholds the projector nicely. With the stand I can just assemble it anywhere and move it around‚Ä¶ Projector screen is a good size we using it watch movies outside. A great product.
5,I want to take a star but I don't think that'd be fair. For the price it's about what you'd expect. The hollow tubes remind me of those cheap guitar stands you get from any music store. The instructions were not very easy to follow or even read. Once I figured it all out I don't think I'll have any trouble going forward. I would absolutely spend a couple more bucks next time on something a little more durable and easy to use but considering this is the first time I've bought one I can't complain. I got what I paid for.
5,Great way for me and my family to enjoy time together watching a movie in the backyard. amazed!! Quality is what you get!! Love it clean and clear for projector
5,The screen is perfect for my home theater. We have watched several movies on it already. It was super easy to setup and smooth operation good quality. We highly recommend the projector screen.
5,Since i bought the projector i always project onto the wall resulting in poor clarity. Then i found this fantastic screen! It has a big fiber screen and all parts are easy to set up. For me this kind of screen is much better than monitor or display screen. It's cheap durable and big enough for movie. Now there is a movie theater in my house. Cool!
5,The package is arrived without any damage. It is easy to assemble and worth the money. We can start to enjoy the movie night anywhere now.
5,It's really a piece of cloth soft easy to hold and carry. The matching adhesive hook hook holds it firmly to the wall. It was a little thin so fixing it to the wall I think was the best decision.
5,I love this screen very much. This screen came with in a well packed box. The screen was folded inside the box but it is completely wrinkle free when I opened it. It is light weighted and come with a canvas carry bag that makes it very easy to store and transport. It is very easy to put together and take apart. I can do it by myself alone. No other tools are needed. The screen made from high quality material. The picture quality is great. It is also very stable outdoor with the tripod stand that came with it. We had a movie night with friends in our backyard with my new screen. All my friends were amazed by the picture quality and they loved the screen. And plus the price is great and affordable! The other feature is that the screen is washable. I haven‚Äôt done so but will try to wash it if it gets dirty. I am very satisfied with this screen so far and would definitely recommend if you need one.
5,I bought this for my new projector easy to setup and easy to take down appreciate this screen also comes with storage bag where everything all fits in the bag. After using the screen the quality of the image has been improved significantly when I watch TV used my new projector recommend for purchase worth the money.
5,One of our friend suggested us to buy this screen and we really liked it. The projector screen size is good and the picture refelction is quite amazing. We had a great movie night with friends.It is so easy to set it up no screws at all. The tripod is very stable and it requires a very less space for storage.We are also planning to use it for our upcoming camping trip for the long weekend and really excited for the same as it can be easily ported.One small issue that I see is screen gets little flaky outdoors when there is wind but one can tighten it with the help of safety pins.Overall good product in this price range.
5,It‚Äôs easy to assemble! And most importantly it‚Äôs super big but very light in weight. So I can move it to anywhere I‚Äôd like! All I need to do is to adjust the projector and there we go enjoy the home theater!
4,It has a large screen. Too many parts to have to put together.
3,This didn't make the projection movie clear a little disappointed.
5,Great size projector. My husband and I have been looking for a projector to use for an outdoor movie theater and this one is great! The size is great the quality of the screen and the tripod are also great and the price is super affordable.
5,Ive purchased other projector screens but usually they wrinkle up and the stands are so flimsy that a bit aof wind during a backyard movie session the screen will topple over. we had quite some winds yesterday but finished the first two harry potter movies with out any hicccups and good screening quality!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†It‚Äôs a great product for a good price nice quality light weight big enough easy to assembly
5,The screen is larger than I though which is a good thing. You might need some clamps to get the best result overall I am happy with this screen. The stand is a plus allows me to start projecting literally any where vs nail the screen on the wall.
5,We bought this so we can have movie nights outside for the summer and so far so good 3 movies in and we couldn't be happier! Definitely recommend easy to set up easy to use easy to put away great purchase all the way around! We'll worth the price we paid compared to others if you're thinking about it you should do it!
5,I used it several times already both outdoor and indoor. Very cheap but super valuable! Easy to assemble where I can install it fully by myself. Light weight but durable at the same time. Love this product!
5,I bought the screen for my kids. They are so excited when I put a video/ movie using the new screen. The projection screen is sturdy and the screen is awesome. Stands up well it makes a great picture (no weird shadows or anything) Great quality screen. Works perfectly. I would recommend this to my friend.
5,The material is thick. You barely can see through it. I bought it for my son so he doesn't need to watch on the TV. so far so good.
