5,Works as advertised. Easy to install. High priced but printer owners are at the mercy of Canon. Switching to aftermarket cartridges from hereon-in. .
5,I had a problem with my printer head getting clogged when i tried other off-brand so-called compatible inks so i buy nothing but canon manufacturer ink from now on.  This is the real deal. I always buy the XL (extra large) tanks for better value and you don't have to change the cartridges as often.
5,Less expensive than the manufacturer‚Äôs price.
3,This cartridge arrived in a padded mailer.  It was wrapped in a Canon seal but was not in the original Canon box.  I put it in the printer and the printer recognized it as a Canon cartridge.  I'm a little concerned about this situation but will try to print something to see if it actually works.
5,It‚Äôs one of the Canon prescribed cartridges for my printer. Works fine!
5,If you have a Canon TS9000 Series Scanner/Photo printer combo then this is the exact black ink cartridge you need. One important thing to note is be careful handling it during installation because it does leak a bit. This is inherent of ink cartridge and not a defect. You're going to get ink on our fingers or worse drip a few on the floor or carpet. I use the printer for photography samples so I'm picky on ink cartridges and only use genuine Canon ink. The color of the images it produces are very accurate.
5,I have a canon printer and I like using genuine cannon tanks so that it is exactly what the manufacturer made the machine for
5,Canon brand inks are great - but expensive. Considering aftermarket ink to save money.
5,I only use Canon ink.  It is more expensive than the off-brands but it is worth it.
5,easy to order and eat to install
5,Fast shipping. Product as described
5,I do wonder sometimes why these printer companies don't just make an "everything pack" that includes ALL the ink a particular printer model might need instead of putting three colors in one box and one black in another and a special black in its own box.  But‚Ä¶ that's life with capitalism.  The XL ink tanks are a good way to avoid buying ink too often.  Even with my light printing duties I found myself going through black and certain color inks quickly.  And since it's OEM ink there is no issue with it being rejected by the printer or having bad print quality.
5,I have 6 pairs of different kinds of ear buds and these are by far the best ones! And the bonus is they don't break the bank.
5,I went through two Canon printers in four years when I was using substitute ink cartridges.  I decided to go back to using Canon OEM ink cartridges and I have been using the same printer for four years now (the other two only lasted a couple of years).  I am convinced that using OEM ink is well worth the added price.  I found I didn't save any money when I had to replace my printer every couple of years.
5,just what i ordered.
5,I have a Canon MG7720 printer with 6-cartridges .  It uses CLI-271 for black and colors and a PGI-270.I buy on Amazon.com because I get better prices than a store.
3,Downgraded this purchase as one of the color tanks leaked when opened. The ink actually shot out and onto our carpet. We were able to get the ink out with minimal effort so not a disaster but I expect better from genuine canon products. Otherwise the ink performs as expected.
5,I used to buy Canon ink for our Canon printers wherever I found the best price. But it varied so wildly - when you could actually find the ink. So once I found it on Amazon it's the only place I look. Free shipping helps.
5,I don't use refilled ink tanks in my printers. Those may work fine but this is the genuine article from Canon and I feel better using their own products.
5,I've tried a bunch of the aftermarket inks and they work pretty good most of them.  But not the pigment ink.  So I just eat the price and buy the good stuff for the pigment ink cartridge.  My Canon printer is happy again!  The five other cartridges are aftermarket non-pigment inks.  They do work just fine.
5,This is a really nice ink.While this is our first Canon printer (used to be a loyal HP fan but since they are not loyal to me and no longer care about the quality of their products I have moved on) I can definitely say we get much crisper prints from the Canon.The pigment ink is the main one used for documents.However it also adds a really nice sharpness to photographs as well.All thumbs up!
5,Great product does what it is supposed to do. I have no cons about the product. I only use this in my Canon printer

5,Product is as advertised.I stick to name brands even though you can find similar off brand or do it yourself ink wells. I have a canon printer and this product comes from Canon and works like it should true black color and easy installation for my printer.  ...JS

4,Standard replacement cartridge for Canon MG 5720 printer.  This seems to be a decent value over the big box stores.

2,This ink shouldn't be this expensive. It's obviously great ink but the high price has forced me to do refills at Costco.
5,Good value!
5,Great
5,Good value
1,PRODUCT IS OK BUT AMAZON DRIVER RATHER THAN DRIVE LIKE A NORMAL PERSON LEFT A 6 INCH DEEP TIRETRACK 20 FEET LONG IN OUR YARD BECAUSE HE DID NOT HAVE THE SENSE TO USE THE DRIVE WAY.  LAZY!!!!!
1,See photos! This is how it arrived! The port cover was hot melt glued to the end of the cartridge and the cartridge was empty.
5,Great
1,My printer would not read these inks. I was replacing identical ink cartridges and this set just would not work properly. Will have to reorder and see if the next set works
1,I cannot find the REQUEST NEW RETURN option anywhere in My Orders Page.  Couldn't return it within 14 days due to LOCK DOWN and now I would like to return it.  I would like to regenerate a Return.
3,Works fine.
3,it was the right one for my printer
1,Leaks before I got it
1,Dislike:  -ink is not genuine (according to Printer)  -the black ink just printed grey all the time....
1,The plastic packaging around the cartridge was compromised meaning that when I opened it ink spilled everywhere covered my hands and damaged my carpet. Ink is expensive enough as it is nevermind half of it ending up on the floor.
1,Fake ink!!!
1,I paid 25 dollars for a XL cartridge to get a regular one. I didn‚Äôt realize it until I had opened it and pulled out the old one. üôÑüôÑ
1,My printer indicated that this was either counterfeit or reusedI am very disappointedI am using it because it is better than nothing and I needed something.Not worth the cost
1,They are not XL they are simply the same cartridge filled with ink!  Basically the cartridges that are not XL are only partially filled.  Wow great marketing strategy.
1,Not new ink. Opened box. Ink orange tabs already removed.
4,Ordered wrong no. needed 171 not 27  USMC
1,Wrong product listed so it doesn't work in our printer.
5,I needed a replacement cartridge  the price was competitive though ink cartridges just cost too much.  I haven't used it you though since it is an OEM product I expect it will work perfectly.
5,FIT PERTVECT LASTED LONG
5,I have a Canon printer that was a replacement for a better printer but Canon would fix it and gave me a good price on the TS 6020.  So I had no choice. It is a good printer but if you print many documents as I do you will run through the 270XL black frequently it is the most important tank to have "on hand" because you can always print in black!!
5,I use this for my personal printing. A bit pricey but the only alternative would be refillers. Not sure whether to trust their product.
5,Perfect
5,very happy and satisfied
2,After purchasing this product I found that the cartridge leaked all over my hands after opening the plastic wrap. The ink had pooled at the bottom and  leaked. What a mess. After cleaning up the mess as best as I could I was able to put this in my printer. I am very disappointed with this purchase.I don't know if this product should be stored differently by the seller but this is unacceptable.
5,The ink tanks are easy to install and give good results but they are a bit on the pricey side.  Getting High yield ink tanks helps as does the ability to buy then separately.  In stores they often come in multi-tank bundles.
5,Good Quality ink. Worked perfectly in my printer.
5,fair price easy install no complaints
5,Great product! Why pay more when you can get these which are just as good as the brand name cartridge?!
5,Perfect just as described! Thank you
5,Parfait! Arrive en 3 jours!
5,I use this ink tank for my Canon printer.
5,merci la coche !!
5,Reliable Canon quality.
5,Tr√®s bien

5,Works well
5,I was happy that this appropriate sized ink cartridge was sent directly to my home and I could use it right away in my printer.
5,Wonderful cartridges as advertised!
