5,I always use this brand. Good product.
5,Great value great quality.
5,Being Iâ€™m a teacher I laminate a lot. I didnâ€™t have any problems with the quality of this product!
5,Great product and value.
5,Love laminating my most used recipes. Just wipe off after use. Also very good for preschool writing practice. Use washable markers and they can reuse over and over again.
5,This compact easy-to-use laminator is great for our small-office use. We use it to laminate notices for posting our health insurance/Rx cards (which surprisingly are still printed on card stock) and yes a few personal projects (bookmarks key tags etc.). Great that it has an auto-off feature too because we "lost" a previous one (also a Fellowes model) that someone left on over a long weekend which damaged it beyond repair. We've had it for just one month so can't speak to durability but until the long-weekend disaster with our previous laminator we'd used it successfully for at least 5 years so I anticipate that this will also be durable.
4,Wrinkles in my new laminator. gave it away and my friend says it works fin ein hers. So my machine is the issue - not the pouches.
5,I have been laminating papers with this for years and it has never failed me. Always comes out smooth and strong and waterproof. Great for signs that could get wet. Very clear and even seems to enhance whatever is laminated. everything lasts much longer and can be cleaned if something gets on it.
4,At first I felt that the sheets were a little too flimsy to use. I did not have a good experience with it at all. But then I used them on other sheets of paper and it came out fine. The conclusion was my error on my end.The price was not bad either for the number of sheets that I received.
3,The roller isn't great...if you don't closely monitor your item as it's going through it is likely to curl or bunch as it's coming out.
5,this was cheaper than most other sources works as well as could be expected
4,bought extras to have on hand
5,The pouches worked great and I was impressed at the color quality coming through.  No fogginess!
5,I have a laminator & I laminate many documents that I want to keep safe & waterproof. This product is perfect for me because (1) Wal-Mart never has any in stock (2) I get more sheets in this package than what is sold at Wal-Mart & (3) a lower price for the amount of sheets I get in this package vs Wal-Mart's product.
5,Love these laminating pouches. Will buy again. They work well with my thermal laminator. They are also great for my pre k classroom. When my students write on them they clean off easily.
4,This is absolutely my favorite thing I own right now! I have used it to make bookmarks magnets and a dry erase thing for my sister's refrigerator.
5,I love these sheets I run a daycare. I have to post a lot of things daily. It makes it so easy to handle and mount up every week. Things last forever. The price is excellent!! The machine is easy to use. Great investment for my businessðŸ’–
5,Love love love!!! ðŸ’— As a teacher and a mom I live these because I laminate EVERYTHING! These are so easy to use and great value for the money! These are so durable there arent any items I have had to re-laminate. I buy this back sooooo often probably every two months!
2,I decided to purchase this over my usual Amazon Basics laminating pouches for the price. I had received one of these as a gift from the same seller and decided to purchase it again before using it. I am glad I canceled this order before receiving it.When trying the ones I received as a gift I was highly disappointed and frustrated as I used them. I am glad I used up all 100 of them in a day.Pros-The price for the quantity.-You can cut them and the pouch doesnâ€™t open:fall apart.-you can use it with card stock  and paper. (One at a time or two sheets of paper at the same time)Cons-you cannot has cardstock and paper together in one pouch.-There is no way this is 3ml it is very flimsy.-6 of 100 sheets curled up inside the laminator (amazon basics one) and ruined my paper.- The sheets that did survive and were laminating appear to have wrinkles on them. I hope you can see it in the pictures.- there is so much static when opening the sheets. You canâ€™t just easily stick the paper in there and hope itâ€™s aligned perfectly.Overall if you are hoping this look presentable donâ€™t use it. Teachers: just use the Amazon basics one.
3,I thought these would be like my 3M sheets and they are not even close. Super flimsy and paperMoves all around while trying to laminate.
5,They laminated my newspaper fine.  3ml is thin though and end product is not stiff as I am used to.
5,Since covid having hands on activities in the classroom has been less and less. I have learned that laminated things can easily be sanitized and I love that my kiddos are able to have more hands on activities while staying safe!These are great quality and work so well!
5,Really like it and wasn't bad quality
5,easy to use and durable
5,Great!!!
5,Works well for light to medium duty use. We don't use the built -in cutter. Does hot and cold lamination.
5,These sheets have been great! I have been able to cut my projects after laminating them and they hold up just fine. I also just had an incident where my sheet got caught on something on my desk causing the sheet to get backed up in my laminator. Since the page I was laminating was only have the size of the sheet I was able to reinsert the sheet and fix the little bit of waving. Then I cut off the excess and my project was saved and doesnâ€™t even look like anything happened. Will definitely buy again and recommend.
4,Used for variety of projects
5,The laminator is ok but it jams a lot.
5,Thermal sheets are good for daily use items.  I double on them to laminate to make very used lists  more reusable.
5,Love these and the price
5,Happy
3,Corners curl up in my machine and pages sometimes are wavy
5,Wonderful product to have for saving anything you don't want ruined.
5,I don't see any difference between these and the brand name. They work great.
5,Good quality great price
5,I use this to make my study flash cards so easy heats up quick. I love it!
5,Fellowes Thermal Laminating Pouches work great and come out very smooth.
5,I Liked that it was easy to use!
5,Awesome
4,I'm using it for photos insurance cards documents and anything else that needs extra protection.
5,Great value works great  for sublimation projects
5,No curling no wrinkling. Pages and cards laminated have still have a sharp or nicely rounded edges. These hold up to use.
3,It's just ok kinda thin but gets the job done
5,These laminating sheets are low priced but of excellent quality.  My wife uses them for laminating items for her school activities.  I've very rare that it creases.
5,These are great quality I use them for homeschool. Will definitely order again.
5,To protect my receipts and projects!
5,laminates almost crystal clear great product
5,Great purchase.  These pouches feel thicker than a brand I previously purchased.  I kept checking to make sure I wasnâ€™t using 2 sheets.  I will definitely be ordering more!
5,Nice product
