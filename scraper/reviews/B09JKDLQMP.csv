4,I like this camera harness however it only faces straight ahead. I would love it if you were able to turn it to the right or left a little. That would allow you to scan a larger area that you are videoing .
4,Pretty good accessory to have if you meet the conditions of use and are ok with losing some features. The plastic quality seems the same as the Blink mini camera. It's a tight fit. Goes in ok but snuggy if you want to pull the camera out its easier once you have it mounted on glass but if you want to take it out not mounted its hard you can press out the camera with your thumbs so make sure it's where you want it.So far the sticky tape is holding quite well no signs of weakness its strong. Now why would you want to put a camera inside your window? Mounting. You don't drill holes you don't have it outside in the heat and elements and the mini costs less and makes for a good constant power on camera.You lose night vision. All you get is a B&W reflection of the camera. You're also not going to be able to hear anything on the other side and you have limited viewing angles. For me this works perfect for my window to my backyard. May get another for the front.
5,Works exactly as advertised. Super simple and easy to install. The adhesive is really strong so be sure you get it where ya want it. It does come with an extra adhesive if you mess up the first or want to move it later. I see a lot of reviews about night vision not working. For those of you who don’t read the directions or even the page that you’re buying this from it clearly states that it DOES NOT SUPPORT NIGHT VISION.  Infrared light is bounced back from the window.. this will happen with any night vision camera. If you want a night vision camera for the outside Blink sells a very effective one that you can buy through Amazon. Mine works great. This method is far cheaper if you want to clearly see what’s going outside through a window particularly at nighttime. Just remember that whatever you’re looking at needs to be lit. A porch with a porch light is plenty bright enough for example.
4,I have misplaced this item but hoping to find it and update my review.  I'm certain it will be a 5* as Blink has a much improved experience over what I've previously used.
4,It works but $13???
5,Works perfectly. Helps save money for those on a budget. Allows you to buy indoor cameras for use for outdoor surveillance. Helps prevent people stealing your camera! Doesn’t interfere with night vision if you follow the directions on how to mount it. I will be buying more in the future!
5,So far hold is great on the window. I'm pleased with the fact that the indoor mini camera can now pick up motion from outside the window and record at night without the reflections from light or indoors.
5,Product is excellent. Night vision is very good. Although at night the light from the Blink camera is reflecting on the window glass and making the video so blurry. I dont know if the Teccle window mount has anything to do with the reflection or just the camera light.
5,Super sticky. I tried different spots on the window for a better view and accidentally stuck it in the wrong spot now I can’t remove it. But on the upside it sticks.
4,I found it works best with night vision turned off (assuming there is another light source) IR intensity set on low and the status LED turned off. Im using it to monitor my car in an apartment complex parking lot so there are many street lamps to keep the area well lit. If you have no outside lights this may not work well for you as there is a huge glare with the night vision on and you can’t see anything. Overall I think it works pretty good for the price!
5,This nifty Blink camera holder is terrific. I mounted it on a window to cover a blind spot on my front walkway that my security cameras don’t cover. It really sticks so be sure you’ve got it where you want it!
5,I am using this to keep an eye on my backyard when I am gone and at night. It works well enough for what it is. I get a slight glare at night with the IR light but if I keep the outside of the window clean its not terrible.
5,This is a good mount for the money. But youbcany adjust the angle to get the right view. The window must be at the right angle of viewing for you to mount it. It's not adjustable.
5,When setting up a new blink camera I was disappointed that I couldn't set it up on my windowsill to see the front porch.This completely rectified the issue! Mounts flush against the window and allows me to see the porch day or night.
5,Night vision works better than i could of imagine.
5,The mount worked great stuck to the window held the Blink camera and I am sure it would work well if the light was alway on.  The night vision didn’t work at all all I saw is a reflection of the camera.
5,Easy to mount and install the camera in it.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 First off it really works for me. I have tried all kinds cameras and I would see nothing but light at night because it truly would mirror it into its self (camera). With this you do see at night if you go into the the camera setting and turn off the night vision as showed in the picture. It is not perfect but you can see out of a window!! Genius!!! Try and be patient it really does work for me!! By the way this a after 4 am pic!!
3,This did not help with the glass feedback.  It still does not show the area we wanted to view.  It shows the reflection.
3,This sticks great on the window and holds the blink Mini well however if you need to reset the blink Mini it is a pain in the butt to try to get it out to press the reset button. They should have left an opening or a cut out so you could easily access the reset button while the blink Mini is inserted into the mount.
4,Great add on for the camera system.
3,
5,It is as advertised.
3,
3,I thought it came with the camera itself. I was kinda sad about it.
3,This item really sticks to the glass and it's really hard to remove! So make sure when installing this you're final with the placement.
3,Need for larger indoor cam
5,Does what it promises
3,I followed the instructions of turning off night vision and disabling the Status LED and used these devices to mount Blink cameras on interior glass windows. The mount itself works well and the cameras seem to work okay in the daytime. But at night (when I really need them to work) the cameras are virtually useless without light. I have a camera peering out a front door that is lit well and this somewhat works. But the cameras I have mounted on by back windows peering into the unlit backyard don't capture anything at night. They are essentially useless once the sun goes down unless I can illuminate that outdoor space. If you are using this in daytime and/or well lit exterior spaces the use of this product will likely be more satisfactory compared to my subpar experience of trying to capture dark exterior space from the inside.
3,Esta cámara grava todo hasta una mosca pasando por la cámara muchos videos Innecesarios te está mandando notificaciones cada minuto o cada segundo por lo que es enfadoso. Compre esta cámara especialmente para la noche pero sucede que deja de gravar de 12 a 8  de la mańana. Y con todo eso tienes que pagar una suscripción al mes para gravar mas videos innecesarios. La verdad no la recomiendo.
5,Just follow the basic instructions and your good to go! Turn off night vision and IR and your indoor camera can be used for the outdoors. Glad I make this purchase. If I add more cameras I will definitely get more if these.
5,Ordered for blink camera to put camera in front window was pretty easy to figure out how to install hardest part was figuring out where I wanted it in window comes with spare adhesive comes with instructions on best camera settings for window set up which was super convenient and cool. I was actually shocked on how well this helped and worked gives good picture view in recordings I tried putting a bunk camera in window without this and it did not go very well horrible glair bad reflection off glass overall not clear picture especially at night using this makes a world of difference! Very helpful crazy useful. Definitely recommend.
2,This sticks well to the window.  YOUR NIGHT VISION WILL NOT WORK WITH THIS.  The reflection from the IR or no IR does not allow you to see at night.  During the day it's fine and will detect movement but because of the glass on the window you'll not be able to make the IR/night vision on your camera to work.
5,No shadows or reflections. Very clear and works as it should. Recommend.
5,Sticks really hard to glass.  Use rubbing alcohol to clean the class prior to use.  My Blink mini fit perfectly.
5,The media could not be loaded.
5,I am able to have an outside view as clear as with an outdoor cam
5,Love that this just attaches to the window. Easy use keeps cords out of sight.
2,I really wanted to love it but I just couldn’t find a way to use it and adjust the camera to get the angle I needed. I also had problems with mounting the holder. It kept sticking to my window before I was ready for it to stick. Great ideas but it needs a little more work.
5,Fits on the inner window so close I don't get glare amd distortion
5,I’m glad I bought these with my cameras. I could see how you would get a glare off some windows without these
5,Like the title says it sticks like glue. I hope it comes off the window when I'm ready to remove it. As for function it functions very well the blink camera fits perfect.
5,Blocks the glare and a must have!
3,Works ok during the day but awful at night.  When night vision turns on you’ll get a reflection and won’t be able to see anything.
2,
5,A must have for filming through a windowWorks well day and night
1,It holds it great and in place. That’s it. Daytime is wonderful. Night time all we get is the reflection of the camera. Did not help that issue at all. Could just as well left it sitting on the window ledge and saves my money.
1,Do not buy unless you understand you need to pay a monthly subscription for pictures or video to work. I feel like it is a scam as works for 30 days then doesn’t send you pictures just notifies you of movement. The way it sounds is storage costs but camera is useless after 30 day trial.
1,Received this box today.  Opened up and just saw the cover w/o blink camera.  Return tomorrow and hope to have replacement soon.HR
1,The inside reflection is horrible. Can hardly see anything outside. Do NOT recommend!
1,From time I got haven’t been able to use it due to cameras I also bought don’t sync
1,Did not eliminate glare. Not worth the purchase.
1,At night when it records or takes pictures all you get is a bright white glare.
1,This review is for the window mount not the Blink camera. The window mount does not allow the camera to use the motion detection nor night vision so during the night I can’t see anything except the reflection. Horrible design and a waste of my money.
1,This is what you get. Can not deactivate red LED. Not as advertised.
1,Save your money. Doesn’t do anything
1,The system just would not work and could not get any support
1,Sticks to the window. Night vision still is a reflection off the window.
1,wouldn't buy again
2,Doesn’t make a difference for night vision which is why I bought it :(
1,It said there will not be a glare from the window at night. That’s a lie.
1,Item was not what I expected. Cheaply made.
1,Did not fit
1,NIGHT VISION DOES NOT WORK DO NOT BUY IT FOR NIGHT VISION PURPOSES.It's fine if you want a window mount but that adhesive is stronger than Hercules so once it sticks to you window you're breaking that window before it's coming back off.
1,The whole reason I bought this was to attach to a window and be able to use night vision. I followed the instructions and attached to window and it didn’t work. Pretty worthless
1,Only sees itself at night.
4,Fits Blink mini camera perfectly. Adhesive is extremely strong! Make sure you stick it on the window exactly where you want it. It is extremely difficult to reposition. (It does come with extra adhesive strip.) Otherwise very pleased!
1,The product eliminates glare. But traps moisture between the camera lens and glass.
2,Couldn't get Blink Mini to fit inside all the way so it can get as close as possible to the glass window. Ended up taping to windows with scotch tape & works perfectly. Too late to return so maybe I can find some other use for it.
5,The night vision sucks bought to be able to keep eye out on my Hummer at night since I live in apartment… good in the day but can’t see at night
1,Not what I anticipated.
5,Could not use had to return
2,Not good for inside with night vision looking out just has a glare other than that it's okay
5,I love it
5,Little expensive for plastic
5,Good quality
4,Yeah they're great but we've discovered that on double-pane windows at night the IR from the camera will reflect back into the camera so all you're capturing essentially is the face of the camera. Also we've diabled the recording light so it doesn't reflect off the window also. But it's a simple great product.
5,Edit June 2022… still love it and still stuck to window I edited it to ad some photos of daytime vs nighttime if you want night vision light you’d have to turn on outside patio light no big deal! And having curtains helps because if you look at the right hand corner you can see tiny reflection of my inside string lights but it doesn’t bother me :) .  Original:Normally I wouldn’t purchase products with no reviews but this thing does exactly what it’s meant to do just make sure to turn off night vision and any light the camera may have. I have it stuck into my front window because my camera doorbell had a blind spot with my wrap around patio. Got rid of all the glare!
1,All you see is the reflection from the window it s stuck to at night.
