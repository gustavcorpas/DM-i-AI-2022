4,The product arrived on time everything in tact. I just needed a laptop to do basic student functions. With the price my expectations were not very high but the quality honestly caught me off guard. Some of the reviews I read prior to purchase complained about the screen size the volume of the fan and the overall speed. The screen size doesn't bother me; I read the specs before purchase. Occasionally the fan runs loud but it is generally when I have a lot of tabs open have been using it for a while or have it sitting on my bed or lap. As for the speed I'm not using it for gaming or any kind of major technological projects. Overall it has exceeded my expectations. It does exactly what I need it to which is again basic functions for class. For clarification I am a Biomed major meaning I am using it purely for research exams homework papers music while studying accessing eBooks and leisure time. I have not tried streaming movies or using the camera aside from virtual proctoring which worked well but the general screen quality is a 5/5 especially for the price. The laptop is very light making it campus-friendly. The keyboard is one of my favorites; I adapted to it quickly and it just has a really clean feel. I do wish it had more USB 3.0 ports but again I really can't complain given the specs and the product price. The touch screen is not very sensitive... at all. That is definitely my biggest complaint. It does not always register your touch and may take several tries. Ultimately do your research know what you're buying and prioritize which features are most important. For my needs this is perfect and accomplishes everything needed.
4,Tried to download Windows 11 but it doesn’t have space which is rare because it’s brand new and I don’t have any files or apps that’s literally the bad thing about this laptop. I like the size the color and the fact that is tactile.
5,The Microsoft Surface Laptop I should have purchased a few moons ago. It is very user-friendly lightweight excellent screen quality with  seamless touch screen and the PRICE was RIGHT.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 It's quality beyond the price everything is great!!! I was so impressed when I got this. It is lightest laptop I have ever seen it's only 1.2 kg and fits into any pack bag. I could carry it wherever I want much more carryable than I thought. It's 100% PREMIUM laptop when I hold it even the plastic bottom made me feel there is no difference.Screentouch are outstanding clear and fast response. Keyboard is my favourite part feel really good when I type.  The i5 Processor is fast no lagging bugging when you do your work. Running Fast like a small beast.The  con: It is easy to get hot and battery life does not pass my standard I would recommend using the better saver mode and carry a Type-c power blank(output 2.6A 39W)The last but not least Its' put by an Amazonrenew box not an official Microsoft box.....
5,I just received this laptop last week. So far absolutely love it!! I use this laptop for anywhere from social media music & movies — to games and for my college classes. Even ran Minecraft on it (which is a heavy game) & it worked GREAT which was not expected.It is small and lightweight which is a plus. It doesn’t have a cheap look whatsoever. All in all I am super satisfied with the purchase.I have also been using to draw/paint in class when I am bored using the touchscreen and it works very well.
5,I got this for my wife for christmas and she absolutely loved it. She has been on the fence about going to college and now she is certain that she wants to go. Glad i got this! And in regards to the 64gb of space it has you can buy a 128 gb micro sd card if you need more. So its not a problem whatsoever.
3,Small screen. Would rather have the numbers on the right but overall great quality for the price point.
5,Perfects perfectly
4,Easy to setup and use however fan at times runs way too loud. Wasn't sure it was a problem or just the way it works.
1,The laptop that I ordered arrived on time the product was in mint condition and there are zero issues with the vendor whatsoever. The product itself sucks though. This laptop is painfully slow. For example if I open a Chrome browser and go to my Gmail account with zero apps running anywhere else it will take about 30+ seconds to load an email each time I move to the next one. You might suggest that I optimize the OS but I already stripped down every thread every extension adjusted for best performance and removed all bloatware. These surface pros are simply unusable unless you buy the most expensive ones.
5,I can't tell from the picture but if this is the new pink HP I LOVE IT!!!!!!
3,Computer will not charge. Either has an issue with the charging port or the cord that was sent with it has an issue.
3,Power cord plug in falls out after use for awhile. Been sticking piece tape on it to hold it in.
5,One of the best laptops I have bought off of amazon. I won't lie I was a bit nervous to put a good chunk of money into a product that was getting shipped without knowing what the outcome will be but I am really happy with what I received. It was well packaged and everything was in the box. The laptop itself works wonderfully. However I cannot say how it works gaming wise I have not tried playing a game on this laptop mainly because it is used for work and school. If you were looking at something that is specifically for games then I would recommend looking at something that is actually meant for that. It has that nice feature but that does not mean it is strictly made for it.
5,Computer was purchased for my middle schooler due to all the online based learning.  It has performed well.  It is small and light but still sturdy enough to survive life in a middle schooler's backpack.  Have not used this computer for any gaming purposes.  Computer arrived within the shipping window.
5,Love it
