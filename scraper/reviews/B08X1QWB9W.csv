4,We are new to the Bluetooth headphone game.  I am NOT new however to the performance audio game.  We purchased these Dime 2's EarFun Air Pro 2 and the Apple AirPods 2nd Gen.  I honestly expected to be returning the Dime's but simply wanted to get a feel for the bottom of the price range.  I WON'T be returning the Dime's.Fit:  I can't talk about "sound quality" until I discuss fit.  The Dime's come with 3 sizes of rubber ear pads.  2 of the sizes felt good in my ears but only 1 size created an ideal "sound isolation" environment.  I used a fully tiled bathroom with a noisy exhaust fan to test all of this sound isolation stuff.  No music not "paired" or powered-on  just me in a bathroom with a noisy fan.  It was really easy to decide which pads to choose for the Dime's.  I was able to accomplish an equally good fit with the EarFun Air Pro 2's it just took longer to decide on which pads were best because they supply 6 options.  Apple AirPods 2G are comfortable and easy to wear but completely FAIL any sound isolation tests or efforts.Sound Quality:  The sound quality varies with the Fit and the audio source;  In that order.  The Dime's have VERY good (almost excellent) sound quality when they are positioned correctly in my ear.  The sound quality is totally lackluster using any of the other 2 supplied ear pads.(see Fit)  The Dime's are definitely tuned to a "flat" EQ with the intent here being the most accurate reproduction of the source audio.  The Dime's nearly accomplish this but maybe sound just a bit "warm" at times.  Not "boomy" still crisp with some punch but warm.  An example of this might be experienced with something like the "Black Album" by Metallica where some of the crunch and texture of that recording will be subtly converted to warmth.  This is an extreme example but one that you may be able to imagine without actually having to go and "listen" to it.  The "price to performance" ratio of these Dime's is insane.  The EarFun Air Pro 2's are even better.  Are they maybe even pushing the boundary into "reference quality" territory?  I'm not qualified to award this label but I am at least qualified to suspect it as possibly being the case.  The Apple AirPods 2G don't fit well enough to create any sound isolation.  Music sounds different every time I put them on or anytime something in the environment changes.If the Dime's are $30 headphones worth $100; then the Apple's are $100 headphones worth $30.  However if the Apple's WERE $30 I wouldn't buy them because I can get the Dime's for $30.  I don't know what to tell you about the EarFun Air Pro 2's..?  They're simply unbelievable at their $60-$80 price point.  I will say that the "touch" controls of the EarFun's are more of a nuisance than the actual "buttons" of the Dime's since I DO have to actually TOUCH the earbuds to put them into my ears.  If I had to offer just 1 suggestion to you it would be to start with the Dime's.  This could become your favorite pair of cheap sunglasses that you just keep coming back to.  I honestly have no idea how much you have to spend to find something that is better without its' own set of compromises.
4,I ordered these earbuds after my airpods suddenly stopped working earlier this week...gotta love apple products :/ I saved $4 ordering them "used" and it is safe to say that they look new as ever. They came in the original re-packaged box with hygienic tape and all pieces/instructions included. The sound quality is amazing and it's a huge relief to hear music in both ears as my right airpod died a couple months ago. The packaging is super sleek I love the forest green color and the zip tie that allows you to clip the case to a bag. Overall the product is very functional and cute. My only complaint is that I wish there wasn't a beeping sound every time I skip a song (does anyone know if there's a way to fix this?). I also dislike the fact that I have to hold down the side button to skip a song and pause the music. I'm used to just tapping the side so it's gonna be quite an adjustment. PSA: the directions don't specify to plug in the case to charge the earbuds prior to use so head-ups to those that also waited 30 min charging them just in the case lol.
5,I've been using these little buds for about 6 months now and I couldn't be happier with the purchase. The grip in my ears is very good I always use them when I jog in the mornings and they never felt like falling off throughout all this time.There is obviously not active noise cancellation but the noise isolation coming from the earphone tips is quite good: using a little over half of the volume sometimes I cannot hear clearly the people speaking around me and the noises from coming cars are reduced in a quiet morning jog environment.For the price you can't expect groundbreaking sound quality but these little buds deliver a decent quality for the price I use them to hear my podcasts in the morning and they sound good for such a task.Battery can be an inconvenience of small earbuds like these but in my case I don't use to use them for longer than a few hours and degradation doesn't mean evident after half a year of use.I would appreciate a battery indicator for the case it doesn't have any and I've found myself trying to use the earbuds just to notice they're not at 100% because the case didn't have any battery on them. There were a few times as well when I couldn't use them at all because they had no charge and the case was also empty.All in all I'm happy with their performance quality and how they've endured through time and I probably would buy them again if I needed an extra pair.
4,I was very excited to get these earbuds. However after having them for about 2 weeks I'm having buyer's remorse. They just don't fit in my ears no matter which eartip I use and that's a deal beaker for me. I do think that the sound is good enough and I enjoy solo mode it comes in helpful due to the short battery life. Still the fact that they just don't fit really makes it hard for me to enjoy them as much as I would've waned to.The mics also pics up a great amount of background noise.Note: They work with my windows laptop and my android phone.
5,I resisted wireless earbuds for a long time because I love my cheap wired pair that I've been rebuying for years and was reluctant to purchase something pricy that I could lose so easily. But after  accidentally tearing my earbuds out of my ears three times last week because I forgot which order I put on my earbuds mask and sunglasses I broke down and bought these.I'm really happy with this purchase so far particularly for the price. I can't judge it against more expensive competitors because frankly I'm not an audiophile so I can't really appreciate the sound quality enough to spend a lot on earbuds. My key requirements were as follows in order:- Price point and/or replaceability: Inexpensive was important but I particularly want to be able to buy individual buds if one goes missing. The Tile feature is a nice bonus over the original Dime and will hopefully further reduce my likelihood of having to pay for a replacement anytime soon.- Size: I have tiny ears and usually struggle with finding buds that fit comfortable and stay in my ears. I have the smallest pads on these and they are comfy while still providing decent sound blocking. I also find they fit my ears a bit better/more securely if I wear them upside down in the opposite ears.- Quiet operation: Might be goofy but I HATE when wireless devices have a talking start up assistant. I don't know why but it's the worst. These have one (unfortunately) but it's at least quiet and the message is short. Since the buds turn on when you take them out of the case the assistant is usually done talking by the time I actually get them on.- Battery life (sort of): I am sure there are earbuds with longer battery life but the case seems to have plenty to get through a day of use. Maybe I'll wish for longer battery eventually but for now it's fine.- Sound quality: I've had wired earbuds that were cheaper with better quality. But these are wireless so I'm willing to cut them some slack. The sound is still clear and of a decent volume. The bass is good and I don't have to turn them up to max on the train.Overall I think this is a great buy as long as sound quality is not your primary interest. In that case you may be happier with a more expensive option.
5,These are great little earbuds and super cheap too. I love how I can hang then off my purse or gym bag. I mainly keep them on my purse and use them when I go shopping to drown out other people and sometimes their screaming kids…lol I haven’t had issues with them staying charged long but I also only use them for short periods of time. I will update my review on charging time once I actually use them for a long period of time.
4,Im a long time fan of skull candy these are great for the price. I wear them for active gym training and slight cardio. These work great in an empty gym however once its packed the BT setting starts to break. I own two pairs. They work great in the sauna too. I wear these in 4x4 setting which means flip then upside down they lock in place. The do not hurt the ear. ive own one pair over a year and used them everyday.
4,I'm sure there's better BT earbuds out there but this one fits the bill for me. If your not a super tech wizard and just want some good ear buds they'll do. I will now they wouldn't stay in at the gym
4,Can not do much of anything without having both in. Battery life is very short compared to others I have for about the same price but the color matches my ear plugs at work so they will have to do.
5,Pros: Nice keychain size! Sound is alright for the size comfortable fit if you have normal sized ears- I have smaller ears they don’t really fit.Cons: battery doesn’t last long at all.Personally I wouldn’t buy the tile version again they chirp so faintly only a dog could find them and with the battery not lasting long enough there’s no point. Save your money and get the regular non-tile version.
5,For the low cost these earpads are so great. Cancels out unwanted noise. I bought 2 brands before this that were trash. I figured this well-known company would put out a superior product. And they did. Great battery life too. Got a second pair for my husband.
4,I bought these to work with my cordless cell phone I got them running on all my computers but not the pixel cell phone. I think it was because I had the computer running while I tried to set up the cell phone. Sound quality is somewhat lacking but at this price point I kind of expected that.
5,These buds are really great. Especially if you use your Device more than the button functions on the buds. You have to press really hard to get it to pause or to change song even turn on/off.Sound is amazing. I’m a long time user of this brand.
3,Three stars because these do 3/5 things I bought them to do. The sound is decent for both media and calls they do block some noise and the battery lasts as long as they say (both the buds and case). They do not however connect to multiple devices well. I cannot make these connect to my Chromebook for any length of time with any kind of consistency. Since I bought these to teach via Zoom hands free as much as I bought them as a light/casual alternative to my heavy noise cancelling Sony headset for casual listening and light work. They do the latter well but I cannot make them work for video calls or any media that isn't on my Android phone. When I try to switch between devices I have a heck of a time getting them to link back to my phone which is the primary device I use them with.Sound Quality: When I say sound is decent I mean they are nothing like my good Sony headset but they are serviceable for audiobooks podcasts etc. Music sounds okay too but not anywhere near as good as my headset. They do not actively cancel sound they just reduce ambient sound interference because of the fit. Not surprised or disappointed in this as I was aware of this function when I purchased them.Fit: My ears are rather small and sometimes they fall out of my smaller left ear especially if I am wearing them while eating. Largely however they stay put even when I'm doing yard work or working out. I won't wear them leaning over bodies of water anyway just in case but I haven't lost them in odd situations or while doing HIIT workouts.On Battery & Turning On/Off Problems Others Have Mentioned: When they are in the case and the case is plugged in I do not think they charge with the case. I tend to charge the case and the buds separately and I have had longer battery times. When I have watched the indicator lights to see if they charge when in the case while the case is plugged in I notice they blink red alternatively. I suspect they don't charge constantly in this situation. *They do turn on when you removed them from the case 9/10 times. I have to make sure that they are off if I'm going to put them in my pocket without the case for them to have any battery life when I want to use them. They get five stars because if you do this they last as advertised but this isn't something I'm overwhelmingly impressed with. I'm not going out of my way to say "Yay! You made a product that does what you said! Good job!" They work with care.Cleaning: So far easy to clean. Just snap the gel bud tips off wipe them and the actual bud then pop them back on. No problems cleaning case and no issues keeping the ports clean.Connections: Pairs with one device easily but will not work with my chromebook so I can teach via zoom. Many problems switching back to phone after trying to connect the chromebook. Pretty disappointed in this but I feel that I use them enough to make my $20 purchase worth it. Still looking for a wireless earbud that would serve this purpose and not cost me more than a class session with a client.Improvements: I do really wish they worked with my chromebook for teaching. This is a pretty big bummer though I knew it was a risk. Being the second major reason for my purchase I am disappointed in this. I also wish "the lanyard function" had a slightly larger loop so I could get it on a clip more easily but this is a minor thing. I'm not constantly losing them in a bag pocket or duffle. In case they fit in most of my pockets (even the super small pockets in women's jeans).
5,Still like I said pretty good the canceled the noise when my brothers step cousin in-law broke into my nabers place own down the street I didn't hear a single noise while they made that baby
5,I work in a job where I wear earbuds all day and these are great. They don’t hurt my ears they have pretty good battery life and they cancel noise pretty well. Perfect set of cost effective earbuds!
4,Nice ear buds for price
4,Saw these in a store (all we're black) and wanted them in a different color. The red ones were exactly what I was looking for. Nice fit great sound with bass included and lasted the whole workout without fail. Charge time is good and other than some of the ear fits they are perfect.
4,I like them but can't go far without losing signal
4,Battery life is good. Has a tendency to fade in and out on uneven ground.  Like the beach.
4,Maybe I don’t know how to activate noise cancellation but people can hear noise. And occasionally the air Bud falls out my ear even after changing the air Bud lining which is great give you two sets. The wise I like skull candy products
5,They’re awesome and get the job done. My only complaint is the fitting and battery life. They did not fit my ears very well but my ears are weirdly sized. The battery life is low at 3 hrs but I'm fine with that since I only wear them for 2 hrs max. Long story short for $25 they’re the same if not better than Airpods in my opinion (for base lovers).
5,Skullcandy always makes good sounding headsets that you don't need to sell your firstborn for.  I love these a bunch they sound great and come built with cool features.  Only thing I'd say is the same with any buds is long term use compared to wired.  Depends what you use em for.  But all and all these  are great buds.
5,I love these. I have 2 pair now. The only complaint I have is there is no indicator of how much charge the case has.
4,For my first pair of wireless headphones these are pretty decent for the price. Loudness and Bass are decent. If you're looking for a pair with a lot of bass and are really loud they don't really pack a punch in those areas. Sound quality is pretty good. I haven't made any calls with them yet to give my accurate review on the mic. Only thing I find that is annoying is that pressing the buttons to lower the volume or anything it hurts my ear having to do so since you have to press it kinda hard for it to work. Other than that again they are a decent pair of headphones for the price I paid. I am satisfied with my purchase.
4,If you are looking for something to wear around the house and you don't want to have to worry about losing them somewhere. These are the headphones they are cheap enough so that if you do lose one you can easily buy a new set without having to spend a ton of money and they work. You can hear what you are listening to what more could you want from headphones at this price.
4,Skullcandy always delivers excellent sound quality and these little buds are no different. They're super convenient to keep in a gym bag or on a key chain in your bag. In your ear they're so comfortable you can easily forget they're in. If you're looking for inexpensive earbuds for use for an hour or two these are fantastic.However if you want all day listening look somewhere else.  The battery life on one bud in single mode is 3 hours max. The case itself doesn't hold a super great charge either if you're switching between single buds as you're charging the lower power one you may get a day or two use out of them. When the earbuds aren't in the case the connector to charge them is open to whatever you happen to have in your pockets especially dust and will result in your earbuds not fully connecting and having difficulty charging.
5,It’s so surprising to find headphones this good for such a low price. While everybody iso it buying overpriced earbud these are worth more but I’m glad they aren’t. Noise cancelling works so good with one earbud and they don’t hurt your ears. A perfect size and overall I appreciate these. Only reason I’m buying again was because I lost one at work was emptying the trash and threw it in the dumpster. They are so light you forget you have them in your ear
5,I REALLY LIKE THE QUALITY AND THE COMFORT OF THESE. THE BATTERY DOES NOT LAST AS LONG AS I WOULD LIKE. I USE THEM FOR WORK AND THEY DO THE JOB. AGAIN ONLY ISSUE IS THAT THEY DONT LAST ME AN ENTIRE 8 HOURS DURING MY SHIFT.
5,I`m a picky for sound devices but I really satisfited with this especially for this price. I am using sony xb950ap at home so I was looking for cheap earbuds for office\gym\outside so I was not expecting something decent and this really surprised me the sound does not lack quality at all. Also it has great bass while high and medium sounds clean I expected it either have bad bass or being bassboosted so other sound will be disorted but everything is perfectly balanced. So it is a strong plus if you are a bass lover like me.In conclusion: + Sound quality is really decent it has good bass meanwhile high and medium frequencies sounds very clean. + Form is great it is very convenient because you don`t need to push it deep into your ears to get good sound. It is really rare thing for me because usually I need to push it in when using other earbuds to get a clean sound. No issues with these however once I put it in it gives clear sound.Also they are not falling out when walking\running or something. I did a lot of movements almost made a backflip and they stay firmly in my ears. This is really an important thing if you buy earbuds for sport activities. + Design is nice case earbuds themself looks pretty nice. + Noice cancelling is good there is no ANC only passive noice cancelling which is doing well enough. + Packaging is also good it comes in nice box (not looking cheap or something at all) which is good if you are going to present it to somebody.Comes with USB cable (which I must mention has two-side pins Jesus finally somebody figured out to make a USB cable that you can plug in any way you want without having pain trying to plug it correctly again and again). -+ Battery capacity is not very big(3.5 earbuds + 8.5 case) and this can be the only minus but come on guys you are buying $25 earbuds this is already OK for this price and if considering everything I wrote above it would be cheating if they had battery like $80+ earbuds. Also they are charging really fast - I put the case on charge and when I checked it after 30 minutes it was fully charged. Then I pluged earbuds and they were 100% very soon (idk 15-20 minutes something like that).So the battery life is not a big disadvantage it lasts long enough (especially for its price lol) and it charges very quick.So overall it is 100% recommended to buy wont regret this.
4,I love these earbuds. In my opinion the best part is the case. You do not risk losing the earbuds and they do not move around when charging. With that being said the charge does not last three hours. I usually wear one earbud at a time and that helps with the short battery life. I also like that the charging cable doesn't have to be flipped around to fit the USB (pictures).  I would recommend for purchase.
5,Skullcandy earbuds are amazing and have such a great sound. For the price they are totally worth it and they fit/feel comfortable.
4,Overall a great product but there are little things about that irk meEarbuds only work for ~3-3.5 hours after a full charge and the case only holds 8.5 hours of charge at a timeI’ve also noticed that I have to turn my earbuds on when I’m charging them in the case on-the-go (charging them on power held in the case)Another thing they constantly fall out of my ears when I move my jaw (eating drinking talking smoking) so I often have to wear them upside-down and in the opposite ears to combat thisThis isn’t too bad just a bit annoying but there’s also some good stuff tooThe sound is nice and pretty good at noise  muffling/cancellingThe touch systems on the buds are easy to useEasy pairing and switching between paired itemsAble to use 1 earbud at a timeEarbuds secured magnetically to lock-in-place in the case as well as the opening of the case clicking in placeKeychain loop on the the case to keep it in one placeI’ve had them for about a month without any real issues
5,I always liked the skull candy brand I looked into the wireless option and these are probably half the price or more of AirPods and they work way better I would say
5,I have had several buds and these are my favorite!  Comfortable and last all day! Wether listening to music or talking podcast. I usually use one at a time because I work in retail  I need to listen for customers questions. The sound is great! Awesome quality! Thanks!
4,Like that they are small and can fit anywhere  love that they don't hurt my ears when wearing them also great sound quality and battery lasted longer than expected. Would recommend.
5,They don’t stay charged as long as I’d like but the carrying case charges them when you’re not using them so that’s cool. I just use them for 8+ hours at a time. Love the color I got. Gonna buy a few more pairs.
5,You need to understand the battery life of this product to fully understand it's five star review status. This was my first pair of earbuds I had no idea how to use them charge them how long to expect them to last etc. I tried to use them after first charge & they died right away! These are basically meant to be plugged in every night essentially you charge these like you would charge your phone nightly & when fully charged they only last 2 hours. They DO require daily charging if you want them to work. I have mine permanently plugged in on my nightstand I use them at night when my husband is sleeping so I can use my phone to watch shows or YouTube etc. & put them back in their case to charge again when I'm done.  If you wanted to take these to work you would need to charge them every night and then put them in your purse or pocket in the am once you start using them they will only last for two hours and then they will die. The sound quality is great they instantly connect to my phone when I remove them from the case they are great! You must keep the case plugged in at all times & put them back when you're done for reliable use though hope that helps!UPDATE: Just an added bit of information I have eventually started using these one at a time and if I need to stop using them and make lunch for my kids or something I reach up and hold the button on the outside of the earbud & press it for three seconds then they turn off. When I go back to them I have not wasted half an hour or an hour of unused time and the battery life last a lot longer! If I ever get a low battery warning then I put it back in the charger and I grab the other one. If you want to make these work and you're flexible they can be great!
5,Es mi segunda compra de estos audifonos.. Son excelentes buena calidad pequeños pero super.
4,These headphones are great on the go. The battery life is amazing however the sound could have a little more punch on the bass. Aside from that the fit of these headphones is perfect and the noise cancellation is great especially when working out or doing day to day tasks.
5,They are so good that I'm wearing right now 2 months later.
4,Overall good sometimes the battery dies though even when not in use
4,These are fine.  They're cool looking and sit better in my ears than the Samsung Galaxy Buds which always fall out of my ears but the sound quality is definitely worse.  They're not terrible they're just...okay.
5,This rating is onlh in regard to my usage while playing a Nintendo switch. I picked these up because Nintendo finally grew some bawlz and  gave us the ability *cough* I'm sorry ENABLED the ability for us to use Bluetooth headphones on the switch.I went looking for a pair of decent but cheap headphones for Nintendo Switch play.Man these things are amazing for Nintendo switch! I was worried cuz I don't normally buy earbuds that don't lock into the ear because of problems falling out but I'm pretty stationary when playing my switch so I went for them and they do not disappoint.Sound starts at medium volume and you can adjust it how you like. I've been playing Skyrim on it and have it to max volume so I can hear assassins and other creatures coming up on me and just cuz you know Skyrim has beautiful music!But man casting fireballs and ice spikes at full volume is insane!!!!
4,Great for day to day listening but not running. Slips and you have to keep readjusting. Super cute though.
5,I’m an AirPod owner I bought these to leave at work in the event I forget my AirPods and I have to say these are just as good. They have a great battery life great sound and noise canceling. I would recommend to anyone who doesn’t want to go broke on a set of earbuds or to someone who just wants an extra set to have around.
5,I have had a pair of these head phones for a little over a year and the quality is exactly the same as when I first bought them. These bitches have survived an hour in the washing machine and 2 hours in the dryer and these bitches still work like theyre brand new. Don’t waste $100- $200 on headphones when you could get these that work the exact same and maybe even better. If you’re  looking for a good hardy little pair of headphones with good sound quality INVEST IN THESE.
4,The sound quality of these ear buds is decent. Not the most comfortable even with the smallest caps. Battery life is not great. My old ear buds would last for days as they didn’t lose charge in the case. These I used for a few hours and put in case overnight and when I went to use the next day they were dead. The power cord doesn’t come with the plug part and the “fancy” usb end doesn’t fit in all types of usb plugs so was screwed for charging at the office.
5,I bought these for my kid who had some significantly more expensive Samsung buds for a couple years before losing one of the buds and needing an inexpensive replacement until it's found. She says these are great also loves that they're red so they're easy to find which is always a recurring issue.
5,I like the clarity of the sound but I wish the volume could a little louder.
5,These are great ear buds. The sound is good and they fit really well. Battery life is ling on the buds and the charging case. Glad I bought these.
4,Nothing
5,Not bad for the money they work well
5,I like them. Work great for the price
5,So far they seem to be doing good he’s had them for a couple of months and likes them.
4,Good earbuds over all but the fact that it's a button press instead of touch sensor on the earbuds is really a turn off.
4,Tha cannot be used at the same time
4,I have always been a fan of Skullcandy headphones so I figured I would give these a shot. Was weary about the price but I know there is a certain standard the Skullcandy has to have....these meet the expectation. The battery life isn't very great and the push buttons don't really work great but if you aren't super picky about that these a a great buy for you. They sound great stay in your ears connect easy are low profile and get the job done.  Not too shabby for $20!
4,What I dislike about the EarPods is that they keep falling off I almost lost them twice had to search for them. Also with the ear plugs that goes on at the end of the ear pugs you don’t know the correct sizes for them. And finally when you ask when the phone rings you have to have both earplugs on in order to use the tap on the phone thing because I like to use one earplug ear in order to hear what’s going on around you so that’s something you can look for to make it all on one ear plug or both your plans set a one idea that’s my concern
4,Seems like perfect little earbuds and they fit fairly well in my small ears. Sadly had to order a replacement since it seems I got a used first pair on top of that the buds are not charging... Lets hope the replacement does better.
4,They are good so far the quality of the sound is decent for the price the battery life is good. The case keep them changing for along period before lost all the save charge.About the noise cancelling they doesn't have or idk if you have to turn on or do something else to get it but in general the are great 👍
5,These are great quality! I’ve always love skullcandy products. These are amazing quality for the price! Love that they have different size ear pieces because I have little ears. Most earbuds just won’t stay in my ears. These fit very well! I’ve been telling friends and co-workers about them for the past week.
5,Need better life barrtey. They need to last longer. And the case needs to be able to charge them
4,I received the earbuds 2 weeks ago and have used them daily.  I really like them... ...but I don't love them.The color is fantastic. I chose the orange. Bright color easy to find if dropped- which happens.  Maybe it's the shape of my ear but occasionally they will fall out.  This is unfortunate to me when listening to music as I use only one at a time.They can easily be used as a pair or singularly. They will also switch between mono and stereo automatically as necessary.It would be nice if they were a bit louder.The batteries will last about 3 hours of continuous use. Charging is made easier with the fancy color-matched case.  The buds magnetically clip into the case which holds two little charge contacts for each one.  Sometimes they don't make perfect contact I guess and don't start charging.  Not often but mildly annoying nonetheless.  A small LED indicator resides in each bud to let you know if it's charging.  Each bud charges in roughly half an hour.  As I only use one at a time: this allows for seamless switching and charging between the two.  The case holds around 12 hours worth of recharge and takes roughly 5 hours to charge.  The case also has an LED indicator for charging status.Nothing is perfect but if you want overall decent quality for a great price- the Skullcandy Dime True-wireless are a good pick.Update:  It seems the buds ONLY charge when the case is NOT charging. This makes an overnight charging scenario much more difficult as the case will charge but the buds won't until the case is unplugged.  A bit lame.Edit again:The in-case charging is very hit and miss.  Often put in one to find it didn't charge at all because it disconnected from the case.  VERY annoying.
4,Battery life is amazing they look cool but there isn't any bass in the music.  Should probably guess that by how small they were. Decent product
4,Great product from Skullcandy! I have never been so impressed with a product that was so inexpensive. The sound quality is outstanding perfectly eq”d and balanced audio similar to pairs of earbuds that cost 5 times the price. If you want a pair of earbuds that you can misplace and not break the bank then look no further. The only complaint is the battery life; 3.5 hours.
5,Better hearing fits good in small don't fall out easy good for on the go. No background noiseExcellent had one before just got old. Love this brand all what it does
5,I'm a big fan of skull candy I would buy again
5,Skull candy is my go to aside from AirPods. These are of great quality but like any electronic it’s always a great investment in purchasing coverage if the unit experience accidental damage. I’m not sure about the battery life but he doesn’t complain. I’ve used them and I should have bought myself a pair when I bought his but for $24 I’m surprised that the bang is bigger than the Buck.
5,This was covered by my Asurance product warranty so I wanted to get something cheap but effective. I think for the price these are well above their standards. I've used my friend's airpods and while these aren't the same quality its nearly identical. My only issue is that they die a bit too soon but its okay as long as you keep the charger around. I was scared to purchase them and waste money but 4 months in and heavy use at work and in the shower they've proven to be great.
5,Quality of item was prime! Good-looking packaging. Very very quick dispatch. A very optimal seller.
5,I really like these ear pods. They work great and fit nicely in my ears. Would definitely recommend to anyone.
5,I’m not a huge audiophile mainly bought these to replace the 1 dollar earbuds I got off wish that I used for 4 years because those were somehow pretty good but were beginning to fall apart. I absolutely love the design on these earbuds and the sound is perfect for me. I just wish the controls when you wore a solo earbud were better
5,Easy charge warehouse toughness and cheap plus great sound.
4,They are nice design
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Great buds of the ear. I have bought these 2wice. I lost my 1st pair on a plane. I left it on a plane. They were black. They are now orange. I cant lose them.SOUNDI used to listen to really bad and tasteless experimental dog noise music with a pair of gaming head phones. I would rock back and forth with my eyes closed. They would roll down my curved head and sometimes fall off. (SKULLCANDIED EARPHONES DO NOT DO THIS). When I listen to music on the ear buds for the first time it sounds much better. More bass than needed but that could be because people like bass. I like high frequencies. Prototype alva noto is good.ENJOYABILITYEnjoyable. I wrote a review today. I enjoy Lisa Mitchell.Good product? Probably yes! I only have the ear of someone like me. Bye
4,sound quality and battery life is good however they keep falling out of My ears.
4,These are just OK . I love how they fit in my ears perfectly though that’s why I ordered Skullcandy all the other earbuds out there fall out of my ears and the sound quality on these are great but they aren’t noise canceling but that was not a concern for me my only concern is that they are a little tricky to figure out when it comes to volume and playing and stopping and turning on and turning off and the battery life is not wonderful on these and I was hoping that the case that they came in would be a little bit bigger than it is only because the case is so small I feel like I’m going to lose it something a little bigger and a tad bulkier would Be easier to find if I threw it in a bag.
5,Son unos excelentes audífonos simplemente me encantan
5,he likes them a lot for listening to music and it helps him sleep i personally like them bc they sound amazing and last a decent time especially for just 25$ it isn't gonna be replacing any expensive ass headset but that's not its competition. I RECOMMEND THESE OVER ANY GENERIC BT EARBUDS
5,Love them no issues so far
4,I wasn't expecting a lot from these due to getting them on sale but I was kind of surprised at them. They are pretty good for the price my only huge complaint is there is no way to tell if the case is charged unlike the earbuds where you can check on bluetooth.
3,I absolutely love the Skullcandy Indy Evo. I went on a trip and lost them and needed a replacement and didn't have the money to buy the Indy. So I got these. Now the sound is great the calls work pretty good. Every single pair of headphones I have EVER had fit mostly perfect in my right ear and hurt in my left. So I only wear one. With these the right hurts and falls out and the left fits better but falls out quickly. I have the smallest covers on and they won't stay in at all. To be fair I have trouble getting earbuds to stay in but these are the worse I have ever had fit wise.
5,Battery life is only barely over a hour and not 10 hrs. Won’t stay in ear no matter what rubber adapter you use. Can’t use out doors afraid I will lose one.
4,I really love the in ear headphones but it didn't last long at all.  Maybe a few months tops.  Not sure if it was defaulted but for the price it was a good buy until then.  So I just ordered a different pair that works just as good if not better.
4,Once I got my EQ dialed in and they broke in a little I gotta say wow I love these! Bass is surprisingly even better than my wired Skullcandy's with larger drivers. Haven't had any cutouts or glitches. Case is super tiny and fits anywhere but is hard as heck to open if closed all the way (snap shut vs magnet). Physical button controls are a PITA since you have to hold the stem while in your ear to press in which takes a bit of pressure so you may prefer to pay more for touch sensitive controls & wireless charging. The main flaw... they are short meaning they don't go far enough into the ear canal. As a result for me it sounds ever so slightly lower on the right side and it hurts my ear a bit pushed in as far as it will go. Thing is this is easily solved by replacing the rubber caps. I've tried both rubber caps from my wired Skullcandy's and the caps off a Blackberry earbud set and both solve the volume and ear pain problem *BUT* with any other caps other than the included on they won't sit and make charging contact in the case but they do make contact and charge once you close the case as it pushes them down. Overall though for $22 color me impressed. Definitely keeping them.
5,these mfs are great for school but you can only use 1 bud at a time because they die rather quickly but it gets me through the whole day by alternating through them
4,Did not like it. Did not fit well on my ears it is not universal on the fit. It hurt my ears. Had to return.
4,My only complaint is the ear gels are too slippery. They tend to fall out whenever my ears move. Other than that they're great.
5,Amazing little earbuds!
4,They work good like the size of them. Only thing when I work out they fall out my ears a lot. Can be annoying.
5,Awesome ear pieces. Great and functional case which locks them in place tightly. The volume is amazing. Highly recommend them. I have two pairs for a backup.
4,There are certainly better earbuds out there than these. But knowing I'd be knocking time around in a pocket with tools and stuff I didn't want to pay a fortune for something that might get damaged. These fell into my price range and I'm happy with them. That being said they're not perfect but someone considering them should already KNOW that from the price alone. But they're pretty good. AND if one gets smashed up I can replace at the cost without feeling like I lost too much.
4,I have narrow ear canals and most ear buds don't fit me. These could be a bit smaller tbh but they fit better than other ones I've tied including ones that advertise being for small ears.
5,For $20 I was expecting a casual set of buds which i thought may have an okay battery life and sounds quality would be manageable. I have had Samsung buds and beats fit pro which was stolen after a car breakin. Well i was amazed by the sounds quality and battery life just for $20. Atleast now i know i can get good music without spending 2 bills
4,Every couple of years for about 6 years I've had to order a new set of wireless earbud. I stay under $50 and only purchase buds with positive reviews. These are both under $50 and have great reviews.The shape doesn't work with my face shape. When using them as they are shown in the pictures and how you are instructed to wear them doesn't work for me. It could be my fat face but when wearing them this way if I smile my cheeks push them up and out of my ears lol its my fat face. However I can flip them upside-down and they fit and stay in place great. Odd complaint but might mean something to somebody.The bigger issue is the battery life they only stay charged with non-stop use for 2.5 to 3 hours. This could be manageable but the charging also take about 1.5 to 2 hours.With other earbuds I had no shape issues (cause I've gotten fat now) and zero battery issues.I will use these until they get accidentally get washed like my past buds but the battery issue will keep me from buying again.
5,I am not an audio nerd but I like these. They sound just fine. They don’t fall out when I work out and they keep a pretty good charge for the price.
4,I find it hard to answer a phone call
4,These headphones are pretty much indestructible. They don't have the most AMAZING sound quality but they still sound pretty good. Battery life isn't the best but they charge quickly. To get down to the point I purchased these headphones just to have cheap work headphones. Recently my s/o washed a pair of pants that had my headphones in the pocket. After an entire wash cycle and going through the dryer they charged up and worked just as well as they did before... So if you need a reliable pair of headphones these are them.
5,I would not blame the fact that my ears hurt on these because my ears are weird!!!... I dealt with and found a way to make them sit better in my ears! - That said - These Earbuds are absolutely gorgeous! Battery life exceed my expectations  Sound: as expected from SkullCandy: Delightful!.... Oh and I didnt even read the part where the Charging Case was also Rechargeable..... WONDERFUL!
3,I have a hard time finding earbuds that fit so usually opt for the ones that don't go in the ear canal. I read several really good reviews for these and have had some other Skullcandy products I liked in the past so I tried these. Unfortunately these didn't fit me. The rubber part couldn't reach my ear canal without the stem hitting some part of my ear. Although I'm returning I think they are a good product. Good price & lightweight! They have an actual button not touch sensitive so it seems like you would risk dislodging them whenever you use the button.
5,Regular headphones that don't have the squish won't fit in my ears. They're like regular ear buds minus the cord. Comes with different squish sizes so they can fit big ears too. They're not heavy & stay put.
5,I bought these because I wanted a cheap pair of earbuds to wear to the gym that I didn't have to worry about the price of them if they somehow are damaged get lost or are stolen while I'm there.I've used a fair number of Skullcandy products in my life and have always been a fan so I decided on these guys. Price point was right and an added bonus is the ones I chose are bright red - perfect for trying to find them if they pop out onto the dark blue gym floor.Anyway I charged them up and gave them a try and was genuinely surprised with the sound quality. I've been using the first run of Skullcandy Indys for a couple years now and the sound quality from the Dimes is honestly pretty close to being on par with those. Certain frequencies may not be as detailed but it's still pretty impressive.They fit well in my ears and don't seem like they're wanting to pop out with every movement like my pair of JLab Airs do which is another huge bonus.The control buttons on the sides are a bit tricky to get used to but I've found if you hold the entire stem between your forefinger and thumb in the right positions the buttons give a little easier. I very rarely use touch controls though so that's not a major issue for me.I've seen alot of other reviews that claim these earbuds are trash but I'd contest that heavily. If I compared them to my ANC Sony headphones sure they're nowhere near as detailed or rich. But it's a $20 pair of earbuds. Have realistic expectations for that fantastic price point. They're perfect for what I need them for and I'm very happy with my purchase.
5,Great ear buds for the price. Last a few hours. Pair easily. Sounds great. Durable. Comfortable fit also stays in my ear very well. Which is an issue I typically have.
4,I bought these when they were $20 and I say they are worth the $20 price tag but would not pay more than that. They are very small and compact easy to carry with you daily. If they are priced higher than $20 you are better off with something else as the price was really what makes these worth it.
3,The sound is good the noise cancelation is good but my left earbud keeps glitching (like random speed ups or sudden loss of volume). This issue began about 30 minutes after I fully charged up the case and the earbuds.Kind of sucks but I would still recommend this just return this product if it has any faults. I'll be using the right ear bud for now.
5,These are good head phones. The sound is crisp and clear. The battery life last all day. I use them for work around loud equipment and still hear my music loud and clear even at a low volume. Setting the up to the phone is easy. When answering phone calls the other person comes in loud and clear. I do have an issue keeping them in my ear while moving my head around. The skull candy brand makes a good product I have a few variations of the head phones.
5,SkullCandy does it again! Excellent earbuds for the price. Great sound cancelling. Great sound. And comes in fun colors. Highly recommend!
3,My favorite color is orange so I was super pumped about the color. I’ve been a fan of Skullcandy products for quite a while. These are good good sound quality the touch buttons aren’t TOO sensitive (you know what I mean some of them are WAY overenthusiastic) but the battery life says 12 hours but I’m not really sure it is. I have one earbud in most of my day listening to music or podcasts so fortunately I can switch them out every hour or so but the Jlab Go whatever is a comparable price has its own charging USB and has a much longer battery life. Still a good price for a very decent product though.Update: the battery life SUCKS. It’s just gotten more and more frustrating.I love the design and color and feel of the case feels good in the hand or pocket has a handy dandy little loop you can clip to your keys or lanyard but the earbud shape itself is kinda funky IN the ear and the battery life is clownshoes.I hate to say it but I’m going back to J Lab Go or whatever the cheap Walmart ones are.I’ve never been so disappointed in Skull Candy and I’m lowering the star rating accordingly.Update 2.0:These earbuds still hurt my heart because I wanted to love them so much! The battery life has done nothing but degrade. At first each one was good for a couple few hours. It’s now devolved to about half an hour for each earbud. SO. SAD.
4,Over all I would say it's good for the money. Nice compast design. Decent sound quality. The only real possible downside is that it doesn't have a very long battery life. About 3 hours of use before needing to be recharged. Not a problem for me but something to look out for
5,I purchased these because I didn't want to spend $50-$100 for other wireless ear buds at the time but I fell in love with these Skullcandy earbuds.  The battery life is great especially with the case that also charges them. The sound quality is great and they are pretty good at sound canceling.And the reason I am really writing this review: they are so comfortable.  I have been wearing them while sitting by the pool and have jumped in the water completely forgetting I had them in.  I immediately took them out dried them in a towel and they still work great. I was astounded and so happy with my purchase! I cannot recommend these enough.
5,I liked the case. I liked the color. The working ( sound) function did not last. I am disappointed that it did not work well since I spent good money to purchase it.
5,I am very happy with these. I loose them and seem to find them when I buy another set (I have had 3 so far)  But the ones I have had the longest which are a year still works great and all of them work consistantly.The battery life could be alittle better but if you keep them charged you will be fine even with consistant use.This is probably the best 20 dollars I have spent and if I paid 40 bucks for them I would still be happy with their performance. If you need some  air buds or have not tried the tech dont let the price fool you. These are great.
5,great product for $20.0 love it
5,I won't lie I really expected these to be a let down. They surprised me. Immediately I was impressed by how the case clicks shut - no accidentally falling out (my Sesh Evos have jumped out of their case when dropped on a bed... it happens). They fit securely in that little lightweight case so I can toss it in my bag and not have to hunt for a stray bud. Unfortunately what you give up for that light weight is the Tile feature the Evo's have so don't you dare drop a Dime you'll have to see where it goes to find it. The other drawback to the case is that the outside of your earbud is exposed through the case but I don't see that being an issue with my usage habits (it's not a step down from what I already have at least).The sound quality is classic Skullcandy clear and balanced. For the price tag I didn't expect thumping bass or extremely rich sound but it doesn't disappoint. This is the Ink'd or Jib equivalent as a wireless bluetooth unit. It lacks the powerful sound my Sesh Evos have at the same volume settings so of course my phone throws a 'loud sounds are bad m'kay' warning at me as I bump it up a little louder - but they get loud enough for drowning out kitchen gadgets lawnmowers Harleys or screaming kids playing MMORPG games on the pc's behind me.  YES!The noise cancellation is spot on excellent can't hear anything but the whoosh of my own heartbeat with them fitting snugly in my ears... except gamer kids of course. Which brings me to fit: right out of the box they fit me perfectly but the extra buds gave me options. The lightweight buds also feel secure and don't threaten to fall out if I yawn changing pressure or structure of my ear canals... so that's a win for me.Sound quality for phone calls is really nice. Great for discord chat as well. Crystal clear.I'm impressed and delighted that they were on sale when I got them. Well worth jumping on that deal even though I have other wireless earbuds. I might even get a couple more pair for those screaming kids... except then they'll scream more.
4,Perfect for doing yard work or working around the house.
5,Good sound i use it everyday
5,I currently own the Samsung Galaxy buds 2 and let me just say that these are...not even close to anywhere near as good. BUT the buds cost me like 150$ and these costs me 25$!! What I CAN say is that these are WAYYYY better than any other budget or cheap pair of earbuds. I ALSO owned a pair of airpods ya know the first model and these sound better! And they aren't over 100$!! Skull candy I don't know how you do it but dang amazing earbuds for a low cost what a WIN. If you are looking for premium if you need noise cancelling the best sound or any of the special cool features the higher end buds have don't get this. But if you want something that still sounds GREAT and FEELS great and LOOKS great and does it's Job with pride for literally 80% then what other ones cost GET THEM lol
5,these are great and love that the case is clicky so they shouldn't open if they fall down. not even my samsung galaxy buds  pro do that if those fall down the buds fly all over the place
5,Good earbuds worth the money
3,I wanted to like these so bad! The sound quality is nice and the design is as well however the ear piece is too large for my ear and puts a lot of uncomfortable pressure on the outer part of the ear because they didn't fit correctly into the ear. I just couldn't wear them long without having to take them out because it just became too uncomfortable. I was bummed because these were supposed to replace my workout ear buds and they just didn't work for me. Now I'm on the hunt again.
4,Paired easily. Don’t compare to my Bose but not bad for the price.
5,Happy
3,* I should have read that it doesn’t come with a normal charger instead it came with a micro SD charger* I used my old skull candy charger to power up these little guys and went to use them the next day at work.* I work 10 hour days. My right ear bud died at 5 hours in. And it kept saying “low battery” in another language.* My left ear bud was fully charged still in the case which I then went to use and realized that this side spoke in English. At this point they started to hurt my ears so I took them out.* these are not noise cancelling but they do have good sound quality.*read before you buy; just because it’s inexpensive doesn’t mean it won’t come with a headache or two and I decided mine weren’t worth the headache. I need earbuds I can depend on and these were not it. I listen to music throughout the day at work and occasionally will power up my wonder-boom to give my ears a rest. I work in a closed door pharmacy so when I need to tune things out I can. I’ll be grabbing something else & giving this away to someone who only plans to use these for short periods of time.*the breakdown shows the right ear maintaining a charge of 3.5hrs and the left 8.5hrs for a total of 12Hrs. It’s much shorter than the average wireless earbud hence “DIME”*I got the black pair. Cute & compact; just not for me. I’m incredibly picky; things have to stay in my ear (even with the smallest ear grip and these being a smaller ear bud themselves I still struggled; so I flipped them up longways and tucked the tip into my upper ear area instead of swinging it low.
5,The quality is made of plastic
4,Wasn't expecting much at this price point and in light of some of the reviews. After listening to them (on an iPhone 8) for several hours this was a solid purchase. After going through everything from Rock to Rap to Electronica there are a few things that are key to getting the max sound quality:1) You MUST get a good seal in your ear canal when you put them in. If the seal is not there these sound really thin and tinny. I have a somewhat small ear opening and usually use the smallest ear tips but for these I went with the largest ones to get the seal. HUGE difference.2) You have to find a good EQ setting in IOS (or whichever platform you have) for the type of music you listen to. In my case Rock had the best balance of lows/mids/highs (closest to a V shape). Hip Hop mixes have a bit too much boom with these but you can roll some of it off with the EQ settings.Also battery life (for me) was not quite as bad as the sub 4 hours I've seen reported. Lasted about 6.5 hours or so before I had to recharge them.Definitely worth it at this price.
4,I've had these for about two months nowStarted off great! And honestly they really aren't bad!Pros: not a bad sound quality! Connects pretty easily. Easy to carry around and nice earbud designCons: not any more noise cancelling than any other earbud. Even when you put the earbuds in the case they don't always turn off. Because of this it eats away at the already short battery life. Don't expect to use these to call anyone as you'll have to talk into the bottom of the earbud to be heard (but holding it to your mouth)Suggestions would be: charge the case every nightIf you're really hurting for some wireless earbuds these will work but you could probably get around the same effect with wired buds
5,Very good if you're constantly doing things. However after a while of owning them the battery life got pretty bad. Went from 3-4 hours to 1-2. If recharging them constantly doesn't bug you get them they're good. :)
4,There super good for the price and they last a long time only down fall is that they don't stay in my ear sometimes and the outside of the earbud will get pretty dirty.
4,I like the sound quality. I’d say its balanced. Just enough bass mid and treble. Not perfect they sound like a little muffled but its an issue for me. Great for the gym!I like the case and buds. It has that recycleable plastic feel. Which i think its good for the environment.Overall great earbuds!
3,I went in knowing the battery life wasn't great. It is what it states and I know I'll need to charge them.The case is sturdy it doesn't randomly pop open. They DO fit well but I have small ears.The reason I went with these despite the so so battery life is the Tile feature. I loose everything. My keys my purse. My wallet. Everything has a TIle on it in my house. I was like shoot why not.Unless you have an amazing high pitch sense of hearing? Nah not worth it. It emits a bit of noise from each ear bud and you have to turn off all things and pray it's not under a light sheet. And boy howdy lets hope the case doesn't go missing. Honestly I'll probably throw another Tile ON the case.If this is your deciding point keep that in mind.
4,I am very happy with the overall quality of the sound and also with the battery life. I love that you can also use just one bud.The only negative aspect is the microphone - calls are quite disturbed especially when made outside.
4,I really love these headphones more than I could have ever expected. I was a hardcore believer in my old-school corded earbuds for a long time. Then I got my galaxy s22 and no longer had a headphone jack. I always liked skullcandy so I went for some of those. And I love them. Except.for one thing the right one is all messed up and won't play very loudly. But if I Tao it a few times just right it works perfectly. Other than that minor inconvenience they're stellar.
4,Love the product! But I’ve noticed the longer I have them in the headphones seem to want to fall out of my ears.
4,For the price I guess there are Ok.  But the batteries only last a few hours which is pretty annoying.  Good sound though.
4,Only paired with my phone.
4,Great but the battery life is half the advertised time about 4 hours not 8
5,This is such a great starter set for anyone. We are an Apple family but their earbuds / headphones are so expensive. Before buying some for my 12 year old I wanted to make sure that he could be responsible enough for something like this. So I purchased these for him to try out and put them in his Easter basket. They are his favorite gift!! He hasn’t asked for the Apple branded AirPods since! My older son has them so it’s not an out of sight out of mind type of thing. He loves these things! The battery life seems to last time all day. He really enjoys the sound quality and while he plays his music and shows loud sometimes I can never hear it when sitting near him. This set is super compact and easy to carry around in your pocket. We love the red color because it’s easy to spot them when you drop them or forget them somewhere. With everything being black and white lately my son looses things. The red color is a huge selling point for us. Overall we highly recommend this set! I’m not even sure if I’ll upgrade him to AirPods or stick with this brand when he’s finished with these headphones. They’ve at least bought me some time to figure that out.
4,I think these are some nice little earbuds use them to run outside primarily and the physical button is great as no touch controls work with wet fingers.I’ve seen people say how hard it is to press the button but if you use common sense it’s not a problem. Grasp the little nub with your thumb and middle finger and press with your index. Easy.Next complaint is battery life what do you expect.. they’re $20. They last ALMOST as long as advertised I get about 3 hours on a full charge.There is no advertising regarding noise canceling for these. They have a snug fit if you have an ear canal that agrees with the 3 sets of included adapters. But active noise canceling ear buds for $20? Ummm no they don’t exist. If they do they’re probably junk.As with everything there are occasionally manufacturing defects on any product we buy and use. Why couldn’t the negative Nancy’s just do what you’re supposed to and send them back for another set before drawing a hasty conclusion and writing a bad review? They bothered me enough to write one of my own. Temper your expectations folks and you’ll be fine. Cheers.
5,Best product below 30$. Not like cheap products at all. Comparable to Apple airpods pro. Excellent battery backup and call quality.
4,Awesome little earbudsGood sound qualityComfortable and long lasting battery life
5,Ya tengo tiempo con este par de audífonos los compre recién fueron lanzados y luego de meses admito que son una buena opción calidad precio.Son bastantes discretos y cómodos como siempre Skullcandy incluye sus tres almohadillas los cual beneficia muchoConsidero que una mejora puede ser la batería ya que algunos competidores ofrecen mas de 3 horas que es lo que realmente dura la carga
4,These work fine and the sound quality is OK but not AirPods. Good battery life and easy to connect and use but no phone use
5,Muy buenose escuchan Perfecto.
4,Sounds great but the battery life doesn't last as long as they said. Just spend the extra money and get the sesh.
4,Good product for price
4,These earbuds sound great easy to connect to and once in ear they are hard to shake out! Great product so far.
4,Son buenos porque para actividades no se caen. Los uso cuando no tengo que ser demasiado cuidadoso
3,Battery life is spot on as advertised but the sound quality is terrible.  I had other Skull Candy sets I was stoked with but have since been discontinued so I snagged these and even with the volume all the way up you still hear even the most basic of background noise.  I guess you get what you pay for!
5,Good product for teenagers sound quality really good for the price. Came in quickly.
5,Funciona bien por el precio que tiene
3,Battery and sound are awesome. I have changed the rubbers and still can’t get them to stay in my ears.
4,Easy seemless Bluetooth connection. Good not great sound quality.  Long battery life. Stays in your ear.
3,I used to buy a skull candy headphones before they got rid of the ear jack I assume the wireless was gonna be just as good as well and I was right they are they are actually really good. The only problem I have is that when you have the headphones in your ear if you make any type of facial grin they get loose and pop out of your ear. It’s quite annoying especially if you’re listening to something that’s funny the earphones going to loosen up and literally pop right out of your ear. Other than that the headphones are Actually really awesome
3,These were great for 2 songs. I had them charged and on medium volume. 3rd song came around and the right bud was buzzing. Hoped it was the song it wasn't. Tried different genres and different media sources. It's definitely the ear bud.Right ear bud is busted after two songs. I didn't even get to turn it up past 50%. Disappointed but expected for $30 for these.
5,Most definitely
4,As expected thank you
4,Nice small case very little weight fits ears snug.
4,Works well as expected
3,Yes they are only 20$ but the one you use most will begin to stop charging if not set in the charger a certain way. Really sad
5,I've got a pair of Bose QC earbuds. I bought a pair of these for my son for his birthday and I was so impressed I bought a set to stash in my tech bag as a backup pair. I've used them a bit just to see how they perform and they fit very well lightweight sound good enough work well enough for calls and have fairly useful button functionality. They sync up quickly so they work great as my backup pair without a lot of hassle. The case and buds themselves are extremely small formfactor which means they don't take up much space in my bag!Bottom line I'd take these over almost anything in the $100 or less range. They simply do what they need to do and are almost cheap enough to be considered throw aways.I've got no complaints for a pair of true wireless earbuds at $20!
4,The sound quality on these is great and they look nice but my only problem is that they aren't very comfortable. Maybe I just need to break them in.
5,Really great earbuds for the price.
3,I was tired of having to buy headphones because they get messed up really quickly. I love the fact that i don't worry about the cords. My only issue with them that they are to buy for my tiny tiny earlobes. Specially with mi right ear. I already switched the bus and still. So if you have tiny ears ( lobs) like i do they are not for you. Other than that Sound is perfect.
5,Realmente los audífonos son muy buenos! La calidad del sonido la cancelación de ruido Skullcandy si sabe hacer bien las cosas. En cuanto a la batería no es la que uno quisiera pero es aceptable. Por $20 estoy muy satisfecho con mi compra.
5,These ear buds sit in the ear nice and tight. They have great sound for the price they only have 3hours of use time so you will have to put them back in the case to charge.
5,If u want ear buds for jogging about maybe consider some with less sound cancelation seriously u can't hear a train within 5 feet. Excellent sound quality as expected from SkullCandy.
3,The quality is good and decent but a big issue is set up and connection is confusing if you are not tech savy then another huge issue it comes with a wire to charge it but not the charger like 1 dont give me a random wire without the charger like I'd have that type of charger to port to it other then that they are mice good quality for the price
4,No se adaptan a personas con orejas pequeñas se salen por qué son grandes
3,This is my backup pair of earbuds so they don't get a ton of use. Bought about a year ago and they were fine average. Been using them more lately and the battery life seems lower each time. Last night I barely got an hour out of them and on a full charge. Doubt that I would buy again.
5,These work so well for my tiny ears! Haven't found earbuds this good in a while
3,Cool color and nice build for a back while you charge a better pair
5,They were easy to set up and use.  I have had a couple weeks now and like them so far.
5,Excellent. Good quality.
3,They were great at first but I only had them for a month and they stopped working after that.
2,Super disappointed. For a low-cost brand I have always trusted Skull Candy; I’ve found them to make great quality headphones just using cheaper materials to make them more affordable. That’s a great business model! But the Dimes are lacking Skull Candy’s usual TLC. Most unforgivably the sound is so so tinny. I can get slightly more bass and low-mids by pressing them deep into my ears and cranking the volume way up—but that’s neither sustainable nor healthy. It’s also not enough to make them sound actually any good. The mids are crisp but lack any body or warmth. Even for $20 earbuds these sound like $5 gas station headphones. Also “noise isolation” is just marketing nonsense. There is no semblance of actual noise cancellation other than having an ill-fitting object stuffed in your ear. Even over a YouTube video I can still hear my quiet air purifier across my bedroom. The fit is also shockingly bad which I think is due to the large too-round shape of the bud itself as well as their awkward weight distribution which tends toward the stem not the bud. They come with 3 sets of rubber ear pads (S M and L) but regardless of which size I use the bud forces itself out of my ear whenever I move my jaw or smile. I’ve never had that problem not solved by changing the ear pads but here we are. The UX is not great either mostly because the buttons on the sides of the earbuds (1) require too much pressure which means you either painfully force the bud into your ear canal waiting for the button to click (and there is a lot of clicking or long-holding required to use these controls) or you have to stabilize the bud by holding the stem between two fingers and then use a third to press the button hard; and (2) the button can only be clicked on the tiny barely-raised logo which is hard to feel (especially if you have calluses) and to find the exact center of the imperfect skull shape. The controls are also messy and confusing trying to cram 12+ functions into two earbuds with one button each. Lastly 3.5 hours of listening isn’t awful for $20—but it’s not great when the product has nothing else to offer. In the end I hate these headphones and the only reason I’m not returning them is because for $20 it’s more trouble than it’s worth. And that’s where they get you.
4,Battery only lasts about 3 hours. Pay the same and get better.
5,I picked up these with some 7mm foam tips and I'm pretty happy with the setup. I hate the silicone tips that these types of things come with from a comfort perspective and the foam gives a more secure fit with better bass response and sound isolation. Only problem with this setup is I have to take off the foam tips to fit the buds in the case and charge them so I just take the tips off and jam them in the case next to the buds and it works. Sound quality is great. Mostly flat though I do like a tiny bit of extra bass with earbuds and these are well within reasonable levels. My only real comparison is some JLab JBuds which I could not stand from a sound (wayyy too much bass and a sound clarity I could only describe as "dirty") and fitment (pain) perspective. I had foam tips with those too but it didn't help the comfort much. I think they were just the wrong shape for my ears. I have little ears with big ear holes. I listen to a lot of Scandinavian melodic death metal and these buds work well for this. Very clear. Paired with an iPhone and I don't notice much compression artifacts unless the source is a low bitrate. "Very high" on Spotify is pretty acceptable for normal listening with these. I don't notice much background hiss with these either. Oh yeah also they don't fall out but I notice they're not quite as secure with the included silicone tips. The buttons on the earbuds are borderline useless but it's not something I typically use. Overall I'm not sure of a better way to spend $20 ($27 with the foam tips ordered separately look for "Earphone Tips New Bee 12pcs Premium Replacement Earbud Tips Blocking Out Ambient Noise Memory Foam Earbuds Inner 4.9mm for in-Ear Headphones with 5mm-7mm Tips" to duplicate my setup).
5,A simple and durable pair of earbuds. The battery life is adequate/good. I mainly enjoy its discreetness. They’re just small enough to not bring attention to them. The earbud’s controls are push button which are displayed as the Skullcandy logo. For the price it’s absolutely must buy.
3,Not good enough noise protection for a riding lawnmower and they come loose and fall out very easily even with the proper rubber thingies.
3,I always used skull candy wired headphones and they are always the best .. I had a different set of wireless skull candy and loved them but i lost them .. I bought these because they look really nice and like they would fit great but man was i wrong .. I have the right ear pads in them .. I popped them in today after a night charge because we had a snow storm and i wanted music while i do snow removal .. The first 10 minutes i had to take me gloves off so many times to fix these things from falling out of my ears .. So many times super upset but i kept rolling with them so i had music felt like every 30-60 seconds i had to push them back into my ears because they started to fall out ... And it took me about 45 mins to do the snow clean up and the battery was already half gone .. Not sure whats up with this style think they got cheaper with the build .. Definitely not happy with these ones .. I would not recommend these maybe another style of theres idk ... The sound quality it awesome they get loud and have nice bass pick up that's why my rating it 3 stars because I always love skull candy but these are just not the ones
4,They work great they're sleek the fit is pretty comfortable for me but that will vary by user.  The issue I have with them is that they shut off/go dead with no warning whatsoever.  I use these a lot for conference calls and it seems that somehow without fail they die on me when someone asks me a question.  Then I'm scrambling to make Windows decide to connect the right non-bluetooth driver and recognize the right input and output device when if it would just say "Power on battery 20 percent" I would nope right out of using them for the time being.  Instead they just nope themselves out whenever it seems good for them and you (I in this instance) look like a fool.In short they're good as long as you keep them fully charged plugged in and use them for short periods of time and not in any situation in which them dying on you could make you look bad in front of high-profile executives for a Fortune 100 company.
4,I did not know these were refurbished when I got them but because I only paid $20 for them I'm not complaining. They don't hold a battery charge like I expected them to but they're decent for what they are. I have to wear them in the opposite ear and upside to get a comfortable snug fit (it's not the first pair I've done this with so has me wondering if I just have funny ears...BUT ANYWAYS) the range is average bud jellies are comfy as heck and my people never have an issue hearing me when I use them for phone or video calls. For the price wonderful but still looking for something like LG Tones that actually fit my ears.
4,Good buy
5,Long time battery and espectacular sound
5,Good sound ok noise cancellation and the battery was ok. I didn't notice how long the battery lasted and I needed a bit longer so I switched them out but I did use them for almost a month and I do love them. I would recommend them to a friend. The only thing I wish it had was more LED indicators on the package to indicate how much power the charging box had.
4,These do the job but I'd like them to fit into my ear better.  While commuting there are times there is a slight disconnect with the Bluetooth connection but otherwise these are a good option for the price.
4,These things are cheap:* the plastic is hard and cheap* the control buttons on the earbuds are so difficult to press that you will never use them* no advanced features (no noise cancellation no audio passthrough no usb-c)* only 3.5 hours of battery lifeWhy you want to buy them anyway:* great sound quality* they are cheap cheap cheap* good connectivity (bluetooth 5)* usability is good for their price (handling of case indicator leds 3 earbud sizes)
5,the audio of these headphones is more than I expected I loved them very much for the price
4,The sound quality is excellent I only have two issues with it. The more trivial one is just the  notification for low battery life is a bit startling and the other is that these tend to slip out of my ears unless I jam them in even with the largest ear-cover things that came with the pack.
5,El tamaño es perfecto mas pequeño que las llaves de mi auto. No estorba en el bolsillo
3,I got these to replace the Jib True. I’ve had two sets of Jib true. Sounded great and fit well but after a few weeks of daily use the right bud would lose volume significantly. The magnetic attachments to the charging base would lose strength and allow the buds to disconnect from charging and auto connect to my phone at inopportune times.Sent in for warranty and never heard back so I tossed them in the trash.Dime has a lid that SHOULD push the buds down onto the charge points and they’re less expensive so that was what made my decision.After a week of use my ears hurt and I kept having to reach up and push them deeper into my ear even with the biggest tips installed. I ordered an aftermarket memory foam tips and that fixed the fitment issue but now they’re not staying connected to the charging points and they auto connect to my phone when I don’t want them to.Sound quality is a 4/5 controls 4/5 aesthetic 3/5 price 5/5.All in all spend more money on a better true wireless earbud if you want something that isn’t annoying.
5,$20 for Skull Candy wireless earbuds? That's a good deal! I wanted to try some wireless earbuds without breaking the bank (or risking losing expensive ones) and they exceed my expectations.First the downside: only  3-3.5 hours batter life. Kind of short but they recharge pretty quickly and you get 2 full recharges from a fully charged case.The upside: literally everything else. Great voice quality great sound and decent bass for the price controls work well pairs and connects easily tells you "power on" and "connected" good fit with 3 sizes of soft tips great range nice case with magnets to hold buds in and hold lid closed.You cannot go wrong for this price period.
3,These are just kind of meh. The fit is not snug enough to block out ambient noise. There is no remaining battery life indicator so you'll have to check on your Bluetooth enabled device. I hate having to actually click my buds to skip songs and increase volume: this puts irritating pressure on the ear cannals.
4,Although I miss some features I've grown used to on more expensive wireless earbuds these earbuds are great for the price. They are not perfect but I love having these as an alternatives to the $100+ premium wireless earbuds.
3,The sound and everything on these earbuds is great and I love them but I've bought two pair in the last year and both sets have had the left earbud stop charging when the case is closed which is a big problem it's why I replaced the first set and I don't know if I really want to buy another pair.
3,They are good for the price but they slip out and they hurt my ears but all honest opinion don’t buy them not worth it. I just wanted to try them out save your money.
3,They wouldnt hold a charge and always said 10% then died. Returning.
4,need to repair every once in a while
4,I use these everyday at the gym and for about a week they were the best earbuds I've ever had they're no airpods because keep in mind they're 30$ was all good until the left earbud got way quieter than the right and I've been using them for about a week the original dimes had this same problem but for that first week they were great I do not reccomend.
3,They don’t fit in the ears correctly. Skull Candy is a excellent product. But this bud doesn’t fit in my ears right.
5,First off I have quite a few more expensive headphones and ear buds. These things are suprisingly nice l especially for the price. They fit nicely not just in the ear canal but in the outer ear as well... Better than any of my others actually. I can workout in these without ever having to adjust these in my ear. Sound quality is probably middle of the road but for $25 they're just as good as my soundcore liberty air 2s. With the tight ear fit it provides good noise isolation. I'm currently sitting in a crowded school basketball gym that was so loud you couldn't hear yourself think. With these in even without music it sounds like someone has a tv going in another room. There's no personalized app to adjust settings and equalizer for the buds but $25. They are going to become a favorite especially as they can sit on my keychain with little notice. $25!
5,Finally a set of wireless earbuds that STAY IN MY EARS! sound quality is decent. These don’t go as loud as others but have good bass and do a good job at noise canceling
4,The earbuds are great for what they are they get the job done but not much else.My only issue is that these do not fit my ears correctly due to the way the buds curve it causes some tension where they rest in my ears which causes pain during long listening sessions.I started putting them in upside-down with the stems pointed up and had no more issues from then on. Pretty simple fix and had no issues after that 👍🏽
5,I’m a big fan of Skull Candy personally. I’ve seen a lot of reviews of people who don’t. But I do. They have great sound quality and reasonably prices. And these DimeBack ones are the most economical. Yup also love that these have the gummy ear pieces. The 1 down side with this specific model is the battery is only about 3 hours. Which for me mowing the lawn it’s fine. But when I’m doing longer hikes(usually 5 hours) they die half way through. So definitely keep that in mind when buying a model. Other thing I discovered this winter is if I wore a winter beanie style hat it would pull the buds out. Over these are great little economical buds. And great sound quality for a good price. I’ve owned many Skull Candy ear buds over the yrs and and extremely happy with them. Always updating with new and more improved style over the yrs as my needs have changed and technology improves. Worth the money
5,I did not expect them to be as good as they are for the price.  Batter life is decent.  Set up was really easy with my iPhone.
3,Incomodan un poquito y suelen resetearse pero me gusta que sean contra agua porque puedes correr en la lluvia o patinar sin miedo a que se dañen además soy muy económicos entonces son perfectos para esas actividades simples si estas buscando calidad y conford no los recomiendo pero si buscas algo resistente para un skater o sesiones de gym correr en Exteriores  sin miedo a tener que ser muy delicado son perfectos
3,The ear buds are very comfortable. The sound is very good.  Noise cancellation is also very good. They do have the TILE feature which is good if you lose them.  The charging cord is very short. I don't want to buy a longer cord. You can use them with the phone feature to answer your phone. Unfortunately using them for long periods of time with your phone. You need to charge them very frequently. Every 2 to 3 hours and they seem to fall out of your ear occasionally. They have the basic functions. Otherwise they are good for the price you pay. However  I'm ready for the next step up which is push active.
5,Battery life
4,Everything was pretty cool but was just physically uncomfortable personally. Tried all 3 bud sizes and after a half hour. Ears were hurting quite a bit.
4,It’s okay but not comfortable for small ears even if you switch out the ear pieces. I keep messing with them to keep them in my ear and so they don’t fall out. Amazing sound and base! I love skullcandy products. But this one was okay. Battery life could be a lot better. 4 hrs is not a long time when others are giving you at least 6 hrs
4,Uncomfortable in my earsSound is fineHas trouble staying connected when in the next room from my phoneThe button is hard to find and pressOne ear was speaking a different language than the other.Battery was at 70% and the right ear said low battery. Left ear ran out of battery an hour later.
4,I have always liked skullcandy. These cute little earbuds work well. Got them to use at work. They work for calls and audio. Battery lasts most of my work days just fine. These are great if you're looking for a deal.
4,I needed a pair of wireless ear buds at work so I could move about the office and still hear my tunes.  These work great and were priced right.  My only issue and maybe it is my ears but I really have to work on getting them in my ears and to stay put.  They get a bit uncomfortable after a while.  But the color Golden Orange blends in very nicely with my skin and hair and no one even notices them.  Not like those white tusks my office mates have hanging out of their ears and discreet was a huge plus for me.  Sound quality is good and distance isn't an issue.  And the handy chargeable ear bud case...love it.  Just pop them out of my ears place them in the case and charge them up.  NO FUSS!  Thank you Skull Candy
4,It gets muffled due to to much stuff going on in the music
5,I had a defective right ear upon arrival. I issued a return and Skullcandy took care of me before they even got their product back. That's super service!The battery life isn't great though. Their predictions for battery life is pretty close. If you listen at max volume its about a half hour shorter than their predictions. Not a bad ear bud for the price.
4,Love these. Pretty comfortable and the sound quality is pretty good for what I use them for but the voice!!! The voice telling you when they’re connected and when they’re dying could peel the paper off of my walls!!!! It’s terrible! Literally had me shooting out of bed in nightmares the other night!
5,Aye…considering they’re ~$20…they thump! I had to tweak my EQ on the Spotsify to remove some of the tins from it. I also hads to use the larger pads for my ears holes to aids in increasing deeper bass which I usuallys don’t do. So then in doing so the sounds deadening increased a bit toos.  Perfects for the stimming!
5,Excelent product good quality fast shipping and packaged well
3,I own a pair of the Skullcandy Dimes (the first ones). I purchased these solely because they had the "Tile" feature and I thought if I misplaced them it would make them easier to find.You CAN NOT hear the Tile alarm unless it is COMPLETELY quiet and you are literally only inches away from them.On top of this the battery life is horrible. Let me be clear while using them it's okay. It's when they sit for a day or so that the battery goes completely dead. So now you not only can't use them YOU CAN'T USE THE TILE FEATURE! 🙄 Save yourself a few bucks and just get the original Dimes they work good.
5,I really enjoy these headphones they have a great battery life and I was truly worried that I would lose a bud but the case closes great my only flaw that I struggle with these headphones is that it's slightly hard to change the volume and song but I think I will figure it out 😊
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Jbl 125 and Skullcandy Dime comparison.  Dime if no music and just talk radio tune or TV shows. JBL audio is so much better that the difference was almost too much. I thought about returning.  Size is noticeably small and already has carrying case for my bike rides.  Since sound not good I can hear around me. Instructions were okay just did not see to remove the white sticker  before charging and hopefully did not break them from doing that. Overall it advertising correctly.
5,Na
4,I wasn't expecting much all I wanted was for my 9 year old son to be able to have some buds for road trips that reliably connect stay connected and stay put.These buds connect to his phone almost every time without hassle. Once connected we haven't had any issues with connectivity. They "mostly" stay put but I do see him fidgeting with them from time to time. He says they fit but imo the fit is probably not as good as some "better" designed buds.Overall we're satisfied we got a great deal during holiday season but wouldn't pay full price for these. The battery life stinks.
3,The tiny size makes it ideal to carry on a keychain. Built in Tile capability To help find device and remind you when you have forgotten it. It has decent audio quality. The ear buds are too small for my ears and I am constantly readjusting them to keep them from falling out. Along with their small size is a small battery other Skullcandy products are less than twice the size but seem to have well over twice the battery life. I would not buy again but I would consider giving as a gift For someone who is either constantly losing EarPods and/or has a smaller ear.
3,It sounds ok has decent battery life pairs pretty well also. One thing to note these are NOT touch theres a button in the middle that needs to be pressed. I happen to like it much better than touch but i can understand that most people would think its not great
5,I bought these so I could listen to music or audible books. I still learning how to use the features. I like they sent different size ear buds. Good quality. Nice case fits in my purse.
5,These come highly recommended by my teenagers.  Because they are very good at noise canceling  I see them with only one in most of the time when they need to keep an ear out for other things. They are also sleek and blend well with clothing and I am told they slip one in their ear during class and are not detected. I am also not able to hear them when they are in their ears which helps keep them in stealth mode.
5,I’m not the kind of person that spends $150 on apple air pods… I’m the kind of person that just wants a functional product that is reasonably priced. These are that kind of product. They work beautifully are comfortable easy to use functional long batter life  and easy to charge. They also come with the handy case and are turned on and paired directly out of the case with each use & automatically turn off when they return to the case. This is great because there is nothing to worry with. These are fabulous and I can’t say enough good things. (They also come with multiple ear pieces so you can have the proper and comfortable fit).
4,I got these to replace a pair of expensive buds which I lost.  Since I mostly listen to podcasts on these while walking the dog and because I have a track record of losing them I went for an inexpensive pair.Overall they are excellent for what I need.  The case keeps them charged and they power on/off automatically.My only complaint is they seem a little large for my ear canal.  No matter what size rubber piece I put on them (they come with 3 different sizes) they always seem like they're not quite far enough "in there" occasionally fall out especially if I'm sweating.  My prior buds (jaybirds) were over the ear instead of in the ear.  But that issue may just be specific to my ears.Sound quality is OK.  Like I said good for podcasts but definitely not as good as the jaybirds for music (but then again these cost a quarter of when the jaybirds cost so...)Great product meets the need.
3,You get what you pay for.  Almost no bass.  Guess I will have to spend more
4,Buen tamaño y buen sonido
4,Loved these!! The only issue is when my charging cord broke the only replacement was found off ebay
5,So I wanted a pair of wireless ear buds so I could listen to stuff at work and not keep getting cords tangled up. I also can't use both at once because I still need to be able to hear what's going on around me in the office.These were PERFECT. I've read reviews of other earbuds that say both play music at the same time no matter what but with these I can keep one in my ear and the other in the charging box and it'll be off. It will only turn on if they are connected to a device and out of the case.Fricken perfect because I can swap to the other ear when the battery gets low and the other piece will charge.With constant use from 8-4ish I can get a full use out if both pieces once and then back to the first one again.I already have two sets will probably get more in different colors to keep in random places. 10/10
5,I have tried several brands of ear buds for solo bicycle rides or hiking sessions.  I get between 2 and 3 hours with these buds.  I have a few pairs and each are different colors.  If I am heading out for more than a 3 hour ride/hike I simply grab two pairs.  The cases are tiny.  After one pair signals low battery I place them back for recharging and then use the second pair.  I suppose you could go much longer by switching back and forth since the case also serves as a charger?  My phone recognizes each pair by color ( ex. sesh light grey or sesh orange).  For me that was easier than mixing up two pairs of the same color.  I think the sound is outstanding and I bought mine for $19.
5,Great buds. Great sound. Channel separation is excellent.  Theses buds block outside noise by filling your ear rather than active cancelation but it's good.
5,I hesitated ordering the Dime when I read the review that said the sound was "metallic" but boy am I glad I ignored that review and went ahead and ordered them.  The buds paired seamlessly and without any hassle.  I put them in my ears and played some music... Wow!  Solid base and broad sound!These are amazing!  Especially for the price.  If you can't justify $100+ for ear buds then these are for you!Thanks Skull Candy!
5,Great sound and good range. Far better than expected for the price.
5,I accidentally left my earbuds in my pocket and it went through the washer and then I threw my clothes into dryer they went to the dryer once I finally found them I was like oh this ain’t gonna work but then once I connect them and everything else the sound quality was still great the noise cancellation was still great all the features were great and they still work in charge just fine
5,Relacion calidad precio razonable. Lo malo es que no se pueden configurar desde la aplicación de skull candy y el volumen máximo es muy bajo no tiene mucha potencia.
3,I’ve had used these for a little bit and kept them with me along with normal wired earbuds. However the reason I don’t like it too much is mostly the battery life. I would fully charge it and in about an hour it would say low battery in the left earbud I’d just keep going until it ran out of power and then about 30-45 minutes (ish) later the right one would go out. It’s almost always connected to my phone even after it’s in the case (which for normal earbuds shouldn’t connect and shouldn’t be in use). Overall it’s a good product would not buy again.
4,Relatively comfortable to wear volume is not high enough you have to have the paired device volume at max so you can get high enough volume from the pair. The tap control is not easily located as one has to feel for tap area. Does not have charge remaining indicator.
5,The earbuds are light weight and easy to use.  It is easy to forget your phone in some other part of the house.  These are great-
2,Update: so family got any better I’m gonna return them. I’m struggling because I really like the color which is stupid but functionally there a fail on every level just about the sound as is average I would say and may be a little bit better than the ones I had previously but they’re certainly not enough to keep for the color and they don’t stay in layers at all I’ve lost them two times in the grass and under a table.Frustrating——-I don’t have any clue how this got so high reviews. I do notice I can tell that they’re in stereo more than my other pairs but outside of that the sound is scratchy there’s no bass and they don’t fit well in my ears and I will give them that my ear canals are an odd size always been an issue for me but I usually get custom plugs and I’m good but for the quality is granted for the price it’s probably I would say maybe average I paid maybe a smidgen more for my two other pairs but they’re 1000 times better than Scott these and I’ve had Skullcandy before and I quite like them but there’s not even a little in fact I think I’m gonna return them and try something else I love the color but that’s it  I’m so sad I really didn’t expect this really I didn’t and I don’t have time to deal with returning in my left one is about to fall out again not happy I’m happy at all happy Wednesday
4,I love the size of these earbuds. The stems make them far easier to work with and the size of the case is wonderfully unobtrusive.I don't know what it is with Skullcandy's new earbud tips but they do not fit my ears nearly as well as the older ones do. I ended up returning these as despite good value sound quality battery life connectivity etc. I just couldn't use them without swapping out for the older tips which make the buds not fit into their case.I wish my ears weren't so weird. They'll probably fit fine for you.
3,I've had skull candy wireless headphones before that I loved but I lost. I got these to replace them & I had high hopes. The sound quality is pretty bad. They sound tinney & are not good for music. Phone calls are okay & don't sound too weird but music gets distorted. They're more comfortable than my last pair & smaller so they fit comfortably in my ears. The battery hasn't died for me while I was out & about yet. I usually use them for about 4 hours or so at a time. Overall they are okay. I wish I had spent a little more & got a better more expensive pair but these will do for now. Skull candy has pretty good quality products. This is the first out of 4 of their products that I've been disappointed by. They're aren't terrible but they aren't great just okay. Worth what they cost I suppose.
5,3rd pair I’ve bought. Now everyone in the house has their own pair.
5,These little ear buds are AWESOME!! The sound is great and they really pack a punch!! I scored them during Amazon Prime Days and got the deal of deals. Worth it!!
4,Works for what they are worth. Low lasting battery life. Sound quality is good recharges quickly.
3,Not meant for working out apparently as because the left one started to mess up after I got sweat in it. They don't really have great sound or quality but their wareless Bluetooth headphones so ... Eh Mediocre
3,Sounds good volume is kinda low even when fully up. Battery life is okay.
4,If you want a decent pair of wireless earbuds but just cannot spend the extra money for an expensive pair look no further! These headphones suit any casual listener's needs with very balanced and satisfying sound. When you turn these bad boys up They sound surprisingly very good without the bass being too overpowering or them too muddy which I see in a lot of budget earbuds. The comfortability is so-so. These models come with ear-tips that will play a huge part in your listening and comfort experience. Choose the size that will fit in your ear snuggly. These particular models were very difficult for me to put in my ears at first but then I got used to it. Other than that though these are very solid earbuds at the price along with the Skullcandy Jib.
4,The battery life is a little sus but overall sounds quality is good
5,Can this product compete head-to-head with any of Apple's products? No.  But does it have a long battery life?  Also no (I get half of the claimed 12-hour battery life).  But the earbuds are super comfortable right?  Nope; they're tolerable.  Great noise cancellation?  Not so much.  But where these earbuds shine is that they deliver acceptable performance for $30.  The instructions for using the controls (for changing a song or increasing the volume etc) take some getting used to; give it a couple of days.  I've had these for 3 weeks now and I keep thinking to myself "I can't believe these cost $30".  I plan to hold on to them for a long time... but if I lose them no big.  Another $30 puts me back in business.
5,Been looking for ear buds that work with my iPhone and messenger and these do!!  Excellent sound quality and long range. Love love love these ear buds
4,I think this product is great especially for such a low price. I have used them on a regular basis for about a month and they have worked really well. My only complaint is that they don’t stay in my ears very well but other than that they are great!
4,These Bluetooth earbuds are good for the price although the first pair I received was defective (left earbud was buzzing loudly) the replacement pair I got is fine.
4,Can be hard for people to hear me when outside on a phone call definitely need both earbuds in for it to pick up my voice at full volume. Things you don’t usually get from earbuds continue to be lacking bass some depth etc. Not the right buds to stay in-ear for jogging or jumping activitiesHOWEVER for the price this is exactly what I was looking for - earbuds to listen to music on dog walks and while biking. I never have a problem with them connecting across devices the battery lasts me a week or more with low-moderate use and they look all right nothing crazy or obstructive. Take some time to figure out the right size bud for your ear as this helps a lot with sound and stability.I recommend these to friends ready to ditch cords as mask-wearing becomes full time.
4,I have used Skull Candy for years especially their earphones my only complaint was they short out after a few months. I brought many knowing that would happen. This was my first pair of wireless buds love the case design and shape that fits my eye perfectly. But the battery life is barely five hours. But I won't hold it against them because of my love for skullcandy. Hopefully the future models will improve with longer battery life.
5,Great battery life and plays music clear!
5,This is my first purchase from Skull candy & I’m pleased. First they’re the only buds at this price point (that I’m aware of) that offer a loop for attachment to a key chain or lanyard. It’s a small but nice extra.The sound is crisp & it syncs up easily to my phone. The only downside is battery life. This set lasts about 6 hrs before needing a charge while I have another pair of buds that easily go all day before a charge is needed. It’s not a deal breaker but worth noting.All n all a purchase I’m pleased with
4,Purchased both the Skullcandy Jib and Dime in an attempt to find the best wireless earbuds for work. Neither one worked for me - couldn't get the earbuds to stay in my ears. The Dime feels cheap. The charger is cheaply made compared to the Jib charger and the earbuds feel like cheap plastic. I paid $5 extra for the Jib and the difference in quality is noticeable.
5,The product is great!
4,There okay:)
5,Really like it great price good quality
5,I believe it's the best and last longer then any other
5,If you need a pair of backup headphones to keep in your bag for all the times you forget your main ones these are a great option. From the tiny size to the built-in keychain loop on the case you can tell that these were designed with portability in mind yet they don't really feel like they're missing anything. They have a charging case with strong magnets that hold the buds in really well. They have auto on/off functionality. They have microphones. You can use the buds individually if you want. There's even a single button on each bud; you're supposed to be able to perform all kinds of functions with different combination presses and long presses but fair warning anything besides the single click to play/pause is tricky to pull off and involves crushing your ear so you might want to stick to your phone for controlling the music. The sound quality is good — nothing mind blowing but definitely above average — and the comfort/fit are pretty par for the course for in-ear buds with the standard three sizes of tips to choose from. But what really makes these buds stand out isn't their sound or comfort but the sheer portability of this little package combined with its value which is where Skullcandy usually shines. For the price you pay you really get a lot. So these won't be replacing my AirPods anytime soon nor can I necessarily recommend you use them as your main headphones but they're a great price and great for traveling.
5,Well made perfect sound quality. I ordered these for someone else because mine have lasted for years now. 🙃🙂🙃
4,For under $30.00 these buds sound decent. High on the tones treble bass is acceptable but not real low. I’m just an average user so for my needs.. exercising a little music here n there they work fine.
5,I loved the color the comfort but the battery life was bs they last 3 hours then needs to be recharged I bout for my motorcycle trips but it sucked that I had to stop one good thing was just using one then putting in inthr charging box then getting the other one
5,They have good sound.  But if you have big ear canals.  Had to swap out what it came with.  Stays on ears better now!
5,They work good look great could be louder.
5,Hasta el momento me ha ido perfecto con los audífonos. Buen sonido solo que no tan alto como hubiera querido.
5,These work perfectly for my audiobooks at work.
5,It works perfectly I was actually contemplating between this one and another I'm glad I took this one.
5,At first I thought they were too low. I put the volume on my phone to the max it would go and they were too quiet. I was disappointed at the lack of volume.However I discovered that you double tap on the R bud to increase volume.Keep Double tapping until you hear a beep.That means the INTERNAL VOLUME setting for the buds is maxed out.You'll notice that messing with this internal volume setting does not change the phone volume.Increase phone volume to desired level.Once this is done these buds BUMP. Great sound and bass.I think mine shipped out with this volume setting at the lowest setting. I was getting ready to return these until I figured this out. these are now my go to while I work.
4,I bought these for 2 of my nephews. They love everything about them
4,These are good for the price. I wish they charged with usb c instead of micro USB. The sound quality is pretty good. They fit in the ear very comfortably. No complaints here!
5,Bought 2 of these after being pleased by first pair. Battery life is definitely on the weaker side but they cost less than $20.On the massive + side of things they pair automatically and QUICK to my iphone without any effort require on my part. I would buy these again anytime if needed.
3,The earbuds are good but the sound quality is not gratifying. They are difficult to turn off. They are usable and the price is reasonable.
4,Build quality is not good. It feels very plasticky and low quality material. Sound quality is good.
5,I bought these earbuds because I have had several sets that didn't work. I love them. Will never buy any other brand but Skullcandy
5,Works perfectly
3,I love Skullcandy. I love they absolutely murder bass. Been buying their products for years and would have gotten their airpod clones if possible. This was what they had in stock is ok I buy it. So I immediately notice the plastic is extremely cheap ok sure I paid 25$ for headphones I can live with that. The sound off the bat is really tinny. Not too much bass no mids so I have to adjust the eq on my phone. I got it sounding pretty good. Not as loud as I would expect or prefer but like I said you get what you pay for. I ended up giving them to my husband because they don't fit my ear well even with the small rubber ends on them they feel uncomfortable. The best part he said was that they attach to your keychain.
5,I've had a few different types of wireless headphones as I seem to loss them one way or another. This is my second time coming back to the Dimes. It has the fastest Power to connected speed I've seen. The sound is good for listening to music or watching videos but they aren't going to change the way you hear music. The battery doesn't seem to charge as fast as some other skull candy models but they do last 3-4 hours each which can be used one at a time well the other changes in the box. Unlike most that use touch buttons they have a tactical button that won't get pressed if you slip them in your pocket.If you just want a decent sound for the best price get these ones. If you want 5-6 hours continuous  of music maybe try the Indy.
4,Is good for the price
3,I really want to love these earbuds skullcandy has always been a favorite brand for me so when I saw these I immediately got them. They were great for a while (bought in Nov 2021) recently one of the earbuds won't charge so I am down to only using 1 earbud. I use these for work calls (minimal usage) in a very loud office so having both is pretty essential for me.
3,While these are by no means super high quality they do work for in my case yard work. You will need to find the perfect position so they stay put even with the largest ear cups. For me that is them facing down in my ear in any other position they fall out while simply walking. Sound quality is decent with little to no bass and a bit tinny sounding treble. With that said for the price not bad at all.
5,Great bang for the buck headphones. Good all around sound that's not too heavy on the bass good solid 2.5-3 hours of battery life on a single charge.I like these because they are cheap and durable enough to take everywhere without being too worried about breaking them or loosing them. Highly recommend for work use. If you need longer battery life then you might want to pick up a nicer set
4,Love the size and how it fitsOnly thing that could be better is the bass
2,I do not know what is worse the battery life or the way they fit. The way these are shaped the entire bud needs to fit in your ear to be secure. It's a little big for me so the buds almost always fall out and need readjusting. I mainly use them at work so I'm not moving around too much and they still fall out. The battery on the buds do not last more than a few hours. I usually only use one bud at a time and in a regular 8 hour work day I have to switch them to charge at least twice. The case I charge it once every 1.5 days.The sound is not TERRIBLE but it does skip a every once in a while and that's annoying when I'm really enjoying a song and the skips interrupt the flow of the music.I bought these because I lose my earbuds regularly and they were inexpensive and colorful but I wish I would have spent a little more for something different. I also wish I had not thrown away the packaging and I could return them all together. 2/10 would not buy again.
5,Good ear buds. The most surprising thing about these is the charger cable get this it's a USB cord that plugs in no matter what side it's facing. That blows my mind usbs have been out for years and only now have a seen a double sided cord lol
5,These are good little earbuds for $25. Note: the instructions aren't the greatest. I don't see anywhere in them where it tells you to remove the little white stickers from the sides of the buds before you charge them. I thought they were part of the design. The buds of course wouldn't charge and I wrote a bad review. But I looked up some online instructions and realized I had to pull the stickers off. They charge and work fine now. I deleted the bad review (apologies to Skullcandy). They're comfortable sound good and I like how they're magnetized so when you open the case they don't go flying out. Recommend if you're on a budget.
3,Pretty good quality but don’t fit well in my ears and constantly fall out during activities.
5,Like
2,Earbuds will not stay in ear no matter which in ear sizes you use. All it takes is chewing food for them to fall out of my ears so you can forget anything active not even just walking. After a full charge the battery drains when not in use. Charged ear buds and took a trip. Didn't use them for 1 day and then went to use them knowing I had previously fully charged them and still they were dead. Makes no sense. If the battery can't keep a charge when not being used then these ear buds are obsolete and unusable. What a shame...
5,Decent set of wireless earbuds except the Right stopped working and the Left has started to stop working. Lasted about 2 months.
4,Got these a few months ago and they work great the sound quality is nice and clear and the build quality feels sturdy and well made. However the battery life on them is pretty short for me usually lasts 4 to 5 hours on a full charge. Overall great earbuds and for $20 they are absolutely worth it.Pros:Great sound qualityPairs quicklySweatproofHigh quality buildCons:Short battery lifeCase can sometimes be hard to openEarbuds tend to fall out when running
3,Battery life is terrible. But they do the job. So.. meh... 3 stars
4,Great value for what you get. Price point is perfect for these little earbuds a bonus is the tile feature. Compact enough to really fit on your key ring and I’ve already tracked down my keys using the tile app. As other reviews have mentioned bass is not so good and they do fit my ears pretty nicely.
5,you can’t beat having these around for a spare pair of earbuds. they look like a tiny key FOB. for 20 dollars i’ll gladly let them live on my keys until i need them in emergency. charge them every now and then and you’re good.heavy users charge every couple of days.don’t expect 7 -8 hours at high volume continuous output.overall worth every penny. definitely should try before commitments to the higher priced premiums. all they offer is functionality that is beyond what you’d actually notice you need when using them.these are just my favorite wireless buds right now.  for everyone.
3,I wanted to like these earbuds being the price was right... The sound is good for the price.  They are really small and compact.  You also can use them independently which makes them more user friendly.  The downside is they will not stay in my left ear and will stay in my right ear as long as i don't move. They fell out of my ears getting into my Uber ride and getting out of the car at my stop.  I've tried all 3 sizes of cushions and will not work with my left ear.  Very frustrating and embarrassing when you have to ask a Uber driver to move the car so you can retrieve the earbud from underneath the car.  So i ordered buds with a loop to see if that will solve the issue.
5,I bought these for the gym! I didn't want something getting hung up on my hoodie as a wear one working out! And I also didn't want this huge thing hanging out my ear. This ear bud exceeds both those concerns! I was getting caught up with noise canceling and this feature and that new technology blah blah with so many reviews. I'm just putting out my info! And want I like about these! They aren't extremely loud but you cant hear a damn thing from the outside I work construction and I can honestly say I've had a hammer drill about 3 feet from my face and I can only hear the hammering if the song is a low part lol so that's awesome! Also like case it feels solid! And looks so damn clean! Also the case is magnetic so when you return the bud to charge it has a positive pull on the bud which feels like you got a 100 dollar ear bud I'm opinion! The only thing I can say is that the range from the phone isn't all that great but I mean we carry our phones on our person already so it doesn't even matter really! Also I remember reading about the 4 charging cable and I have USB wall plugs so it hang on it's dedicated one in my kitchen not a big deal for me! Honestly for what these ear bud are I seriously cannot Believe they go 20 bucks! Buy them!
5,Muy buenos los recomiendo
4,These are really great earbuds overall especially for the price. Connecting has no hassle and the size is perfect for working out. Very lightweight and stay in your ear. I have wet ear wax and these earbuds still do a great job of staying in and canceling noise. They might be easy to lose if you don't keep track of them but a good way to avoid that is to hook them onto your keys. The only thing I would say is that the sound is not as loud as you would get with other more expensive earbuds but definitely worth more than the money you pay. Never had issues with battery life. I am really active and use them to work out and study and only have to charge them every two days or so. Have been using them for a few months now.
5,So comfy and work great just battery dies pretty quickly
5,I bought these on because I couldn't find the one I usually get.  I am so pleased with this purchase.  Especially for the price! Battery life needs something to be desired but for the price  you can't ask for more.  Very pleased
3,Sound cancelation is amazing.
4,The headphones really aren't that loud at its highest setting. But in the end not bad for the price
3,Had to buy memory foam replacement things and now they stay in. Battery doesn't last near as long as other brands and noise cancelation was an issue until I got the memory foam pieces; they drown out everything outside. So my review for the memory foam will have 5 stars.
5,Sound great for 20 bucks.  Don’t expect these to be as good as AirPods but thy fit my ear better.
3,They fit well with the smallest size silicone tips. I have very small ears so fit is always a challenge. Decent sound for podcasts and audio books. Not too concerned about battery life because I wear one at a time. I can just switch back and forth.I'm not completely happy with them because the controls are awful. I can pause/play and turn on/off and that's it plus you have to mash the bar making adjustments uncomfortable. I have to use my phone to adjust the volume or backtrack which defeats the purpose of buying them. I wanted them so I could move around the house without carrying my phone with me everywhere. I'd return them but they're the only ones out of three different brands that actually worked at all. Sigh ..
5,I use the when I cut my grass and do other yard work I have sweat with them in and had no issues. Great value
4,Like the size of the earbuds and the charging box sound quality is impressive pairing is easy. Controls can be a bit tricky but once you get the hang of it enjoy your music
5,Very nice product
5,Very easy to set up and use! Highly recommended for anyone who wants a good headphone for a great price!
3,Happy with sound quality but was very surprised that battery drained in less than a few hours after full charge. Most of my other Bluetooth head phones and buds lasted 10-12 hrs on a charge. Not a fan of Skullcandy anymore
3,The battery life on these is pretty good and the case keeps them charged - just remember to periodically charge the case itself. The sound is OK but noise isolation/cancellation is not very good. They're comfortable in my ears and have a good fit. If I'm on workout equipment or at my desk with my paired phone sitting out the bluetooth connection is good. However if my phone is in my pocket and I'm doing anything other than sitting in a chair the connection frequently drops out and causes audio issues with the media that is playing including complete loss of audio or the audio in each bud not being synced with the other. I don't have the same issue with other wireless earbuds that I use.It would be nice if there was an app to manage them like some other buds have but that's not a dealbreaker for me.
3,Pros:As with all Skull Candy equipment the sound is really good.They're very affordableThey come in a few colorsCons:The batteries usually go dead within about 2 hours of me taking them off the charger.I can't get a comfortable fit with any of the 3 sizes of ear pieces.They leave my ears hurting.The noise canceling isn't as good as my other pair.They fall out of my ears more than they should.It's a good thing that I mainly bought these to be a back up for when my better Skull Candy wireless ear buds are on the charger. Your better bet is to save up and buy a $40 pair of Skull candy's...
4,We bought these for my son and he loves them great sound quality  and battery life would recommend to purchase especially for children whose not be responsible enough for more expensive ear buds
4,I tried for 16 hours to get them to charge because they wouldn't charge then I realized those white pieces are not a part of the earbuds they are supposed to come off 🤦
5,I never write reviews. I either can't remember or I don't have time. However I had to write a review of these wireless earbuds. Without meaning too I put them through the wash. The case cover broke off. I was sure that they were done and I was pissed. Before I threw them out I figured I would check them to make sure they were done just in case. I put the cover of the case back on as best I could put the earbuds in and plugged them in to charge. They still charged! The next day I tested the sound and there was no change whatsoever. These earbuds were well worth the money.I am extremely picky about how my ear buds sound and skullcandy has delivered to my specifications every single time. Crisp and clear without too much bass. These are no exception. They stay in fairly well. I have some trouble with that but I also had that same trouble with wired ear buds so that is a me issue not a product issue. These earbuds also get as loud as I like which is an issue I have had with others. The noise cancelling is very good and I honestly didn't think it would be.I will say that the controls are a little complicated and it took me a while to get the hang of them. Once I did I have been a happy camper.
4,For a tiny case and tiny earbuds it’s relly good sound quality is Alr bass is a little low only problem with it is that it keeps fallin out my ear overall it’s a really good pair or earbuds for the price
3,Bought for my boys and they quit working.
5,
5,I was not expecting the sound quality and noise cancellation to be this great for this price. The battery life is ok but I use one earbud at a time to switch back and forth when an earbud dies. Bought this item back in October and I’m just now writing a reviewbecause I’m not able to hear or speak over the phone with this. I can still listen to music though.Update 4/21: After I wrote this review unexpectedly my earbuds started to work for me to speak/hear as a headset
3,I like the headphones but
3,I bought these for mostly outdoor stuff or when I'm active and I am disappointed. The fit is poor and they often come loose even when simply walking. While sound is quite good it's annoying and it affect the noise cancelation abilities.
3,The noise canceling feature was not very effective.The worst thing about these is they won’t stay in my ear regardless of which size silicone umbrella I used.Everything else about these were fine but I cannot tolerate them falling out.
4,Work as expected
5,You can't beat the audio quality and build quality for this price.
5,Effortless pairing exceptional sound quality comfortable positioning into ear make these earbuds an excellent choice. Lowest price is an added advantage. I repeated the order purchased 3 more for gifting.
4,Very good headphones Everything is good about the one thing I would like it to be less cheap plastic cause a plastic it feels cheap but overall it’s very good headphones
5,These are excellent for the price point. We’ve been sleeping on Skull Candy for sure! Fit is good in most ear shapes. My 11 year old daughter has a little trouble positioning them but myself husband 13 and 15 year old sons have no issue at all. Battery is excellent. We wear these while mowing the lawn and can hear our podcast clear as I would in a silent room. Worth every penny!
3,They are ok if you don't have any head phones but not very loud and the battery is the worst! Didn't hold charge very long at all maybe 1.5 to 2 hours at the most and they take way too long to charge. MPOWs were much better to bad they stopped selling those.
4,You get what you paid for.
5,Great fit and sound quality
4,I use these headphones at work to listen to music and watch shows. I tried using them for a call and was told it sounds like I am in a silo. Very echo-y to the person on the other end of the call
5,Nice earbuds.  Good sound quality.  They have three sizes to fit almost all ears. Or in my case one ear canal is smaller than the other. All as advertised
3,I bought these as a replacement for my AirPods.  I’ve only ever used AirPods but I am sick of paying to replace them when I inevitably break/loose one.  Thought I would try these…and I am happy with them.  I am disappointed that I can’t answer a call on my phone and it automatically transfer into the earbud (you must answer on the earbud for the earbud to transfer the call.) But other than that I have no issues.  They have very good battery life the sound quality is decent. Calls sound fine and callers have not complained about how I sound on their end.  The charging case seems sturdy and came with a keychain attachment.  Connecting to my iPhone was simple.  Overall I am very happy with the quality for the price.
4,Using it for quite some time and I am in love with this one .
4,They sound really good; for what they are. You need to understand that this are meant to be portable on the go earbuds that focus on portability above everything while keeping decent sound that is actually better  that the skullcandy indy Evo.the fit is actually my only issue with them. they can fall of your ears if you don't push them in every now and then.
5,Excelente : artículo en excelentes condiciones  sellado  a tiempo
5,Battery life and sound quality 👌
3,Great sounds horrible battery life about 3.5 hours and the case needs to be changed daily
5,For the price these little boys pack a punch. Important to note that they have physical buttons to press as opposed to touch. And the water resistance is very good. I'm not saying you should do this buy mine survived a trip through the washing machine!
4,with the price tag under $20 it worths the peny. good looking but the buttons are not that click it takes time to get use to. will be better if the button are more sensitive or responsive.
5,Best purchase I've made in a while.  They fit snug in both my ears and my wife's smaller ears.  I read reviews that they could get worked loose during a workout but I'm not sure how that is possible with the various sized earbud adapters.  I certainly don't have issues during my workouts.  They have never fallen out period.Easy to sync across all my devices.  I really like the magnetic connection back to charging case and charging light to verify they are in fact charging.  The case is small enough to put in pockets and easy to carry.  I've been in and out of airports with no issues.  They don't cancel 100% of the noise but nearly close to that.All my calls say they can hear my voice just fine so have started to use these for conference calls as well which I was not expecting to do!
5,They're pretty great earbuds all things considered.They sometimes randomly fall out of my ears when I'm learning over my desk or exercising because they're kinda an odd shape the microphone's not the strongest (granted I have a rather quiet voice so it'll probably work better for others) and they only have around a 2.5 hour battery life but they charge really quickly have great sound quality for listening are comfortable to wear and connect quick to the Bluetooth on my phone. Skullcandy is a great company and I've never been disappointed by any of the wired earbuds I've gotten from them and these are definitely the same with the bonus of not having to worry about catching the cord on things. The quality of these earbuds is definitely worth their price.
4,It is what you pay for… battery life is weak… they charge unevenly … they fall off if they get the slightest tiniest drop of sweat … but for 25 bucks they work ok. Wouldn’t buy them again tho.
5,I've been using these headphones at work with my new S22. First time with the wireless type. Other than my awkward right ear acting like a pressure cooker and popping the headphone several feet away I'm really enjoying these. My left ear (standard ear no awkward shaping) the headphone stays very well. I've accepted no headphone will ever fit in my right ear.As for noise cancellation I can still hear my co-workers yelling across the building might be a them problem not a headphone problem.Battery life is good especially if I only use one at a time and always have one charging.
5,These are the best for this price point.  They are clear loud and don't lose connection.  The tight fitting nubs cancel out noise but its not 100%.  These are great for the gym and stay in my ears.  Highly recommend if you want quality for a  fair price.
4,Sound is great. Love the design. Battery life not so good
2,I gave these a chance. The first pair was defective and the right earbud wouldn't turn on at all. After getting a replacement I was finally able to give them a chance!They fall out of your ears. I can’t even wear them sitting around the house without the left one falling out. The design is awful. Even when you flip them they are so uncomfortable and painful that you can only wear them for 30 minutes at most. The sound quality is okay but nothing too great. The only thing that I like about these were the colors blue and orange. I’ll be returning these and looking outside of Skullcandy as most of their blue tooth earbuds are designed this way. Really disappointed. If you think “oh i’ll have a different experience you won’t. Look at the recent reviews
4,At first I wasn't to sure about the purchase but they're easy to use set up and they're my go to choice when getting wireless earbuds. They lasted me almost a year. I lost them while being careless but if you're careful then you'd have these for a long time.
4,The sound level isn't loud at all.The connectivity is sparse and the battery life is pretty bad also.
4,The earbuds were great quality overall I wear them almost constantly. I have to switch and only wear one at a time to extend the battery life to last all day but for the compact case this is something I am totally willing to do. I will say however that after using these almost constantly my ears do tend to get sore and I would equate this to the feeling of using apples gen 1 wired earbuds. With that in mind they are not particularly comfortable and I think they would be better off with a rubber tip like the Indy earbuds. Over all decent but docked for the discomfort.
4,(Heads up: I have small ears and always have to use the smallest earbud tip in the package)Sound is great the buttons and the case work perfectly (a little plasticy-cheap feeling case but works great for the price) but the plastic ear bud is a bit too big for my ear. I can wear them for about an hour before I need to switch to another pair but I do think that's because of my small ear shape.Other than that they're a great set of earbuds if you need a less expensive pair! If you have normal or bigger ears I don't think you'll have any issue.
5,First I want to start this review by saying I've seen at least 3 other reviews right here on AMZ that say these sound as good if not better than air pod pros. That is utter nonsense! These are no where near the sonic quality of air pod pros not now not ever. What they excel at is value!I primarily bought these to use on my soft phone at work and they are amazing for that for a few reasons. One they pair super easy. Two you can use them independently so if the left one needs a charge just use the right one they both have mics. Three they sound decent enough to peep some youtubez or Spotify while not on the phone or on a Zoom call. There's not much bass but they are very clear sound wise just not a lot of bottom end. I have the medium tips in and they are quite comfy so far.I've only had them for 2 days so I'm sure I can add more to the review later but for the price they're dope. For $2.99 I bought the warranty so no matter what happens I have 3 years worth for $26 bucks. a deal worth paying for.
5,This truly is one of the times where you get what you pay for but in a good way. I don't expect AirPod quality and that's not what I got. The sound is pretty good the battery life is fine as well and the mic quality as far as others have heard me over the phone was just decent. I sounded a bit "far" from the mic according to people but my voice wasn't muffled to them or anything of the kind.Could it be better? For a higher price sure. You definitely get your money's worth.My only complaint (and I knew this before buying) is that I never like padding on my earbuds I like when I just put the earpiece itself into my ear like the AirPod rather than it requiring padding for usage. Outside of that 5/5 for what I got based on the price I paid.
4,I have two pairs now and have no problem switching betwen them.The only small problem is that you have to make sure they connect to the charger.If not one of them will stay connected to the phone and you might not hear the phone ringing.
5,I'm old school so it took me a while to unplug. I was really hesitant at first. I've had many pairs of skull candies throughout the years and they've always been reliable so I decided to continue down the SC line. Sound quality is great along with the noise cancelation. I usually use them for about an hour at a time and don't have to put them on a charger for almost a week. Your use may be more or less but for the price these little guys are pretty great. Cannot shake a stick at the price for sure. They do tend to get a smidge uncomfortable after a while which is like every other pair of headphones. But SC provides three different size silicone sleeves for them. I use the smallest size and they are perfect.**Update - 3/18/22 - Just discovered that these are sweat/water resistant. Had them in for cardio and then into the pool and they hardly moved in my ears and my ears do get sweaty. They aren't like "swim under water and keep them submerged" waterproof but if you keep them above the water while you're swimming it's a damn game changer. So fun.
5,Me encanta el producto se recargan en 30 minutos y su batería dura hasta 5 horas ininterrumpidas; son cómodos puedo salir a trotar con ellos sin preocuparme de que se vayan a caer ya que se ajustan bien a la forma del oído y no molestan
5,Great earphones! They work better than some of the more expensive pairs that I've owned. Good sound quality they reduce background noise quite a bit good mic and they're water resistant. The case charges the earphones pretty quickly compared to others that I've owned. Great purchase especially for the price.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I originally bought these for my dad but then I read the bad reviews (after I bought them like a smart person 😂) and decided not to give them to him until I tried it myself. These are tiny wonderful earbuds. As for the people that said that the sound is "metallic" don't believe it they sound great. The battery life is a little short I've gotten close to 4hrs of non-stop use but for this price that's not bad at all. Especially since it can turn into 6-8 if you use the buds separately. They fit in my ears great which is surprising because I have like really small ears and a daith piercing which causes problems on its own when it comes to earbuds. They're actually super comfy and I LOVE LOVE LOVE the fact that it has a little snap on it when you close them because as shown in my video my Galaxy Buds+ don't have that which is honestly something Samsung should consider doing to their buds given how expensive they are. That part being said if you have butter fingers like me these buds are something you should truly consider. Oh and the bass isn't bad at all.......Let's just say my dad isn't getting this pair. We'll both have a pair because I'm not giving these babies up 😅
4,Ill keep em!
4,Lovely ear buds fun colors nice price.
3,So i want to give props to skull candy for developing these buds for its bottom functions it's nice.But great downfall in the battery life compared to other earbuds within the same budget i get max 2.5 hrs of use out of these lacking in that department.The sound is mediocre at best lacking in depth and is not as loud as I'd like it's a 70% of my iluv earbuds too bad one earbud got damage and i had to get these.Microphone is great on this one as talking on the phone is a breeze with these no need to be talking loud for others to hear you loud and clear. Great positioning of mic.All in all i wish i could give these a greater score after a day's use the battery life and lack of volume/sound quality just won't let these be great.How do i take advantage of my 1 year warranty as these won't ne getting much use due to poor battery life
3,The earbuds look great sound great but do not charge sufficiently or hold a good charge.
3,Good quality and overall performance. Just not as comfortable to wear as other skull candy products I have owned
4,For the price I was shocked. Very good buy. Wish the sound had more range but not bad for what I paid. Battery life is average for the market. 6 hrs of listening to music on a full charge. I would recommend these if you don’t want to shell out serious money for top of the line wireless earbuds
4,I normally wear these when im trying to cancel out noise and just listen to some music. Sadly these earbuds only last a good 3 hours and then they run out of battery wish they lasted longer because they fit so snuggly in my tiny ears and are the only kind that would fit my ears without any bothers or pain.
5,I always wait a month or more i review earbuds to make sure my opinion is correct. For the price they great! I expected maybe a bit more from skull candy I’ve used skullcandy wired headphones before and always loved them.They have lasted battery life is on the low end and they love to fall out but as inexpensive earbuds go these weren’t bad.I recommend them! Thank you
4,Works. It is great for phone calls. The  fidelity in sound reproduction is ok but What do you want for $20
5,🤩
5,Charged them up worked for 5mins then the left one shut off. Tried to charge again and it would even turn on.  Very disappointed
4,I let my headphones completely drained of its battery and I have tried to repair my headphones and they won’t pair up I’ve tried everything nothing has worked. This was my second pair that I have bought my other set is still working. I’m going to ask for a refund
4,fit was not working great for my ears
5,They sounded pretty clear surprisingly but not mind crushing bass just a nice balance type of sound I feel like. They do sound clearer than the jib true wireless earbuds (skullcandy's other earbuds) but the jibs are much more bass heavy and have longer battery so overall these are pretty good but I'd buy the dime 2's cause they seem much more convenient for finding if you lose them cause it is extremely small earbuds and on the Skullcandy app in add devices the dime 2's are on there so??? They might be getting app support but I don't know.
5,There’s nothing to dislike . I the quality of sound is amazing and blocks outside noise really good . I accidentally washed and dried these headphones and they still worked . Shout out to skullcandy these are really good headphones
4,The earbuds sound pretty good for the price you would only notice they aren't top tier when it comes to the bass which is kinda ok compared to a few other earbuds under $50. The earbuds themselves are a very good weight and sit comfortably in my ears without making them feel sore after a while. The one button controls are quite finicky but serviceable. Battery life is very good I use it on my daily commute to work and they last all week long on a single charge of the case. All in all a very good product that I'd easily recommend.
2,they die from a full charge in 2 hours or so. which i guess is fine if you're only using them for short periods.they also have an issue with wanting to stay in the ear. i find myself quite often having to readjust them so they don't fall out. they are pretty heavy and the weight distribution causes them to want to eject themselves from my ear. If you sit still and only wear them for a short period of time then they are fine. otherwise i wouldn't recommend.
5,Great product for the price I would if again if I needed
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             EDIT:I used a different micro USB than the one provided and both buds charged fineI received the Skullcandy dimes today and don't get me wrong the sound quality is great and they are comfortable in my ears but only the left one works. I have charged them and the left bud works perfectly but no matter how long I hold down the button for the right bud it will not turn on. They have good sound quality but I am very disappointed that I only get to hear half of my music :(
5,I used these earbuds day in and day out battery life is decent and noise cancellation is really good and taking into account that this magnificent piece of technology is only 20 dollars you can't go wrong if you're on a budget!
5,I bought these knowing the battery life is shorter than its more expensive counterparts.But for the price these are perfect for my 10 minute and 30 minute breaks at work throughout the week.
4,For what it's worth these are exactly what you pay for. They're smaller size and smaller battery are great for quick trips. They have a lanyard already attached so you can put the on any key ring. The only gripes I have is the charger cord could be longer(but if you're like me you probably already have an adequate length) and the fact that for a recent item it still uses micro USB instead of USB c.
4,I finally decided to try wireless headphones with no interest in the hundreds of dollars for low quality that apple sells. I am very pleased with these. I’ve been a fan of skull candy for years and refuse to change. I think they could have done a bit better with the sound quality but other than that I love these. They block out all the noisy machinery I work with the battery lasts for days the way I use them and they’re not too bulky for me! Can’t really beat it for the price.
4,I like these I only wished they were a bit smaller for my small ears. They looked small in the photos.
3,Man SkullCandy sucks now if you judge them based on these. They are tiny but expect 2 hours battery life max before they die. And they seem to drain battery even in the case. Don’t use it for a week and everything is dead.
4,They fitted my ears and sounded alright. I like the small case. Only down size is the battery life... Comapre to my old Tozo which had battery for 5 hours the Skillcandy lasted for about 2.7 to 3 hours max. Its ok for me since I use it mainly at home. But if i am traveling I would prefer to have longer battery life.
4,They're probably better than what you pay for but still pretty cheap.Pros:Cheaper than replacement (samsung) BudsSound is good connectivity is easyWorks on Bluetooth without appBattery life is pretty goodColor is neat-oCons:Can fall out by moving ears or shaking headButton press while in-ear is uncomfortableAt first they fit naturally in ear but after prolonged use they become noticeable and less comfortable
5,Good quality color makes it easy to find but also easy to scuff and look dirty on button face
5,love these so far.  They sound good simple to insert and stay in place.  excellent charging design - magnetic wizardry almost sucks them into place in the charging case.case indicator(red for charging green for charged) is intuative.
4,works well. sometimes disconnects randomly but hey what can ya do
4,earbuds sound good a little loose fitting in my ears - but that should be expected for this style
5,These are comfortable and everything I could want in a pair of earbuds and they are super small cases unlike AirPods and it has a little sling thing to up on your keys or something they also charge fast and there super light on your ears and it has a good base and audio and they look practical. I had a pair of AirPods and I prefer these because of the rubber tips they fit snug and they won't come off.
5,Battery life could be longer
5,Great earbuds. GREAT price! Sound is fab
3,They stopped holding a charge after 5? months. about on par for skull candy product life of 6 months. Bought a 2nd pair 20$ for 6 months use is acceptable I guess.
4,See above
5,Mi hija le gustó suena bien
5,To be honest this earbuds met my expectations and I love how there's noice cancelling which gets me on my zone just jamming. 👍
4,Best quality for the price range. If youre not gonna spend $100+ you won't beat these.
4,Great ear buds for the price  fits well in the ear . Sound us also not too bad
3,Battery life is really nice theres some noise cancelling but in terms of quality of sound sometimes it skips a few seconds mid song and it really kicks you out of the mood.
5,Lost my IPods so I did a lot of research.  First week using these but so far I am IMPRESSED right out of the gate !!!!  For the $$  again … IMPRESSED !!!!
4,These work great and are so so good for $20 but don’t bother with the colors (get black or grey). This is something I’d made a mental note about with Pastel colored earbuds in the past but I got distracted by the pretty blue and forgot. Because the case exposes part of the earbuds they get dirty in your pocket purse or just with handling if they’re in a key ring/backpack. The light colors will show all of the dirt that stains and doesn’t easily come off when wiped clean. I know they’re clean but they look gross.
5,Muy útil
3,I got these because of the "locate" functionality if you lose them. Too bad it simply plays a sound through the earbud which is pretty worthless if the battery is dead or if you simply don't have superhuman hearing.
5,I’m very impressed with the life of the battery
4,Battery life & sound is good.  They hurt in my small ears.But the included case makes them easy to store & not lose. And cool that you charge them while inside the case.
2,I bought these for extremely long runs and because they claimed to hold a charge for up to 12 hours they seemed like the right ones.  I have continued to try but they hold a 3 hour charge at best.  Sometimes only one earphone works at a time yet they still both go out at usually less than 3 hours.  Since I purchased them a couple of months ago I can no longer return them.  I would not recommend them if you want to be able to use them for several hours at a time.
5,I picked these up as a backup pair. I have to use the right ear bud on my other set so if that one dies I can't use the left one. With these you can just keep switching between left and right while charging the other in the case and it'll last all day.
4,This just me.  After try for couple days..Sound good  fit REALLY WELL. Compare to other Jabra Sony Nakamichi. Yes no ANC but i already know. what i need is just a simple workout earbud. Almost 5 star but only issue during trail running has been disconnected several time. Beside that.  I really like this bud..
4,They seem to run down on battery pretty fast. Also the way the ear part goes in the ear they are sore and hurt after a while. My ears tend to be smaller though.
3,I figure at under $30 these are still a decent buy. I’ve had no issues with the fit using the medium inserts but of course that’s subjective person to person. My only real gripe is that the earbuds have a noticeably weak bass response to the point where everything sounds thin. If it were possible to eq sound on an iPhone it may be better but there’s no option for that.I wasn’t expecting audiophile level quality but the bass response is noticeably weaker than wired iPhone earbuds. If bass is important for your uses I’d suggest looking elsewhere. I won’t return these by any means but I probably won’t recommend them to anyone.
3,Decent but not the best. I mean you get what you pay for. It’s frustrating how you have to manually turn them on and off. You also have to manually connect them to bluetooth sometimes. AirPods do everything I mentioned automatically when you take them out and put them back in the charging case. Sounds quality is really good though👌🏽 Especially if you listen to music with a lot of bass and treble. Also good for phone calls. Clear sound quality. So in the end not as good as AirPods but for a fraction of the price of AirPods not too shabby 👍🏽
4,For the price they are nice enough. My son loves them. They do what they’re supposed to do! (No more music moves etc. playing from phone ore tablet during my movies music etc!)
4,Would give 5 stars if the right bud worked well on phone calls doesnt seem to distort when both buds are used together the left workes perfect. Also I had really expensive Bose buds that did not survive a washer dryer cycle (reason why I purchased these) and i cant believe my wife washed and dried these too (could be my fault for leaving in pockets) but these survived the cycle and are still working fine!!! Would recomend if you not trying to spend $$$.
4,Great Buds... Just one problem tho. The left bud only Charges to 40%. They've been like this since day one. Battery life would be outstanding! If both Buds could hold a 100% charge.Yet! I still can get about 10-12Hrs of use(alternating Buds)
5,Sounds good with the noise isolating fit. Definitely mufflers when people are trying to talk to you or other outside noise. My friend was talking to me and I was yelling "these ear buds are great!" Lol. Battery runs the average drain for the 12hr battery life. The buds fit my ears really well. Fast shipping and good quality for the price. Plus you can't go wrong with Skullcandy. My go to for quality audio with style. Thank you.
3,So I purchased these because I needed a pair for the gym I loved the design of the charging case and saw it had good reviews. I have worn them with different tips but it still hurts after a while. I’m not sure if it is my ear shape or the earbuds but they tend to hurt after wearing them for a few minutes I’ve tried readjusting them but tend to just switch between wearing only one side. The sound quality is decent but not really good at cancelling out all sound.
4,These are good for the price. The only problem is that occasionally they will stop working and I will have to pause and restart what I am listening to.
5,use them on my lunch breaks just clip to my keychain and go
5,Good sound quality. They fit my ears which are hard to fit.
3,Handles playing music well but does not do well with calls. Makes it very difficult for others to hear you.
4,Only thing I didn't like was I thought they were broke because they wouldn't charge but it was because the ports were covered but I didn't know cause it looked like part of the ear bud lol
4,The only complaint I have with these ear bud is they began to hurt my ear where the plastic parts sits on. I have changed the sizes and still not comfortable.. So these are not going to work for me when I need to wear them for a long period of time. Other than that I love the sound quality and battery life. I can walk a good distance from my purse with my phone inside and still have no problems staying connected..
4,Excellent product! Super compact and portable! Perfect as a backup or for the casual listener thats constantly on the go. The keychain case is amazing extremely convenient and useful. Combines the size of the sesh with the stem style of the Indy. Easy to use and set up as well. I would recommend buying 2 because why not?The only downsides are they aren't THAT loud but loud enough... No tile support also battery life is a bit small.I am a huge fan of the design. Super sleek and way cooler than airpods in my opinion. A beefed up version of these that could extend battery life volume and that dont take up too much space would be ideal. (Basically an Indy Sesh Dime combo) But for now these are definitely a solid buy.
5,Est muy practico para usae
5,They are solid. Fits on my keys and are good. I mean they’re no AirPods or nothing close to my Powerbeats 4 but geez these do work. I like that u can use either right or left or both. It’s good cuz in class or working I use one at a time. I like em. Battery could be improved but they’re tiny and 20 dollars. I ain’t complaining! Great work scullcandy
5,Use them for the gymLong lasting batteryNo falling from my earFun fact: remove the white strip from the earphones if not it won't charge battery. I've seen many reviews saying they won't charge I got scared because I "got the same problem". I remove the white strip and VOILA! They charge XD
4,+ Decent quality audio (Had to adjust my Spotify EQ to avoid low end distortion)+ Fitment is exceptional - stem fits inside of ear as opposed to AirPods which hang out+ Battery life is exceptional+ Single bud use is great for long walks and zoom meetings as you can charge one while using another+ Convenient carrying case- If you do not have an EQ on your device you may not be able to adjust to reduce low end distortion- Case is shown the same footprint as a car remote but it is about 2.5X as thick (Still very pocketable)- When worn for a long time (for me) it became uncomfortable as I am between silicone cap sizes.  This is a consistent problem w/ most earbuds.
4,These are really good headphones. Amazing sound quality. Great battery life. My only issue with them is that I struggled to keep them in my ears. I have  relatively small ears so I though switching out the plastics bits would help but unfortunately they did not.TLDR: They would be a perfect pair of buds if I didn't have to push them back in my ear every 2 minutes.
5,As someone who's a little rough and tumble with their electronics these earbuds have excellent durability and the sound quality has in no means diminished over time. The battery life is really good you can go up to 5 days (in my experience) without charging them. All in all this is an amazing product 10/10 would recommend.
5,I bought these as a back-up for my Galaxy Buds and for working out. The sound quality - including bass response - is very good. Battery life is acceptable. It is also very easy to attach to your key chain and always have them with you. Great product!
4,I wish I had booked some other earphones. The noise cancellation is not great also the sound is not so loud and clear so the overall experience is not great.
5,Very simple to use
2,Charged fine very interesting charger cord. But unfortunately only ONE of the buds has sound coming from it & is connecting. I have no issues with the left bud. The right bud isn’t connecting nor will it allow me to hear anything. Lights up like it’s gonna pair but no sound & no connectivity. And yes the buds & case are fully charged.
4,The shorter microphone boom does not work for me. I need the longer one to adjust it in my ear.
5,The sound quality is very good. They are comfortable and the battery life is good. I use them alot without issues.
5,Great for its price :D.
5,I was hesitant with the price but great purchase.. I use them for motorcycle riding they lasted 3 hours I stop eat have a drink and they recharge in the case and lasted another 4 hours for my ride home. I’m not sure of total length for one use.
5,We did get faulty pair that lasted less than week but customer service was fast at replacing them and haven't had no trouble since.
5,I like that I can connect them on my key ring
4,These ear buds are cost effective comfortable and easy to set up. My only rea issue is that they can have issues staying in the ear at times.
5,Second pair I bought . It does the job while for what I need .
4,Got these as a gift for a friend and while I’m not sure of the specs I know that she LOVES them and uses them daily.
3,So I bought these because I'm both a fan of Skull candy brand and in search fora new more comfortable incognito pair of ear buds and this seemed like the move.  Pros that I did find so far is that they have a small tail to them so they're pretty incognito of which I like they have really decent sound quality and clarity and they fit comfortably and perfectly.Cons that i have find so far is that it isn't a recharging case I haven't been able to test the battery life as I've fully charged them stuck them in my pocket expecting them to be fully charged still only to find them extremely low and only last a few minutes.  They weren't on as I had to power them on before use.I will run a test again once they're fully charged again after making sure they're completely of as it might have been the case that they were still on which is why I gave them ⭐⭐⭐instead of the⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐they could have even with the small change of making the case a recharging case even if it costs more money to purchase.
4,They are good for what I need them for. The sound quality is not perfect and they seem to die fast but they are OKAY.
4,They’re ok.  I have small ears so the buds constantly fall out while I’m working out.  Even with the smallest buds in.  They don’t really cancel the noise and they’re tricky to connect to your devices.
4,Great headphones for the money. Although if you’re going to be using these a lot and listening for long periods of time spend the extra and get a more comfortable pair.
3,It said the charge could hold up to eight hours and it did not do only like 4 hours.
5,I'm simple so it charged I took the buds out they paired to each other no problem then they connected to my phone no problem and the played music with no problem that's all I wanted I didn't need a life changing experience I wanted cheap buds that worked and mission accomplished I also shook my head a lot and no fall out definite plus
2,The first thing I noticed which is out of the ordinary for skull candy is the poor volume and the mediocre sound quality. After trying all the various attachments to make them stay in my ears. They still fall out constantly. I bought these because they were cheap so it wouldn't bother me if I lost them. There is no tracking for them. So you have to physically hunt for them if you can't find them. They are slightly less than ok.
2,As a skull candy lover I am disappointed. I’ve used skull candy for so many years. I recently lost my AirPods so I opted for these EarPods. I was expecting so much more but I was faced with discomfort horrible sound quality and 3 hour battery life. I will be keeping them since they were only 20 bucks. But I will soon be repurchasing another set of AirPods.
5,Very good product
3,These are my favorite Bluetooth earbuds for comfort sound quality and affordability but this is my 4th set and ALL FOUR SETS have had issues with charging the right earbud. They magnetically snap into place so they SHOULD automatically align no issues but the right one has to be fidgeted with constantly to get it to charge and then only keeps charging for seconds or minutes at best before I have to fuss with it again to get the little red charging light to come back on. I’ll have them charging overnight put the right one in my ear and have it give me an immediate low battery warning if it comes on at all. I’m not returning them because I lost the charging case for my last set and now I have two left earbuds to swap out as they die so I’ll make it work but I’m definitely not buying these again despite the price.
4,I was a bit skeptical about the sizing of these earbuds they did fall out when I first tried them on. I later realized you have to twist them a bit into place for them to stay in your ears. They also come with different sized buds to fit your ear. The sound quality amazing noise cancelation is amazing as well. I just got them today so I can't say much about the battery life yet. But everything else is just perfect. I just ordered a second pair for my younger sister.
3,I have been a big fan of Skull Candy earphones for years.  I’ve got several wired and a couple of wireless that I’ve worn out so I thought the quality of these would equal my past experiences.  They do not.  The battery life for the charger and the actual headphones is not as long as other wireless headphones given to me recently. The headphones only last a couple  of hours and the charger box has to be recharged every couple of days when others last a couple of weeks.  Also after a little while of wearing they become uncomfortable in my ears but I’m not sure if that’s my own anatomy or design. Would not buy again.
4,Right side only works left can't connect no matter what methods I used. Can play for about 2-3 hours and battery goes low. Other than that it's alright.(Edit: I made an exchange and now the left side works!)
5,I love them easy to where the sound is loud works perfectly on an iPhone 11 thank you
5,I've bought several modles of Skullcandies True wireless ear buds and these for the price are the absolute best. Compared to the Vinles or the Evo sesh these have more base and fit more snuggley. For whatever reason these seem to have a natural noise canceling effect that feels almost comparable to their ANC model (at least when music is playing) I'm not sure about the mic but for music these are amazing. Only issue is the battery doesn't last super long. 2 maybe 3 hours with a full charge before you have to put them away for a bit.
4,I already had a part of buds from Jlab which I liked but wanted an extra pair and honestly I like these better. Sound is great on par with the others they fit better without falling out and connect flawlessly. Battery life so far is good I haven't used them for more than maybe 1.5 hours at a time. The only minor issue so far is a couple days they have just stopped playing music for no reason and Ive had to manually start playing the music again but that's not a BIG issue at least not yet. Very good for the cheap cheap price and I might even buy a few for family members:)
4,Well the noise canceling is great it feels like you've got plugs in your ears the battery life is ok for what I slide them for just the bus ride to school and back and the noise quality aint have bad either  but the reason I wanted to write the review was because oddly enough it seems the left bud is louder than the right one and it is very noticeable I tried to focus on the music and forget about it but that's a bit hard when the music doesn't even sound right don't get me wrong their wonderful and for the price it's great but when you build a product around audio I feel you shouldn't have this problem
4,They fit decent built pretty nice. But they're pretty quiet comparing them to bonus free ones i got from my Snap-on dealer. I was sure these would exceed something that was free. The battery life is sorta weak you aren't gotta like them if you enjoy deafening music. But they do the job. Definitely worth the 20$ or whatever i paid for em.
4,They were good but getting them paired was a little difficult
2,The sound quality is great and the battery lasts a long time but the left earbud is much quieter than the right one. I have to turn the volume up to the max just to hear my music from the left earbud.
4,Would recommend this product.
5,I love the convenience of these things. The battery life and connection to my phone are great. And I love the ability to find them if I miss place them with the “Tile” app!
2,I bought two sets of these used them while working around the house and on my vehicles. Loved them at first with the exception of them cutting out when my phone was in my back pocket. The problem could also be with the phone.They work as advertised about 3 hours. You can continue using them all day if one is used and the other is charging. Sound quality is there and the case is nice.Why the two star review?  Both headsets lasted no more than 2 months before the battery case failed to charge  properly using the supplied charger. The headphones had a nasty habit of turning on while in the charging case and not charging regardless of whether both pieces were in the case. I know because my phone would randomly connect to them from the other room when they were supposed to be charging. These issues made them a 2 month disposable. For the price youd be better off going with JBL.
5,Good quality of audio and battery (according to the price) they connected easy to my iphone a little delay or manual setting to send automatically the call through bluetooth.Remember it is a button to use the functions you need to press it there's no sensor.
5,Not the best sound quality but what would you expect. These are great for running and times when they might get damaged or lost. Exactly what I was looking for
5,These ear buds are GREAT. I bought them for myself but I would up gifting them to a student because my ear openings are just too small for these to fit comfortably. Regardless of the tips I tried. They hold a charge really well and my student says the sound quality is GREAT! Definitely worth a purchase!
5,Muy buen sonido. Se pueden usar independientes
1,Caveat emptor! Buyer beware!I purchased 2 pairs of these -one for me and one for my son.All seemed fine until a couple of months later when the ear buds would turn on when in the charging case. Issue appears to be poor connection between the case and earbuds.  Results are (1) earbud in case intermittently turns on and off in case (2) often times case is flat due to constant battery drain and (3) phone calls send audio to earbud in case - which of course I don’t know until I look at my phone and see I’m connected to an earbud that should be turned off and charging.Amazon wasted hours of my time only to say I was outside return period (I was just seeking a solution and customer support but given Amazon CS didn’t have a clue I expected a refund). Amazon referred me to Skull Candy CS in … Ireland. Skull Candy didn’t and wouldn’t help me either.Now my sons earbuds are also turning on in charging case.I compared the charging case contacts to those of a competitor and immediately noticed the Dime charging case contact pins have no appreciable spring tension. I think the poorly designed case coupled with poorly designed charging pins is a by design recipe for failure.My advice if you want to try these is buy them from a local store that can provide support if yours turn out to be duds like ours. At least then you can deal with a human instead of Amazon’s horrible system for raising a CS ticket.I’ve posted a picture to show the fault in action. The earbud shown on the left is firmly placed in the charging case and yet is not charging and is connected to my phone.  Closing the case lid sometimes helps but I find it’s better to keep it open so I can see if either bus is connected or not when it should be off and charging in case.  Second picture shows charging case snapped shut. My phone is still connected as shown by the third picture.
4,The quality is great but my ears are small and these don’t fit/ stay in my ear especially my left ear. However the sound quality is great. Will be looking at ones that go over the ear instead. I still love skull candy
3,I checked CR for good ratting with the earbuds Unfortunately I was wrong this time to follow it's recommendation.Pro: price nice design overall clear voice.Cons: MONO level sound quality  good for talk but not for music...
5,Battery life is great for the sizeIf you don't want any other sound but the music you can position them. But you can also position them to allow minimal to most outside sounds to come through.Controls on headphones haven't been accidentally triggered under a helmet or baklava. Snug fit in multiple positions. Case is so small almost forget about it even being attached. Sweet product.Addition 12-13-21Have had trouble with the headphones turning on inside the charging case and not charging. After adjusting the headphones inside the case it functions and charges but sometimes after closing the case they will reactivate and connect... Still with this they are still worth it.
5,I use these with my computer.  When used with my iPhone the lowest volume is still a little loud for me.  You certainly can't go wrong for the price.  My other headphones were four times the cost.  They are not worth the added cost.
5,Battery doesn’t last long but I like to use these in the gym. I like the small compact size and Sound is decent.  I tried a lot of ear phones and haven’t found one to fit perfect in my small ears.  But for $20 I don’t care if I lose these.  I would gladly buy these again if needed.
3,Battery life is as advertised. My issue is the fit in the ear. Takes a bit of consistent twisting and light pushing to get to a place where it feels secure.
2,These are my first wireless earbuds. I was hoping to really love them but that was not the case. These make my ipad freeze constantly so frustrating.  If I switch to my wired earbuds it stops freezing.  They work fine for podcasts but if you try to watch anything they are terrible.
4,Gracias
5,Didn’t have a dislike on these love them
4,Great sound. Had to change out silicome cups to fit correctly. I use these at work all day. But I'm hadcuffed to use one at a time due to battery life. When one dies I switch to the other. I listen to podcast most of the time. So can't vouch for bass. But great clarity compared to my retired Soundpeats+. Nice and small overall i like the case and the buds themselves. Skullcandy makes good stuff. Haven't been disappointed yet.
4,Gor for wife and they are great bit the battery life is short so best to upgrade to the better skull candy ranked pods.
3,These die within a few hours and are not very comfortable
3,The battery life isn’t that long for use
5,awesome
3,Fitment and sound quality are great. But battery life is terrible.  I tend to only wear one while I'm working and it died within 3 hours.
5,So I've had this product for around a week and have used them consistently everyday. I work from home and listen to a lot of podcasts the audio quality Is good not amazing they get decently loud and the passive noise isolation is pretty great for a pair of this size and price I do have fairly small ears to the body of the buds themselves do hurt a bit but the extra tips do help. Overall I think its a great pick up for the gym or quick daily use the battery gives me a solid 3 hours before having to drop them into the case to charge but its not bad. If you're looking for better battery life I'd recommend the Jib True's but I am happy with the purchase
3,I have had many wireless buds and never had a pair that hurt like these do.  They push against my ear in an odd way.
4,Charges fast and holds a charge when inactive.
5,Love these ear buds. Not only do they fit comfortably but they are very water resistant. I've washed the ear piece by itself and the whole unit also. It's been washed 2x and still works and sounds great! I go thru more ear buds than anyone I know and these are by far the best!
4,Not wonderful sound but satisfactory. Fits well in ear and very good value
3,The sound on these is very good the battery life is okay but the shape is not small ear friendly. The mid size rubber pieces don’t quite work for me but when I size down the hard plastic of the earbud is too close and makes a secure fit pretty impossible. I even tried sizing up to the large and it obviously did not fit my ears. So if you have small ears be ready to have an awkward fit. It’s a disappointment for me for sure.
5,Theses ear buds work great! They didn't even budge in my ears whole dancing like a crazy lady 🤣. They cancel noise and sound great. They also charged up pretty fast for the first time. Worth the money. :)
4,Good for walking controls are little hard to use but they work well and the amount of battery left is hard to figure out as the buds show red when you put them back in the case.
4,They an excellent product over all they are built with quality Workmanship and work as the description says.
5,I like these earbuds. They are comfortable to wear. Good product for price.
2,The buds sound good and they're comfortable in your ear. They stay in your ear well and that's where the benefits stop. The button is difficult to press if you have cold hands or gloves forget hitting the button. The battery life for the case is pathetic. You have to charge the case everyday if you use these regularly. The buds themselves last about 2.5hrs on lower volume.
5,Yeah for the price they are beyond expectations. The sound is really great. The passive noise cancellation is really good. Probably too good for me. I really cant here anything around me even if there not playing which makes me a little paranoid with them in that im about to run into something. They sound great tho i listen to hip hop and rap and they are great. For the price these buds are the best on the market for certain at their price point
5,Amazing sound quality just wish they had a bit more battery life.
3,The colour of the product is not as expected... deceivedBland Orange not Golden
2,I have only had the skull candy headphones for a few weeks. Fully charged them before use. Used them 1 time for about an hour. A few days later when to use them again and they were dead along with the charging case. Very limited battery life. Not even close to what was advertised. I am going to try them again this week but if they don't live up to advertised battery life I will likely return them.
5,Muy buen sonido
3,Coming from gen 1 AirPods the sound quality was a significant let down but you can’t expect much from a $25 pair of earphones.No range on the drivers just flat sound.Probably great for audiobooks and podcasts but not for musicYMMV but these did not fit well in my ears.
3,Very Basic functions sound is good low battery life... They are much sturdier than expected! I love skullcandy products overall. Always above expectation
5,Absolutely love these pods.I tried several others til I found these. I will never buy anything else but skullcandy.Price and function make it a no Brainer.Not touch pause it actually has a push button to pause if someone is speaking to me. Every other one was a super pain.These things rock. I'm a window cleaner  on a ladder so throw one side in and listen to a podcast or music while working.  Makes my days 100x better. Never had one go dead.
5,The 5-star rating considers the price I paid. The sound is plenty good enough as a spare / backup pair of earbuds to throw in my suitcase when travelling etc. The case is compact and charges the buds reliably. The buds paired with my iPhone exactly as the instructions said they would and reconnect reliably. Very happy with my purchase.
4,Quality product
5,I am really hard on all my stuff and these are the first wireless earbud to hold up. I've used wired earbuds for a while after ruining 5 different kinds of Bluetooth earbuds. I saw these and decided to give Bluetooth a last try and now these are all I use. I weld almost every day and hunt every opportunity i get and these hold up perfectly.
5,I was skeptical having owned Bose Monster and Beats headphone as well as AirPods. The sound - is good not HD but it’s good for the purpose and price. Size and fit are great low profile snug and doesn’t feel like gonna come out and lose them. Noise cancellation is decent sound is kind of like wearing foam ear plugs but not the foam feel .. if you know what I mean. Carry case is great small compact. The battery life hasn’t been an issue so far but only about a month in on use.All in all I think they are a pretty good pair of wireless headphones and for the price…wow such a bargain. Don’t think you would be disappointed in buying these just don’t expect sound clarity l
4,Battery life doesn't last more then 2 hours at best after less than a month.
3,Overall they work well function how they should and sound nice! Though (and im not sure if this is just me) but these earbuds may be the most uncomfortable ones ive ever worn. Ive tried the different sized rubber things provided with the headphones but no matter what size i use these earbuds become incredibly painful to wear for longer and 30 to 40 minutes.
3,Even with smallest ear piece still too large for my ears
5,I have an older version of true wireless earbuds but the left one requires the right to connect to the music player. Both of these earpieces will work independently. I think they’re great!
4,Battery dies fast.
5,These sound great. However they have less battery life than my phone. If you charge these every other night that'll be no problem. There are also basically no features. But the price and sound quality is so spectacular that it makes up for everything else.
5,They're not trying to be knock offs of anything so they aren't horrible quality it's skullcandy so the sound is good for such a small package makes it easy to put on keys or something similar too and when the case dies they don't automatically turn on and connect to your phone which is really nice
2,was bluetooth'n sound from my samsung phone. charged these up in the morning and took them out that evening to run. had phone in front leg under garment spandex pocket. went running and noticed the sound cut out when i turned my head to the left. then later it cut out all together. its not the batteries. sound quality isnt that great they dont fit tight in the ear enough to cancel anything but i should have cancelled my order.
3,The sound is pretty good and the noise cancellation but it doesn't work well for calls when you're in exteriors
5,They look just like the picture. Blue tooth is great
4,Son buenos en sonido y aislan bien el ruidos pero se ensucian rapido y son dificiles de limpiar aparte en momentos se caen del oido y prove todas las almohadillas. Son comodos al bolsillo y la carga es rapida y duradera los he provado con mi galaxy s20 y nintendo swich y sin provlemas en los dos dispositivos.
5,They have good sound quality and the grandson is enjoying them. Hold a charge decently and for the price I'd say they're worth it.
3,Looks great love the black connected easy and sounded great. Left earbud kept popping out I changed out the plastic ear buds and fell out every time. Decided to return them when one almost fell into the toilet while getting up bc it popped out for 20th time.
3,These earbuds honestly fell flat for me. The depth of sound loudness and reproduction are laughable. I wanted earbuds to rival my AirPods that I didn’t have to swap between my laptop and phone one for each. These are markedly worse than AirPods in almost every way. I guess I’ll keep my AirPods spared to both.
5,I started with them then I bought them for my daughters for school. They had both tried mine and liked the fit and the compact charging case. Will last all day for a student for sure. I have never tested the straight listening time. 100% approve !
4,got these for a friend of mine and he was thrilled that the sound quality was so good however when he's using these calling me its very hard to hear him. the mic is pretty bad but I'm still giving it 4 stars since the sound quality and noise cancellation was worth it for the price.
4,Great little buds compact sound connects to everything. Holds a charge for a while.
3,Good value. The price point makes it easy to settle on but there are some issues with it cutting in and out.
4,They keep falling even with different attachments
4,To me it had a good quality if you just want to listen to music only. However I doesn't work too well with voice calls a lot of times the receiver complains about hearing me either I'm breaking up hearing an echo or just distorted.
3,Decent sound for the money.Blutooth easy too use.
4,These earbuds work very well. There were slightly uncomfortable at first but not terrible. They can fall out though.
2,I purchased these ear buds because i have had several Skull Candy earbuds that have really been a good deal and lasted 1 year plus but these earbuds are sub par. the battery life is about 1.5 hours when it does charge I have charged it several times and it only charges 25% the left bud doesnt always connect. the earbud charging base last about 2 charges then needs to be recharged. More than anything and i am disappointed. I did give 2 stars due to the sound quality and noise cancelation properties. But the battery life and charging capabilities over shadow any good qualities and leave lots to be desired.Ultimately i regret purchasing these.
4,Use them everyday at school work and for outdoor recreational. Good price point for amazing set of ear buds 👌👍
5,Case is a little bit of a pain to open. Otherwise enjoy the ear buds and am happy with them.
4,The sound is great and they’re comfortable on my ears
3,Prefer my Indys.  These are small but battery in earpiece and case are short lived.  Good for a walk or run but not for longer listens.  Also seem to pop out of ear more easily than other SkullCandy products.
2,I liked these for thr price. They work ok but charging seems to be an issue. No matter what they only seem to be at 10%.  The battery doesn't last long at all.  Also I am always having to put them back in.  I couldn't work out or be active un them if I tried.  I do like the color and sound quality and noise cancelation works well.
2,These are priced okay but it's Skullcandy so it's always going to be a toss up. But had some success with the wired ones so I figured why not? They sound okay. BUT THEY DON'T STAY IN. AT ALL. I put them in and immediately they started sliding out. I was sitting down working on my laptop not running not walking. Sitting. And they slid out of my ear. I tried every size silicone tip all slid out. I had to put my old Samsung buds tips on the left one just to keep it in my ear. I'm currently wearing these JLab GoAirPop and my god day and night. I can walk around the house! And they don't fall out! Get the JLab and forget the Skullcandy. I also don't like that the earbud stems are felt on the top of the case because of the cut outs. Odd. But yeah get the JLab earbuds. Cost the same better quality.
5,Cuentan con una buena distancia de conexión y poca latencia (retraso) en el sonido la calidad de los materiales son aceptables teniendo en cuenta su valor y son fáciles de transportar gracias a su reducido tamaño se ajustan bastante bien a la oreja así que no se tendría problema si se requieren para hacer ejercicio. Serian perfectos si tuvieran un poco mas de calidad de sonido y si su puerto de carga fuera tipo c pero igual se perdona por lo económicos que son.
5,These earbuds definitely do the job. I use them when I workout in the gym so I don't hear everything else around me. The battery life may be a little suspect but I attribute that more on user error and not plugging them in after I use them.
4,Los auriculares suenan bien pero el volumen es muy bajo.
3,For the low price the sound quality is acceptable (not very good but not terrible). The main problem is that I cannot seem to make them stay in my ears. These would be good for sitting more or less still like listening to a podcast at your desk; or on a plane. I'm not even really running in them; mostly elliptical and circuit training. I've tried all three sizes of rubber tips that came with; they keep falling out. Going to return them.
5,Me agrado el diseño y la calidad del producto lo utilizo para hacer deporte y en la oficina
3,I got these because my son has two pairs and he says he likes them but I am not happy with the sound quality and will be looking into another brand.
5,These pair of wireless earbuds have physical lasted longer than most other similar products I have purchased. The noise cancellation is amazing and the sound I receive from this product is of good quality.
1,Either mine were defective or Skull Candy is grossly overestimating the battery life on these earbuds. Historically the battery on mine has only ever lasted a maximum of an hour even after charging for 24+ hrs. But more recently the battery only lasts about a half hour. Complete garbage.Other complaints: The USB chord for charging for charging is only about three inches long which is fairly impractical. Also I'd prefer it the LED indicator was inside the case rather than the outside. My room is lit up like a Christmas tree at night with so many LEDS glowing from all my electronics. Lastly for some strange reason these earbuds tend to have moisture on them when taking them out of the case after charging them for a while. No idea what the moisture is or what causes it but it's almost always there when I take the earbuds out.
3,They work ok. But I use earbuds everyday at work and they do not have a very good battery life...charging them fully and they only last a few hours. I try and swap them out individually to charge and it still doesn't matter.
4,These are some great earbuds for the price.  The fit is decent and the case is the size of a key fob.  They have a reasonably flat response.  Low end is ok I don't think it will wow you.  Battery life is ok as well.  They are my go to pair for a quick listen to tunes phone call or watching videos.  Probably won't knock you off your feet but the size fit and packaging is great!  Really easy to tuck in your pocket purse or keyring for an impromptu set of earbuds.  For the price you can't beat them.
5,I didn’t dislike anything about the product
3,Hurt my ears seconds after putting them in gave them to my mom and she loves them
5,Work great battery life is good I stager them well using at work. So I use them one at a time. Thay last all day 12h shift.  For the $ thay are great.  Way better than the off brands you pay the same price for. 💯
4,They dont stay charged very long but they do work well enough
5,I think it is a great product. I do not think they are really good a noise cancelling but this may also be a little bit of an issue with the low max volume level on my aged phone that I have.
4,Great product at the price range. Lightweight and quite easy to use. I know I am being nitpicky but a usb-c charger instead of micro USB would've been the chefs kiss.Good sound quality and good battery life. Noise cancelation is 'meh'.Would highly recommend for tight budget shoppers.
3,I wore them exactly once and one fell out and I never did find it. Usually I love Skull Candy products but this was a total miss!
5,Feel fantastic in my ears never fall out and they don't look awkward
5,IM SHOOK
5,I use these whenever I want to listen to music or audio books and I don't want to bother anyone or if I'm working in the yard. These are comfortable to wear for several hours and no issues with the batter life. Sounds great and blocks out outside noise.  The sound quality on phone calls is also very good. Definitely worth the price.
3,Blocks out alot and the sound is good
3,I wanted some earbuds just for the gym. I wasn't looking for anything too flashy and $20 is a bargain. I used them once & right away I could tell how poor the sound quality was. They aren't noice cancellation headphones btw. It's difficult to push the buttons on the earbud. I needed up returning them. I bought some great headphones for about $100. See it as an investment!
2,Out of the box the left one does not work. Yes I charged them fully before first use. The right one does work but it’s pretty quiet. Not a high volume ear bud but what can you expect for $20. I prolly won’t use them. I bought them for work but now I think I’ll give them away. The atmosphere im in I doubt I’ll be able to hear them.
4,Bought these after reading a review and man they were right! Great quality good weight. They are comfortable the sound quality is better than some $100 dollar pairs that I have had. The noise cancelling can raise the volume rather quickly and uncomfortably but okay. The biggest 2 cons would be the function of paring (just a little un-intuitive) and battery life (2.5 hrs in the ear) They say 8 hours but that's with the case fully charged. For the price though they are a steal!
5,I have always been a fan of skull candy and these little guys are no exception.  HOLY BASS!!!
5,Accident washed them in a load of laundry. Let them fully dry before charging and using again and they’re still as good as ever
5,I bought these because I have used skull candy headphones in the past. These paired easily and the battery life is good. High quality product at a very affordable price!
4,First of all the cost... ~$20.  Very inexpensive.They fit great and don't fall out.  This has been an issue with all other bluetooth headphones I've tried in the past.The sound is good.  They charge fast.  Will have to time battery life sometime.  Am using 1 at a time and when battery low message plays I use the other one.Packaging & case also nice and include keychain connection.They also sync automatically which is very cool.
5,I listen to a lot of audiobooks especially at night. I have some weird shaped awful ears that almost no earbuds fit comfortably. I have tried 10+ earbuds that were supposed to fit small ears and none of them worked. I have a small ear canal and I have a small outer ear. But these fit and don't hurt my ears! The sound quality is fine you can use both or either one at a time. I fall asleep with these in my ears and I can wake up the next day with no pain. The only thing I can see someone complaining about these is they don't fit tightly. If I really shake my head they could fall out. But the main thing is they are comfortable for someone with small ears.
3,They are very easy to connect to a phone and they are comfortable. I've always looked to Skullcandy for affordable good-quality headphones. These are a disappointment. I worked and worked with my equalizer and could never get a good sound. It was very flat and almost no bass. It was like something you'd get from the dollar store except maybe more comfortable.
5,Do they compare to $200-300 buds? No. But for being $30 these are phenomal. I wanted a cheap pair for work(painting) and was impressed by the quality.
5,I love these ear buds! I bought them to try them when working out at the gym. I had wired earbuds they kept getting in the way.
5,I purchased a pair for me and my wife and we both love using them from listening to music and videos to phone conversations. Great price and good quality.
3,Battery life is low. About 2-2.5 hours of nonstop use. I use 1 ear bud while at work and have to switch out twice in a day. Left one then right one and then left again in an 8 hour period. Voice call quality isn't the best either. They also fall out of my ears constantly. I've had another pair that were a 4 dollars more and they lasted a lot longer.
3,Like that they don't hurt my ears dislike don't stay in to good
4,Honestly I was expecting broken earbuds that had static but these are perfect for $25. They are a little uncomfortable on my ears for long periods of time and the battery lasts around 4 hours but otherwise they are just as good as any airpods I've ever borrowed. If you're looking for decent earbuds to wear while working a couple times a day I definitely recommend these.
4,
3,Make sure you take little stickers off charging points on earbuds. They aren't that noticeable and there is nothing letting you know to do so unless you scan the qr  code for additional troubleshooting. Sound is decent...though there is little bass. Monsters I had previously had much better sound but were 80 bucks and died after a year.
5,My wife is super critical of darn near everything and if something so wrong with these she would have told me.  The only thing she did say is for someone with little ears they don't fit well and sometimes fall out.But sound wise and everything else she seems like with.
5,Works great long lasting cancels noise
3,Battery life is very short. Buds go dead in about hour and a half. Have to put back in case for re-charge.
4,Im a pretty small person 4'11" but i was still expecting them to stay in. They come lose and when they do that there is zero noise cancellation. the sound quality is slightly worse than a pair of apple wired earbuds but my ears werent bleeding and they are comfortable to wear for a long time.
4,Not going to blow your hair back but is a great option for the price.
5,These things are great I really did not expect much for 20 dollars. It's my first pair of skull candy earbuds and if the cheapest ones are this good I will buy others for sure. Sound is great size. For just being around they work great dont fall out BUT NOT GOOD AT ALL FOR EXERCISE THEY WILL FLY OUT. That's the only bad side get others for running
5,I use these for my zoom meetings training sessions listening to music or watching videos. Easy to use. Although sometimes my coworkers don't realize I have them in when listening to training sessions for work. That's also good listening to music at work and walking away from my desk without the pull of a cord. Battery life seems good but I have not tested it. I don't have them in all day but they seem to last.
4,They work just fine but to turn them on/off it's sometimes difficult.
5,Good sound quality and great battery life.
4,Works great. Even after being washed by your wife
4,These earbuds fit well stay snug and have a great sound.My only complaint is I don't find the battery to last long.
5,I always loved skullcandy head phones even before wireless but these headphones are wayy better than any wireless headphones I've ever had
3,Battery life
5,I love skull candy everything about it is jus awesome.
2,The noise is so quiet and I can’t keep them in my ears to save my life. Battery life is insanely low.
5,Really great for the price! they're super good at cancelling noise you can't hear people around you and others can't hear the sound even on full blast. The only downside is I kept loosing these because they fell out sometimes but that's likely a me problem. the sound quality is amazing for the price and the battery lasts a good 2-7 hours depending on how long you charge them for. id pick these over airpods any day !
5,Small enough to carry in my pocket. No complaints on the sound quality. I love how fast they charge in the case. They are more comfortable for me if I wear them upside down (right earbud in my left ear left earbud in my right ear).
5,These little buds are great for easy listening.These buds have buttons that click and are not prone to accidental touches changing your settings.Battery life is about 3 or 4 hours or so depending on volume and the case charges them several  times for up to around 12 hours.I dont sweat much and haven't dropped them in any water so I can't speak to that except to say they are advertised being ipx4.They sit in my ear canals snugly and don't feel like they are going to fall out if I turn my head suddenly like so many others do.All in all a nice no frills option!
5,These replaced my 4 year old set of buds by Skullcandy. I have had very good lifespan on all the products wired or wireless/bluetooth.Pros-The range is better than the prior and more expensive models. The sound is very clear from Classical Electric Rock and on calls. I have used these in Teams (Microsoft Teams) meetings and on calls. I have not had any complaints on hearing me.Cons - After a while they can hurt the ear canal. They can pop out of the ear if your smile moves your ears as mine does. I have had the left side fall out when Laughing really hard.Note - I have not run or done anything robust with them save some packaging and stairs (not running)Thank you -
3,Can't  hear on a call. Media hear ok. Best thing  I'd battery life. Not much good if you can't  hear.
4,not that good for taking calls but it works as wireless headphones!
5,Omg for the price and the size these are great. Small Enough to hook to a keychain or gym bag. The sound is pretty good. They sync as soon as you take them out of the box. Honestly the size is what I love most. I have small ears and all other earbuds I have tried have been a waste. They just don't stay in my ears. These do stay in. Pictured next to my mouse to show you the size comparison in the case and next to some change for the actual earbuds.
4,The sound quality is really good for $20 I was impressed when I first tired them on. I have had them for abt two months now and they do indeed have good battery life. Noise cancellation was ok but for $20 this is probably the best you can get.
5,She wanted AirPods and I felt those are too expensive for a little girl who is hard on items and loses things a lot! Lol She also wanted them to be green which AirPods aren’t so I found these and she loves them!! They fit her ears sound great and they hold a charge! Great introduction into the world of wireless earbuds
5,Use them every day at the gym. Reliable and work! Stay in my ear well.
2,I’m a little disappointed with this product. I’ve only had it for 3 months and the right headphone keeps shutting off for no reason.
5,Eficientes y económicos
3,Noice cancellation is not great at all. It’s an ok earbuds if you have great hearing. But if you’re trying to block out noice this here is not you.
3,The battery life is pretty disappointing. Plus for some reason I can't understand the earbuds don't become active immediately.
5,The reason I love skullcandy is the price too prefect for the insane quality these are made! They knocked out of the park with these ones! Gonna buy a second one soon!
5,Good price good quality good sound.  Bad battery life.  Maybe lasts an hour nowadays.  I really like them but the short battery life limits their usefulness.
5,I was considering some other high-$$$ options but then decided to give this a try. I am very happy that I got this... I have used the high-end earbuds and for 1/10th of the price this dime does a great job. Definitely recommended!
3,Not that loud but they will get the job done the battery life is actually good
3,Battery life is my only complaint
4,Purchased these for work. They are discreet and not bulky. Good at low and high volumes.  Better bass when louder. But good enough just to enjoy my time at work.  This is all subjective to my experience with this product.  Would buy again for this price range.
5,By boyfriend LOVES these ear buds. I did a little research and ordered them for Christmas. He says they work perfect! He is outside at the plant he works at A LOT and these have been amazing!
5,I use these buds intermittently throughout the day for conference calls music a video.  They are perfect for this.The earpieces activate when I take them out of their cradle which is small and fits well in my pocket.  When I'm done listening I just put them back and self deactivate and begin recharging.  When I notice that the ear buds either don't automatically activate or deactivate in the cradle then I know it's time to recharge the cradle.Can't beat these for the money (for the casual listener).
4,I love this product. Great price. It is not the best material but I think for what you get is very good.Great sound excellent noise cancellation.The material is not so great and the case also.
5,It has faster feedback than any other products that have more than double price. Longer battery life for sure as well. Once you have it installed you will be all free from connectivity problems and battery life. I can say that because I have tried more than three other products that are much more expensive. I just want to mention that I usually don't leave any review but I am buying a LOT of products from Amazon. This product makes me leave a review. IT IS THE ONE YOU WANT!
5,Lightweight comfortable fit clear sound. Noise canceling is a little lax but overall good quality at a good price. Would buy again.
5,I think these are the greatest bang for your buck!
4,I’ve always used skull candy headphones preferably the inkd. These aren’t as comfortable but for the same price wireless headphones it’s nice to have a pair! I will also say the sound quality FOR 20 BUCKS IS PHENOMENAL. You could waste money on other headphones for 20 bucks but these are great for what they are. It’s funny skull candy has improved with their Bluetooth headphones the cheaper they go! Highly recommend!!
5,Batteries die quickly (2.5 hours). Charge fast (50 minutes). I like them. Don't wear them in the bathroom  they might drop in the lue.
4,I used these everyday. Only time I have an issue is when I’m on a call. The people on the other end have trouble hearing me.
3,Kinda disappointed with the sound it's just ok...
4,Good headphones for the price I got them at. Battery life is lacking but that may just be my own preference. Good quality.
2,These ear buds are junk! Won’t charge after a month. And when amazingly they do charge they run out of juice after about 30 minutes. I bought 2 pairs on prime day and they both do it. Don’t waste your money
5,I loves these because you can't hear people and I really like bass and these actually have a lot of bass and I was really hoping they could handle the washer and dryer when I accidentally left it in my jacket and it still works fine and yes the case does to
3,Para empezar a usarlos tienes que apretar por cuatro segundos cada audifono y igual para apagarlos tienes que apretar cada audifono 4 segundos la caja no marca cuanta pila tiene asi que los puedes poner en el estuche pensando que estan cargando cuando en realidad no lo estan
3,Acabados básicos la batería se agota sin uso muy rápidamente toca ponerlos a cargar constantemente; el sonido es muy bajo a pesar de usar todo el volumen.
5,These work out so well for listening to music while walking.
5,Sound awesome they let me be in my own little world and the batteries have been holding up great!!!
2,I tried to link it with multiple devises but not able to discover it.
4,The sound quality is nice crisp clean sound throw in your pocket standby charge time over 18 hours play time over 8 hours would rate 5 stars if the bass was better the earbuds are super comfortable and secure fit
3,These are ok for basic use.Battery life isn't great and lack of controls from the ear buds themselves are the reasons for 3 stars.
4,I'm not sure there is a better pair for $20 reputable brand and work well. Sound quality is about what you'd expect just wish battery life was a little better.
4,Sound and call quality is adequate for $20.  I have them to my daughter as standby pocketable earbuds to use quickly when on the go.
4,These are good headphones for the price  I've been using them for about 3 months now.I give 4 stars because the left one has become a little quiet..it still plays but the right one is louder. I'm sure this is covered via warranty.
5,You get what you paid for. These aren’t the newest beats or Apple headphones. But for the price these little buds pack a punch. They’re perfect for work and for the gym. Great buy!
2,I'm disappointed because apparently there is an app that is required to use these but I have no idea what app that is so they are useless.
5,I saw some negative reviews about batter life and all that. But these have way outperformed those reviews. Light GREAT FIT good sound quality and I spend about 2 hours in the gym a day and charge them for about 15-30 minutes each day....SOLID.
2,Didn't fit my ears in the slightest. They were huge for my ears.
3,In the past my biggest problem with wireless ear buds has been poor connectivity between my phone and the ear buds but these connect really well. The sound quality isn't very good they're not very comfortable and the volume is very quiet but they get the job done for a fairly low price. The charging cable they came with didn't work but that wasn't too bad because I had an extra one lying around. However if I hadn't had that extra cable that would have been a deal breaker. They are by no means amazing but if you're just looking for something that's inexpensive and works these are a good choice.
2,Sound is not very impressive- at all. Battery life is about 3 hours from fully charged- Pretty much makes these useless for why I bought them- for my 9 hour work shift. Luckily I brought my old pair because I turned these on at 6am- it’s not even 9am and I just got a battery low warning. UselessI would not recommend buying I will warn about them tho- don’t waste money
3,For the price they are okay.
1,I didn't get these expecting the fanciest features and knew what to expect based on the specifications listed.  I just needed something that I could connect to my laptop for some meetings.  Based on the advertising and the stated "up to" 3.5 hours of battery life I felt this would be fine.  Even if I got 2.5 hours that shouldn't be a problem.  It would be disappointing and 40% less then stated but something I could likely live with.However after using them for a month I find that the runtime on the batteries is atrocious - less than 2 hours before they die.  I am not doing anything fancy - they are connected to a laptop that I am sitting right in front of.  I am not moving around or doing anything else.I didn't expect them to last all day - but a runtime of under 2 hour in unacceptable.  I contacted Skullcandy and their response was to send them in for warranty repair.  Normally this might be an option but sending them any way that is trackable will cost me at least half of what I paid - certainly not worth it.  Plus I'd be without headphones for as long as it takes them to "repair" them.I will have to live with them or just get a another pair of Anker headphones that I can use for my laptop.I'm exceptionally disappointed.  I didn't expect top of the line and the sound is fine but these fall well short of even their limited specifications and I could recommend them at all.  As my first Skullcandy product I'd likely be hesitant to try others.Disappointed in the product and the service.
5,I love these earbuds. Great quality for a great price.
5,In short you're getting what you pay for and just a little bit more. They don't sound on par with my Sony earbuds obviously but at a tenth of the cost I'd say they have a much better sound-quality-to-cost ratio. The only thing I would say is lacking is the bass but they are truly excellent for being under the $25 price point.
5,Not perfect. I've had them for a few months & I've got no complaints. I thought they would be better because of the brand but they definitely get the job done.
3,So I have bought skullcandy earbuds for years now because I love the sound quality when listening to music or podcasts and I really wanted to love these  but not only do they hurt my ears (the fit is off even with smallest covers) but the battery life is crap and they don't seem to charge completely...like EVER..
4,Purchased for a pre-teen so didn't want to spend too much on a pair of wireless ear-buds. The kiddo was happy and so was I. Good value and price point.
5,Great product.!
3,The color is nice and the battery lasts a long time but something about the way they are shaped hurts my ears.
3,I bought these to replace my older anker earbuds that didn't hold much of a charge anymore. I sound quaility wasn't as good in terms of richness or fullness but clarity was good. They seat easily into the charging case and you really feel that they are secure and charging. Worked great for walking around the grocery store or the neighborhood. I tried them at the gym this week and that is where they started to fail for me. I tried all of the sizes of inserts they came with but they kept falling out when i was doing any exercised that required muscle move around the neck and head. This included even simple stretching or bending over. Even the muscle movements cause by straining during an exercise make these threaten to fall out of my ears. I will go back to my old anker buds for future gym sessions.
4,It’s a lot smaller than any other ear buds out there.
1,I just got these earbuds and just after 30 minutes of use i am facing 3 big problems..1.Listening to Music Is Horrible!! The Sound Quality Is Too Low That You Would Think The Singer Is Actually Talking Not Singing.. Very Bad Directly Stopped Listening To Music As I Was Disturbed From It & Moved On To Calls!!2.Calls? They Don’t Work On Calls Unless You Are In A Really Quiet Environment.. I Made 2 Calls & It Was Impossible To Proceed So No Music & No Calls Just After 30 Minutes Of Use??What Are They Useful For idk3. Jut 30 Minutes In & They Dropped From My Ears.. And I Was Like Why?? Very Easy To Slide From Ears!!4. Simply Do Your Self A Favor & Do Not Buy.
5,Very good earbuds long battery life
3,I bought them for the green color. They aren’t actually green. It’s a very feminine a sea foam color. Not at all like the color in the pictures. I’ll just give them to my little girls.
4,Amazing Quality
5,These were purchased for my 11 year old and he loves them. They fit great. The sound is great. Once we figured out the charging process we had no problems with them after that!
2,I didn’t like that it has a connection issues if your rubning or working out these won’t work for you you’ll get a static or pausing sound. but if you sitting still you will be fine.
4,Just as advertised 😍😊
4,The battery last longer than I expected. The ear praises them selfs can be a little bulky. Overall it’s the quality of wired skullcandy buds with the ease of Bluetooth.
3,I can hear just fine but the person you are talking to can not hear you well.
2,Starting off by saying I'm a big skull candy fan. When ppl were rocking beats and Bose I loved getting my red/black flat corded deep bass Skullcandy earbuds. I guess I expected similar comfort and audio from that era. Unfortunately I don't think they tested for the ergonomics of the actual unit which for me prevented from seating the earbud far enough to make a slight seal and hear the bass. Even when I tried pressing harder I couldn't get it to seat whilst using the 3 didn't sized plugs they offer. It was very very very uncomfortable. I would never listen to music on them. Kinda a no kidding paper weight but even then I don't think it does that well. It does look asthetically pleasing but very uncomfortable cannot hear too well depending on if you have anything smaller than giant ears that can seat more than just the silicone ear bud even the unit. The charge obviously isn't enough I think they advertised 8 hours but yeah you'll have to take them out every 3 hours and maybe even shorter as the battery degrades. I need at least 5! And it needs to not take long charging. Look to Anker on this one y'all.
2,I bought these for my iPhone 13. BIG mistake! I read the reviews and I was hopeful I followed all the instructions but these didn't even last 20 minutes before dying. The name does not lie they really are worth a DIME.
2,They don't last very long. They slip out of my ears constantly. The sound quality is alright but overall I wouldn't purchase these again.
5,Love ‘em’ listen to a lot of audible books! 8 to 12 hours per day. Battery life is good I do have to recharge them but very happy! Had to replace the first set… Sent them to the washer/dryer! They continued to work after but only for a few days… My mistake.
3,Not luxurious or high quality but they get the job done for listening to podcasts in my cubicle. They pop out of my ears constantly and don’t have the best sound quality but they were cheap and make sense as a second pair of earbuds. Would not purchase again but not mad I have them…if that makes sense
2,It’s not you get what you pay for because there is similar price buds out there with way better quality.The plastic is cheap the fit is horrible. No more than 5minutes in or it genuinely hurts my ears. The sound is tinny and low res. Base is heavy but fuzzy. There is legitimately equally priced buds out there from lesser know brands that deliver a higher quality product and better sound.
5,Thinking of buying another pair as a back up pair
2,I really wanted to like these. The case is neat and I like the colors but it only took me about an hour of use to know that I was going to return them.Firstly they are very uncomfortable to wear. I've had no problems with the original airpods but there is some plastic angle that doesn't have enough padding that hurts my ears when I wear these.Also the button design is horrible. The tiny little skull on the shaft of the headphone is the button and it takes a decent amount of pressure to press it. Since you're pressing on the shaft you're likely to dislodge the headphones this way.I gave two stars because I do like the the colors and the case is pretty neat. I wish the case had USB-C instead of Micro USB.
5,I've grown weary of over-priced average-sounding wireless buds. I bought these SkullCandy Dimes on sale when they were 21 bucks. I find them to be comfortable and loud enough for my elderly ears. Bought the grey. When I see them on sale again will buy another pair...only in hard-to-lose red.
4,But battery life could be a little longer
4,Anyone who reviews these earbuds and says there’s no bass is lying. There’s plenty of bass and overall the sound quality is amazing for the price. The only complaint I have is battery life but that’s not a deal breaker.
2,I might be spoiled since I'm used to Bose and Airpods. These sounded cheap without depth.
3,I love my Jib True earbuds. I bought my son the Dime set. One earbud wouldn't charge. I returned for a replacement. Replacement wouldn't charge either. Both times it was only one bud that didn't charge. Not sure if it is a quality issue or may have just been a fluke but I won't buy Dime again.
4,The headphones are great but when you plug them into the charger one will sometimes turn on and not charge which drains the battery. Otherwise they are very nice.
3,These lost signal and dropped in and out whenever I walked near the street or parking lot. Any car with a bluetooth system would knock these out. They sometimes lost signal if I put my phone in my pocket.
5,These are amazing for the price! No complaints!
5,I love the design the fit the price etc. Also love how it can fit onto my keychain. Only drawback is the battery life. 2hrs per earbud would seem generous; however when listening to a 3 hr podcast it will die a little over halfway through. I do avoid this by using one earbud at a time.All in all it's a great buy for $20. Keep it as a spare take it to the gym it works great.
4,My ears a dumb so ear buds never fit in my ears
3,Overall they're good wireless earbuds but they often lose synchronization and you have to re-pair them with your device.
5,i love these ear buds. they work great connect easily and last forever.nowi don't use them for 8 hours a day. maybe an hour here and hour there. i haven't had anyone complain about how they sound while on a phone call. for me they last about a week on one charge. they have great volume. and when im playing music i cant really hear background noise.i cant justify paying 100$ for a pair of headphones. ill keep buying these. very happy
5,I've bought several wireless earbuds over the past years. My last were really nice Soundcore Pros. Unfortunately I left them in a car somewhere and needed a replacement.Wow! The bass on these are way better then my Soundcores. They fit really comfortable and snug into my ears. The battery life is very nice. I recommend these.
2,I like skullcandy but this model is not good.I think the noise leakage is bad too.I think that skullcandy can improve in the future!
2,On this set and a set I previous purchased one bud stopped working. I have followed the instructions in the video -- unpairing/letting phone forget the device and repairing -- and it does not do the trick.
5,I love these. I just wanted something cheap to try our wireless earbuds and these were a great starter pair. Good sound quality and the charging is super easy. Also there was lots of cool videos on skull candy to walk you through the pairing process and it wasn't that hard! I love these!!!
5,This is hands-down the best sounding pair of wireless earbuds I have ever experienced for under $150.
3,My daughter has Tiny ears. These fit perfect. Sound quality is great. Just wish the battery life last more that 2-3 hrs after full charge
3,Sounds okay enough. Its value is that it is cheap and works okay. It's destined to a landfill though and I wish that we could go back to cables.
4,I already had the skull candy indy evo I never really liked the way the silicone sleeves fit in the ear. The skulls candy dime feels great! They fit more like traditional ear buds and are very comfortable. The sound quality is surprisingly good for the cost. I’d definitely recommend these.
5,These are some of the best earbuds I’ve ever had. The sound quality is amazing I can wear one at work or I won’t be able to hear anything. I love I can use one at time independently so while one is charging I’m still jamming.
5,Awesome earbuds! Skullcandy is an underrated brand in my opinion all of their listening gear has blown my mind since 2007. Sound quality is superb and I had no trouble syncing them with my iPhone. I do run sprints and so far they have not fallen out while I work out. I love them.
5,I don't usually review much of anything but these earbuds are awesome.  I enjoy running outdoors I don't usually wear any headphones at all because I always wind up fighting with them for the whole run.  But these earbuds barely moved at all even after 5 miles.  Great sound quality good enough noise cancellation (you can still hear but outside noises are quieter which I think is better for safety reasons) and they stay exactly where you put them.  Great value for the money. 10/10 would buy again.
5,I absolutely love these. I walk run and do both strength and cardio workouts with these earbuds in and they are great! They don’t fall out and they are pretty noise cancelling. They come with multiple rubber attachments for different ear sizes (which is nice for my small ears). You charge the whole case unit itself and then every time you put your earbuds into the small case they automatically start charging in the case! I can keep these in my gym bag for awhile without having to charge them. Highly recommend!
5,The sound quality is crisp I’m a musician and I like to listen to “complicated” music and I have had no problems with sound. The earbuds are small and the plug changeouts are nice. The battery life stared is good but could be better.
4,For the price you can not go wrong with these. I bought them to wear under my motorcycle helmet. they sit almost flat and my helmet slides right over them. 3 hours of battery life before a charge is not stellar but I rarely listen longer than that.
2,The Good:These earbuds look nice and the case is great.  They travel well and the case stays closed with the earbuds firmly in the case.They sound really good. A+ sound quality.The Bad.. which is really bad:The batteries on these are truly terrible.  This morning at 9 am I started with my brand new Dime earbuds with 100% batteries. At 10:30 am I got a low battery warning and the left earbud is now at 10% battery and the right at 30%.  Pretty unimpressive.I have small ears the smallest in ear cushions are still too large for my ears. I was hoping these would be better than apple Airpods but  no luck there.The long and short is that I would never buy these again because the battery life is so bad.  I frequently need to use headphones for 8 to 10 hours at a time a two hour battery life is NEVER going to cut it.  Two stars because the sound is great and I like the carry case.
4,An affordable earbud option if you just need it for work.
5,Great bang for your buck
3,Right earbud won't charge. Looked up all the possible causes/fixes at Skullcandy and apparently this is an issue with some units. Missed my return window with Amazon so will try with the manufacturer under warranty.
2,I needed a cheap pair of wireless earbuds for times when I didn't want to wear my on-ear wireless headphones. I knew these wouldn't be great. But they're pretty bad actually. They don't want to stay in your ear and the sound quality was pretty terrible. They're also super quiet even when my phone or computer volume was at 100%.I've used Skullcandy products for years and their mid-price stuff is usually a good balance between cost comfort and sound quality. Not with these but I guess I should have known that when they only cost a few bucks.Since returning these I've purchased a pair of Skullcandy Indy Evo buds. Those are much more comfy and sound a lot better for only a bit more money. Still not great but usable and not $100 or $200 like some other pairs out there.
4,Do not fit in my ears fall out all the time.
2,I liked the style sound however the battery life is less than 3/4 hours. I'm able to listen to music while working and they didn't perform well for me.
3,The concept is very nice as well as the price point. However the large disc that fits into the cup of the ear prevents the bud from going inside the canal for optimal noise cancellation and overall sound quality. I tried pushing a little more but it hurts the outer ear area to get it where I needed it. Other buds can be pushed a bit more inside to capture the lower frequency range (bass). For this I give low ratings and am getting a refund/sending it back.  Perhaps the next model will allow for more insertion of the bud into the ear. Otherwise I'll keep my old blue tooth headset a bit longer as it is much better in the sound/noise cancellation department.  Get it next time on the design Skull Candy! I always love your sound...but this one fell short.
4,Its loud and good to be listen to music but be careful not to lose one
5,For the price these are great earbuds. The battery life could be better and the ability to amp up the volume. All in all for the price....they are some pretty damn good earbuds!
3,Can't use these for more than a few minutes at a time they're very uncomfortable.
3,this is the first time I bought these earbuds and have been disappointed right off the bat. The earbuds don't stay put and music kept cutting in and out as I turned my head. I put them on yesterday at school and I was grooving to my music while I was cleaning and it cut in and out. They are a disappointment. I'll have to try a different brand.
3,They were okay for the most part but I've had them now for a while and they're not shutting off when I put them inside the case. They still automatically connect while inside the case which is frustrating because I have to disconnect them manually
4,For the price these are amazing. I've recommended them to all my friends.
5,April 8th 2022 Love these so far they are loud fit nice and so far excellent charge and it sits nicely on my lanyard when I'm not using it
5,Like the ear buds great value. Wish they were better at canceling noise.
5,I was skeptical about these but I am pleasantly impressed! I couldn’t see a microphone but had a very clear conversation so I have become a convert they are comfortable to wear inconspicuous light weight i definitely give them a thumbs up
4,I like the noise cancellation But the sound is quiet and could be better but for the price not bad at all
4,Pros: Small and easy to carry around. Fit good and stay in my ears. High volume. Good isolation.Cons: Case feels cheap and earphones feel just okay. Sound quality isn't anything special. Small battery life.
5,Had for a month and they are working great.  Use to make phone calls and listen to audiobooks and music.  I have never used AirPods so I cannot compare.  I am not someone who has them in all the time and the sound quality is fine for the price I paid.  If they last a year or more that would be magnificent time will tell.  I think if you are looking (slightly) name brand headphones for light use and don't care they are not white with an apple logo I would give these a shot.
5,These are awesome they come with several different sizes of rubber tips to fit your ears and cancel noise really well. The sound is great for music and podcasts it’s not as great for calls (the other line can hear some static) but still way better than the other 3 I have tried at the same price point.
2,So I purchased these Blue Tooth ear buds based on a recommendation from Consumer Reports. Turns out CR really missed the call on this item.First the case that holds the buds is super-hard to open you really have to wedge your fingernails in the groove to get it to open up. Second (and this was the deal-breaker for me) was that the volume/FF/RW controls are NOT activated by tapping the ear buds; you have to press hard on the tiny embedded button inside each ear bud. And that requires a lot of pressure on these tiny buds sitting in your ear canal. So it's uncomfortable and the buds can dislodge from your ear.And to add insult to injury there's no free return. Will cost me ~ $7. Not happy at all. But I'll gladly pay the return cost just to get this disappointing purchase out of my sight.
3,Battery life is extremely weak. Can only use for 3 - 4 hours at a time.
5,So I own an pair of Sesh and now a pair of the Dimes and I really enjoy both.  The battery life and sound quality are not as good as the Sesh but the trade off for the smaller / compactness of the Dimes makes it a great pair for me to always have on the go.  Small enough to comfortably fit into my pocket it was the significant draw to having them over the Sesh.  Overall if you do not have a pair yet I recommend the Sesh but for the price it's hard to beat the Dimes as an introductory / back-up pair.
5,The case is great! Not only does it charge them it lets you see that they are actually inside it!
5,Can’t complain about anything for that price and to be honest I wanted to upgrade with skull candy Indy fuel refurbished and it was joke to me the sound was the same the fit was worse and the only thing which was better is the battery life with charging case other than that I am happy with Dime and I can recommend it for that price they get the job done. I am using them for my iPhone 12 Pro and works great with my Apple Watch series 6 cellular without having the phone which is amazing.
4,I love these! My only complaint is they are not the most comfortable she hurt my ears if I wear them too long.
3,These hurt my ears after wearing for many hours but the main reason I returned them is the pause button is in a bad place - whenever I would press pause it would make the earbud fall out.
4,Great for the value however not the most comfortable to wear. A bit more comfortable now due to my changing and using different ear tips. I LOVE the fact that the earbuds work independently of each other. That should be advertised more! I would purchase again!
3,Love these earbuds but max battery life is about 4.5 hrs  so the must be charged at least once during a normal work day
5,Very good sound quality fits well and doesn’t fall out of my ears. The battery life with a full charge is only about three hours. I wear them on my frequent flights from Miami to St. Louis And they typically die about 20 minutes before I land. Other than that I would definitely recommend these.
2,These earbuds have no bass. They have a very narrow tinny sound. I got them based on the reviews being mostly good. I ended up getting OnePlus Nord buds. They are about the same size but have exceptional audio for about $40.
5,Love it so far and I use it quite frequently! Design is minimal and unique. Sound quality is pretty good and even. No heavy bass however. Noise cancellation is decent but not complete. Small complaint (but it's likely just the size of my ears or the plugs I use) is that when I'm eating or chewing one earbud tends to fall out.
3,Love them just the battery life sucks.
2,They wouldn't stay in my ears and I have semi small ears.I gave them to my husband to try and he said they hurt his ears.Worst pair of ear buds I have ever bought.
5,It was a great mother's day present
5,I have owned a few of these and you can't beat the quality at this price point. If only I didn't lose these one ear bud at a time in sure my original ones would still be working more than a year later. Unfortunately I've lost several from these falling out and not being retrievable from where they fell sigh.
2,I wear these while working out. Sweat gets around them and it’s mostly ok except when you tilt your head. For whatever reason the right ear bud always falls out never the left that side hangs on good. I can’t explain it but I've read other reviews saying the same. They fit fine and the sound is good but useless if it’s a pain to deal with
4,Sound quality is decent. Not the most basd oriented earbuds but I'm satisfied with the overall audio quality. Basted them at full volume with no issue. I'm surprised for how tinny the case is. Don't expect a lot of bass though.
4,Good inexpensive ear buds
3,They broke and I only had it for 2 days
1,I bought these because my other pair stopped working and I had a 5 hour flight. I received the ear buds the day of my flight worked great for 10 minutes then one side shut off and wouldn’t power back on. Now the other side is doing the same and it wont charge. Honestly pretty disappointed now I have no head phones on my flight all around just a horrible experience and horrible product. I’m just going to keep leaving the same horrible review because the seller won’t reach out to me and Amazon won’t accept my return because I don’t have the original box. Horrible all around I would never buy another product from this seller as well. UPDATE: sense the seller refused to contact me. I bought a second pair. The 2nd pair is more broke then the first one. Only the right ear works and charger won’t work thank god I gave. A million pieces now and I’m able to get the charger from the old set to charge the right ear pod. So the left ear pod doesn’t work in general. Probably one of the worst things I’ve ever bought from Amazon. I own 3 now and none of them work do not buy this product! There’s no way this product so be rated anything near 4/5 stars 2 stars at the most. DO NOT BUY
5,They are STRONG. I am an extremely clumbsy person and i dont know if its just me or the earphones but they keep popping out no matter the size its okay after your ear gets used to them I guess but they have not broken when hitting the ground or falling in my dogs water bowl. I like them the color is also great.
5,For 20 bucks you can’t ask for better quality.
3,The power drain on the right earbud is rather quick (< 2 hrs listening time).  Sound quality is good as is noise cancellation.  It is a bit difficult to secure them in the ear but with a little manuvering it can be done.
3,They are inexpensive so I didn't expect much. They are ok in terms of sound quality and battery life (3-4) hours. They don't stay in my ears that well.
3,love these ear buds i saw manybad review and was hesitant but it was worth it... love how they automatically connect and the battery life is very long. it does drain my phone battery quite a bit but its ok it has great sound.
5,They aren't the best headphones but for $20 are the best affordable ones
5,Got these to use for snowboarding and they were great! The different size cap on the earphone was perfect cause it allowed me to adjust the noise cancelling more.
4,I overall love these earphones the only thing I’d complain about is the comfortability. These earphones start to hurt my ears after awhile.  But I really love the sound quality of these earphones and the durability.
3,I bought these because the reviews said they were small and fit in the ears well.  Unfortunately they don’t stay in my ears at all.  If I hold them in they sound great and I hear only what I want to when it comes to outside noise depending on how high I turn the volume.  I wish that they stayed in my ears because they were affordable and I listen to books at work and it’s inconvenient to have to stay plugged in when I need to move around.
5,They fit my ears!
4,I accidently washed one of the ear buds and it worked just fine after.
4,For the price these are great.  I had a little challenge fitting them securely in my ears but was able to make it work
5,This is my second skullcandy product. They have yet to fail me. The sound quality is amazing. Very convenient. The battery life lasts pretty fairly. I do have to charge the headphones once a day after 4 hours of life or so.
3,The price was right to take a chance. Nothing special here. Noise cancel is below par IMO and volume level doesn't go to high..  I'm not upset with these buds but they are definitely not my go to. Not a bad choice if you want a back-up or an extra that you keep in your bag or car for when you don't have your first choice. I must add that I was a little let down because I AM a fan of Skullcandy products.
2,Came fine but the left earbud is always low on battery and wont charge
5,Got these for an incredible price and like them very much. They don't have the external audio controls like my previous Indy's but I like the way they fit in my ears more than the Indy. You can use either bud solo unlike my pair of Indy's. Fit perfectly into that small extra pocket that comes on Men's pants. Had to add them tp my collection of Skullcandy earphones.
4,I’d have spent more or got refurbished ones to get the equalizer app.  These are as good if not better than Apple wireless buds for over 4x the price.  Way more comfortable than Apple.  I love them for music phone calls and gaming
4,Works pretty well and the audio is adequate enough tho I mostly used it for calls at work. Haven't really gotten around the skip and volume features but otherwise it fits for the simple stuff I needed it to do
5,So I think the main thing is the sound quality.Not too bad I think they need a little more base.For the price though they are a great buy.Noise cancelling is good and receiving phone calls from your phone works really well.It would be nice to have a little more playtime but come on look how much you're paying for these!In my opinion they are a great buy!
3,Better than a gas station bluetooth set. But there are sets that are $40 (Earfun) that are 3x the value on every category.FitmentSound qualityBattery lifeWater ResistantUSB-c and wireless charging
3,I bought these for my son for Christmas and they work ok the sound is not loud at all when he connects to his switch the reason we bought them.
5,good cheap buds for 3 hr listening time
5,These are great earbuds they have good sound quality as well as an excellent battery life. These are really good quality and simple to use love that they automatically connect when you take them out as well. Only negatives in my opinion are that the case easily gets dirty when the earbuds are out and the complexity of the push controls on the buds themselves. They are an excellent price and would definitely buy again.
5,I love these so much. I added them to my keychain and I have been carrying them around with me for about a month and I have not many complaints! I will say I wouldn't use these for working out. They tend to start slipping out of my ear when I try to run with them in or when I'm rowing. These are better for just walking around or sitting and studying.
5,Versatiles y comodos.
1,I try not to write negative reviews for something that cost $20 because I understand cheap products. But I've bought $10 headphones from Wal-Mart that worked better. The charge SUCKS!!! I've charged the ear buds and the pack they come in all at the same time and they die at random times one at a time!!! Last 3 hours???? Nah more like a hour (barley) for each bud. These are awful they fall out constantly and I have the smallest rubber tips on which leads me to have to wear them on opposite ears with the bottom piece within the cravas of the top part of my ear. It helps them stay but it hurts after while. These are trash not even worth $5. Buy at your own displeasure. Booooo 🍅🍅🍅👎🏾
4,Sound is great. Bluetooth connectivity is good. The only issue that I have with them is that after a while of use they start slipping out.
4,Compact case nice looking
4,These aren’t beats but they are only $30 so for that the sound quality is great. If i wear them for 2+ hours they really start to hurt my ears from how they fit not from their loudness.
3,Caused my ears to hurt. Somehow hurt worse then the 65 dollar version of skullcandy headphones. I would highly recommend getting the other ones. Can have them on for hours.
5,Love these! Great bang for the buck!!
5,Great price. Not super loud but good sound
4,Glad to know skull candy still got that great base quality to it
3,If you turn it up halfway it’ll display that music like a speaker. i guess it’s worth it’s money if it were like 10 bucks. Only if you play quiet music (litterally no one)
5,I have had these for over a month now and I love them. They are super small but packs a punch with sound quality. I have the Airpods pros and Powerbeats 2 and I use the Dime over both. They are easy to connect and I literally have them attached to my car keys. They aren't marketed as noise canceling but when I have them on in car or outside I can still only hear audio through them over background noise. These are gonna be sold out by back to school time and for the holiday season. I am saying it now.
5,Being affordable is what first attracted me to these earbuds being that I was buying them for my 12-year old.  They work well for him and I appreciate how inexpensive they were.
5,My daughter bought these with her own money. I was worried the low price would mean she was getting a cheap product. I was absolutely wrong. These are really impressive for the price. They work as advertised.
3,These headphones have silicone tips. I cannot wear silicone tipped earbuds. I've given them an honest try but unfortunately they just don't fit my ears. They constantly fall out of my head even if I'm sitting down and being completely still they still fall out. I've tried various other pairs of headphones with silicone tips before and they're all the same (to me).Sound  quality is very tiny and mid-range only. Having physical buttons is hard to maneuver and to use. The controls are very convoluted due to the fact that buttons are very hard to press  and are very tiny on a already small earbud. Every time I press the button they will fall out.
5,They pair quickly every time you pull them out of the case. When I'm gonna get a little crazy I activate 4x4 mode. I flip em around and switch ears. They fit snug and secure. Sound quality is amazing.....for a twenty dollar pair of buds. Battery life is meh I get 3.5 hrs per charge but the case will charge an additional 2 times. Best part is when you lose one you're only out 20 bucks not $200.
2,They are not very loud and I can still hear more outside then inside the ear buds
3,Battery doesn't last as advertised and they take too long to connect when removed from the case.
4,Make them more comfortable for longer use.
2,I like skullcandy.  I used to buy them more often then not when I purchased headphones with the wire attached.  I finally decided to act like it was 2022 and buy some wireless ones.  I know me so I decided to start low and see if I wouldn’t lose them right away.  Surprisingly I didn’t.  The sound I would say was a little under what the wire ones sound like but were good for the price.  Not my problem with them is out of no where the left side one dies in less the hour but the right one keeps going.  It’s annoying.  So that gets a thumbs down.  Just got a more expensive pair so let’s hope these last.
5,I wear these all day working in landscaping. For the price buy two pair and keep a second charged if “your battery” doesn’t last! I have no issues with them at all!
2,Battery life is terrible.  I love how loud they can go. They are not very comfortable.
4,Hard to keep in your ear while working or constantly moving.
2,Very weak no bass poor quality sound and broke in a week or two
5,I got these for my son. They have been ran over with a car and the charging case was washed and dried in the machine and still works. Buying myself a pair now!
3,Yes they're inexpensive sound is excellent in the one side that has volume.. I don't hate them in fact I bought 3 sets for my son my hub and myself. I just hate HATE the fact that neither I or my hubs can get more than on to work!!! My son's worked great right out of the box and he had bilateral sound! But even he said that the controls were really wonky and difficult. Otherwise- the sound and battery is great. If they would both work simultaneously and the instructions weren't absolutely useless I would love them! And I really do want to love them.
3,These are small Lil ear buds with so so sound the base is below standard but works well for receiving calls and not for music. The battery life is a less then claimed. I wish I should a spend a few more $ and got something like t75 Jabra.
5,He uses them with his Nintendo switch he loves them ..
4,Best "bang for your buck" ear buds!I love these. I just wish the battery life was a little longer.
5,These earbuds come with multiple rubber fittings and the sound cancellation is great as well as the quality. Just as good as the best brands. The battery life is great too I can listen for hours before having to charge and they charge super fast.
5,These are the best bang for the buck. Plus they stay in the ear better than any earbuds I've had before.
5,I had been looking for a pair of Bluetooth ear buds for a while and didn't want to spend an arm and a leg for them. I'm not an audiophile so I'm not interested in bells and whistles I also wanted to buy from a brand I trust. When I seen the Skull Candy Dime ear buds I knew this was what I was looking for. Price is great sound is great and I know I'm getting a quality product from a company I have purchased from before. Overall I am very satisfied with my purchase.
3,For the price the sound is pretty good but they do not fit in my ears comfortably at all. My ears get pretty sore while only wearing them for about 10 minutes.If you cant try them to see if they fit in your ears comfortably dont get them.
3,If I were reviewing this to a friend or otherwise:They are perfect for light podcast listening exclusively. The performance for music listening is doable but the bass doesn’t pick up as much as others. It’s still very present. It’s not the best for phone calls…but there’s texting for that. They are solid for the price. To date I’ve found they sound quality performs best with Apple special audio. Otherwise it can be tough for music listeners. They work in a pinch though.
3,They sound alright and have a neat charging case but whoever thought to put a button on these things that jams the earbud into your ear because of how difficult it is to push it when you go to use it is a moron. Plus they constantly cut in and out while i'm walking. They're only crystal clear if i hold my phone close to them and not move.
5,These fit great are lightweight sound fantastic for the price and have pretty good passive noise cancellation. A 3-hour battery life means you're not going to work outside all day with them but that's what breaks are for and they charge fast in the case. Would (and will) buy again.
4,These are my first ear buds so it's hard to compare. Sound quality was ok very little low end but for the price its acceptable. The controls are very hard to use. Battery seens to drain too fast.
1,Has problems with charging and staying connected to the pins on the casing/cover/box so it unexpectedly connects to the phone randomly and won't charge despite being plugged in for hours at times.Also has issues with the earbuds not pairing together and audio only coming out of one earbud.When it is connected a lot of the time the audio is noticeably quieter in one earbud.Wanted to claim warranty get it replaced or refunded but they made that tedious as well. I had to pay for shipping to return this dud and drop it off at a drop-off point of their choice and that was the icing on the cake
5,Primarily used at the gym. These buds have decent sound to them and the case holds a charge for a long time so the buds are always fully charged. I can basically go about 10 hours before having to recharge the case. They're not totally noise cancelling but come on for twenty bucks they're awesome!
5,They sound amazing! The mic is pretty good too. They were supposed to be delivered on the 16th but they came 1 week earlier.I'm really happy!
2,I’ve always loved skull candy but very disappointed in these. At first they seemed good and they do for small headphones cancel out noise. But I have had mine for about three months and the battery life is about 2 hours max. They also glitch really bad randomly……like when I work out. Would recommend just buying a different brand
5,Great quality. I was pleasantly surprised with the great sound quality and how easy it was to sync them to my phone. Definitely worth the purchase!
4,Precio
1,So I'll say this I just opened the package todayconnected it to my phone and started listening. With out music its ability to cancel outside noise is great!  The music quality was also good only thing is it worked for about 10 minutes then the right ear piece turned off I figured it was just low battery considering I just opened it. I charge it for a  good four hours... and nope it won't charge past 10%  and the now the left ear piece won't even turn on... so I'm returning them.... completely defective. This was my first time using skull candy headphones  and I guess I was right to stay away from them...
4,For the price they are amazing. The first charge took forever but afterwards they are perfect.
3,Better headphones at this price point.
2,Sent these back.  These are not the cheap-but-awesome ear buds you are looking for.Would not really recommend.
4,Overall good product for the price;Sound quality : GoodBattery life on ear : Very good for the priceCombine total  battery life per charge : Not bad it can be improved
3,Tried to use these several times to talk on the phone but there is little to no noise reduction but they’re great as regular earbuds
2,Bateria poca duración
4,Noise cancellation poor quality is ok.
5,Much love and praise to Skullcandy for the courage to do what's right.This technology has been around too long to not to be modestly priced.It feels like one company is trying to make another company come straight?Here's a hint. Also buy the $2.99 insurance which gives 3 years coverage for a $25 purchase.No joke. That's the deal of the year combo. They have to stand behind that $25 purchase for 3 years at one buck a year!
2,They don't fit in my ears properly! They fall out easily! I regret not returning them!
4,I love them. They are affordable slim & work
5,If your like me you don't want earbuds that are really big and bulky these where the best ones I could find for a cheap price where they wernt to big and bulky.
5,Perfect for what I wanted it to be. It is really compact and easy to carry in your pocket. The buds pair very quickly and the sound quality is also good for this price. The only drawback is the battery life but I was okay to trade that off for its compactness.
4,Sound quality is decent for the price. Battery life is close to accurately described. Comes with different sized silicon ear pieces but still will come out easily when you’re sweaty and running.
4,The quality is great for the price.  I'm not sure how long I'll be able to own wireless earbuds without losing one sonI went with the lower cost.  Only issue is that they're not the most comfortable fit. I've had plenty of Skullcandy earbuds so have plenty of earpieces to try.
5,These are perfect! Simple to use and great quality for the price. My friend and I tested these to make sure they were what we expected and they were. Now to jump on the treadmill!
1,Box came without a charge and the cable is like nothing i've ever seen before. So there's that. Controls lack virtually any tactile response. Keep falling out of my ears while stretching which doesn't bode well for exercise. Alternate size ear pieces ship loose in container. Said container has a hole in it? Nice. Bluetooth range is highly suspect as I lose signal from laptop when straying a very modest range away. Pretty weak overall - proceed with caution. Addendum: I've tried two of the three earpiece sizes and they continually drop out of my ears during the simplest of calisthenics. Once moist with sweat you can forgetaboutit. These little guys are awful in a myriad of different ways.
4,Sound bites great.
5,Don’t let the low ratings full you! These are actually very very decent! They get loud. I use my for my night manager job and of course with the 4hr battery in the buds I take breaks from listening to let it charge (I mainly use the right bud so I can still hear coworkers/customers). I used them for the gym once and WOW!! They’re really good! The added key chain is perfect because I can’t tell you how many earbuds I’ve lost. Considering buying a second pair as a backup
3,Needs to have a better technology system to hold the charge longer. 8 to 9 hours it's already low charge. Otherwise I love them.
5,These are amazing headphones for the price point are they top of the line no but the price makes up for that.  I have already lost one of the pair of earbuds I got last year because the charging case didnt latch and these skull candy earbud cases do huge A+ to the makers for this little feature.  The battery life is exatcly what they say it is also huge A+ for a comapny finally telling the truth about their product!!  I would totally reccomend to anyone.
1,I like the color and that is about it. No noise canceling at all. The calls sound so distorted and the audio is okay. You are better off just buying a $5 generic wired pair of earphones because they would sound so much better than this $20 garbage. Oh yeah battery life is a joke. You put them on for about 45 minutes and they give you the low battery warning. Yeah just don't bother buying them. I tried to give them away and the person ended up paying me so I can take them back.
5,The pairing was quick and easy. I think they sound really good especially for the price. They do stick out a little only because my ears are ridiculously small even with the smallest earbud cover but when my husband tried them on they fit perfectly. The battery life I can't comment on because I haven't put them through that test yet other than that I really like them!
3,When someone call me they can't hear me without an annoying amount of noise in the background distorting the main voice.
4,Good pair of earbuds for polite music and gym.
4,Affordable and good quality all u need to know
4,They are a pretty good value not the best sound but good enough volume is good fit is good but i wouldn’t go with any other color other than black since the tops are exposed in the case they get dirty pretty quickly
4,They're about the same quality as a normal $15 of wired earbuds but the volume control seems off. It's too loud on the lowest setting to carry a conversation but too quiet at the highest if you're doing anything remotely loud.
2,Stopped charging after a month
5,My eight-year-old loves to run and wanted "AirPods". We tried 10+ wireless headphones before we found these. They come with several sizes and stay in her ears when she is running or just lounging. They can also be adjusted to fit my adult ears. They are durable and stay charged.
4,Just wish the case would stay open more often
1,UPDATE: They continued to have issues so I returned them.  I would NOT recommend buying these.  I gave them a fair shot but they actually turned me off of the SkullCandy brand for good because they are selling crap deliberately.  Wireless is dysfunctional and battery life is horrible.---I basically bought these for my home office when I have to jump on meetings.  They are pretty good for that however they have horrible battery life.  If I have back to back meetings I get "battery low" notifications constantly.  So to get around this I use one at a time.  If you are listening to music there is periodic crackling noise so I wouldn't keep them if I used them for anything where I cared about sound quality.  I also had connection dropping on a call once which is very annoying.  If it keeps happening I will return for a better pair.
4,Battery is way to short
5,Works great battery last a very long time . easy connection and when using it for phone calls you can hear perfectly as does the other person on the phoneVery good ear buds
5,These are awesome. I’ve been looking for some wireless ear buds that fit well and don’t fall out and these are great. Sound is great too. These are better than Apple’s.
2,Tried all the sizes and these immediately popped out of my ear without even moving my head.
5,Skullcandy is one of my favorite earbuds to use in general and these are great like the others. I have smaller inner ear and most earbuds aren’t small enough or makes my ear uncomfortable after few minutes. These are perfect size and feels good in my ears up for an hour!
1,Ordered the light gray & blue fully charged and they never worked. Both earpieces connected to the Bluetooth- I could use all the functions of the earpiece like volume control play/pause skipping tracks etc. But there was no sound coming out of the left earpiece. I went through the troubleshooting process unpaired and repaired the Bluetooth reset the headphones themselves and nothing worked-- because it was connected to the Bluetooth it just must have had a faulty speaker?Went through the return/replacement process and they sent a new pair same color and had the SAME ISSUE left side had no sound coming out.I have an orange pair and they are fine we picked up a black pair from another store and they're fine but I'd avoid the gray/blue because 2 of 2 pairs we were sent have the same broken left earpiece.
5,I have spent over $100 in 1yr time on Corded Ones these here are Great!!!They are Loud but not Deafening Loud fit Perfectly in my ears don't fall out & they ' do ' last for 7hrs will Alert you on your Phone when the Battery runs Low.Money well spent.
5,Love them
4,they last a while for $20 good for the price.
4,Nice sound for the price. Good battery life. Noise cancellation works well.
5,I've always been enthralled with Skullcandy products and I was happy to stumble upon these one day. The audio quality is amazing and the noise cancellation is stellar. I've been using Skullcandy headphones for years and these measure up to the same quality I have come to expect from them. I also love that there's different color choices no more black earbuds getting lost in my black backpack!
5,I like ‘em
5,I got these for my teen who loves to draw while listening to music. We love our skull candy products she's been using the Ink'd wires earbuds but recently wanted an upgrade to Bluetooth. We received them charged them and I was able to pair within minutes! The sound quality is great but you'll definitely want to invest in the sesh Evo for a better quality sound. For the price we have no complaints the functions are amazing connecting is effortless. Absolutely worth the money!
5,I've been using mine since June the sound quality and battery life are good for the price and they're pretty comfortable. I'm writing this review today because they just came out of a full wash cycle in the pocket of my shorts. I dried them off charged them and they started right up their little red charging light shining like the eye of an unkillable Terminator. Outstanding buds at this price point.
3,Sound quality could be better and battery life aswell but over all they are ok
4,I especially like the fact that you can see if they're in the case while the case is closed.
4,Easy setupgood case and design
5,I got these for my hubby. He loves them! Best earbuds for your money!
4,2 month review. Sound quality is good but the battery life is terrible
4,Just got them and only played with them for an hour but I have always bought skull candy head phones (mainly because of the warranty).
4,They are great headphones but I wasn't sent the color I ordered. 👎🏽
5,These earbuds sound great for how cheap they are. They come with different size ear pieces.
5,You can use either ear independently. If you use frequently you will need to charge the case every night
5,Bought over 6 months ago for my kids. Have no problem so far and they use everyday. They love them!
3,The sound quality was great and so is their noise canceling effect but boy were these uncomfortable. I either missed the return period or they were not eligible for returns but i wish i could. They make my ears feel sore after ten minutes and i end up switching to my wire earphones.
5,They are great for listening to music and answering the phone not to mention they can drown out sound really well.
5,With the multiple size silicone cups you can customize ear fit. Battery life is long and charging is super easy. Sound quality is top notch!
4,Very inexpensive product for nice sound quality and decent battery life
2,They only last for 2 hours while they charge for five..
3,I've read the faqs and watched the videos and done everything suggested but so far I can't get the right earbud to charge for the life of me. Don't want to return these but feeling like I might need to at this point.
2,These headphones are not made for the gym. They’re aren’t loud enough. I mainly use them in the car when someone else is driving because I know I’ll be able to hear them if they talk to me or at home when I’m cleaning . Battery life is good but then again I don’t use them on a daily. I bought them solely because of the color . I would not buy these again.
3,The sound quality is good and it's easy to pair with different devices (no problems with randomly disconnecting like others I've tried) but the battery life is really bad. Maybe I got a dud but they don't last anywhere near the already short advertised three hours and the cases charge is slow.
2,I "ass-u-med" that all Skullcandy headphones or earbuds were of sound quality; that is until these arrived.
5,These work like they are supposed to. These aren't a cheap knock-off air pod imitation! Battery life is great!
5,way better than the tozo brand. if you are debating between the two brands just buy this
2,I like these a lot. The battery lasts about 3.5 hours. But the range is amazing. I can leave my phone in my office and walk to the back of the plant and still get the sound. That's about 50M through 4 or 5 layers of drywall wood and sheet metal. Nice.3 Month EDIT: Any time I bump the headphone case it nudges the earbuds and they connect. It messed up my other headphones my Bluetooth speaker my car stereo...I hate it. I hate it so bad... The earbuds perform really well in their price range but the fact that they connect if I look at the case wrong is just infuriating.5 Month Edit: I just threw these away. If I look at the case wrong they connect to my phone so my video disconnect my car stereo etc. I hated it. I hated it so bad I couldn't even believe it. It's just so obnoxious. I guess I got my $20 worth of use out of them but I would rather die than but another pair
3,They are  good for the price but they really hurt my ears so I had to give them away  🤷🏻‍♂️
4,Great sound and connects easily to my Samsung but still unable to connect to my iphone.
5,This is my first time owning wireless earbuds and I like the immediate connection once you take them out of the case. That only works when Bluetooth is on obviously.Not much to complain about aside from the buds not fitting perfectly but that's a personal nitpick.
3,2 negatives of the product: battery life the headphones won’t automatically turn on and connect if I only take 1 earbud out of the case sometimes I like to do this when I’m working from home.Other than that solid product.
5,These work pretty well but a little interference if I get to far from my mp3 player.
1,The first thing I do when I get headphones is test them with test tones. Bass response begins at around 70hz for comparison even cheap ($20 or less) earbuds get down to 30hz or even 20hz. I've never heard anything struggle like this. And even then it's practically inaudible. And it's not like the problem gets better in songs. If anything it's worse; with other sounds playing bass is effectively inaudible. Aside from the bass the earbuds perform quite well with balanced sound and low distortion. But without bass these earbuds are useless for pretty much all music.The controls are a problem too; they rely on pressing buttons on the surface of the earbuds. The buttons are small and difficult to find with your finger and require far too much force to press. You end up uncomfortably driving the earbud into your ear. With practice I suspect you could get the angles just right to avoid discomfort but it's still a poor design.No idea about battery life. But on the plus side the batteries didn't catch fire and burn my ears.
5,If you can’t afford beats or airpods you will love these. I have beats but have these as my backup and it’s a great pair for when I need them.
5,Gross I know but impressive right?
4,Es buena la calidad del sonido pero le falta mejorar
3,Battery life and noise isolation/cancellation are not good. But the sound quality is pretty good for the price! I like how they are small and light. They do tend to pop out of my ear if I lay down. I have also had some weird issues like them turning off randomly but they are still working. Overall you cant beat this price for wireless headphones
5,Have had these little earbuds for some time now and they are wonderful. I use them everyday at work with no problem save for the battery not lasting as long as my shift. Other than that they serve their purpose and will even live through being accidentally washed in the washing machine. Worth the price especially since I got them on sale.
4,Sounds near perfect for the price. Lately most manufacturers have copied Apple's design in both the Beats and Airpods in the size and shape of their ear canal tube that the only stable eartip size is still painful to wear for me.
3,I'm disappointed with battery life.  Earbuds last about 1.5 hours not 3.5 hrs as it claims.
5,I am new to using earbuds. In the past when I tried them my ears would hurt. So I gave up on using earbuds. Then my son bought these and loved them so I figured I would try them. For the price if I hated them I'd just give them to my son. But I LOVE them. I always thought it was weird how people walk around talking to themselves but now I get it. lol
4,But this is better than the last one i bought.
5,If this is all you can spend this is the way to go to get mostly all the “airpod” features. I don’t like the fact that when returned to the case it won’t disconnect from Bluetooth 🤷‍♂️
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Just opened them and they are so cute !! I love them  very inexpensive as well !! The sound is excellent quality  I honestly think it’s better than the actual iPhone earphones. That’s just my opinion though . Try them out  you won’t regret !
5,Bought for my 7 yr old but they was too big. I love the sound quality though and how easy they are to charge
3,Don’t stay in my ears like to fall out.
5,They are lovely. But they can sometimes slip from your ear. They alao so not have loud volume. But they do last long and only have to charger once every 2 days even through i use them for 8 hours everyday.
2,The battery life doesn’t last it cuts off without warning and both sides do not charge the same waste of my money
5,Product works good for the money
3,I'm hard on earbuds I use them the majority of the day every day. They started getting quiet and just don't charge right anymore. I just received my second pair we'll see how she goes a second time.
4,My son ordered these buds and for the price there really isn't anything to complain about. They sound decent bluetooth connectivity decent and battery life decent for the price.
3,These earbuds get the job done. I was looking for something inexpensive that I could use to listen to podcasts/music while sitting at my desk at work and these definitely do the job. Sound is great and as far as sticking things in your ears go they are relatively comfortable to wear. My only problems are that the controls on the ear piece are hard to use. You're supposed to be able to skip forward/backward adjust volume and all that stuff from the ear piece but it's so small all I can get it do is pause and play. Other than that I like them.
5,Can't really figure out how to fast forward or stop it on the earpieces but it connects very well
2,Does not announce the number that's calling and I need to know..
5,These earbuds are great for everyday use although they don't have any noise cancellation they still block out a good amount of noise. The bass is a bit low (compared to other Skullcandy earbuds I've tried) but overall the sound quality is very clear especially with phone calls the battery life is decent considering the size. You do loose a few functions compared to higher priced earbuds (wireless charging USB C ANC) but taking into account the price these buds are well worth it.
2,You can maybe get 3-4 hours of use before having to charge. I've had cheaper pairs that last 8-10 hours.
4,Would be perfect if I could get them to work with my fire tablet
4,I like this product because its small portable and the battery life is good but the only thing that it lack is the sound quality the sound its fair for the prise.
5,Got this for my son after his sister got the airpod pros however this work as well if not better
3,Realmente quede muy bien la persona quedó fascinada con el producto sobre toda la cancelación de ruido
5,Been buying skullcandy  for many years and haven't been dissatisfied overall. Always a good buy for the price.
5,Little if no hissing while there's no music playing (common issue with cheap buds) with the correct size plugs you won't hear a thing around you not sure if it uses real noise cancelling or if it's just jammed in my ears well but pretty impressive. Battery life is what you'd expect. Case is stylish and stands out. Would love to try one of the more expensive pairs now wasn't expecting much but was surprised!
5,Had these headphones for about a year and they have been dropped in pools and sinks and from 3 story balcony and they still work would recommend for Christmas gift or just your own use.
1,I don't recommend these earbuds to anyone they could of designed them with 9-10 hours of constant battery life INSTEAD of just a lousy 3 hours....SMH..... AND they're not LOUD AT ALL WHATSOEVER!!!.....like most all other Skullcandy earbuds usually are!!!.....I GIVE THESE 1 STAR OUT OF 5 STARS..... NOTHING BUT A DISAPPOINTMENT.....I GAVE MINE TO MY NEIGHBOR'S TEENAGE KID AND HE SEEMS TO BE ENJOYING THEM..... I'M GLAD SOMEONE IS CUZ I KNOW I DIDN'T ENJOY THEM ANY!!!
5,For the price it's a good earbud the sound is okay it's bass heavy the case is very light.The plastic feels cheap but the case close a nice click  the earbud last about 2.5 to 3 hours
5,Great sound - can’t figure out controls but on a setting I like - only drawback is they fall out and one fell in paint while I was painting but cleaned it up right away and still works great.
5,Worked great for podcasts in a noisy warehouse full of forklifts and background sounds. Love the size of these.
5,Dude for the price of these I was legit surprised as to how good they are I’ve used other Bluetooth headphones and I’ve like these better every time I will legit be getting just these in the future if/when I loose one or something lol 😂 again GREAT QUALITY for a REALLY GREAT PRICE bro I can’t stress that enough 🤣
2,I couldn’t get these headphones to pair with any of my devices.
5,My son loves his. He used them all the time
5,For $20 these are great. I wanted to clarify some people's bad reviews but it legit says they only last 3.5 hours. If you are going to complain about that then don't buy them. I bought them for work where I don't wear them for more than a hour at a time so it will charge between. They do feel cheaply made but the sound quality surprised me on how well they sound for the price.
5,Battery life needs to improve
5,These are incredible for the price I got the chill gray dimes and they work perfectly after around 2 years
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Battery suck on earbuds
3,they sometimes fall out when i smile to hard. the sound is tolerable.
2,Poor design for the ear. Pushes against ear wall and hurts! Hubs & son both tried them with the same problem.
2,Even by cheap earpiece standards this device has NO low end. Very disappointed.
4,They worked great for my son for school
4,Battery life is kind of low but that knew that getting into it. My main "issue" is they kind of hurt your ears after prolonged use. but not like my gen 1 air pods did. Still a good alternative to the other pricey options.
4,Love the vilor optiins!!
5,i love these they work so good super loud i use them at work all the time and people have to repeat themselves cause im to busy listening to music or some podcast.
5,It’s like riding a unicorn naked and bareback over a rainbow! 🦄 🌈
5,These things are awesome I bought them for my wife. I have air pod pros and these things sound just as good. If you don’t care about noise cancellation (which these have from the rubber tip just not electric noise cancellation) and status symbol of air pods get these. You can buy 10 of these for the price of one air pod pro. Also if you drop the case the ear buds won’t fly out like AirPods! Try these out can’t go wrong for $25
4,
2,poor voice cancelation and sound quality.
2,After a while it was not water-resistant and affected the sound quality and the microphone.
1,These earbuds simply would not pair. Taking them out of the charging pod they are supposed to pair immediately. I had to figure out how to manually pair them as the instructions do not tell you. After the two pair to pair them with your phone or other device three of the same device names show up. One is for the left the other the right and the last is for both but the names do not indicate which is which. You just have to guess. Want to pair them with another device? Not only do you need to do the above all over again you will probably need to unpair the earbuds from your first device as they will automatically connect to the original device. So if you turn bluetooth off pair to a second device then turn it back on the earbuds disconnect and reconnect to the original. They also do not come with an additional rubber ear pieces so good luck getting them to stay in your ear. These kept falling out as I moved. Overall an irritating and unnecessarily difficult experience.Oh and despite them constantly falling out they were uncomfortable when in my ear. When they finally stayed put they were painful after about 2mins. Could not even get through a single song. This is only highlighted by the fact that they have a button not a touch sensor so you have to press them into your ear to press the button. And this button controls everything. Volume manual pairing stop/start etc.Truly garbage.
4,I love these wireless ear buds for real. I keep them on my key chain it's super reliable and convenient.
5,Works very well! No complaints
5,Gods sound quality.  I think as good as my air pods but much cheaper.
2,I bought this earphones. The first pair arrived with problems to recharge. I fully charged it and few minutes later the "low battery" message appears. I send it back and ask for a replacement. The second one works well for 3 months (I use it around 4 hours per WEEK) but now it's again with with the same problem. The right earbud seems to have contact problems in the case. Sometimes the light is on sometimes is off and does not recharge. Don't know how to solve that even after research. I'll send it back again.
3,The earbuds are ok. Sound quality is not very impressive but does it s job.Good for the price of $20. Looks very nice. Compact and easy to carry around.
3,They’re very small and not noticeable I wore them to work but they don’t cancel much sound they’re also uncomfortable in my ear idk if that’s just me not being use to them or what other than that for the price they’re great
3,Could not fit 11 yrs old. Still Bulky for some kids.
5,Magnetic so if you put en in your pocket they stick together...i like scullcandy products
5,Small and practical. I have small ears and I do have to push them back in once in a while but that happens with all buds in my case.
3,Liked the bass didn't like the way they don't stay in your ears.
5,Considering the price i think it's a good product. Had 2-2.5 hrs of battery life worked for me well.
5,Buenos Audifonos
2,Hurt me ear as soon as I started using them sounds was not great and battery died quick
5,The sounds quality on these is great for the price. They are small and lightweight!!! I have smaller ears and they fit snug and don't feel like they will fall out. They mic quality is okay but still great for the size and price!There is no active noise cancellation but they do isolate sound well!If you are looking for some solid small earbuds that will not break the bank look no further!
4,Ok sound
5,Great little device it’s easy to carry as a keychain and sturdy I was using my beats pro for work and notice that the case was getting loose from being in my pocket and decided to give this little guys a try and they didn’t disappoint.
2,Didn’t pair well with I phone 13  sound quality wasn’t good returned item
5,It’s chip and will works well first 4-6 months.Ok for lectures but not for music.
5,The are great - especially when compared to the ones T-Mobile tried to sell me for $200 bucks. Easy to charge battery lasts a long time and sound is great. I use them for talking and listening to music/tv when I'm on the train. 100% Happy.
5,They are very good just wish the battery life was longer
3,They fit well and sound is pretty good for a cheaper pair of buds. The issue is connectivity really. They pair with all my devices just fine. Quickly in fact. Faster than anything else. It's when I am active like mowing the lawn and making a turn I move my head one direction and the connection drops for a second. I also experience frequent skipping on songs when streaming Pandora and others like Tidal.
3,Little battery life sound quality isn't great and the noise cancellation isn't good.It’s not a horrible product it fits snugly in your ear and it’s louder than AirPods.
5,Good quality just a little too much sound blocking for being in public
5,I wonder why I haven't had these the whole time. They rock so hard. They're tight in my ears. The technology is amazing!I love earbud headphones. I've gone through about twenty pair of the kind with cords. These are so much of a technological advancement for an incredible price. I love them.
5,Bought them for riding my motorcycle. I have loud bikes and they cut out most of the noise. sound quality is very good. Battery life is a bit short so I got two sets one can charge while one gets used price is great
5,These are perfect in every way! I LOVE how tiny the charging case & earbuds are!
5,Great for the price
5,These headphones are hands down freaking sweet
5,Work great and I accidentally dropped them in water after they dried they worked perfectly fine
2,Battery life isn’t long at all. Maybe 2 hours? Not worth the money
5,I'm the dummy that didn't know how to us it. Sorry about my previous review.
4,ok
5,Stop searching and pull the trigger on these headphones . The sound quality is great and the microphone sounds clear .My only gripe is the plastic quality wish they had used a better quality plastic but still  for the price you cannot go wrong .
3,Battery runs down a little faster than expected but the sound quality is good. I wish I could find earbud holders that worked with these!
3,They don't seem to hold charge for long
4,Sound quality is goodBattery life not so much
3,They do have a problem where the case stops charging the earbuds but besides this they’re pretty good
3,It's a great pair of wireless earbuds for this price. I've had a couple problems one being sometimes when I listen to a song it sputters. Another being that the case IS NOT DUST PROOF(but you could just get a case). But I really enjoyed the sound quality so great. And I like the keychain element. You really can't hear anything when there in it's great.
5,Skull candy head phones have never let me down. Best bang for your buck without having to sacrifice sound quality or fit!
5,They work great they don't really cancel much noise from the out unless there cramed in ur ears ND if u have large gauges thell fall out sometimes
2,Don't waste your money. Only got to use these once because they will not charge even when the indicative light says they're fully charged. Bought them to use when going on my jogs and they kept falling out of my ears even with the three different comfort sizes. Only good thing about them is the sound quality is decent for the price
5,These aren't perfect but they also aren't $100. My biggest complaint is it feels like you are jamming them in your ear when you press a button.
5,I have you Skullcandy for the past 3 to 4 years now and they have never fail to impress. I was looking for compact yet truly wireless set; and found myself stumbling upon this. Not only is the sound and volume amazing but the bass and quality of music isMuch more than you would expect of the size these actually are. Portable minimalistic and currently on my keychain. Highly suggest purchasing
5,Soy unapersona qsiempre esta en constante movimiento y por primera ves unos audifonos q un muy bajo precio q no se me caenSu calidad es buena durabkesBuen sonidoSolo q la bateria no dura mucho como 4 a 5 horas pero recargan rapidoBuena adquisicion a un bajo costo
5,Excellent sound and good fit
3,If you’re just looking for a cheap pair for working out they will do the trick don’t buy them if you are looking for noise canceling long battery life and comfort
5,For the price these just work these them for phone calls and music and they're just fine. I've had these several months but several pairs for friends of family everybody likes them can't beat it.
3,Kind of disappointed really.  These headphones aren’t that loud they battery life does not last as long as advertised and there’s no warning to let me know when the battery is getting low. I’ve had these for just over a week and I’ve shown up at the gym twice to start my workout without them turning on.  Nothing to warn me they might be low on life and to recharge.I guess you get what you pay for. Disappointing because I’ve liked Skull Candy for a while….
4,A great buy for the price.
3,Good ear phones and it does cancel out all the other sounds around even without anything being played. The downside is they still fall out of my ears
5,I purchased these to wear while weight training in the gym. they work great. Small size  battery lasts the whole workout easily charged. Great purchase.
5,Bought this for my son he loves them the battery life isn't as bad as it seems decent sounds good
2,Thought they would’ve been nice to use for work. They don’t work very well and when I get them to connect the sound was terrible. It made a weird scratchy sound and couldn’t get my audio. I went back to wired headphones.
4,Pretty solid all around but Bluetooth distance is lacking and battery life
3,The sound quality is excellent as expected from Skullcandy. They are nice and small and fit decently in my ears. The only reason for 3 stars is if you walk 2ft away from your phone the bluetooth has trouble staying connected. I ride a bicycle and usually with my old bluetooth skullcandy headphones I kept my phone in my pocket. I can't do that with these because it will constantly skip and unconnect. I will be purchasing a phone holder for my bike in hopes to fix the problem because I really do like these earbuds.
5,Didn't know what to expect. My last pair of earbuds would constantly fall out and battery life was very short. These are the best -bomb diggers!Haven't used noise canceling function but I am very happy. Highly recommended.Make sure you remove them from your pocket before you do laundry. 😆 LOL.
4,The battery life isn't the best but connection was easy and it does the job
3,The sound quality is OK. But things to worry about are battery life. They last like two hours. WATCH OUT
5,Use these to make my job a little less boring and also survived falling into a bucket of water. Good noise cancelling and good sound . Great alternative to apple
3,The sound quality is A1. Noise cancellation is the same. However these do not stay in my ear. Keeps falling out & it’s very annoying
5,These earbuds are amazing! They kind of cancel noise but some noise gets through they fit really well you can hear the bass and it's great! The audio is also great you can do 8D audio and it sounds amazing when the music is circling around you!
3,I have really small ears. I’ve tried various earbuds and none of them seem to fit. I wanted to love these but they slip out of my ears - they are too heavy and slip off. So sad.
5,Simple to get it to work. Like the fit. Good value for the money.
3,I would rather listen than watch them change. Everything else is good when you're not charging them.
5,These are pretty good for the price and have great noise isolating I ride a train to work every day and other passing trains can be painful to the ears but with these in it helps. My only complaints I have is that the Bluetooth isn't the best and the sound is a little quiet even at max volume.
5,I received my Skullcandys today and the battery life is fantastic. My earbuds got four and a half hours of use on a single charge I'm sure the charging case will perform equally well. The sound quality is great the volume levels and noise cancellation are more than adequate. My ears require smaller buds these are comfortable to me and stay in place. No complaints.
2,i live skullcandy earbuds i have a different bluetooth pair before i lost them and i also had ones with the cords and i enjoyed then both so of course i thought these would be good but i was wrong.I first got them they were dead which is understandable so i charged then and started to play music the sound quality is good but they felt soo cheap like hard plastic and most earbuds are made of plastic but they still feel nice after using them for about a week they keep cutting out and the worst part is you can’t stop of pause your music for almost 30 dollars this was a waste of money i can see them being good if you added a better case and a control on them
5,We have both used them and they are great
5,Batteries last the stated length and they produce some really good sound. Only drawback is the battery in the buds themselves. You need two pairs to keep going through a long grind of a day.
5,For the price these are excellent little earbuds and I love the charging case.
5,I was skeptical... But these are by far the best ear buds I've ever owned. They're far better than my last pair of $80 hypergear buds. Battery life isn't quite as long but audio quality is supurb!
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Sound quality is tinny and airy pretty good all in all for the cost but little depth to the sound. Mic seems okay.
3,I usually love all Skull Candy products but these have to be charged multiple times during an 8 hr shift.
5,Really nice Ear buds for the price.  Good sound quality. Good noise canceling.  Not sure battery life is as described but I can get 5 hours on one charge
4,They are not as loud as I was thinking they would be.
5,These are pretty good for 20 bucks. Was bummed out the microphone didn’t work on them but overall these are good headphones
3,Save your money and buy better earbuds. The sound quality is terrible and they kept falling out of my ears.
3,Does not fit in ear properly
4,Great product! Especially for the price but the volume does get very loud. It gets loud enough to hear but if you’re wanting something to workout with and have your music blasting this will not suffice.
3,Disappointed that these don’t get too loud.
5,I’m generally not a fan of earbuds. I purchased these because of my previous experiences with the Skullcandy brand. The audio quality and fit are what I needed. I have always loved the option of multiple ear pieces to fit the ear so the earbud stays in comfortably. I would recommend these for quality pricey and fit.
5,Work great for the amount of money they are :)
5,After several attempts and watching several videos the left earbud did not play.  Called company and they were very helpful and sent replacement.
4,No me agrada mucho el tiempo útil de la bateria
5,Fantastic for the money. Don’t compare these to apple airpod pros. However these will stack up to headphones in the $75 range all day.
5,I just use these to listen to the Simple Radio app on my phone. Thy are comfortable and sound decent.
3,Similar devices I have will recharge in case very well. Seems like these are always dead.
2,Theyre ok for what they are. Just wish they were louder. Running outside it doesnt drown out ambient noise like Id prefer.
2,My husband and I have the older pair and haven't had issues. Bought these for my son less than two months later one of the ear buds no longer works
3,Battery life says up to 12 hours but after 2.5 hours later they die
4,Works great and great value.
4,I'm an adult with small ears even with the smallest rubberized earpiece the hard plastic outside wouldn't allow it to sit comfortably into my ears. They kept falling out. These would be great otherwise.
4,Sound quality could be better & louder. Definitely not the type to take to the gym
5,Muy bueno
1,The negative reviews are completely accurate. Both headphones do not remain paired together. The rechargeable batteries in the headphones are DOA.Yesterday I received a new set of skull candy wireless headphones  from Amazon. not a third  parter seller.I let the headphones set for an adequate charge cycle (several hours) and tried them out.The headphones worked for less than 10 minutes. First the right headphone stopped working. I restarted the right ear bud.Within 20 minutes both ears are out of power.I made further fruitless efforts.The negative reviews accurately describe all permutations of these defects.These earbuds are not worth twenty dollars or the effort to return the product.
5,A good choice for a pair of headphones to use at the gym.
1,I bought these to take to a work conference AND go on runs with. Was happy with how they sat in my ear mostly but all ears are different. Normally would have rated these as a five star but I purchased these on 7/19/22 and as of 9/7 the right ear bud no longer works. Didn't even get 2 full months of use and that's a bummer
5,They have bass and treble regulat. I miss my original 😢 pair. Great company
3,They work pretty well and for the price you can't complain. I wish they had better noice cancelling better bass and better battery life but they are definitely useable
5,And i mean it. compared it to earphones double the price or even more and sound wise it is better!!! sure there has been cut down on things like box materials battery(still has quite enough) but otherwise everything is pretty similar and the sound is absolutely remarkable and these are just priced your pocketmoney. would really buy all my friends these and would recommend to everyone.
4,Not a comfortable fit to ears.
5,I'd say that for the price they are a good buy. They have an amazing fit and decent sound quality. My one complaint is that you will not be getting any where close to the 3.5 hours of battery life I have been getting 1.5 to 2 hours at the max. But other than that they are a great so if you are looking for a cheap pair of true wireless earbuds I'd say go for it.
5,Only use for calls. Works great for those.
5,These ear buds get the job done. User friendly great for the gym/working out discreet and small but still pack quality sound. Why spend $200+ on some fancy state-of-the-art trendy ear buds that can dial the US space station when all you really need is to listen to music and on occasion take/make a call to your grandparents?! Thank you Skullcandy
3,These feel good in your ear the problem comes with theme being not so great in the function department. They kept skipping and cutting out. I tried 2 pairs just to make sure and they both did. I went ahead and ordered a new pair from another brand and they work perfect. I wish these did since the looks and comfort is great.
3,Really good buds for the price but I couldn’t get a good fit so I returned them.  Sound is good and they have some type of rubberized coating on them.  This is great so they don’t slip out of your hands when removing from the charging case.  The Grey/Blue color I got looked good. So far I have tried these and EVO Sesh and returned both b/c I couldn’t get a good fit in my ear.  I think I am done with Skullcandy but not SC fault.
5,I had misplaced my Jib somewhere in one of the company cars I drive daily so right away I drove to locations that showed this in stock. Got to them and they said they were sold. Immediately talked to a friend who always collects and recommended it since he likes going to run in the park or gym time.
5,These are amazing for the price point I just bought a second pair!! Love them
2,Ordered these and they never fully charged. Had to return them.
5,Ok so they cool I liked them but  they just were to thick but still loved them . I lost them already though. Update I left them outside while it was raining and was worried they would not work anymore  they do just the same. Great $20 earbuds.
3,They kind of hurt if you don’t put them in at the right angle. Also falls out easily.
5,If you are looking for an easy to carry set of earbuds these are your solution. I have not tested extensively but my other Skull Candy earbuds have always delivered. I like the price and the size. I chose the aqua color as I occasionally drop an earbud and I wanted a color that would be easy to find. I use these for audio books music and podcasts.
3,Al cabo de solo 2 meses de uso el auricular derecho no coge carga.
4,Good quality. Battery stinks but that was advertised. Been a Skull Candy fan for years.
3,These earbuds are just ok.  The sound quality is acceptable for the price you pay.  The only true complaint I have is that no matter which of the included set of tips I use the material they are made of is so smooth they gradually slide out my ears every time I use them.
5,Great 👍 I love them!!
5,Best Bluetooth earbuds I've ever had the size of the case is perfect for putting in your pocket. You can wear one ear bud and leave the other one charging and keep changing them out as the battery dies.
2,Funcionan bien y se ven de buena calidad.Mi único problema con el producto es que son muy grandes (el diámetro que da a la oreja no la parte interna)  apenas me los pongo me empiezan a molestar bastante imposible usarlos por más de media hora.. El diámetro es mucho mayor con relación otros productos como los de iphone e incluso económicos como los de xiaomi..
5,It’s all good but battery life too short
4,Its alright
5,Battery lasts 4 hours or less
5,I bought these for my wife for her work outs.  She really likes them because they are very light fit in her very small ears well and the sound quality is very good for this use.  I compare these to B&O E8 Gen1. These are better in all respect.  Not sure about Gen3 of course and expect they would be challenged by that comparison.
5,SkullCandy Wireless Headphones are something Imma buy for years to come there amazing qualities there not expensive and they’re just a brand that I would continue to keep purchasing
5,I use theme every day. Great money value.
5,Works well for listening to music and talking on the phone.  No complaints.
5,Great product
5,Great product
5,Used these a lot at work cause they were cheap and I didn’t care about them too much. Kept me from going too crazy at the not-to-smart people I worked with when I was at fast food.
5,Great for the price if you need earbuds I recommend
2,I wanted to give this a try since the wired inkd from skull candy was surprisingly better than expected for the price point. These feel super cheap plastic low quality sound and I hear many momentary skips in each song. Not reliable at all. Unless you are just waiting on some good quality wireless earphone and need something meanwhile as a cheap use and throw otherwise not good at all for 25 bucks.
5,The price is well worth the investment to experience true wireless earbuds. Should have done it SOONER BUT NEVER TO LATE TRUST ME THE SOONER THE BETTER YOU WILL BE WITH THESE EARBUDS
2,These don't hold battery life at all and neither does the case
3,These headphones have a fairly low price and a fairly low profile. However as far as I know since purchasing these headphones they do not have noise cancelation capabilities. You get what you paid for.
5,I have been using these for a few weeks.  They have good audio quality they are comfortable and easy to use.  There are more feature rich headphones out there with longer battery life but these are an excellent value.  If you need a pair of nice headphones that you won’t cry over loosing or damaging then these are what you need.
4,Low priced decent quality earphones
5,Muy buenos
5,I have gone through several pairs of wireless headphones. Many just don’t stay in my ears or have terrible sound quality in the phone mode. I have never liked the look of headphones that have the part that hangs down from the ear. These have a very small piece and fit snugly but comfortably in my ears. I would buy these again for sure.
4,Battery life is horrible. Sounds is good for the price.
1,I love this brand of headphones and never had a problem before. This pair I bought will not hold a charge despite the fact I leave them untouched and on charge for more than twelve hours the longest I’ve gotten them to run is maybe 20mins or 4 songs and the left ear bud won’t work I have had these problems since I got them I tried reaching out and got nothing so a bad review is my next best option.
5,Great gift for a child and the quality exceeds the price point expectations.
3,Everything except the battery life was mediocre. Had to return. As they wouldn't stay in my ear no matter what.
5,I've tried a few different earbuds in the past few years. So far these are my favorite! Even compared to more expensive ones! Sound is great comfort is decent (ear gets a little sore after wearing for a full work day but tolerable) and the battery life of both the bud and the case is insane!!! Love these so much!!!
5,My daughter uses them for school purposes and listening to music. Noise cancellation is excellent.
5,I received a competitor brand as a gift; and I loved them. There was an issue with them however the process was so poor I decided to purchase SkullCandy as I have these as headphones. And for the price they are great!
5,Teenager likes them. Easy to use. Great sound.
3,Por el precio creo que ahí mejores opciones
4,Pretty great! Occasionally they’ll fall out of my ear but sound quality is great.
5,The product is amazing!! The sound quality is just what I needed and the noise canceling helps too with hearing the sound more. If your just using it for noise canceling tho I would opt with a different product but if your a music lover or just enjoy some peace and quite with your videos this would work too
2,Both the noise reduction and sound quality were great for the price The battery life was definitely on the low end But that was to be expected. However only two weeks into owning them the right earbud simply wouldn't charge. Case would show full charge on the left earbud would be fully charged but the right earbud wouldn't last more than 10 minutes.  The charging cable is definetly on the low end and is reversible in usb-a with exposed connectors so if You're rough with cables it will break. It's also very short totaling like 6 inches. As a bit of a "see how it really was" purchase I did not ask for a replacement. $30 was fine but replacing means I've spent $60 and that's just too much for budget earbuds.For travel where you might lose or break one sure these work unique case design is a plus but if they don't charge what can you do.
3,Fit is fine and the sound is surprisingly good. But I am not getting anywhere near the 12 hour battery life.4-6 hours is the best I have gotten so far.If it drops more I will have to adjust this review and return.
5,The size sound quality for the price.
3,Poor battery life and not quick with auto-connecting
2,I bought these bc I love skull candy ! However these were disappointing. The sound wasn’t the best and additionally my headphones didn’t charge and they had low battery after I spent 3 hours charging it with the Case. Had to return it sadly. They did look like the pictures ! Very convenient but didn’t work for me
5,I'm loving it
5,Love this product it’s small and compact love it
3,Battery died too fast.
3,The sound is great. I really love this one from Skullcandy. But darn it the things won't stay in my ears no matter what size ear bud things I use. And I'm not talking about active use. I'm mean sitting still not doing anything not even eating. I've *never* had this problem with Skullcandy before. So sad :(
5,They are really good for their price. They fit well in my ears and are very comfortable unlike airpods which hurt. The sound quality is really good for the price and was pretty surprised by the quality. Would definitely recommend these if anyone is looking for a cheaper option of wireless buds and can't pay for high end ones like air pods or galaxy buds.
4,Digging them so far
4,My only reason for the  4 star review is nothing on here or the package mentions that these aren't touch sensitve. The side of the ear bud is a push button.
2,Very poor sound quality.  Very tinny. I tried using on two different devices. Same result on both.  I expected better from Skullcandy.
5,the best earbuds I have.
3,They sound great but they only last about 3hrs that sucks.
3,Over all they aren’t to bad. Have a issue with cutting out for some reason. Tried on different phones as well. And reset and repaired them as well. They are great for while sitting at the desk. Not so well moving around.
5,No se lleven tantos de los reviews que ven para comprarlos son muy buenos cómodos y buen sonido y batería también muy buena porque nadie durará 4 horas escuchando música sin parar así que para su tamaño la batería está súper 3 hora y 40 minutos
2,Took less than a month for it to fail recharging.
5,this is my 3 or 4th skullcandy product and I have never been disappointed by any of them. The build quality and sound quality is good. The battery life on this one is also around the suggested 3hours.
3,I've always loved Skullcandy stuff but these earbuds are a 3/10. The battery life is pretty short other than that they're great.
5,Love them and would totally get another pair.Thought I killed them when they dipped in the pool. I forgot to pull them out and dunked my head.  I let them dry on the towel but then never stopped and still work weeks later.  I'm sold.
4,
3,Everything works as expected for the price point but these do not stay put in my ears when moving about like a workout
5,I bought these for my trip to Vegas and they were comfortable during the flight. They come with 3 different sized ear bud pieces to help create a comfortable fit. Sound quality has been great. Battery life has been great as well. Not the greatest headphones but great for the price.
5,I love the sound! Very clear and sharp!
5,I've been using it for a month now. I'm so impressed with it. Good sound quality and fitted better than Samsung buds I have.
5,i’m a music major and these are currently my go to in-ear divide of choice they are great and affordable
1,Was buying a new phone and the clerk suggested ear buds. I voiced my concern about losing them so she suggested I get these. They blew my expectations away at their price point. These very reasonably priced buds would be my go to on price alone. Out of the box the sound is very full and balanced. I've worked in music music education & theory esports tournaments and all manner of video gaming. My only concern is the instructions suggest charging them for 30 minutes. I charged them for for 4 hours before pairing. The left ear died after 4 songs. Maybe they were not seated in the case properly. We will see.EDIT: Oh boy. Charged these for 8+ hours and tried again. They lasted 1 song and turned off. Do not buy these.
5,I bought these to use during Zoom Meetings in a noisy office. They connect to my PC fast the voice audio is clear and the wireless range is about 120 ft. Music audio is below average but that is what I expected for $25. They sound just as good as $200 AirPod Pros so all things considered I am very satisfied.
5,Perfect for my needs.
2,They are ok for what I paid but definitely not going to be something I use long term.. no real features… very basic and for what they cost I would think better uses of it.. they fall out my ears in every way I try to put them.. I tried the big ear plugs to the smallest and still fall out every time.Like I said ok for the short term and just to have sound but not really worth the investment
5,Son muy cómodos y el sonido es muy nítido no son táctiles y eso es importante ya que no se actibaran en cada momento sin querer por lo que estaba buscando unos audifonos que cumplieran esta función. Los recomiendo ampliamente.
2,Don’t expect to hear any bass.  Operation is simple.  You can use left bud or right bud or both buds for listening to music or taking a call which is good.  The fit is secure. They are small so if you knock them out of your ear you need to be on the lookout.  My left bud is louder than my right bud.  There is no app to download for connecting them to your phone.
3,Audio is below average compared to the standard ones.
2,Battery life is maybe 3 hrs. My super cheap ones last 6-7. Doesn't want to charge half the time and have to shove something between them and the case cover to apply pressure to actually charge.
1,These are great for the price however I don't know if mine are defective or if they all are like this but after being fully charged then put away unused for a week they die. Battery is flat after sitting unused for a week. Work great when I charge them back up but they eventually die even inside the case unused for a week. Not cool and not what I expected.Update: charged left overnight no lights after I unplug them. Just dead as disco.
1,Excited to get these then disappointed in use. The left bud worked just fine. And by fine I mean like when your significant other tells you everything is fine. Its not. The right bud does not work. Its not a pairing issue. Its a does not work issue. They both have the red light in the charging case. But when I remove from the case the right does not. And they will not turn on nor off. I have tried many of the tips offered by those online as well as from Skullcandy.And all to no avail. They are defective. Im not going to play the return for a new pair game just to have the problem arise in the future. Even with a product coverage plan i do not see going through issues as this worth it.. I strongly advise against the purchase of these cheap earbuds. By cheap I am not referring to cost but to qualify. They are garbage. Returning
5,I read a lot of reviews before buying these and was not disappointed.  Some say they have issues with battery life but I have zero with that.  Sound quality is better than my galaxy buds pro and they fit in my ears better.  Great for under $30.
5,It's a really great item and it lives up to what was advertised. 😀
5,Easy to use small in size for small ears and comes with a very convenient magnetic charging case. Sound quality is great and fit comfortably and are practically weightless. Perfect for small ears and perfect in price. The sound quality and battery life will amaze you.
2,These plug up my ears. It didn't matter what ear tips I was using they would just plug up my ears rather than sitting comfortably in them.The battery life is awful. Not really much to say there. You'll get around 3 hours with these which sucks for people who have their earbuds in while they work all day like I do.There's no touch controls. They have buttons that are hard to press and you end up just shoving the buds further into your ears plugging them up more.I just ended up buying Sony's WF1000XM4's. Yeah they're way more expensive but I got really tired of budget stuff being garbage. My advice? Spend big on a brand you can trust. That way you know the quality will be great you won't have pesky little problems and you know they'll last.
1,One already doesn’t charge because it doesn’t make a good connection. The other when it does charge it will last about 30 mins and the changing station might charge the headphone once if it has been more then a few day since I last charged the station. Also have to manually pair it every time I want to use it.
5,Thanks for the fast service. The color is great.
3,I expected more. Cute but clunky. The sound quality is just okay. The buds were too big for my ears. I gave them away.
3,Battery life lasts roughly 4 hours from full charge of constant listening at like 60% volume you get 4 hours and the Skullcandy companion app doesn’t work with these unfortunately still a good buy despite two minor issues
5,I somehow lost my sesh evos and got these as a low cost option. The case is not as nice as the sesh evos but the sound and connectivity are actually better! It has been a pleasant surprise especially at this price point.
5,Sound quality is great but doesn’t have a long battery life.
5,Love these earbuds.  The instruction pamphlet included was sub-par though.  Their website had the information I needed to charge sync and start enjoying the earbuds.  The sound quality is really good much better than the price would suggest.
3,Sounds great for how much you pay for. I don't mind the short battery life since I got these for the bedside before I fall asleep. The main problem I have is that they don't stay in my ear. I have to really shove it in and then not move my jaw (like talk to my wife) otherwise it works its way out of ear.
2,I despise literally everything about these headphones never purchasing ever again. uncomfortable would never bring these to work they fall out  immediately. Never purchasing these ever again don't even fit ears properly.
5,Sound quality and connection are great
1,The color looks cool and all but that doesn’t change the fact as to why I don’t like these anymore. First of all the battery life is only like 3 hours or less or that’s what “they say”. Reason why I’m saying this is because everytime I connected these things to my Bluetooth they would literally only last like 5 minutes. That’s it! I kid you not! Even when I charged these for a couple of hours they would still die instantly. One ear piece would only connect while the other can’t? Doesn’t make sense. The sound quality is solid but not amazing enough to be able to block all the noise around you no matter where you go because I could still hear everyone and everything. Guess this is what you get for only $20 earbuds. If you want amazing SkullCandy headphones or earbuds then just get the expensive ones when you have the money or if you already have the money. Strongly recommend NOT to buy these right here
2,Operating instructions/manual is a joke -- TOTALLY useless.  Earcushions come in 3 sizes: Large Extra Large EXTRAVAGANT!  None fit my ears -- all are WAY too large and painful to use more than 10-15 minutes are require extensive ear canal manipulation to get them inserted. Work ok on my tablet but drastically degrade video quality/resolution/update rate as well as degrade/stutter audio on my desktop --- had to revert back to wired headset.  Totally useless product
1,I love Skullcandy I think it’s a great brand and I expected Skullcandy quality when I ordered these headphones even though they’re inexpensive I still expected the same quality. first they feel extremely Inexpensive like a light plastic that you could kind of crush like if you sat on it or something like it does not feel sturdy or safe. also the sound isn’t good. Additionally it takes a while for the headphones to pair which I guess isn’t that bad but it’s really annoying when you’re working and you want to switch to your earbuds but you have to wait a few moments in the middle of teaching to let it connect. they’re also a little bigger than I thought  my ears are really small and they don’t really fit and I haven’t had this problem before with any other Skullcandy earbuds and I’ve had three different pairs of Skullcandy EarPods at this point so I did not expect them to be so big I couldn’t even use them
5,Love the way they worked out perfect for work
5,Great
5,I really like it and they last a long time
3,The right ear bud will only stay on for a few minutes before randomly just turning off which is annoying and battery life could be better. I’ve bought cheaper headphones with better battery life and both headphones worked. The right one worked correctly one time before it started acting weird.
5,No esperaba que estos audifonos tuvieran la calidad y versatilidad por el precio en el que estan. si esperas no gastar mucho dinero y tener un producto de calidad compralos.
3,Super short battery life! I love them  I really like skullcandy. I was just disappointed  how quick  they did die.
3,They were to big for my ears.  The plastic that was the headphone pushed on my ear to much.  That was the only problem.
5,A MAZE BALLS
5,This model doesn't connect with the Tile app.  Other than that. they work great!!
5,Good sound
3,They're comfortable pair easily and are convenient. You cannot hear your media if there are people speaking nearby though. The volume is underpowered and there is almost no low-frequency response.
2,I have been using skullcandy products for years. I have a few pairs of jib wireless that I love and wanted to try a set that have absolutely zero wires. These Dime earbuds are worth about as much. The sound quality is full of static. The connection cuts out and reconnects every 30 seconds making for a choppy listening experience. The earbuds themselves have 3 hours of battery life. I don't know why they advertise it as a combination of the earbuds and the case. They each have different battery capacities. The only thing I liked is that they fit my ear comfortably and didn't fall out when I moved around. I don't think this is a skullcandy issue as I do love their other products. I'll be looking into their other wireless earbuds and so should you.
5,This product is a solid product I would recommend for those who may be on a budget. Great battery life for the price especially in the rechargeable case. Definitely a steal for the price.
5,Good headphones just as advertised
5,Love everything about them!
3,For a mid-price ear bud these sound ok.  The biggest issue is the battery life.  I got them for cutting the grass and they last about an hour which means they don't even get through the entire job.
3,The sound quality on these I think is really great considering the price. My only gripe is the battery life. It's really low. I can get 2.5 to 3 hours if I'm lucky. These couldn't last an afternoon hike.
5,I love how small the ear buds are and how they fit comfortably in my eats. Perfect for travel work and everyday use. I love them.
3,Good headphones for the price.  They sound almost identical to the Sesh.The Bluetooth connection can be spotty sometimes but only on videos for some reason.Also don't expect to be listening all day on a single charge.  The battery on these is pretty low so hardcore listeners probably look at the Sesh or better.  Casual listeners will love these.The included keychain attachment makes it a good pair for people on the go.
5,This is the best price to do what we need. Our grandson loses them and it doesn't seem so painful if we have to purchase another one. So far he hasn't lost these. Yay
2,They are rough.. the battery life sucks the fit of them actually hurt my ears and I only bought them cause I needed new Bluetooth headphones. It’s a waist of money.
5,It sounds so clear
4,These earbuds are good sound is great not to loud but is fine the only con is ear fatigue after a little while.
5,Skullcandy always has quality products and this is no exception.
5,I'm a manager and I am always getting phone calls these ear buds connected easily and are good audio quality. If you not looking to spend alot I'd say these will work great for you.
3,Battery life very poor and sound quality not as I aspected
1,Of the 3 other products from skull candy i have purchased problems with charging and keeping charge on the earbuds have been a common problem that they seem to over come.  The Jib and the Evo and now the Dime 2 have the same earbud charging problems where even placed on the charging case one ear bud seems to always not charge. the voice saying you need to recharge is also very quiet.  while the sound quality seems ok enough. the over all product doesnt perform as expected. Skull candy should probably stick to wired or look into more design improvements on the wireless products they are trying to get into.
2,Skull Candy usually is spot on but these are kacking in sound quality and battery endurance.
3,Use this with my phone. I. Needed an inexpensive set that it was ok if I lost. Theses are good.
5,I just love these suckers!! They are perfect for listening to music or a good book on a relaxing walk!!
5,Poder cambiar las gomitas para adaptarlas es lo mejorPueden mojarseY dura mucho la batería
4,Just wish it had a better battery life.
5,I've always bought skullcandy earphones and wanted to go wireless so I bought these they're super small and easy to hide and very comfortable. The sound quality is also great I didn't know if it would be that good because it was wireless but they sound as great if not better than their wired earphones.
5,Honestly shocked at the quality for such a good price. The battery life is not that bad either it's not exactly 3 hours but it still is a work horse for when I need to jam.  I bought three pairs to have one for my bag and two to decorate and paint the cases for my kids.
5,For the price you can’t beat them .. I’ve only used them for two hours before I plug them back in so I haven’t tested the “12 hour battery life” yet .. but I’ve absolutely  no complaints for $20.00.
5,It's more lighter
5,Best 20 bucks you’ll ever spend on headphones. Great sound perfect fit very comfortable and surprisingly well made. Battery life is a little short at 3+ hrs but charge fast in super compact case. Could not be happier with this purchase.
5,These headphones are the perfect size little case comes with is great outside of the case the battery life it's been so long but it's still worth it I think for the size
1,I was happy with this purchase for 17 days this was until the right ear's sound began to get lower until it was almost nonexistent by day 21 ( of the 30 day return time ) so I returned them! Never to order again...
2,Volume control can only be adjusted off devices. Hang up and answer is the same and sound quality is mediocre at best. Have had other bargains with better usability
5,Got this as a birthday gift for my Brother. Works well. Still going strong months later.
3,Bueno
4,Great sound definitely recommend
3,Bluetooth connect fades out while my phone is in my pocket while on my morning walks. The cutouts in the music stop immediately when I take my phone out of my pocket. They will do but I think I would rather have my wired EarPods.
2,The battery seems to be draining.  It works for a few days then doesn't work.  Then one side and the other doesn't.  It has to be constantly reset.  Ugh I really wanted to like these.
4,I am enjoying my new ear buds....
2,El diseño los materiales y los detalles son muy interesantes y de buena calidad su uso no tanto son muy grandes aún si le pongo las partes más pequeñas para insertar en mis oídos el sonido es aceptable pero para conversar en el celular o la tableta son pésimos su micrófono es deficiente y no aísla los ruidos del ambiente ofreciendo al receptor del audio un ruido general con una vos entre este....decidí no usarlos más para llamadas solo para escuchar música eventualmente.
3,I left my phone less than 20 feet away and sound cuts off. The range is weak
5,I love everything about it and I’ve seen some YouTube videos and I feel like they were a bit too harsh on their reviews. And I liked the price and let me tell you guys somethingthese earbuds are loud and fit perfectly on my ear and they are easy to charge and very portable.
3,I just bought this because of the price and the looks but other than that it's just okay. Sound quality is fair. Weak bass. Fit kinda hurts my ear even with the smallest tip.
3,Sound and fit are alright.  Still not comparable to the apple earbuds.
1,The location option hardly works. It doesn’t track all the time at least for me it hasn’t. It only tells me the last place they was used two days ago 🤦‍♂️ One bud doesn’t work at all the other is extremely low. I don’t know if I just got a bad set or something but I had high hopes for these. I love skull candy brand and have never had an issue with anything of theirs. Hoping I get a new set sent since I got the protection plan added and I will update my review.
3,The sound quality is exactly what I've come to expect from Skull Candy.  My issue is the volume.  I like to listen to music loud (tho I probably shouldn't) and they just dont go as loud as I would like them to.
5,Sounds great but does not stop outside noises.
3,Thankfully they were cheap enough to throw away. They fall out every 4 seconds without even moving.
5,Says battery life is only for 12 hours but mine have lasted longer. I like the small comfortable fit. It took me awhile to find some earbuds that fit perfectly and that were true to the size displayed.
5,Perfect for listening to music and phone calls
5,Sound quality is good .. somehow better than my AirPods .. witch I threw away !..
5,Buena relacion calidad - precio bonitos comodos pequeños me gustaron...
5,Really good last a long time and very durable
5,yass
2,These are as small as a key fob and only $20. If you're looking for some small cheap earbuds to go onto your lanyard or backpack these are for you only if you don't mind the bare minimum quality sound or the painful edges of the earbuds pushing on your ears. These last a few hours battery but I could never keep them in for more than an hour due to the ear pain these caused. Do not recommend if you're looking for comfortable.
5,I love these head phones. I use them for the gym and to talk on the phone when i’m on a walk or cleaning my house. I was impressed by the quality! And they have a nice look to them also!
3,Biggest issue is the battery- am lucky to get an hour. Noise cancellation doesn’t exist.
5,Amazing sounding earbuds for an insanely cheap price there noise cancellation is amazing and I can’t hear anything around me when I wear them my only problem with them is that there battle try life is very short at only 4 hours. Look at rtings.com review for these.
5,La conectividad entre dispositivos es increible!
1,You cant talk on phone with these for nothing. Kitchen & porch are exactly together and you cant go in or out without the other person not hearing aything you trying to say. Worthless at work. Theres no noise cancelling at all. I 100% dont reccommend for phone calls.  Its the reason i bought them.
5,Loved the quality and convenience and the price was great. Easy to operate and battery life and sound is great
5,I love the fit and the sound quality is great
5,For the price you get an amazing deal! They sound good enough and the battery lasts long enough but you don't have to pay 200+ dollars!
3,I like the design the color and the sound displayed but it dies too quick…. 30-45mins of str8 use before needing too be recharged.
5,I love my skull candy.
5,These work great and so far have used while cleaning house zoom calls and road trips so I can listen to a book while the rest of the family listens to their podcasts. I have only used once for answering a call and they seemed to have worked well.
2,I like these ear buds. They are small and sound good. But two weeks in the left earbud will play but the sound is so low. At full volume I cannot hear the podcasts or music. Just a soft muffled sound of what’s playing.
5,Seen many complaints. Honestly the best pair I gotten. They are loud enough for me to work in and good for almost 3.5 hours. Enough time to charge them on my first break at work. My ears are small so it was fine to wear for me.
5,My daughter loves them just what she needed I believe the price was right
5,Buen diseño. Se adapta a la oreja gracias a que trae 3 tamaños distintos. Buen sonido. Bateria de gran duración.
2,Sound was okay for the money but not what i expected from skullcandy. Dont stay in your ear very well if you move around.
3,They are not GREEN....SEA FOAM GREEN!  A little "light" green for me. Sound is ALWAYS awesome with SkullCandy. Button controls way too complicated and have to be pushed in sequences...like video game code. Awkward and difficult.  For the price and what I use them for perfect. SEA FOAM not GREEN!
3,The sound quality is great and they're really nice earbuds. However my left ear bud continuously disconnects and sometimes re-syncing works and sometimes it doesn't. Makes a clicking noise when it happens so I'm not sure if it's a manufacturer issue or not. But other than sometimes having to mess with them for (sometimes) an hour to get them to work they're pretty good
5,Absolutely perfect for portable use. I put them on my key ring and bring them everywhere. They don’t sound bad either if you want mega bass you will want the Indy evo but for the price these are a steal. Buttons are not great but I can live with that.
5,I like that they turn on and off as soon as you place them in their case. I dislike how they fit in my ear
5,Very clear
2,I bought these because they marketed them as "Dime" thinking the size.  While the stems are smaller the buds even if you use the smallest rubber pieces they seem like normal size ear buds.  My daughter has small ears and these didn't work out.  We returned.
5,My grandson loves them. He likes the sound quality & battery life
3,This product is okay for the most part. but i have the hardest tule keeping it in my ear. it always falls out and i get frustrated and just don’t use it
5,Got this for my twin boys. So far they love them.
5,I really love these ear buds. The noise cancellation is great. The sound is great  The battery doesn't last quite as long as it says. I would say 2.5-3 hours. Not the full 3.5 hours that is stated. Other than that this product is great.
5,These are great for when Im tired  my kids asking me for snacks
5,These earbuds are exactly what I needed for usage at a deskjob.  The sound quality is fantastic.  Pairing was easy and the single earbud to double earbud switch over is seamless.  I would recommend these if you're looking for a very economical pair of earbuds.
5,These are great! My wife has beats pro wireless earbuds and I can’t tell the difference in sound. They fit well in the ear and work great in my motorcycle helmet. Also I have crystal clear phone calls in my helmet. Awesome price for awesome earbuds!
2,These are the worst pair of Bluetooth earbuds I’ve purchased . I got maybe 30 minutes of use before both earbuds died . After charging and attempting to use them three times with the same result  I’ll be returning them .
5,These headphones are always on me since they have a hook and it stays on my keychain! Durable and good battery life.
5,I like them they do last 6 hours but still to test the water resistance
5,great
1,If I paid $1 for these it would be a waste of money! Fell out of my ears constantly. Tried each of the end pieces to see if they would fit better. Each one was worse than the one before. NEVER stayed in my ear to have a conversation. Not even 1 minute. Charge lasted about 4 hours on a really good day- when they were not used. Terrible product! I used them literally 1 day and as I was trying to used them while I washed dishes one fell in my dish water. Never worked again. I never could keep the 1 in to make a call after that!
2,The sound is crisp and nice but it's hard to listen to them when it hurts the cartilage in my ears after 10 minutes of use. You're better of getting the Jib True version where it doesn't treat your ears like a horrible pressure point
2,I can't get these to stay in my ears. They've fallen out in the grocery store going on walks around the neighborhood and just walking around the house. I end up trying to twist them and push them harder into my ears to try to keep them in and that ends up hurting my ears.If it wasn't for that these would be alright. Easy to pair headphone case is nice sound quality is pretty good. I don't know if it's just my ears but they just aren't working to stay in my ears and be comfortable.
5,My son was thrilled when he got these for Christmas
5,Best ear buds I have bought in a long time for a great price
5,I was very impressed with battery life and sound if these earbuds. I really didn't expect them to sound this good for the price I paid
5,I really like these little ear buds they do a good job of cancelling out the surrounding noise! I use them daily to walk on the treadmill and row! They do start to fidget when I start to sweat but it’s to be expwcred
5,Solid backup earbuds - battery a little too short if you listen to music all day at work like me. I just keep them in truck in case I forget my others. Amazing for the price. I got the warranty too so pretty dang good $25
4,It's pretty good for the price.
5,
5,It does what it's meant to do. It's not the best but it's not the worst. It's a nice deal.
5,These arent going to amaze anyone but ive had wireless earbuds that were twice as expensive that havent performed as well. Ive used these all day everyday since i got them and they're super worth 25 bucks. Skullcandy did us all a solid on this one.
5,Amazing headphones especially for the price! For the few hours a day I use them they are great for noise cancellation. Mowing the yard shopping etc… battery could be a little better but I use them every day and charge the “case” once a week.
5,Love them & my glow in the dark case.
2,I bought these to use just around the house to keep myself from tangling in cords while I listened to music & audiobooks. They have great sound quality as I was expecting from skullcandy; but the battery doesn’t last more than 1 hour(even after a full charge) and if you have even the smallest amount of perspiration in your ear they fall out. Very dissatisfied.
2,Very uncomfortable fall out easily and have sound quality far below what I expect from Scullcandy earbuds.
3,For some reason I didn’t get all my cushions/caps that fit in your ear. Also they fall out constantly. Maybe I don’t know how to fit my ears right? Very disappointed.
3,Hard to keep in your ears otherwise a great product
5,Sounds great
5,love how small they are. they have amazing audio as expected.
5,These things are awesome! I've gone through multiple different brands of wireless ear buds and these are by far the best. The case is very compact and the ear buds fit perfectly. The sound quality is great and they easily connect to my phone everytime.
5,Great earphones. These truly wireless headphones do not have the common problem of cheap headphones where they constantly unpair or are hard to pair to your phone. The sleek and minimal design make it easy to strap onto your keychain to bring along and never forget your headphones.10/10
3,I was lured by the price but I now wish I'd spent a little more for a better product. I have to wear they inverted in my ear to get them to fit without falling out - weird.Soun d quality isn't that great either.
5,Great for price
2,Love the red color. Hate that every couple of minutes the sound completely pauses for a few seconds. Have purchased other Bluetooth wireless Skull candy earbuds and this did not happen. I'd return but I threw out the packaging.
5,For the price you cannot beat the quality of this product.
5,As described wish the battery life was better but I'm honestly just being picky. The overall noise cancellation is what s 3.5/5 I live in NY and can still hear the train announcements at full volume :/ btw I was listening to Kpop so yeahhh...
5,Amazing earned great value for mooney
5,It’s good to the price good size makes the work.
3,these are much bigger than they look and actually fit better in my ears when i swap L and R.
3,They're super nice and work well but they were very uncomfortable for me :( had to return.
3,I like these for the sound. Definite value for the price. Just plan on buying a USB charge cable the included one is about 4 inches long is all.
5,Great value and good quality
3,Right earbud has less output than the left one. They do fall easily.
2,I wanted to use them as a hands free for my phone.  Answering the phone is problematic partially because of there size.  And I used them seperately for a tele-meeting the first one died after 30 minutes the  second one lasted 40 minutes.  So for this purpose they are not satisfactory.On the plus side they have good sound quality and are fairly comfortable.
5,The sound is incredible!
5,For the price its really good product
5,Exelent price for comfortable fotment small form factor exelent audio quality variety of colors and exelent battery life. Definitely recomend if your looking for very compact an light earbuds!
4,They work really well
5,These are so nice I wear them at the gym all the time and the sound is fantastic the best I've ever used.  They cancel all sound I cannot hear my weights when lifting at all.
5,For the price you can't beat the quality and sound.
5,Great soundeasy to useVery lightweight and convenientThe case snaps closed which is great since I’ve had earbuds fall out of cases with other models
1,I bought these and have charged them fully on multiple occasions. The left bud dies after 20 minutes everytime. The right bud lasts approx. 45 minutes. I have had these about 3 weeks and I don't think I have the box anymore so I hope I can return these.
5,Give it to my friend as a present he said he really liked them And he said it fit perfectly in his ears
5,The sound is good I doesn't cancel the noise that good and tha battery life could be better but still a good purchase for the price
3,Good
1,Like the title says they will fall out of your ears. No matter what other size rubber tips I tried they just keep falling out making them useless for me
2,Been using Skullcandy for years but the two pairs of truly wireless earbuds I've bought are not up to par. These don't stay in your ears and are very uncomfortable. Also I have to turn my volume all the way up just to get good sound. I will be returning.
1,Sound is good not great.  HUGE amount of interference on phone calls.  Awful.  Doesn't stay connected with phone in my back pocket and buds in my ears... Just like every other sub-$50 earbud set I've bought from amazon..... Sad.Update.Won't stay connected constant skips hiccups disconnects interference.... With phone feet away with line of sight.  Garbage.  Total garbage.
2,The left side bud won’t connect:(
5,Battery life is great they don’t fall out of my ears connected easily. I have nothing bad to say about these.
5,
5,So far I have no complaints on these wireless ear buds. 😎
5,Bestheadset ever
5,These came as described with fast shipping. They fit my ears well and have decent sound.
5,Todo esta perfecto en funcionalidad y estetica
5,There a comfortable fit good sound and lightweight. Just wish they had longer battery life but still a good buy overall for the price
5,Love these skull candy is always amazing and they always hit the mark! These are great for listening to music and for talking on the phone! The charge stays for a very long time! These were well worth the buy! I definitely recommend! 😎
5,The person. I got this for loves  it
1,Defective wouldn’t charge or turn on had on the for at least 4 hours and they still never charged or turned on waste of time and money
1,To start I'm a commercial truck driver so hands free while driving is a MUST. Now I've used multiple different brands models of bluetooth ear buds. I do have and love my Skullcandy over the collar inked bluetooth got those through best buy with warranty (which is a must with semi wired). As for the dime buds I was hoping they carried the same back round noise cancellation as do the ink'd wireless but sadly they are awful.. all the boxes are checked for them to go back sound quality is very metallic no base call quality is TERRIBLE the caller cannot hear you but everything else around you comes out loud. Why I thought these would be good maybe cause it's Skullcandy.. Do not even bother.. If anything grab the *update tribit flybuds C1* or Mpow x3s you'll be amazed by sound quality.
4,Great sound for price. Nice small case and comfortable fitment
2,They where great for like a month now one is like 50% volume on max. Bummer
4,Good for the money.Smaller than I thought.Good back up pair
5,These are some good ear buds. The sound quality is great. They have good battery life. Also they come in a really pretty shade of blue.
3,Exactly what you would expect for the money. Fit sucks wouldn't do anything active in them. Cheap plastic and are not very comfortable. Sound quality Is pretty good. Battery life is good. Never had them die on me
5,I got these for my 11 year old daughter! They are not overpriced which is good considering my daughters age! The quality is great and she loves them! Good fit cute case!
5,
3,Very poor battery life when I received them. The left ear also has a fuzzy sound unless pressed together.
3,Poor battery life
3,Great sound quality. Stays in the ear decently. I put the charging station on my keyring so I don't lose it. Battery life is a bit short. I work 8 hour shifts and have to charge it mid day. Bluetooth distance is nice. About 30 feet?
5,This headphones is really great for the price. I use it daily and there are no complaints I can come up with. Pick it up it you want to test out wireless earbuds. You won't regret it.
3,So sound quality is good. Love the colors. The battery seems okay. My biggest issue is they will not stay in my ears. And they hurt! Even with the smaller ear things they still don't work. Which is sad because I wanted to love these
2,Hurt my ears won't stay in if I move at all
3,I use them for my walk to work and at work. And I feel they could be better. It seems like one pod is louder than the other. Also seems like one last longer than the other. They are good but just thought they would have been better.
1,These are so cheaply made and I never got them to turn on even after I charged them for 2 days I threw the box away which is why I did not ask for a refund back
2,Literally fell out of my ears the second I put them in tried each earbud size and didn't fit. The sound was nice until they would fall out. Definitely not swear proof since I'm doing a million sweaty things and they fall out immediately. Don't waste your time.
5,Amazing sound quality for the price this is honestly better sounding than my old JBL earbuds that cost $100. Small and compact and has good battery life
2,You get what you pay for. Low battery life which I expected. The case is good small and compact but scratches easily. Earbuds feel good but fall out from time to time. But what gets me upset is trying to open the case. I have to use something to pop it open. Would've given a 4 star but the case is what gets me.
3,The earbuds are alright but the sound cuts out too often which is very annoying. You’d be better off spending a little bit more money a nicer pair of earbuds.
2,Really uncomfortable in my ears fell out CONSTANTLY. I don't use them at all lmfao. The battery life is decent... but nowhere near as convenient as a significantly cheaper wired pair. Had potential but they're retired to the junk drawer about 90% of the time.
3,4 hour battery life at best. NOT 12
3,Decent sound quality easy to set up and use but they’re not nearly loud enough. At maximum volume I could still hear my footsteps while running on the treadmill. I gave them to my husband.
1,Edit - I had to edit my review  as within 2 months of purchase  one of the earbuds volume just died off  now i am listening to this mostly out of my left ear . I thought skull candy being a big name brand will have some lasting quality  but 2 months is unacceptable even for a cheaper earbud .it has a nice sound and fits well the only draw back is that there is no battery indicator so u dont know when u need to recharge it  i have suddenly run out of battery a few times and it is really annoying . the key ring attachment is surprisingly useful though
5,Love it so much
1,These are awful! They worked great for the first five minutes and since all it does is cut in and out echo and bounce between the two sides. I had them fully charged and read everything and researched it- I just think these aren’t worth it. Save your money or stick to plug in ones.
5,The best head phone purchase  you could buy
5,Can't beat the price for the quality
5,Good sound quality and decent battery life
5,
1,They do not charge and the right side does not turn on. These are not what they are represented to be. If I still had the box I would send them back but stupid me I am stuck with them and getting rid of them.
2,Bought these because I thought they were good for small ears but no.
5,Every once in a while it can miss the charging contacts in the charging case. Other than that it's awesome; especially at this price point.
5,good sound quality no bass but for $20 im happy
2,Pretty disappointed in these to be honest. Even for the low price point I didn't expect that these would crap out so soon. Left earbud just doesn't charge anymore. That's what we all get for buying mass produced plastic garbage from China. Should have known better.
2,I fully charged the earbuds per instruction prior to first use. I’ve only used them twice and am returning them. The first use was strictly for a zoom meeting- simple. Listening mostly little talking. After 1 hour 45 minutes there was only 10% charge left. The 2nd time same process. Fully charged same use - zoom meeting. I thought maybe I’ll just use one earbud for a little while to save the battery. Wrong! After 1 hour 30 minutes there was only 5% battery remaining! Don’t waste your money. I review every purchase before buying. The reviews on this product must have been fake.
1,Una estrella porque es lo mínimo.Llegaron dañados. No cargaban. No funcionaban. Completamente muertos. Los dejé cargando por más de doce horas y nada. Los tuve que devolver.
3,The sound quality is great but there is no noise canceling for phone calls in case anyone wanted them for that. Battery life is great connect easily and quickly and fit nice in my Keychain. Like a 3 or 4 out of 5 for me
1,Straight up trash... do not purchase.Horrible battery life & auto-connects constantly. I’ve missed important phone calls because my phone was ringing through my earbuds half a house away from me while they’re both in their charging dock... sitting by my lunch cooler.
5,item as it describes
2,Ok for music but avoid if you need to answer a call. You will lose friends and lose business if you answer the phone with these. Didn’t fit right in my ears but I’ve been told I’m a bad listener so still working on that.
2,These are advertised to last for 12 hours without a charge. I wear them at work and get at most 2 1/2 hours per earbud before it goes down to 10%.
5,It lasts about 3 hours but that is good for the cost of these.
2,These are really uncomfortable! I haven’t ever had an issue with earbuds being too uncomfortable to wear for more than a minute…. until I tried these on. I don’t have especially small ears either!
1,I am re-purchasing the headphones after losing my first pair. Was disappointed to find that the lanyard loop was not attached to the earbud case upon opening the item. It doesn't appear that one can remove and attach it as needed. This defeats the purpose of my purchase and I'll be contacting the seller.
1,These head phones need to literally be within 1 foot of your phone or they will cut off conatantly. Cant even keep my phone in my pocket. Rediculous
3,I wanted to like this Dime because I like skullcandy but the buttons are way too hard to push it's  like digging into your ear just to power it on.
5,These things are amazing for the price. Although the bass is punchier than purists may prefer it doesn't affect the quality of the sound very much. And for $25 there's no question these are the best buds you can buy.
5,Sound is okay but volume control could be better. I turned the volume to the lowest but it is still loud.
2,I enjoy skullcandy products but this one was by far the worst. Would not stay in my ear (no matter what bud size I had) and couldn't find the ear hooks that would fit to help them not fall out of the ear. Returned.
5,Estan geniales. Por el precio tienes una calidad excelente de audio y muy resistentes. Siempre me pasaba que se arruinaban rápido mis audífonos pero estos estan perfectos para todo uso.
5,Absolutely AMAZING!! Just like the photo. Charging casesingle use features and noise blocking capabilities are a plus and did I mention the sound quality is unreal. Reasonably priced quality made Awesome features and excellent sound. Very happy with my purchase.
5,Worth the money if you need a inexpensive earbud option.
5,Great earbuds for any uses you may have there very small and have good bass to them I like them because they are compact and affordable I highly recommend this purchase the battery life could be a little longer though
5,Best. Earphones. Ever! Thats it that’s the review. They’re the best ones I’ve bought yet and super inexpensive for the quality. Even bought another pair for my mother in law!
3,Didn’t come with charger block so I don’t get how I’m supposed to charge it I have a back up usb but what if I didn’t ya know that’s why it’s three stars.
2,Very disappointed with these headphones. I purchased twice and they both have the same issues. Possibly defective but I think it's just a poor quality product.I've noticed static issues the right ear constantly falls out uncomfortable fit and poor bass.These headphones should be no more than $5.
2,I like the look however it does not last 12 hours as it promotes. Not even 6 hours. Within 4 hours I'm at 10% of battery life or it turns off/dead.
2,Attempted all the self-fixes on the internet and none of them fixed the fact that neither of my earbuds charged while in the case even though the case itself was fully charged and plugged in.
2,These are the worst! I know they are inexpensive but go to the dollar store the ones you get there will be better! They won’t stay in your ears they constantly fall out and after about 2 hours of picking these up after falling the battery will be dead. Save your money do not buy
5,I've gone through several wireless earbuds and finally found a pair that don't hurt my ears and they stay in snuggly.  They are small enough for my pocket charge fast and connected without me having to do anything.
5,Great product
5,I'm so glad they had a smaller size for people with littler ears.
5,Really nice bang for your buck!
5,It had a good sound
1,These ear buds have horrible sound quality for music zero stars 0 stars. On the plus side they're small and fit good. The case was difficult to open felt like the top was going to snap off.
1,Bought these headphones a few days ago and haven't been able to use them because it would not charge. I tried to charge it for one hour before initial use and when I turned it on it said battery low 10%. I thought to myself okay it may be one of those that requires long charging so I plugged it in over night. Light was red then changed to green and still when I turned it on it said 10% played for 2mins and then shut off. I was sent a defective device. I was excited to get them because generally Skullcandy has great sound and bass I'm very disappointed
5,Great product I love the colors and how easy I can use them.
5,Le falto una almohadilla (L) lo demas llego perfecto a panamá los recomiendo excelente calidad de material de los auriculares
2,Sound quality during calls is too low on the highest level. I wouldn’t buy this product if I knew it was going to be so bad. Overall sound for media playback is acceptable as any average low cost wired earbuds.Nothing special.
3,Full charge only last 3 to 4 hours
3,Short battery life and a ridiculous charge time.  5 hours to charge the case is unreasonably long.
5,Don't fit very good in my ears
2,Overall I’m pretty disappointed with these. Sound quality is “OK” but I get only about 1 1/2 hours before they are dead. I purchased these for conference calls so it’s not like I’m pushing high volume music through these.I do not recommend these ear buds.
1,There must be an issue with the prime day shipments they received from Skullcandy because I've had two sets sent to me with the exact same issues. I charge the earbuds till the light is green try to turn them on the left one doesn't turn on at all and the right ear is only at 10%.
5,I love these earbuds they sound great and work great. They do hurt my ears from time to time but other than that I am happy with them! Well worth the money!
1,Out of the box they will not charge trid cleaning points different cables nothing worked and i got them  just before I went on vacation and returned after the 30 day return window.
3,Comfortable in your ear but battery life less than 2 hours of continuous use.
5,Great ear buds.. use them everyday walking the dog!
5,Great
5,These were for my Son for class. He uses them alot I school for his classes. Loves them
5,These things r great. Holds a charge excellently and they're more than loud enough. Have not had em die on me yet and I tried to kill them but still made it the day.
5,My boys like them for there Cell phone games and You Tube. Small convenient and comfortable.
5,For the price these earbuds are well worth the cost. Great sound quality. I have small ears so they can become a bit uncomfortable if using for extended periods of time.
3,I love my Skullcandy products. But the Skullcandy Dime true wireless I was like disappointed in because they don’t stay charged very long. The sound quality is wonderful!!
1,Used these earbuds for about 8 months and started to have trouble with them constantly turning back on and connecting to devices while in the case this would cause them to steal my audio in the middle of a phone call or be completely dead when I went to use them. Recently they have started to lose audio when a phone call is made and I have tried to check settings and re-pair multiple times to no avail. If you want a warranty replacement you need to pay to have it shipped back at your own cost and it's not really worth the price for me to ship these in when I could get a new pair from another maker. I've had no name earbuds last longer than these so I'm quite disappointed in the quality of these.
5,They are excellent I keep them on standby when I don’t have my AirPods
5,don't spec to much for a 20 bucks headphones bad sound quality easy to lose uncomfortable in your hear.
5,For 25 bucks these are a steal I personally think the sound quality lacks a little amount of bass but not a deal breaking amount compared to my asivio one x pros these are good but not as good
1,I usually LOVE skull candy products but these are useless. I got them for the gym and  the distance from my head where the earbuds are located and my pocket where my phone is located is too far and the signal just breaks constantly.  Don’t recommend
3,Battery life is about 2 hours just for staying charged not use time.
5,I like the sound and that is not expensive.
3,I tryed these out of few times  they were not crystal clear I'm guessing i should spend a lot money to get the sound i want i dont plan to give up on skull candy's
1,These worked correctly for all of 1 month. My daughter has only had them since April 2022 and they completely stopped working in June. The issue is they won’t charge at all. When they would charge the battery life wouldn’t last half the day. Save your money.
5,Sound ok
2,Sound quality is poor. Not one of their better products.
5,I love the case and they sound amazingand they come with more t hug an one size ear buds
2,Compared to their other similarly priced models these are lacking bigly in the sound quality and bass department. The lid is also not the best but understandable for the price. The jib is a better option imo
5,Sometimes the smaller things are the better these earbuds are small but they are turned over by their amazing sound noice and battery quality that it doesn't even matter overall they are amazing
5,The bass was so incredible that I felt it in my teeth 😋LOVE them!
1,I bought these because I've had other skullcandy headphones before but only the left ears turns on after letting it charge.  Truly disappointed right now. I must have gotten a defective pair....money down the drainNow I have to order some new ones.
5,Good quality for a great price
2,The only reason I bought these was because of the good reviews and price. I am not an audiophile but have other earbuds around the same price that surpass this for miles. These are not good the sound is very metallic no matter how many times I messed with the settings. The battery life is atrocious my other buds last a little over a month on 1 single charge and that's me using them at the gym for at least an hour for 5 or 6 days a week. You get what you pay for so do yourself a favor cough up an extra $10 and get something much better.
1,This would be great if both sides worked but for some reason only the right one works. Don't waste your money.
5,Love love LOVE! So glad these are so affordable and so good! At last a company doesnt feel the need to charge an arm and leg for technology thats been around for a while.
5,I like all the things about the ear buds awesome sound bass battery life.
3,Disappointed. I thought they were supposed to last 12 hrs. My first use they barely made it 3 1/2 hrs. The second time less than 3 hrs. My workout are 4 or more hrs. Very disappointed.
5,Liked: price ease of use and pairing fit small size nice sound quality. The earbud attachment make an Ok job of canceling outside noise.Dislike:lowish battery life (3 hrs more or less)
3,If they fit your ears they are great!They were too big ( the hard piece)Therefore wouldn't stay in and we're not comfortable.If they had fit they were wonderful earbuds.I probably just have small ears!
5,My son wanted these and said they “save his life” on the over 1 hour bus ride to school.
1,I'm gonna be honest this product really sucks for the price the only thing you're really paying for is the mediocre earbuds at best and the tile feature. The tile feature can only be used when they're not dead which they will be frequently if you don't charge them EVERYDAY.
2,Bought these earbuds hoping that skull candy would live up to my expectations. I own a set of over the ear wireless headphones that are great. Unfortunately I was very disappointed. These do not hold a charge for very long and the left earbud started crackling and eventually stopped working all together just a few months after owning them. I would pay a little more for better quality and to save on the frustration of having to charge them so often.
5,Great quality for the price! Very discreet size battery life is decent for such a compact design.
5,I genuinely love these headphones. The battery life isn’t a big issue for me since I don’t use them for more than 2 hours at a time. Sound quality is amazing isolates very well.
5,These have great sound quality. They are really nice for the price.
2,I bought these because they were Skullcandy brand and they were cheap; thinking they would be pretty good. I had a better experience with my old Onn brand earbuds from Walmart.
5,Bought these for my boyfriend and he really likes them. The audio when he is on the phone is a little muffled but for the price I think they are great.
5,Nice product
5,Great headphones as always from skullcandy.
5,Use them when I'm at work
2,I love the case and how well the buds stay In the case. I am very disappointed in the buds themselves … they will not stay in my ears at all!I don’t  have the original box so I can’t return them. Waste of money.
5,Charge last a long time. Noice cancellation is great.
5,
5,very nice packaging exactly what I ordered.
5,I bought these for my mom to use at the gym and she loves them. My brother also has a pair and I will get a set when my Indy Fuels wear out.
2,Dos meses y medio después de la compra el audífono izquierdo no funciona. Solo se conecta el lado derecho ya seguimos las recomendaciones que tiene skullcandy en su página y no funcionaron. Solicité directamente con skullcandy hacer válida mi garantía y recibí un código pero era más caro pagar el envío hasta California que comprar otros earbuds. Esta vez buscaré otra marca.
5,Don't waste your money with the dumb looking ibud things!  These are amazing!  connects to your phone as you take them out of the magnetic charging case!
5,I like the convenience of it being small and I can put the earphone on my keychain
1,Stopped trying to get it to work after a week would hardly ever connect to my phone and if it did only one earbud would connect
5,I have been through a few pairs of low cost Bluetooth earbuds. These are by far the best and less than half the cost of others I have tried. Big sound.
3,They sound incredible  but the battery life is disappointing. The 12 hour battery life as advertised includes recharge time  so I'm only getting 5 hours of uninterrupted listening time.
5,Best dime for my dime
5,Great value  battery life could be better but very happy overall.
5,Good
5,Love these Skullcandy pods. Good sound and battery life. Use them on the go. Last a full day with normal use. Never drops signal and also good for phone calls too
1,I really liked these  in the beginning. No problems at all. But after about two months the left side no longer keeps a charge and almost immediately dies! I would usually buy skullcandys wired earbuds and I was lucky if they last three months. But they were cheap and sounded good so I didnt mind. I honestly thought these were different but it turns out they last about the same amount of time. Ive never dropped them or gotten them wet they just one day stopped charging.
2,Battery life is horrible
5,Wish the battery life was betterBut it’s coolAin’t like I’m going long distant without a charging unitOver: Very impressed ear bud performance with out breaking our bank.
2,sound quality bad. I realize that consumers rated them high but they are much worse than others that i have priced about the same Case is not made to seal has openings on the back two slashes bad design
5,The battery isn't the best but it's good for the price.
1,I wish I could get a refund on these. They literally stopped charging/working after only 3 months. When they were working they'd fall out of my ears regularly. Too bad I threw away the package. Would not recommend unfortunately
2,I’ve done every troubleshooting thing I could Google. The touch controls don’t work at all. Nothing. And the sound is low. The volume is turned all the way up but the sound is barely audible. Disappointed.
1,I’m genuinely shocked I thought Skull Candy was a better brand than this. I decided to try these out however in the past I’ve used the JLab Go Air earbuds same price point. The battery on those last forever they were sound cancelling and provided a pretty stable connection. These Skull Candy ones are nothing of the sort. I figured they’d at least be comparable but the battery dies in like 3 hours at best. The JLab ones would literally get me through an entire 8 hour shift and finally be low on battery when I get home. For the same price I will definitely not be purchasing these again. Go buy JLab’s version of these.
2,The sound is okay coming out of them however microphone echoes horribly even with a single ear piece being used.  For a $20 pair of wireless ear buds they're okay.
5,I've been with them for several weeks now and no problem at the moment the battery life is good and the sound quality is decent.
5,I like these headphones alot.  They work great and sound good
5,Great battery at least for me not a heavy user of ear buds but these always come in clutch.
5,Decent
1,I bought these because I like the idea of earpods/buds with no cord. I like the case they come in and that they come with multiple different ear bud sizes. However even with the smallest size they don't fit in my ears and HURT! I wish I would have kept the box so I could return them.
5,mostly what i like about the product is a quality-price ratio arguably best one on the market
5,The ear buds really surprised me. The charging case it's really small. Most of the time I forget its in my pocket. Excellent sound quality. The price isn't bad.
5,I liked them better than the tozo t6
1,To start off they sound great but they don't  stay in your ears and the battery life isn't great I get like an hour of music and the sound quality is okay but it gave me a headache after awhile
1,Not much bass in the sound. But didn’t matter the right one quit working at one month.
2,Solo me agrado el precio el sonido lo paso no lo recomiendo para lugares con un poco de ruido en tal caso se pierden los bajos.
5,Good value . Wear them during work outs
1,I was very excited about these earbuds! They are such a great price! I charged them up paired them to each other and to my device and everything was great! Sound quality wasn’t the best but I was willing to overlook that. Then all of a sudden the right one powered off. For no reason. On a full charge after two minutes of use. I charged them again. Same thing happened again. The right one just refuses to hold a charge.
2,good sound quality long battery life took one star because they dont stay in my ear which is frustratingi originally wrote that first line weeks after receiving earbuds. I am back almost 4 months later and the earbuds have stopped charging out of nowhere. very frustrating
5,They work great and fit in my ear with no issues. While running they stay in too.
5,Love these buds!
2,They worked great… for a few weeks then I started experiencing problems like random pausing cutting out and cutting back in constantly going further into the song or video than where I was at and now the left one is significantly quieter than the right one
5,Sound is great for the price. I have been getting just short of 3hrs with a full charge.  Great for workouts. Easy on the ear as well.  Pretty light.
1,I bought the black dimes and I can't get the left headphone to work at all. Won't turn on or connect. Tried the resetting and it doesn't fix it. Light on it turns red when it's in the case but thats it. Tried to find your contact info but this was the only way I could find to ask for help. The right side is perfect. I was really looking forward ward to these because I loved the previous gray pair I had. Please help me get it working or please refund me thank you
5,Great earbuds for the price.  Sound is awesome.  I would recommend to family and friends
2,The product itself is ok.  It comes with a charging case that could be attached to your keychain.  The ear pieces could be used one at a time left or right.  Both ear pieces has its own microphone.My only gripe is that the battery life on each of the ear pieces started going bad within 2 weeks of purchase.  Towards the end the left piece would only last for 15 minutes and right for 10 minutes.  I ended up just returning and buying a different brand.
5,My son luves them
3,Definitely worth the money. only thing was my ear canals hurt after extended use. Not ergonomic for my ears. Hopefully it fits other customers better.
3,Great sound quality but not enough battery to last a full 2 hour Zoom meeting. Easy to pair once I figured out the confusing instructions.
2,They keep falling out with any size rubber cover. I have wired Skull Candy and have  Apple ear pods which stay fine so can say these are a good idea but poorly executed.
5,These are small sleak lightweight and have great sound for the price. Would highly recommend for working out or running.
1,(If you have ever used any of Skullcandy's cheap wired earbuds these sound exactly the same. Perfectly fine especially on the cheap. I am surprised you can have earbuds that have this decent battery in a package this small! Only issue I have had is failure to charge/disconnect every now and again when I don't seat them right in their case. Otherwise everything I could hope for out of tiny wireless headphones on the cheap!)(EDIT)OK so the seating issue has gotten MUCH worse. It takes about 8 minutes at a time to get them seated properly so that they actually power off and charge. Now if jostled even slightly one of the buds will come loose stop charging and auto-connect to my phone stopping my music when I am listening in the car or through the phone speakers. Unfortunately these things are basically just landfill now. Shame.
2,Falls out of ear constantly poor battery life
5,Fast charging comfortable easy to use. Battery life could be longer but with how fast they charge no complaints
1,The worst earbuds I have purchased so far.  Only one works at a time.  And they often turn off so that I have to “forget this device” and go back and find in Bluetooth SEVERAL times during one use.
5,Good product 👍
5,I tested and loved these sporty earbuds but too child like design. Gifted to my step-daughter she's gleaming with cheer.
2,Keeps automatically turning on even in the charge case and connecting to my phone. Runs the battery super fast that way. Very disappointed.
3,The buds do not fit in the ear tight enough to achieve the same bass quality as the same brand that is the wired version. Disappointed.
5,Absolutely love gooodDon't think twice just buy.
5,These buds are good but arent very loud on LG phones. They work well on my laptop though.
3,La  batería no me gustó
1,Didn’t even have these for a full week and the. left bud stopped working waste of money do not buy. This is why I stick with wired earbuds.
5,I normally use my ear buds for the gym. They really do cancel out all noises. The battery last long as well.
3,Background noise too loud
2,I haven't had much luck keeping these headphones in my ear.  They will not stay in That's after switching out the size of the ear buds as well.  No luck.  I do not recommend these buds at all.  I would've returned them if I would've used them sooner.  My return date lapsed before I knew what a lemon these were.
1,I use this product for personal use I could hardly hear through them they weren't consistent terrible product save your money!
1,I bought these 06/21/21. 1 year and a month later the batteries no longer hold a charge beyond a couple of minutes.This was my first time buying wireless earbuds. Maybe that is the norm and I had unrealistic expectations.
2,The battery doesn't last as long as they say they will. I will definitely get another ones from other brand.
5,These earbuds are definitely worth the money. Good quality and easy to use. Love using them on my walks very comfortable and they stay put.
1,Definitivamente son unas polqueria se entiende q son baratos pero hay unos mas baratos q estos y se ecuchan el doble de mejor. Me los puse y le di play a la musica y pareciera q solo funciona al 20% de volumen no se oye nada el ruido de afuera no me deja escuchar mis canciones aun utilizando un volumen booster no hay resultados de mejoria no boten su dinero en esto ni para probarlos como hise yo. Es lo peor de lo peor. Los Sony MDRE9LP de cable q salen en $7.99 le ganan a estos skullcandy
1,No me gusto porque se me perdieron a la semana
1,So small that it does not even fit. Can't even hold it in hands.
5,Love the sound quality !! Have always been a fan of skull candy !! Love the single ear pod use !! Noise cancellation is awesome !! Well done !!
5,This was a gift and the receiver enjoyed.
2,Product is decent but when I’m in a crowded place it cuts out a lot
5,Lo pequeño y cómodo que es lo único malo es la conexión micro usb hubiera sido tipo c por los demás buen producto me sorprendió la calidad del sonido
5,Awesome ear buds for the price. I use them off and on during the day.
5,Overall sound quality is actually pretty good the only thing I would want is more battery but it’s tiny so it’s alright but I recommend them !
5,If you want quality wireless sound but don't want to spend lots of $$ these are what you want. Love them.
5,They are small enough to fit underneath my over ear hearing protection.
2,Immediately out of the box the ear buds felt cheap.The buttons are not sensitive enough on either side. And the battery lasted maybe 1.5 hours of a meeting before it needed recharging.The sound quality coming in is great but the mic doesn’t pick up voice well. No one can hear my voice when speaking thru the mic.
5,For what your paying it's a great pair of earbuds in a small form factor. The battery could be better but for the price you can't go wrong.
2,As the saying goes... you get what you pay for.... and paying cheap  I got cheap.  They work...they were easy to chargesetup and pair to my ipod... but the range is horrible... they cut in and out... you can't even have my ipod more than 12" away...can't put out in my pocket and have them stay connected... it might be a weak signal from the pod to be fair.  But for now they are worthless.
1,I purchased these for the supposed sound quality according to Consumers Reports Magazine. The sound is OK but not as good as I thought it would be.  The bud's feel like they are going to fall out but have not as of yet.  Hookup issues sometimes one than the other than neither or both.  They also drop in and out if you carry your phone in your pocket.  Hard to open the case.  Not recommended.
5,These are great! I have small ears and they fit perfectly. Sound is good. They turn on as soon as you put them in. Great for the price!
5,A great product for this price
2,I have tried to put different buds in they still fall out of my ear no matter what..
5,It's not canceling the noise 😒
5,Everyday listening. Secure fit decent sounddecent battery life.
1,First of all. They didn’t even come in a box. Just the earbuds in a plastic baggie. No charging cord. No addition ear pieces. Nothing. Left them to charge overnight. They still won’t even turn on to pair them. I couldn’t tell you how they sound. Because they have clearly been used and they don’t work. Now I have to go through the trouble of returning them. Ugh.Now onto my second pair of these. Charged and work. Minus the fact that the left earbud now says it’s always dying. Now I am going to have to return two of these!!!
5,Short battery life a decent audio but its the value that makes this a 5 star review
5,Fantastic for the price
3,Fit well sound great but don't stay charged very long
5,If your ears are small these are the "Buds" you have been looking for Great Fit & Great factory support team from Skullcandy.. A+A+A+A+
3,I like the carrying case and battery life but sound quality isn't great.
3,After using them for a month the sound quality is get lower hence the noise cancelation is not good. Battery life is better than the other earbuds
5,They actually work unlike some other cheap wireless earbuds. They are very high quality for the price.
2,Good quality and are loud but no matter what I tried the left earbud wouldn't have sound
5,My  wife is very happy with these ear buds she connects to an apple phone and is very pleased with sound quality and battery life.
5,*for the price* I have zero complaints. Will buy a again if these get broken/lost. They sound great feel sturdy fit well and have excellent range.
5,Great sound quality for music!! Nice and small  which I love.
5,I was looking for some good earbuds at low cost. Didn't expected that skull candy have it. I love this brand and I love this earbuds
5,great little ear buds! i would buy them again! super cheap and great sound!
5,The media could not be loaded.
5,Sound quality and price are excellent!!!
5,Good ear phones
1,Left earbud won’t charge so it won’t work.  Luckily they were cheap but these are absolute junk.
5,I for real didn't expect these earbuds to be to be this good it's everything i wanted in earbuds for an amazing price definitely recommend
5,These are great earbuds they are tiny but the only downside is less battery but it still has plenty for the price I highly recommend
1,This is my second pair of skull candy earbuds and they are garbage. One does not power on and the other holds a charge for Maby 5 minutes. I wouldent spend another dime with this company
2,Sound on the ear buds seem to be pretty good. But the problem I'm having is the charging aspect of these buds. They do not automatically turn on when you remove them from the case not do the turn off when you put them back in. I manually have to turn them on and off by pressing on the ear buds themselves. I tried using the chat function to troubleshoot but that was useless. Also the charging cord is about 2 inches long! WTH good is that?!!! Not impressed.
3,Wish it had better than 3 hour battery life
1,Audio in both ears wont sync after few weeks of use. there is stutter and even the volume is not balanced in both ears. its a hardware issue with no fix whatsoever. terrible battery life. trashed them.
5,These have to be the best bang for your buck great sound and the battery life is insane that are better then most
5,After reading some of the other reviews I was hesitant. But I am glad that I tried them price was great and quality was even better.
1,Amazon sent a 2nd set. 1 charge lasted 45 minutes. Then back to 1 song and done. I've always had great luck with Skullcandy. I ordered these thinking they would be great like previous sc items. Charged it for an hour. Turn it on and connect... headset at 10%.... let it charge some more on my drive and try again. 1 song and BATTERY LOW and cut off. Get to my project let them charge on a new wall charger for 3 hours and? .. 10% and less than one song. Atrocious item. Do nor recommend if you want to use them.
3,El sonido es aceptable si vemos relación precio vs calidad.
2,Battery life is super poor barely can use for an hour before hearing that the battery is low. Sound quality is terrible the other party can hardly hear me
5,Perfect sound and better than any headphones in the world!
5,Great for the price. Oddly they are 1000x more comfortable if I switch the ear they say to go in and put them in upside down.
3,N/A
5,These earbuds work Great..
5,Lovely feel and sound. Keep it on my Keychain. Love it. So happy I could stay in the skull candy family with affordable wireless Bluetooth earphones.
1,It took less than 20 minutes to determine that these are not usable for making phone calls. I tried five calls from two locations (to make sure it wasn't my phone's reception that was the problem) and the results were the same: constant cutting out and breaking up kinda like old fashioned bad cell reception. This occurred even when both items were fully charged and less than 2 feet apart with the phone right in front of my face.I'm returning them (after jumping through a few needless and confusing Amazon hoops regarding how to send it).Music sounded good but I did not thoroughly test that aspect.
5,Easily the best for this price. Battery isn't super long but lasts long enough for nearly anything you'd want wireless headphones for.
2,These are...ok. I wouldn't recommend them though. Uncomfortable hard to get a good seal and the button is IMPOSSIBLE to press while these are in your ears. Not bad for $20 but I'd recommend spending $10 more and getting a decent pair of earbuds.
5,Good product
3,Disliked this product do to it being uncomfortable in my ear sound is all highs no lows and the case does not charge them.
2,I like Skullcandy headphones I thought the wireless version would be good quality but it's on the other side of the spectrum . I would rather use my regular headphones with the cord then these. Waste of money.  Might return them .The noise cancellation is okay but the quality of volume isn't good.It's very uncomfortable in your ears.The battery life is 1 hour to 1.3 hours.Find yourself something better
5,Love these!
1,Dislike having to use both in order for them to work. I only use one at a time as I need my other ear to hearI like that it's small
5,Love these. Was able to contact to my phone without a problem.  Clear sound and does great with the bass in songs
1,The pieces stayed in the ears well not very loud in volume but good sound. My complaint is that the charge on the headphones and headphone charger don’t last long.
5,Good pair of heaphones for a pinch really smol and eqsy to carry
1,Absolute garbage good for landfill.
2,They hate to connect. The sound quality is crap. The distance is horrible. And the battery is like 2 hours... Not. Worth. It.
3,Price is great I'm happy with the sound battery life isn't great but they are very small. My biggest complaint is they hurt my ears.
2,Never turned off battery died repeatedly
5,This is my second pair!
5,Great item and awesome sound as always with skullcandy.... absolutely  love them a must  buy 😍
5,Really great products for the price surprisingly well made considering how cheap they are. I would definitely recommend them for anyone looking for good Bluetooth headphones.
2,Sound is just okay. Doesn't connect to phone or power on upon opening case have to turn them on every time I get them out button is hard to push. Could live with these but battery life is a joke. The last pair I had lasted days on one case charge. These die even if if not in use in just a couple hours. Would not buy again.
5,These are awesome for the price. I use them everyday all day and for the cheap price I couldn’t ask for more.
5,Plenty of bass and block out annoying background noise
1,I hate these headphones and have considered returning them multiple times. They die super quick! Cannot hold a charge even after being charged to full battery.
5,I can't speak to the battery life but the sound quality and noise cancellation are very good. Worth the very modest cost! Fun color too!
5,The battery life is decent they haven't died anytime I use them.
5,Does the job
5,Love the price point.  Using it for backup.
3,I love the sound and comfortable fit but I have difficulty locating the control button. A bump would be nice please! 😁
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I’m so disappointed I had other products from skull candy and they were fine These lasted for a year and a half and I barely used them - garbage I got what I paid for
5,Very good for the price. Better than I expected.
5,Survived being ran over twice and rain
5,I even accidentally washed them about 3 times by accident and they still work good. Love them highly recommended.
2,I used them for hands free calls and listening to music.
1,Works for a month before internal batteries die in the earbuds and cannot return them after a month. Then your told to deal with Skullcandy directly to get warranty claim. There is no warranty for the dime 2 waste of my time. The only option after a month is the trash can. Worst earbuds I have ever purchased :(
2,Everything is fine except for the battery life.I've had cheaper headphones with far better battery life. It's kind of ridiculous how bad it is. I'll get maybe an hour and a half before the battery low announcement.
5,I absolutely love these they are super comfortable and stay in my ears without having to constantly adjust soumd quality is great for the price!
1,no los recomiendo. No funciona para nada bien
1,So bad!It came with a type c cable and a micro usb portIf that wasn't bad enough they were completely dead hence I had to wait two days after receiving them to try  they kept falling out of my ears no matter which tip I tried and are very uncomfortable.  I wish I could return but unfortunately I'm not able to but man this was not worth it. I've never been disappointed with skull candy purchases till now
5,Good product! I would buy it again
1,So i love how small & convenient these are. I charged them all night & started listening to my audio book to start my shift. They where dead before lunch time. :( super disappointed. Its going to be a long end of shift for me.
5,They hold a charge for a really long time
5,No noise cancelation but other then that works great
1,I have not been able to use because they will not charge and I can not return them because the packaging was tossed out.
2,My original earphones are saved and it will not let me use the new pair.  So they are useless.
5,They are just perfect. Fit great. Sound great. And charge fast. Bought a second pair to keep in car and home.
5,Really good quality for a decent price
5,Love these! Fit my ears great. Don't have to keep adjusting them. Love the color and how easy to use.
1,For me this product is terrible because I have to turn the earbuds on after I detatch them from the charger and even after I connect it the left earbud connects and makes me go through hell to get the right earbud to play by putting them back on the base and trying to configure just how I should detatch them. It's too much work for me to connect them to my phone especially when all the other buds I've purchased have never given me this problem...plz fix this issue cuz it should be simple for your group of tech wizards... And the button is too far down on the earbud... who thought of this design? I would love to give him/her a piece of my mind. The center point for the button should be right where the earbud fits in the ear... c'mon guys
5,The battery life is shorter then I liked but great sound and price.
5,You can use for running or in te office
1,I’m not one to generally leave reviews just saying. I’m a little mf teenage boy this is not what I generally spend my time doing. But these headphones are the first of several brands that I’ve used to just… not charge? They’re clean and I’ve used them but one time the case says it’s charging but the buds aren’t. I’ve charged them all night. On two different cords.I might be willing to boost my rating if customer service at least reaches out and tells me how to fix this or is willing to replace them but for now say hello to my first bad rating to Literally anything…
5,Best budget Bluetooth headphones I could find just wish battery lasted a little while longer
1,Used them one time and they haven't worked since.
5,I purchase them for work and they worked great I couldn't hear a single customer
2,Battery life isn't good at all I only had 1 hour of music time and it wasn't even all the way up
2,I got these about a month ago as a temporary replacement for my other earbuds and as something for work. Not even a full month and the right one stopped working… they were decent but already the right one not working 🥴
1,The earbuds are decent not great battery life isn't great either but they are small and I thought would replace my tile so I have my headphones with me and a tile tracker in the form of my earbuds. The tile app will say nearby then simply not connect. After searching for 30 min to find my keys unsuccessfully trying to use the tile tracker feature I found them about 10 feet from me. Apparently being 10 feet away was to far to use the tracker feature
5,The sound quality is amazing and they don’t move at all which I was worried about.
5,sound is ok battery life needs help but overall they are a good pair to keep on you at all times
1,These are terrible!!! They don’t stay in your ear. They fall out all the time.
5,It works great good sound quality
5,Sound quality is perfectProlonged use can get a little uncomfortable though
5,Price is right
3,I though they could use more volume control and fit the ear a little better.
5,These tiny mighty earbuds sound so good I thought I commited a crime when I bought them for $24.99
5,Very awesome product
5,These are compact bass is good battery life is pretty decent. It last during my shift at work. I would recommend.
5,Works great when I’m hiking
5,These are amazing good price great quality sound and very compact so I can carry them right on my keys
5,Cute and great quality
5,The best I ever owned.
5,Love them! Battery life is low but the case charges them fast! They last about 3 hours!
3,Audio connection goes out I have to disconnect connection and reconnect them again
5,Really nice sound quality. With could Crank them up lil more but there definitely water resistant! Trust me!!!
5,Good for running
1,The battery life im not sure if there is a glitch but if you're not using them but they're fully charged they say 10% battery life once u plug them in in 5 mins they're charged I wouldn't recommend nor buy them again!!!
1,Absolutely garbage died after 15 min after charging to full life will never buy again I would appreciate themmy money back as the are complete garbage. I attempted to return and STILL got charged for the second pair. Absolute garbage will not ever buy again would suggest you don't either unless you want to be scammed
1,Could not pair them to my Samsung.
1,I bought these for my wife thinking hey a cheap pair of earbuds to replace her broken pair should have stuck with something more these. The sound quality is great 5 star material but that doesn't make up for the fact of very poor battery life and no battery indicator on the case to tell you when to recharge. Would give better review but don't want my stars rounded up to 5 so all 1s it is.
2,I figured after the constant issues I’ve had with skullcandy’s Indy headphones I’d give them another shot with a newer pair. Issues like faulty connections in the case seem consultant with any model of skullcandy wireless headphones. This causes your headphones to stay on and never change. Very annoying and somehow the only attribute skullcandyhad mastered in each pair they sell.
5,Nice earbuds that come with detailed instructions and a nice carrying case.
1,Charged it up fully. Died within 10 minutes. Trying to get a refund but can’t send back unless I print out and box it and don’t have time don’t waste your money on these.
5,These earbuds were great. I just couldn’t get them to stay in my ears. So I eventually returned them.
3,They sound good battery life sucks though...
1,Worst headphones I've ever owned  sound quality is about equal to a pair I would get a dollar tree  highly disappointed skull candy usually makes decent headphones these however are absolutely terrible
5,Sounds just like my expensive ear phones last a long time great buy
5,1000000% worth the $25 I’d pay $50 for these they’re excellent! I can completely ignore the world around me with these!
1,I charged it fully and when turning it on it showed 10% battery life and only one ear would work.  Horrible.  Don't buy.
5,I bought this for my wife. She loves them. Comfortable and great sound.
2,I had these earbuds for 4 months and used them regularly at work. The one time I use them until the battery completely drained one side  no longer takes a charge or powers on.
5,Great ear buds for the price high quality sound and easy to use. Holds a charge long.
1,I had these for long enough now... they don't charge.  Especially the left bud. The ear bud case charges though... as the ear buds continue to tell me the battery is dying after a minute of use. I love the idea of these though.
1,Cuando conecto los audífonos se escuchan super bajos y dan problemas en conectarse. Además de que se escuchan mal.
5,These are great pair easily and the case is magnetic and charges well.  Great value
1,There is no flaw that wired ear buds had that the invention of wireless ear buds fixed. Instead it took a product that 100% accomplished what it set out to do and replaced it with a product that 10% accomplished what it set out to do. Yes they sound good. When you can hear the music which skips like a CD you buried in sand and had a dance party on that sand. I thought we were past that as a species.Oh and don't think you can just put your phone in your pocket so you can listen to music while you mow the lawn or clean the house because your body will block the signal from the phone to the ear buds and the music won't play.
5,Love them!
1,No me agrado nadala carga no dura naday cuestan caros y se oye bajitolos tienes puesto y no utilizando y se le va la carga solo.
5,Wish had more battery life
5,Love these. They sound amazing and are comfortable to use. Skull candy has great products at amazing prices.
2,I've had these earbuds for a week but they still won't charge it's only saying its at 10 percent so it's a one time thing so I don't recommend it.
5,Honestly they sound great only downsides are battery life and max volume that’s about it.
1,Very disappointed with this product. First of all. The battery only lasted 20 min. Then it wouldn’t even connect to my phone. A waste of money.
5,Love that I can keep these on my keychain and have them wherever I go!
1,Battery won’t last also hard to heard
5,These are Great headphones at a great price
2,Sound quality is great especially for a $25 set of earbuds but out of the box brand new they won't charge over 10%. Put em straight on the charger and light turned green in 5-10 minutes. I thought they were fully charged but after 3 tries it does the same every time. Fork over at least the extra 20 n get JBL's n save the headache.
5,They are light wieght work greats. Wish the battery was longer than 6hrs
5,Been looking for a good pair of buds that fits my ears comfortably….. These are it !
1,These headphone will only last an hour on a full charge. When all other wireless headphones last at least 8 hours. I can barely make it through a whole album before these utter garbage headphones die. This was a very bad purchase on my part and will be returning these asap!
5,These are great for the money! Very happy!
1,I was so unhappy with these. The sound quality was too poor for calls while driving which was the main reason why I bought these. Multiple people said they could not understand me.These are fine for listening to something on the phone but don't fall asleep - the earpods have a voice to tell you when the battery is low and it's so loud it made me jerk awake.They're a bit slippery and hard to grasp especially when taking them put of the case. They slip out of the ear easily. They're easy to lose.In the end I bought a headphones jack adapter for my new phone and went back to wired headphones.
2,the case is nice and slime sound quality is good only bad thing the ear buds do not stay in my ears they constantly fall out.
1,The left ear bud did not work at all. It wouldn’t even power on. I went through all of the trouble shooting tips and videos and still nothing. Amazon is sending a replacement and hopefully they work. If they do work I will change my rating. But this is the second product I have bought from Skullcandy that has been a pain and not worked as promised.***Update***The replacement pair I received would not charge. So I now have 4 ear buds with two cases and I cant use any of them. Will be returning for a refund in the morning. I definitely will never purchase anything from Skull candy ever again and I caution anyone else to look to another company for their needs.
5,I purchased these because they were recommended by a IT group I belong to.  Great purchase.
5,Nada que agregar. Muy buen producto.25/07/2021Edit un auricular ha estado teniendo problemas de emparejamiento
1,Worked great until day 40 return window gone. I will check the warranty.
1,The sound quality with these is awful. We have a pair from target that work amazing but these ones are terrible.
3,Nicely made lightweight. Volume can get pretty loud but there's hardly any bass... Not a keeper.
2,I was so disappointed in the battery life. 3 hours is about it.
5,This is a quality product especially for the price. No complaints
1,Headphones have been on charger for since last night and I still have no charge. My charging case will show a green light indicating a charged case. However my ear buds are not charged. Turns out my charging case is defective. I’ve watched several YouTube videos and read the skull candy manual to rectify the issuebut the headphones do not work. I will be returning.
5,Good item highly recommend.
1,I had the “dime 1” earbuds and they were very good. These “dime 2” earbuds are mostly the same but with much worse battery life
1,Cheap
2,Easy to pair up. Best I can say. Sound is way to low and falls out my ear if I just shake my head a little bit. Would not recommend
5,Good
2,These are terribly uncomfortable for small ears. The don't fit and fall out unless I jam them in my ears at an awkward angle. The frontside of the earbud (the part they seem to hide and face away from you in the pictures) is quite square and pointy instead of rounded making them quite painful. Good sound though and if you have bigger ears I'm sure they'd work better.
1,The noise canceling isn’t strong at all they aren’t very loud either the Skullcandy Sesh Bluetooth headphones are MUCH better for anyone reading this I recommend those instead. These headphones are also very light like it’s completely made of a very light plastic but that’s a personal bias the skullcandy Sesh’s are heavier in a sense.
2,These as to be expected will randomly cut out if they arent within 3 feet of the phone. The sound quality is fine when this doesnt happen unless you make sure the buds are charging you might end up with 80 percent 50 percent 20 percent or even 0 percent.
1,Worst purchase I’ve ever made on Amazon. The Bluetooth pairing was complete garbage. After letting the case charge for 10 hours in a bit and the buns for another six I got about seven minutes of battery life with both pods working. And there was nothing auto about it. I will never buy Skullcandy again. I went into this expecting very little since they were so cheap so there was not a high bar to meet. Yet they still managed to fail miserably.
5,I like the way I can still hear my surroundings and yet enjoy music
5,These fit my petite ears wonderfully great sound cancelling. I wish the battery life was longer.
5,Great sound quality and they last forever haven't had a a problem yet deff. Recommend.
1,I cannot get these to stay charged or connected for more than five minutes without shutting off.  Prob my least favorite ones ever :(. Bummed
2,They will not stay in ears that are little.
5,They sound is great! Definitely worth the money. Love the size and fit. Perfect for the gym.
5,Got them for my son and he loves them. He says they sound really good.
5,These are great!! Very comfortable easy to pair good audio. You just can’t go wrong with any skullcandy product!
2,I like the color they feel kind of cheap. They stopped connecting automatically when I undock them. They stopped holding a charge longer than 20 minutes for some reason even though the case was charging all night with different chargers. But when they did work they were okay quality. Worth $25 for sure. :)
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 this sucks !!!only one ear working and they provide a charging cord but not the block and it's not your normal kind of charger... im at work with 6 1/2 hrs to go and no charger and only one working ear argh... they need to tell people that shit
1,I bought 2 pair of these. 1 for my son and 1 for me. both have the same issue holding a charge. I haven't used them since we bought them. Maybe I'm doing it wrong but according to the directions I am not. Good fit in ear and great sound but can't enjoy that without battery power !
1,Right ear stop working after 3days of use and case over heat when charging
5,Haven't had them long but they are amazing got twenty bucks
1,The sound quality in these earbuds is tinny. But that's hardly the biggest problem. The big problems are (1) the incredibly short battery life (far lower than advertised); and (2) the repeated connectivity problems even at remarkably short distances (less than 5 feet). These nearly useless earbuds convinced me to go back to headphones with a hard connection in almost no time at all.
1,The left ear piece doesn't work; so it came broken so a bit of a let down
5,Perfect for everyday use!
1,Have had wired Skullcandy in-ears before so I thought I’d try these based on the price. Frankly they sound terrible. Super high-endy like old transistor radios. Do not buy these.
5,Got them for my daughter she said they sound great she uses every day
1,A full charge will die within 1hour (each ear)The quality for the brand was not good
2,They had good base to sound quality but for some odd reason the headphone pods do not sit properly in the charging case so they don't connect well and they won't charge had to return them.
5,Good product
2,I love the size & design of the product.  It comes with a dongle and is small enough to carry on your keychain.  Sound quality leaves a lot to desire for.  Reviews stating this sounds tinny and metallic is an understatement.  I tried everything to love these earbuds but even with EQ settings.
5,perfect
5,Their products are always great quality for the price.
5,Estos auriculares me dejaron sorprendido tienen una buena salida de audio súper recomendable
5,Best headphones for the cost. Sound quality equal or better than the original AirPods
1,I bought this product to connect to my TV for wireless listening. The battery life averaged about 4 hours.I threw them away and spend a little more for a better product. My new earbuds go for days without charging. Don't waste your money!
5,Great value and quality
1,Couldn't hear anything in one.
2,I got these thinking it they would be good for listening to audio books music and for online calls/meetings.  These didn't even last the morning.  Even wearing one bud at a time with the other in the charging case.  The call quality was terrible.  I ended up turning off Bluetooth and using my phone as normal.
5,I’m so glad I got these. They’re perfect!
5,Good
1,One ear pod works great. The other. I can’t charge  I e been trying for three days now
2,The battery life was fine for my use. These earbuds fit to perfection in my ears however the sound quality is terrible. I don't necessarily need to feel like I'm in a concert when listening to music but at least give some quality sound! Spend the extra $25 to $50 for good earbuds if you're going with the Skullcandy brand!
1,Used them once then would not work again no matter how much they were charged
1,This is poor quality I don’t recommend this product to anyone
2,I really like the case and how the earbuds fit into it but battery life is terrible like an hour and sometimes have problems pairing.
5,Stay in ear well and sound great
5,Excellent for its price. As good as other expensive ear buds.
5,great quality  sound is better than others I have tried
1,They worked great for the first month then one ear piece stopped connecting to the other.  Then eventually the other stopped working making them a $20 pair of ear plugs.  And yes this has happened to BOTH PAIR.
1,Awful!  First time using followed the instructions and they lasted the 4 hours I did yard work.  Put them in the case to charge.  They lasted 15 minutes then wouldn't charge over 10 percent.
1,Earbuds would not maintain a charge greater than 30 minutes after charging for two days. Returned and purchased another brand.
5,Una excelente relación calidad precio.
2,These are not up to the typical quality I expect from Skullcandy. The pairing process is to tricky as one of the earbuds does not seeming to want to cooperate. The sound quality is decent but the battery life is just plan unacceptable. While the price point is intriguing there are just better quality sets at the same or similar price.
5,THE DIMES ARE AN AMAZING VALUE.MUSIC IS GREAT AND CRISP!!
2,Could not get them to pair separately and the right side one never wanted to pair at all and drained the charging area also has controllers determined by what earbud side you press rather than just short pressinig. Good if you like having both in at a time but horrible on their own for work.
5,Its okay
5,Sound is amazing and the noise cancelation is great
5,Very clear sound nice fit
5,They sound really good for the price.  I'm impressed with the quality
5,Great long lasting battery you can use them individually barly notice case in pocket
1,These are the worst Skullcandy headphones I have ever bought.  1 of them didn't work right. The sound was messed up in it. The battery life is by far the shortest I have ever seen for Bluetooth earbuds. Another problem is they do not stay in your ear.  I found mine constantly falling out. I have not 1 good thing to say about these headphones. I wish I had wasted my money on a better pair. TSkullcandy is my favorite brand and I have never complained about anything I have bought. So i hate that I have to give this review. But I don't want anyone to make the same mistake I did.
2,After just 3 weeks of use the automatic turn on feature stopped working and do not charge when not manually turned off they also have poor battery life and charge slowly.Alright for the money though.
1,Suenan muy feo
1,Gosh I was so excited for these but I guess I should have expected this. The first week was great! The few times I used it the mic was great the sound was spectacular but like two weeks go by and the left side completely loses audio. It really did try to hang in there but the audio went all muffled and static-like and eventually spluttered out. As I write this the right side is showing the same symptoms I estimate a week tops.These earbuds look really sleek they sounded great for a week and the only con I saw at the time was that the song skip option only worked when both earphones were on.
5,Very good quality and amazing price!!!!
1,I got these because they say they are for small ears.  They are for normal size ears. Not small ears. I have yet to find earbuds for small ears that don’t pop out if I laugh while listening to a podcast.
1,Was really disappointed battery doesn't even last my 5 hour shift on a full charge. I try to use only one bud at a time till it dies and I'll use the other one. Cute color garbage battery.
1,Dont waste your time getting these. I thought they were malfunctioning for the first day I had them then i realized the small scull on the buds was an actual button that must be pressed/double pressed to pause fast forward increase volume or answer calls. It's so small good luck finding it and once you do you must push it so hard you either have to hold on to the little tail or just jam it deeper and deeper into your ear. There are plenty of earbuds on the market at a similar price point that are touch sensitive you will have much better luck with any of those.
5,Excellent ear buds. Very pleased. Better than my old anchor brand ones.
5,Absolutely amazing terrific fit great sound quality great size.
5,I was skeptical about buying these skullcandy dime earbuds. Everyone should have a pair.
1,Bought this and the battery life literally only lasted an hour keep your money
5,works ok.
5,Excellent noise isolation. Great sound. Very loud. Keeps me dancing my work day away!
5,They're solid buds
3,Only one earbud works at a time
1,These earbuds have very poor sound quality all high end and no low end at all to the point that the high pitched sound hurt my ears. The battery sucks too.Spend a little more for bigger drivers and better batteries.
5,Great sound battery life and noise cancellation is very good
2,The headset is disconnecting time to time when you get phone calls you need to connect it again! It’s not convince to use it.
1,Didn't like and didn't fit
2,When not in use it drains battery
1,After 1 week the right one would not connect
1,The worst earbuds I've ever used. The right one did not work. The battery life was a joke. I tossed the left out of my truck window after charging it over night and after 30 minutes of use the battery was drained. Waste of money!
1,I got these on a Sunday. Charged them up to full charge and tested them briefly.  I put them in my bag to take to work with me the next day to use on daily Teams meetings.It took forever to pair them. Once they did pair they would simply not work in MS Teams.And as an added bonus they had discharged themselves to 10% of charge time left after simply sitting in my backpack overnight.
5,Muy buenos
1,These are difficult to keep in painful and uncomfortable to wear. They don’t cancel much noise out and don’t get the quality sounds I had expected. Feels very cheap like the plastic used to make disposable products. Really hard to connect turn on press the buttons in the ear bud. Overall not very user friendly.
5,Excellent
5,Llegaron muy rapido y en muy buenas condiciones sin aboyadurasExecelentes audifonos.
5,Exactly as described! Great fit for the price
2,I got these for work specifically because they advertised 12hr battery. I have to charge them every 2 hours. They offer better earbuds for the same price or less.
5,These are awesome and for only 26 dollars I love these
5,Great headphones. Love the way they attach to your key ring.
1,each ear bud charge only last for 4 hours. The battery pack charge only last 2 days.
5,Arrived very fast and the sound quality is superb.
2,For the first month of using these they worked great with no problems. Then all of a sudden the left earbud stopped working altogether and even after a full charge it still won’t work. I’m disappointed and probably won’t be reordering these
5,The quality in sound is superb!!!
5,Had them for two weeks they are amazing for the price go Skullcandy ‼️
5,Ease of setup. Sound quality good. Battery life great.
5,I really like the skull candy deep in bass and comfortable.
5,Skullcandy NEVER disappoints!!! These ear buds are amazing!!!!
5,Sound is very clear on both ends. No complaints!
5,I love the sound quality when I work out
1,Fresh out the box and charged yet shows no signs of life when attempting to turn them on. Pretty disappointed.
1,With my iPhone’s volume cranked as high as it can go still can BARELY hear a phone call through these. Literally could never use these for phone calls which is the sole reason why I bought them. Sound quality is a little better when listening to music but the audio is still muffled. Overall these are pretty bad quality—you definitely get what you pay for. NOT RECOMMENDED!!!
5,Thank you.
1,They are so uncomfortable that I wouldn't have used them if they did work but fresh out if the case (which tbe case was also janky) and full charged the left ear bud never worked. 0/10. The only thing I'll give them is that shipping was decently quick but getting a turd sooner rather than later you're still getting a turd.
1,I bought these defective earbuds and even if they worked here are its problems. You physically have to turn them on and off those neat slats in the case will gather dust dirt and grime in your pockets. Garbage. Better off going outside and lighting $20 on fire.
1,Tried these out as an alternative to other wireless earphones but they are awful. They disconnect from Bluetooth constantly. One earphone will work while the other turns off sporadically. The worked well once and now they are already malfunctioning; it hasn't even been a week since I've had them. The earphones are not worth paying more than $10 for them.
1,The earbud themselves give great sound. The shape of the earbud makes it impossible for it to stay inside your ear. Even with the 3 different sized rubber pieces I can feel the earbud sliding out my ear. Im totally disappointed because Skullcandy is a brand I thoroughly enjoyed growing up. Their headphones were always phenomenal for a good price. If I didn't already wedge these earbuds into my middle ear I would return them.
2,I get it they are last year's model. Still micro USB even in 2019 or 2020 is unacceptable let alone 2021. The world runs on USBC or wireless charging.The fit is meh the sound quality is meh. I'll update on connectivity after roaming out in public for a few weeks.
5,It’s ok
1,They stopped working in less than two months. They will no longer charge. red charging light comes on the case comes on but even after leaving it on the charger all day nothing happens.  No lights on the earbuds and no sound.
2,Very quiet. They fall out of my ears no matter which cushions I use. But most importantly the batteries suuuuuuuuuuuck. Going to get another pair of Jabras instead. I lose them so often it's a shame to spend that much but you get what you pay for.
1,After 1 week of use the right bud dies after a couple hours of use. I thought I was charging them wrong but by the time I figured it out I couldn’t return them. I was really bummed!
5,They are earbuds
1,One ear bud stopped working the next day full charge. Tried to place it in a different box of the same earbuds but no luck. Trying to return.
2,The left earbud did not connect to my phone at all.
5,Sonido agradable pero batería de corta duración.
2,I have always bought Skullcandy headphones because they pretty much are the best for the money but when I got these ones they were not what I wanted they were not loud enough they did not have the base that Skullcandy normally has just was on satisfied
5,I love them size and quality are amazing for that prince
1,These are the worst earbuds I've ever purchased. Battery life is barely 3 hours. Sound quality is poor. You have to turn the device all the way up and still barely hear. There is no noise cancelation at all.
1,After full charge the battery only lasted for 10 minutes. I have not used any headset where battery died that quickly. Does not help if you are in meetings that last more than 10 minutes or for travel. Would not recommend this
5,I love the sound quality good battery life
2,Not so good rare coming from Skullcandy :/
5,I love these for the price ❤️
5,Won’t find a better pair for the price.
1,They do not stay in my ears the don’t fit and come right out
3,Sound quality
5,Everything you need in an pair of ear buds.
1,Hard to push the volume buttons on the earbuds. Could never figure out how to work it. My current ones synch by themselves
2,The battery on these headphones are horribly bad.
5,It’s what you want for a great price
1,I got these after reading a few positive reviews. First pair would charge past 10%. I returned them and they were replaced with some that charged to a wonderful 30%. I really wanted to like these. They fit my ears great sound quality great mic but none of this matters if they won't charge.
5,Muy bueno
5,For the price these sound amazing! And they are very convenient.
1,Never got a chance to use these as they never fully charged.  I purchased a different charger thinking that was the issue but after having them plugged in and charging for 24 hours they still did not charge.
1,Im so confused by these earbuds. I cant tell if they charge while you charge the case. I guess I'll never know becauelse now they do not charge whatsoever.Long time skullcandy customer but these are the worst quality I've experienced.
1,Don’t come charged and then they won’t contact I want my money back this company is bs
2,Not really noise cancelling and the bass is not very strong so everything sounds like it's lacking In a way.
2,It keeps falling off my left ear. At one point it fell in the sink while I was doing dishes🙄
5,They are good for for games
1,I saw the price and thought: "How bad can they be?"Bad. Really really bad.
5,No issues with it. It works well. I love it!
1,Battery wont last more than 3 hours. Scammers
1,These are crap. Don't waste your time on the name. Though the device stayed paired to my phone the buds would not connect for calls or any audio after 1 day of use. The audio is terrible with static and crackling. I'm returning and going back to the cheaper generic pair that works fine.
1,Don't waste your time with this product.It stopped holding its charge 1 month and 9 days after I got it.I applied for a refund and return and was told I had to post it THAT SAME DAY or I wouldn't get the refund.I scrambled to get it to the post office and was then told I'd have to pay freight to return the FAULTY ITEM.The freight was 50% of the cost of the item anyway...Wish I'd never wasted my time and money with these.Terrible product. Terrible experience.Disappointed with Amazon's lack of assistance.
1,You can’t stuff them in your ear really .You can put them in and they won’t come out  but you shake them out without too much effort . I recommend Skullcandy jibXT .
2,Product worked great for about 2 weeks. Now one ear phone doesn’t work. I guess I got what I paid for considering the price
2,The right one can be in the case all day charging and 5 minutes at the gym and it dies. the left one no problem. The sound is pretty good. These do not cancel out noise and the volume is a little on the low side.
5,Best cheap earbuds around!
1,I like the size but the right ear is not working. For this brand I wasn't expecting that issue. I've had cheaper that works better. I hope this issue can be fixed.
5,Amazing quality especially considering the price.
5,Try to disconnect on occasion sound quality is great
5,Do it
1,Doesn't do anything it claims
5,Es genial tamaño el precio y la calidad del audio
5,They are great for the price!!
5,Very good for the price
5,La batería no tiene tanta duración.
5,
1,Received mine yesterday and they are already a pain.  First there's no voice or sound to tell if they're paired or not after charging all night put them on and after about two hours the battery is low and I'm still trying to tell when they are on or off.  I get all this from my below $15 pairs.  Overall I am not pleased with my purchase.
1,I leave these charging for 12 hours sometimes only just to find the right earbuds battery life is a 0.2 seconds. A Baby could create better battery life on these headphones. Very frustrating especially when I want to disassociate with the world around me.Now I have to listen to people through my right ear.
2,Hard to pair don't stay in ears keeps falling out
5,Excelente producto recomendado bateria duradera 👍
5,It’s Very Good For The Price!!
2,I really wanted to like these. Battery life is absolutely terrible. I consistently get 1-2 hours of total listening time before they lose battery and disconnect
5,Perfect for the price. Skullcandy never disappoints.
5,Cheap and compact with good quality. Already reccomended to friends
1,Tired to wear them. Wore them for 1.5 hours while doing work around the property on my tractor. I had to constantly push these back in. Tried the small med and large rubbers and none kept the earbuds in. If I bent over they would fall out of my ears. I have 2 sets of skullcandy wired and 1 set of wireless inked+. The inked+ lasted about 9 months before they died. Was hoping these would be a good replacement and nope. They sounded good but they hurt to waer and fell out more than a few times.
1,It doesn't charge it keeps saying 10% battery.  Waste of money
5,Perfectos
5,just what i was looking for
5,Great product. For the price couldn't be happier!
2,Battery sucks and speaker sounds blown in the left one
5,Awesome worked very well cool color
5,Excellent product
2,Headphones fit well until you start you start to sweat then they fall out with the slightest movement. Charging case is super convenient but the Headphone battery life is terrible. I will be lucky to get an hour out of them before needing to charge.
5,Excelente producto
2,These are cheap wireless ear buds that both have their own tiny batteries in them and not much more. They fit well and have an ergonomic design but the sound quality is garbage. I’m considering returning these but haven’t decided yet.
5,Great pair of ear buds!
5,producto recomendado cumple lo descrito.
2,RUN....Battery life is bad... sound is not great either.  Not for the price range and other better ones available. The only good thing is size and fit
1,The product is excellent in terms of appearance and sound quality. The battery life is awful though. No matter how long it charges it doesn't seem to last longer than a hour at most
1,The sound quality is very poor. Noise cancellation doesn’t work. And microphone literally doesn’t work. Battery life is way less than it’s described. It dies pretty quick. Waste of money.
5,The best $25 bucks you can spend on wireless earbuds!
5,Love it
1,They’re okay when they work but the volume buttons only work some of the time and one sign often cuts out even when charged. After a couple of months they’re pretty much useless.
2,I bought these because I thought the battery life would keep me going through my 8 hours of work but turns out only last 4 hours. Will not be buying these anymore
5,Small case just as expected
2,I like Skull Candy but these were not comfortable to wear and they kept falling out.
5,Best Bluetooth earbuds ever for the price.
1,Suck soooo bad. Do not get these!!!
2,These sounded great but battery seemed some short of AirPods. I promptly lost one in the yard within two days of getting them. Nothing seems to stay in my ears well except the Apple AirPods!  Shucks!
5,Además de prácticos son formidables
2,Works good then now pack is not charging the ear buds
5,High equility
1,microphone doesn't work well with my MacBook Air. Skullcandy Dime bluetooth earphones keep disconnect themselve and creating noise in Siri and Photobooth on Mac. Bummer.
1,Bought two pair on December 22 of 2021 and today on February 18th of 2022 the second pair died. First pair never held a charge for more than an hr then suddenly just stopped charging altogether. Second pair just started doing this muted sound then stopped playing sound completely.  Not worth it
2,I’m a big fan of Skullcandy so I was really disappointed with these earbuds. They didn’t fit well in the ear and made an airtight seal making the buttons painful to press and the music was noticeably tinny and low-quality.
5,Great wireless earbuds for cheap.
1,battery life sucks  sounds really low very disappointed
5,Great product for a veary good price.
1,Did not work.  Would not turn on.
1,Right ear bud did not work at all. Charge on left ear bud went from 100% to 20% in about 10 minutes. It is very unfortunate i was really excited to get these since i used skull candy headphones as a kid religously and now i am a very unimpressed adult.
5,In love!!!
5,Good battery life
2,I liked the color and sound quality for what skull candy is but the touch features do not work and the battery life is very short even for the recharging case.
2,Would rather spend the money on the corded version since those are way better quality and way more comfortable to wear.
1,Realmente el sonido es malo la duración de la batería es pobre y no se ajustan a los oídos tengo unos JBL piratas hace 3 años y suenan mucho mejor que estos.
1,i was returning it 1 day ago but i gave it another chance and it didnt turn out the sound in the right bud got worse and it has a Studer problem not work 26 more like worth 10..
1,The product did not work for me if you want to buy it but the purchase may go wrong keep in mind that it arrived defective so think twice there are more options.
5,Great little earbuds for the price.
1,choppy voice & noise is more louder
2,As earbuds for just music they are fine. But not if you are using them to also make phone calls. The person on the other end can’t hear you.
2,The sound quality was horrible and no matter how I charged them it ran out of battery quick. I am very disappointed
2,Only 1 bud worked. I ran with 1 couldn't tell if it does any noise canceling. The battery seems to last awhile. But who only wants 1 earbud??
5,Absolutely love them
5,There Great...
1,The right ear bud goes dead in a hours time the volume is not that loud and I can hear everything in my background with both in
5,Sound pretty good for the price
1,The day after the return window closes (30 days) the left earpiece stops working. Can’t return them now so stuck with a non-working pair of earbuds. Very frustrating for my 10 year old.
1,Last time I buy electronics from Amazon. These do not charge and were a waste of money
1,Not loud quality very cheap
1,Battery life is awful sound quality is below average and it feels as if these earbuds were rushed into the market definitely do not recommend.
1,Had these for a couple months now. These earphones are not good the battery is terrible I get max one hour and my left one dies 30 mins before the right one. Save ur money and spend more for better ones. Dissapointed since it is skullcandy brand
5,Great for the price
1,Can’t charge it
2,ear buds are hard to get out of the compartment.. They are also hard to turn on and off... sound is good....distance from device is  is short. not a repurchase
5,Perfecto
1,Battery only lasts 2 hours (playing music) not 3.5 hours like they saidEvery time I use they it tells me my iPhone can’t pair with them anymore and to forget the device and repairTakes longer to charge them than they lastNot sure how they sound playing music I only used them to listen to a podcast but you can use only one at a time which is niceI would not waste money buying these there are a lot better one for only a couple dollars more out there
1,Poca batería
1,Sounds was great until second & no sounds was coming from one piece
5,Good sound quality.
5,Wow so good I love it
5,Great usability considering the price.
5,Sound quality is great.
5,Best thing for price
1,They worked well for a few weeks. Now they cut in and out and after a while drop the connection. When that happens they have to be removed and re-paired to the device. Pain in the ass especially when you're busy.You get what you pay for. I bought these after losing one bud from my Sonys.
1,Received a defective item. Doesn't charge max charge at 10% which can only be used for a few minutes. Very disappointed.
1,My right headphone dies after  ~20 minutes of use. The left headphone at least works but only seems to get about an hour and half of use before dying.
5,Great product. Great price!
2,sound quality is very good . unfortunately they don’t last more than 2 hours on a full charge . very disappointing
2,They go too deep in-ear and constantly fall out.  The battery life isn't that great. It like plugs your ears to the point where you feel pressure which I do not like.
1,Got these less than a month ago. They held charge through half an hour of cardio exactly once. I charge them up but they start telling me "battery low" after about 10 minutes. Today I took them off the charger (they'd been there overnight) and the light flashed red as soon as I turned them on and they said "battery low" IMMEDIATELY after coming off the charger. These were on a number of lists of best "affordable" options but I guess you get what you pay for.
5,Excelente
1,Se rompió un auricular apenas los compre
1,Very painful to ears. It's shape is not good. Poor battery life and no noise cancellation.
2,Battery doesn’t make it hours. Hard to get out of case some times
2,These didn't work well for me but I seem to have trouble finding earbuds that fit my ears well anyway.  The price and the case are good but not being waterproof is a negative.
5,For the price it’s unmatched
1,Don’t buy inlet one of them works
2,The sound is decent. The battery doesn't last for more than a couple hours.
2,The quality of these ear buds is severely lacking. The charging case feels cheaply made and the battery life of the individual earbuds is less than 4 hours.
2,Short battery life
2,Bad battery have 2 re charge them every hour had them for a week
2,These had no reasonable volume to them. Not loud enough to workout with.
5,Perfect!!
1,After a month of having them the left ear bud has lost volume and is much lower then the right side. Unfortunately I can not return them because it is 2 days past the 31 days of having them.. very disappointed will never buy skull candy again..
1,Sound quality size battery life is not good
1,Wanted some headphones I wouldn’t have to keep on the charger.  Bad quality of sound. And doesn’t automatically connect to iPhone.
1,Not like the old skullcandies. I feel like I just got it out of a gum all machine. The quality is really bad which flows into the sound quality. Never buying skullcandies again.
2,They are very bulky for the ear they hurt
1,Buds only last 1 to 2 hours at max volume..max volume isn't very loud..the case takes forever to recharge the buds..had them on for 45 min and withing 15 min of listening they died...I bought these since I've had wired skullcandys before and they were solid..but these dime series suck! I had my tozios for 2 years and have no issues till they were stolen by my kids..lol
1,After charging and set up both earbuds paired to phone and worked. Volume when  1 bud used alone is low. Charged again and left will not pair with right. Right work alone ok. Returning to Amazon.
1,RIght earbud did not work. The red "charging" indicator light never turned off. I could only get one side to work. Don't recommend.
1,Very low
2,Problem with the battery dying under a hour !! Returned product
1,Didn't even want put them in my ear because as I opened the bottom of the box the extra ear pieces were loose and fell out alongside the keychain strap and a loose usb cord and after watching at least 5 unboxing videos its ane even the videos from the product page it shows the strap on the case and the earpieces are to secured to a carboard strip and the usb is supposed to be tied up
2,Weird connectivity issues at times where one earbud won't connect. I also feel like they are constantly charging because of how bad the battery life is.
2,Good sound and worth the price but they don’t like to stay in my ears
1,I bought this not that long for a Christmas gift. I asked about them to see if they liked it and they said it's an okay product The downside to this product is the battery life. It does not amount to the advertised time. I would suggest looking into another product that would have a better battery time
2,Decent for $20
5,Worth the buy
1,On bud just stopped working. Look for a different brand
1,The only good thing was the color
5,Great
1,Definitely get what you paid for. Horrible volume and battery life never last more then 3 hours. Not worth it at all
2,I mean the sound quality is great but the battery in the earbuds only last a bit over an hour and they are uncomfortable. Such a let down after all the years of great products from Skullcandy.
1,Just awful please do not buy! They only charge to 10% and you have to hold the pods down in the case and then one side will just turn off randomly and you would have to recharge! Just annoying but for the price if these issues didn’t exist I would buy.
5,Nice product
2,I like these earphones but I wish they had the battery meter on them to tell when they need recharging. Otherwise great product.
2,Buds were supposed to come with a charging cord according to the box.  They did not.
1,Batteries will not even come close to lasting the length of an average movie.  The only good thing about these is their small size.
1,It doesn’t charge one of the earphones.. it works for a month
1,These earbuds don't have the best sound quality but they worked well...for 3 months. After 3 months the right one stopped working at all and the left plays at such a low volume that it is difficult to hear anything. They do not hold a very long charge I'd say a max of 3 hours play time before they have to go back in to the charging case.  Definitely not worth buying.
1,This is my second pair of Skull Candy ear buds in 3 months. The first pair the left ear bud just completely died. No sound etc this pair would not charge over 10% brand new out of the box. I won't be buying this brand anymore.
1,You really are getting less than you paid for with these. The sound quality is trash vocals are alright but it has zero bass it sounds like blown speakers. They are horrible for small ears as well. The battery life sucks I can get like five hours out of them at a low volume. They also like to work their way out of your ears and randomly pop out. I wouldn't waste my money I rather buy wired headphones instead.
1,The fit great sound great but battery doesn't even last an hour on these things. They dont hold a charge. Not sure if I just have faulty ear buds but I'll never buy this brand again.
2,The sound quality was way too low for a skull candy brand.  I know it was cheap but dollar store ear piece is louder than these.
1,These have to be the quietest earpods I have ever seen id have to say dollar store earpods have better sound quality and just pure volume you can not hear them if they are not rammed all the way down your ear hole and thats the only reason they cancel sound is because you have to have them stuffed so far in your ears so you can hear the tiny bit of volume these produce its crazy how quiet they are
1,Can’t keep them paired connected to the Bluetooth and not comfortable in the ear. Just spend the extra money and get some airpods
1,I've had these for a little over a month and they just stopped working. Wouldn't pair to anything. Did everything support suggested but still wouldn't turn on. Don't go with these unless you're only needing them for a short bit of time. Also don't use these for calling no one can hear you but they'll hear a car door shut from a mile away in the background. It's the weirdest thing
1,I bought these because I thought they would be better than spending $180 for AirPods. When they arrived I was so exited to use them and when I put them in after connecting them to my phone the left one would never work even after a whole day of charging. Do not bother buying these. They are a waste of money.
2,Great sounding but don't have enough volumebattery life is not great
1,Beautiful green color which I like. But I'm very disappointed because it doesn't work. I'm guessing I got a defective one. I can't be bothered to return it. Totally waste of money.
1,These are poor quality. Poor material very cheap plastic. Not good sound at all. Very much a waste of your time and money. DO NOT ReCommend.
1,There is literally no charge in the case whatsoever. They last maybe an hour. Don’t waste your money. Cute fit nice but complete garbage
1,i have the smallest rubber piece installed and they still are too big. they hurt my ears. they sound fine once you get past the pain. much better options out there. i hate these things
1,Great low-price earbud until it broke. I have a set of studio headphones from Skullcandy that I love (I've had them for 5 years no problems) but these are a total disappointment. If it doesn't work it provides no value. the left earbud started to lose sync about two weeks ago and then it stopped powering on. Now I get nothing from it. No power no lights no sound nothing. Tried charging it tried following the troubleshooting from the web. What a waste.
1,Skullcandy says more than 3 hours battery life but whenever I try to use it after charging for couple of hours it alerts "battery low"Below average battery life.
2,These sound pretty good but when you make a phone call the other party cannot hear you. I was very disappointed.
2,Was excited to finally own a dime but let dime doesnt hold charge and once connected give me battery low message before dying
1,Left ear disconnects afer 10 seconds right ear goes off after a minute. I've charged it until green over and over and tried on different phones but it's always the same result.
1,The battery charged for two days and never maintained a charge.
1,I bought these for my husband hoping they would be amazing. My Husband opened them the sound was perfect but he tried charging them all night and only charged to 10%... they won't charge any higher then 10%. I am pretty bummed I even spent the money on these.
2,The sound quality goes out after a good week of use I work in lawn care and they just didn’t last.
2,La batería me dura apenas 3 horas súper mal!
1,They don't hold charge at all. I had them on charge all day and I got nothing.
1,They stopped connecting to my phone after 1 use. Still won’t connect even though they’re fully charged and I’ve tried restarting them.
1,It took all of 14 minutes before it started breaking up and essentially not working. I have no use for a barely functioning product
1,Wow. These ear phones are absolutely terrible. The sound quality sucks the comfortability is very bad (hurts my ears) the battery life is garbage. These earbuds refuse to stay in my ears every second I have to keep fixing and pushing them into my ear unless I jam them to the point where they hurt and the sound quality just becomes distorted.Horrendous. Save your money.
1,I got these as a gift for my sister who lives abroad! She called me a week after that they stopped working. First the left bud then the right followed two days later.
1,Tooooo bad  the left one is not working even I charged it for one day
1,I’m sure these would be totally worth it if both worked but only one connects the other was DOA.
2,It says that the battery would last hours it not even last 30 minutes and the earpkugs die.
1,One side did not work and the one that worked did not have good sound.. and would not stay in my ear
1,There was nothing To brag about take it off my list
1,Not impressed with sound or battery compared to similar products. Shape sucks and ALWAYS falls out.
2,They do not hold a charge. They suck or mine are defective
1,I love that are they are small and easy to carry around. My biggest problem is the connection. I can play music for at most 10 minutes at a time before the earbuds go silent but according to my phone they are still connected and the song is still playing. It's been happening each time I go to use them and it's very frustrating. It's not worth it to buy them if I can only use them for 10 minutes at a time.
2,One earbud didn't work
1,Seems like a few people have gotten these lemons.  The left earbud worked for 10 minutes then just out of the blue stopped working.  I tried everything to get it resynced over a couple of days then contacted customer care and they said it was defective.  I would not recommend these since the warranty is only 1 year or this could happen to you.
1,There is nothing I like about these earbuds. They didn't stay in my ears and when I tried to use the command button they are so hard to push that it wound up not doing what I'd want it to do. I like to listen to music at work but these don't go low enough for me to feel comfortable wearing them.
2,No bass what so ever
2,The sound quality isn't very good and the batery life is short but what u spect for 20 bucks
1,These are hands down the MOST UNCOMFORTABLE earbuds ever made. I can only keep them in for 40 mins at a time. I wanted to use them at my bench in the Lab for my entire work day but that is not possible. It’s not that the different sized part that goes in your ear canal it’s the circle shell. That part just expands your ear to the point where my ears become red and sore.
2,They were nice until a month and then they broke and stopped connecting. Don’t even buy it not even worth 20 bucks
1,Sound quality belies the usual Skullcandy reputation for fairly good sound overall and GREAT bass response. The Dime is low priced which is good but audio quality is terrible and bass response even worse. I'm surprised at how awful these earbuds are considering they're from Skullcandy. I'm returning this set to Amazon ASAP. DON'T PURCHASE! You'll regret it if you do! I wish I could give this item ZERO stars! ♐
1,I purchased these ear buds when they went on sale mainly because of the Skullcandy brand. Now I wasn't expecting Sony or Bose sound quality but that wasn't even the issue I had with them. They charged once paired once played music once (1 song) Then never turned on again. Same problem with not 1 but 3 different pairs! Stay clear from these ear buds!
2,They sound decent but keep cutting off and on when
1,I PURCHASED THESE THINKING THAT IT WOULD BE A GREAT VALUE FOR JUST USING THEM IN BED.  THE FIRST SET I RECEIVED WOULD NOT CONNECT AT ALL TO ANY DEVICE.  EXCHANGED THEM FOR ANOTHER PAIR AND NOW THEY WILL NOT STAY CHARGED.  TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME TRYING TO GET REFUNDED FOR BOTH PAIRS.
1,I wanted to love these headphones since they’re inexpensive in comparison to my beats solo3. I got these headphones for the gym and business calls. unfortunately my right earbud stopped working within 2 months of use (3-4 days). when my headphones worked they were excellent.
2,Could not get these to pair with my phone and stay chatged
1,DO NOT BUY THEY ARE FAULTY‼️‼️‼️ One ear bud will not work straight out the box
2,Great sound but always fall out of ear just walking
1,Worst purchase ever... they dont charge properly..  total waste of money ! Would not recommend.
1,They are good headphones but the battery life was a lie it’s not 22 hours it’s more like 3 hours at most. The sound is really good but I just wish there was more battery power. Oh and another thing is you have press the buttons really hard to use any of the functions
1,I ordered these in sheer excitement. When they arrived one worked the case was cracked and it didn't charge. Sad about this
1,They didn’t fit in my ear…they kept falling out of my ear
2,Noise canceling sucks and not good for music everything sounds like it’s mono no stero sound
1,I purchased 2 of these air buds (gray and black). The gray pack is not working correctly. The Bluetooth does not disconnect from phone after being pace in the case and closed. I do not have this issue with the black pair. How do I go about replacing the gray pair.
1,Got my package and the headphones weren't in the box just the charger... Not happy.
1,- No clear directions on how to charge earbuds in package- Could not charge using cord in package- Worked for 2 months then right ear bud stopped working.-Highly disappointed because I heard great things about skullcandy.
1,Great sound but they fall out constantly rendering them almost useless on top of annoying. If you have small ears do not purchase these. Other than that they are light weight and the charging base is very small compared to others. I won't purchase again but you may love them.
1,Scull candy was always my go to but these does not have good bass sound I spent to much for that
2,I dislike the battery life is not good at all
1,These don't work at all. I tried syncing them up with multiple different devices to make sure it wasn't a problem with my phone or computer. Nope it's the earbuds.Literally no sound or it comes out the speakers and not the earbuds. They connect for a hot second and then suddenly the device can't find them.Waste of money. Buy a better brand.
1,They did not last long.  One side has trouble charging completely.  I can only use the left side.
1,Doesn’t charge doesn’t auto sync when taken out of case don’t turn off when put back into case. You get what you pay for but I thought 25 bucks it would do what it said at least a few times. Not once. Don’t buy.
1,It came with a micro USB cable to some weird flat connector I've never seen and have no way to use so I can't charge them without buying a cable. As stated it's micro USB instead of USB C so I don't have any cables. No USB C or charging cable is too much for me so it's gotta go back.
1,Got these because they had good reviews but I think my ears are too small for them. The hard plastic portion hurts my ear and they don't stay in (even though I tried the smallest bud option they came with). I will have to return them.
1,They hurt my ears.  People couldn't hear me when used for talking on the phone. Sound was ok
1,No se si solo son los audífonos que adquirí pero no están cargando bien ni tampoco le dura la batería. Tampoco cargan cuando están guardados. Dice que tienen la carga completa y cuando conecto los auriculares al teléfono dicen que están en 10%. Solo llevo con ellos 1 semana. 😒 Quiero devolución de dinero.
1,I just bought them today and they're already having a problem with them. For example: Everytime the battery goes down by 10 percentage starting at a 100 percent it's says battery low even though it on high battery percentage. They're nice headphones but constantly hearing the battery dying really ticks me off.
1,They dropped the ball on these ear buds and I'm a skull candy fan
2,The plastic of the ear buds is sharp and cut into my ears and not super comfortable
1,I like the right bud. It works great. The left ear bud is difficult to turn on and doesn’t seem to hold a charge. Might be me but the right one works? Sorry I picked this pair and kept trying to make it work past the return date.  Live and learn.
2,Nice quality audio when they accually stay in your ear 🤦
1,The title says it all got the frist pair and they wouldn't stay connected for more the 5 minutes at a time. Returned the broken pair git a new pair they stop connecting to bluetooth after a month. Don't buy thes Sony has great pairs at the same price as these look for them.
2,Sound is good but the battery life is what makes it a 2 star product.
1,After two wonderful months with these headphones they stopped working entirely. The headphones themselves do not turn on and show no LED light to indicate they are on. The case still charges and the color of the LED still indicates it’s charge but the earbuds themselves are done. Waste of money.
2,Had a hard time pairing and not too comfortable
2,Very short battery life poor fit slipping when working out and you're sweating.
1,I can charge these for hours and they don’t last longer than an hour or so. I’ll be in a meeting and they’ll shut off because they die which is so freaking annoying. I wouldn’t recommend these to anyone simply out of my extreme frustration.
1,The worst audio quality I've ever heard from earphones. Even the cheap plastic ones from the dollar store have better audio. They're comfortable but what the point if you have this distorted compressed sounding noise constantly going on in the background. Wired Skullcandy earbuds have better audio than these and they're $10 cheaper.
1,I use it for work and it worked a week dose not stay charged 12 hours
1,Very disappointed with this purchase.  There were multiple problems with these headphones.  Poor sound quality would only sync together for a short time did not come with a regular usb charging cord and they don't make one that you can just purchase.
2,Battery life sux
1,The unit was junk.  It didn't hold a charge and it was impossible to connect to bluetooth.
1,Total disappointment.Think twice about buying.
1,I dislike the way they keep popping outta my ears.
1,The sound quality and everything se was great for about 2 weeks and then they just stopped working.
1,Down bad in 24 hours
1,Poor quality failed within 30 days. Can't return.
1,Worst headphones ever. Connecting them is a big issue!
1,Junk
1,Wouldn’t purchase again fitment sucks!! Always fall out!!
1,I had to send this item back immediately. My 1st pair of ear buds (a different brand) are great. I really like the wireless technology. However these were very uncomfortable for my ears even after I switched the sizes of the ear cushions.
2,These earbuds are not good.
1,Don’t last
1,I got this one ear bud wasn't working. I didn't want to return it so I just stuck with it. But they headphones only stayed paid to my phone for about a week. Idk what went wrong. Waste of money though.
1,I wish I could give this a negative 5. This headset completely sucks!  It will not hold a charge It shows being fully charged and only holds 20%. I'm pissed I wasted my money!
1,these never stayed charged they kept dying after 30 mins. waste of $$$
2,they were good at first but speaker blew after a week
1,The range of the Bluetooth is horrible I can have my phone in my pocket it's cuts off sound to the headphones I have to hold my phone in my hand near my chest to hear these ear buds. I do not reccomend anyone buying these
2,I like size but the sound quality is not good at all
1,Charged all night and battery lasted 5 minutes.
1,No tienen buen sonido no lo recomiendo...
1,I love Skullcandy products normally. This one is terrible on battery life.
1,Not charging anymore. Sounds quality poor also
1,Noise cancel doesn’t work.Cosmetically in poor shape if new bad product
2,Battery life 2 hrs at best
1,I have several of Skullcandy products. this one is the worst. Don't buy it
1,Sound quality is not bad but i can’t get them to stay in my ears tried all three size tips but still can’t get them to stay in I should’ve spent a little more for some better ones.
1,I had these charging overnight two days straight using different charges they battery or something does not work at all.
2,Not great at all don’t buy
1,They didn't work out of the box after charging.Amazon is replacing them. We'll see.
1,These are definitely not worth the money
1,not worth the portage stamp to even return these. cheap poorly made poor sound battery dies before the movie gets good.
1,
1,Sound quality is good but they don't stay charged nor stay in my ears.
1,
1,Item came broken. Waste of my money and time.
2,Battery life not good
1,I loved theses ear da for like two days until they stopped charging two days after I bought them. I didn’t drop them I didn’t break them I just used them and they broke.
1,Trash. The right earbud won't charge/connect  always had skullcandy earphones but this pair left me very disappointed
1,Skip it
1,The battery life is horrible.
1,The battery never charged for BOTH the case and earbuds. It would be great if it charges. I let the case AND earbuds charge for 3 DAYS!! It still hasn't charged. I should've return this sooner. Waste of money!
1,They look nice but unfortunately they feel and sound low quality. There are much better earbuds on the market for the price.
1,They never held a charge. Only lasted a few weeks before they just never charged again.
1,They stopped working after a week
1,Sound sucks I have tried every size of the ear bud and no matter what the fall out of my ear after 10 seconds. Only good thing about these is the small charging case
1,Broke within a few weeks of use
1,Left side battery will run for 3 hours and right side will last for 4 hours. Will not complete a full 8 hour work day.
1,Great price decent sound but super uncomfortable
1,Peace of crap
1,Tried pairing with 5 different Samsung mobile devices and not one would pair. Complete and utter garbage product. DO NOT BUY
1,After fully charging these ear buds did not work consistently. The battery life is very short. Less than 2 hours. Do not buy.
1,Don't buy waste of money buy better ones
1,Absolutely awful. I understand the price is cheap but skull candy could have charged a little more for a little better. Max volume sucks bt range is awful and after a half hour of wearing they are painful.
1,Brand new out the box the right ear bud never turns on or and it’s never fully charged. The right ear bud is. It working no even used once just never turned on doesn’t work you get what you pay for I guess
1,They don’t fit my ears even with the smallest earbud.I returned them and I still haven’t received my refund which is disappointing
1,Do not buy. Bad quality broke after a month do not stay in my ears with any of the size options do not block out sound even on full volume.
1,They won't connect to my phone.
1,The pair I received only last about 3 hours fully charged.
1,Don't waste your money on this they are defected
1,You can barely hear with them and it doesn’t stay connected to the phone. The battery doesn’t last long at all.
1,They sound worse than the $10 fake AirPods. Have always loved Skullcandy products but should have paid more for their other earbuds.
1,You can't expect much from $20 earbuds but dang. These are so cheaply made and they disconnect constantly.
1,The item is notwork
1,Left charing for a whole day.....40% battery.....left. Charging for 2 days......10% battery?
1,Battery does not last I have had this only for a couple of months and this pair would not take a charge anymore.
1,It’s horrible
1,It's a decent pair of earbuds but it would not recharge. I tried different charging cords but nothing.
1,These are terrible headphones even for cheap ones. The connectivity is absolutely terrible and has lots of problems. They also don't fit in my ears very well.
1,Can’t say I’m not surprised. Won’t connect to anything after 2 weeks of use. When it does connect it drops the connection within a minute or two.
1,Hated the fact that 1st pair didn't work. 2nd pair didn't work.  Now Noone will give me a refund. Hate this company. Would never deal with them again! Do NOT recommend!
1,The quality is ok for headphones- but the headphones would not power on for 5 minutes. Kept- shutting down and loosing sync with I phone- would I purchase again- no thanks
3,Head phone usage
1,Very disappointed
1,They are hard to pair.(bad instructions.) The batteries are short lived. They sound OK though!
1,The left earbud would not charge. I left it for 24 hours straight and nothing. I returned it.
1,Worked for about a week. Then one of the pods stopped charging and holding a charge. The other pod lasted about a week after that. Now neither of them work.
4,If you are looking for the best earbuds these might not be it but there is still a lot of value to be had.One of the most appealing qualities of the Skullcandy Dime 2 earbuds is the fact that they are super portable. The sound quality is not terrible but it does not compare to any of the premium earbuds which I think is probably relatable to its size. On top of being really portable they are also compatible with the tile app which makes them easy to find and anything that is near them which is why I tend to keep them in my keychain.If you are trying to find the best sounding earbuds these are probably not it but if you are trying to get the most portable these are definitely up there. I hope this review helps you make an educated purchasing decision.
1,Battery life is nonexistent. Very disappointed in skull candy
1,They lasted a week before the right side stopped working basket with the $50 ones Skullcandy isn't doing good these days. Currently trying to get my money back
1,One side doesn't work! Nuff said.
4,Decent enough earbuds but thought they'd stay in my ears better. I can literally be sitting still and they will start to fall out. Tried all 3 sizes and it makes no difference. Was excited to use them for my hikes but can't trust them to stay put so they are used only in my home office.
1,Unfortunately only one earbud works after less than a week of use.
1,I charge them to 100%. Got to work at 7 by 10 they were dead.  I work long days so I need something that lasts at least 7 hours
1,The charging cage and left earbud did not work!!!! The right side sounds weird. Low quality material as well
1,One one earbud connects at a time. You can’t wear both buds at the same time or the sound will only come out from one.
1,Worst product ever
1,literally stopped working after 2 days. it refused to charge. and the right me never even turned on
1,Was excited to get these but quickly disappointed as they only stayed charged for 2 hours. Recharged and used 4 times then they stopped working all together.
1,It stop working the first week I opened it. try to charge multiple time’ nothing" its dead
1,Buds don't stay in ear. Returned
1,These are fukn TRASH... I got 2 different pairs and neither worked properly
1,First got them and they turned on and connected fine. Died in 5 minutes and I wasn’t able to get them to charge again
1,Puts pressure on my ear and causes severe pain.
1,it really hurt ears and don't fit very well sharp molding and control bouton is just too hard to push that it doesnt work good
1,Don’t buy this earbuds  it is horribleDon’t work well
3,Battery life sucks i bought these for work . Ever time i turn around they are dead. The sound is okay it’s not very loud but you get what you pay for
1,Battery life horrible
1,I use this product so I don’t have to hold my phone.
4,If you are looking for an inexpensive small set of earbuds for podcasts these are a decent choice.The small form factor disappears in the pocket and the colors are nice but that is about all the nice things I can say.The tiny form factor means the sound is somewhat empty the battery life barely gets you through a workday and the button on the buds are so small and hard to use I find it easier to remove the buds to use them.I would highly recommend passing on these and going with the Sesh or Sesh Evo for the better sound and battery life.
1,Wouldn’t stay on battery life sucks. Don’t bother.
1,Do not charge properly! Amazon selling defective products.
1,Bad!
1,I received these think they would be perfect to use for work. They wouldn't even charge and the usb cable is not here.
1,Not worth buying
1,Horrible customer service. Earbuds keep saying something not related to anything I’m listening to. Poor battery life. Stay
1,Used These For Use Only & The Battery Life Is Horrible Neither The Earbuds Or Case Stays Charged You Can Get A Good Hour Maybe 2hrs Of Usage Wouldnt Recommend
1,There is no bass whatsoever with these buds.  The sound quality is not much better than a dollar store wired set.  Was disappointed.
1,The sound was great but it won't hold a charge past 30 percent.
1,They didn’t want to stay in my ears and don’t sound the best I’ve had the same problem with another pair of skull candys
1,Crap
1,They laster for a couple of uses until their bluetooth feature failed.
1,the sound quality is not what you would expect considering the price I feel as there are cheaper earbuds out there with better quality
1,ive been charging these for over an hour and they are still at low battery. this is honestly a waste of money
1,Very I uncomfortable and the battery life is terrible and frequently disconnects and songs skip. They fall out easily when making any facial expression.
1,The Connection Sucks I Cant Put My Phone In My Back Pocket Or Put It In My Front Pocket Without It Losing Connection So I’m Very Disappointed With This Purchase
1,The charger is broken
1,Could have be nice I guess. Not worth the cost of the shipping. Holds a charge for 3-5 minutes. Very Tinny sounding. Absolute garbage!!!
1,Terrible battery life. Two hours at best.
1,This bitches won't even turn on after charging up used or not I still expected them to at least work.
1,Sound cancelation is not good. Not water proof not sweat proof. Won’t buy again.
1,It lost the tru wireless connection in about a week. It worked perfectly until the right ear stopped connecting.
1,Sound quality is good. Like that you can use either bud at a time. Battery life low.
1,These ear buds last 2 to 2 1/2 hours tops.  I’m very disappointed in them as I bought them for the brand name.
1,Worked great the first time. Fits good. Now when I connect only one ear will play at a time. And they refuse to play together. Can't do anything about it.
1,Couldn't go very far away before cutting out and battery life not so good. But it's little and cute. Love the string attachment
1,They won’t keep a charge the sound is real low really don’t like them I order some more the very next day
1,Already not working and only have had this a couple months and I’ve bought skull candy before and had a good experience but not with this
1,So they worked for about 4 minutes then died. I charged and they never powered back on. Returned.
1,they keep falling out.
4,These were easy to pair with my phone. Has an issue with being able to control volume and had to go into phone settings to unlock volume control. This problem did not exist with my other wireless headphones.Sound quality is only average and lacks bass response.
1,Poor quality
1,Don't buy
1,No charger so I haven’t even tried them.
1,Trash
1,These are the worst earbuds. The battery life is terrible and they constantly loose connection
1,The right earbud stopped working after one month. Will not charge. Sounded great and comfortable until could only hear with left ear Bud.
1,Never stay charged.  Never able to use
1,They don't stay in your ears no matter what pieces or size you use. The moment you go to talk they fall out.
1,Stopped working after a short while of receiving it
1,Very poor battery life. Not worth the price.
1,Why do I hear a echo all the time with these headphones. What crap buy the Apple ones
1,Ear buds die within a hour and half do not last 12 hours like product says.
1,This is the worst piece of junk I've ever bought on Amazon.
4,Los agarre en 10$ por promoción asi que por ese precio ningun otra marca tiene buen sonido y bateria aparte son muy pequeños y eso hace que sean muy buenos al llevarmos en el bolsillo
1,Worthless product
1,They hurt my ears. From insertion to short listens they do not sit well in the ear canal
3,I work in an extremely loud environment and it just feels like they don't cancel the noise effectively nor do they seem to be loud enough to drown out my coworkers but the mic picks up EVERYTHING it seems.I'm actually a little bit disappointed that the wired Skullcandy earbuds are still my go-to given the expectations I had for these wireless ones. They just don't seem to have the oomph to compete with their so-called outmoded brethren and worse they aren't even supported by the Skullcandy app which is annoying.I can't really attest to the battery life completely but I've never had them die when I've used them even after quite some time at work.
3,I really like this product. The problem I had is that I had to order it twice because they had problem with the shipping and I had to wait a while to receive the item.
4,They are very comfortable they have two plastic pieces that need to be removed before charging or else they will not charge.
1,The left bud doesn't charge at all. Didn't even last for a month
1,Battery life 1 hour staticy noise cancelation is OK being generous. Not even worth 25 bucks
4,Cheap alternative and great value for the amount of money.
4,For the price they're pretty good. Bass is good. Not insane but it's good. They fill in my whole ear. I prefer these over airpods. Skullcandy never disappointed me to be to be honest. All my skullcandys sound great
1,One of the earbuds is not even working after one month... sound was good but suddenly one of the earbuds died
1,Lost 1 earbud
5,Got these for a friend and she absolutely loves them!
1,I normally love all of my skull candy products but this not so much! Definitely feel I wasted my time!!
1,Can never get the right one to charge for some reason.
3,For the low price I paid $10 bucks in offer up I guess you can't expect much.  They are only $25 on Amazon.  There are a lot better quality ones on Amazon for that price or a few dollars more.  I would not recommend these for the following 3 reasons:1) Sound quality - Average2) Fit - Below Average fall out easily3) Charging - Micro USB not USB Type C
1,Missing product all that was in the box was a charge cord and replacement ear cushions. NO EAR BUDs. Buyer beware
1,Horrible
1,Poor quality VERY short battery life.. Sound quality is regular to not worth it.
1,Couldn't get these to connect to anything
1,Worked for one day. When we tried to charge they would not take a charge. Super disappointed.
1,Says 12 hour battery life but dies in 2 hours
3,Sound quality is acceptable and noise cancellation as well.Unfortunately they keep on slipping out when I use them for running and sound quality is not that great when making phone calls. It is hard to hear when on a call and keeps on pausing.Item is ok and can’t complain for the price they are perfect to listen to music if sitting down not doing any activities which might cause for the ear pod to slip out.For the price I don’t have to worry about loosing them or anything happening to them since I’ve previously lost expensive pods.
1,literal trash
5,Small sturdy clear sound good price.  I can't ask for more for the price.
1,Uncomfortable hard to use earbuds. Cheap feeling everything.
1,do not stay charged past about 2 to 3 hours and cut out
1,Horrible instructions  poor quality  even the website and the tech couldn't troubleshoot it right.
1,pay for a more quality pair...these don't last long.
1,Horrible product if I could give 0 stars I would
3,These were great for 5 months....  then the battery in the right earbud just stopped working...The left followed about 2 months later...  Not the best....
1,Pretty simple. The right ear bud stopped working after a month.
3,I don’t know what type of adapter to use for the USB cord. Please direct me to the box for the cord.
1,Didnt/couldn't use
1,Product is hasn’t good connection and not stay in ear
5,Ive had these for almost 2 days. and i love the bass. i can never hear anyone from themIll add updates to see if they break or anything but ill treat them right.
1,The earphones sounded great for three days then the sound got very distorted.
5,I love these my AirPods just stopped working and I refused to pay that much again! These were easy to pair and are very loud !Great find!
1,Rubbish one ear doesn’t work Now they’re both useless
5,I'm not a fan of the "airpod" style Bluetooth headphones (they hurt my ears) and I had bought a set of these previously from a different store. They are good quality well made comfortable to wear Bluetooth headphones.I can go a solid 6 hours without needing to charge them and honestly forget they are even in my ears.If you want a set of headphones that does exactly what you need it to do without costing an arm and a leg then pick up a set of these.
1,Dropped it one time at work from about 3-4 feet haven’t worked since
1,Just not very good
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The battery life is 5 minutes
1,Only one works at a time terrible buy. Barely used it
5,No sirvieron no cargaban y el auricular derecho no prendía
1,Low quality
5,I used these for school and had to charge them during my lunch break but other than that could use them all day. Sound great.
1,Only one works
1,Love the size but I can’t hear anything.  Wouldn’t recommend
1,Battery didnt last even 1 hour
1,Way too small. It got lost in my ear
1,Wouldn't recommend. Hurt when ear and also doesn't stay in your ear
5,These are the greatest $20 wireless earbuds ever. Ordering my second pair only because the first pair went through the wash twice and STILL work!! I figured I should have a back up pair since I obviously can't check my pockets thoroughly and I don't want to go a day without if it happens again and I'm not so lucky a third time!
1,Dead on Arrival. Only one earbud works.
1,I don’t like anything about these headphones
1,these are awful
1,Worse than free airline earbuds
4,The sound quality is pretty good. I wear these on the mower and the sound cancellation is above average. Wish the battery life were longer. These lasted for about an hour.
1,Poor battery life
1,Only one side worked…
1,Battery life is no good
1,I just got mine charged them and they wont even turn on.
1,way too big
1,I said what i said
1,Battery life is no good
5,For the amount that these cost they actually sound pretty good.
4,My sisters screamed at me for about 20 minutes and I had no idea cause I had these earbuds on. So they’re pretty noise cancelling and sound really good. But they’re not the best at staying put in your ears unless you’re willing to settle for a painful fit.
1,i couldn't wear these they hurt my ears abs gushy stay in!
1,
5,These don't compare to my Sony true wireless earbuds at all. But what these are good at is being there when you need them. On the days I forget my Sony earbuds these dimes are always waiting for me at the bottom of the bag. And that is so worth the cost I may buy a second and stash it somewhere else
1,Very practical for beaters quality is egh
1,Ok product for the price. Ear buds keep.falling.off
1,👎🏼
1,It sucks
3,Battery life is not good.Sound quality and noise cancellation is great.
1,Sounds goodVery short battery life
1,Not really worth the price
5,After the first time it pairs IMMEDIATELY from your car to your ear to your car and back.I had 150$ buds as a gift that drove me nuts with pairing. Losing them was a godsend as I bought these; and all my problems vanished.  I was primarily audiobooks and podcasts; 90 minutes a day of lines exercise drudgery some phone calls.  Charge every night like the phone never go wrong.  I hate Airpods every teenager has to have but I got sick of wires.
5,These earbuds are really well made and also it's a brand that pretty much everybody knows: Skullcandy! The sound quality is good for the price more focused on the lows. It's recommended to EQ this as these earbuds shine when you use a equalizer. I used Wavelet for Android and used the AutoEQ setting using Skullcandy Dime setting. They work well however changing it to another earbuds present (Like Sony XM4s) they work really well and improved sound quality (clear sound vocals and also bass is better). The size is indeed a gem and for 20 bucks you cannot go wrong. These buds are tiny but powerful.
5,Earbuds don't always fit my ears but these have and really happy with them.
5,Like these their casd can just be carried in pocket not bulky
4,These earbuds are very stylish. I love that they have Tile finding availability since earbuds tend to get lost so easily. They also have a small loop on the case to attach to a key chain or something for greater ease of keeping track of them.I was hoping the small mic stick would be a game changer and not get caught on masks as easily and it really is helpful while still picking up conversation well. Everyone I was on phone calls with said that they could hear me perfectly and that the call was continuous not spotty like with other brands I have tried.As for sound quality for me the volume seemed to have a mind of its own. I would be listening to music and it would be very quiet and then out of nowhere become very loud. Same with hearing during phone calls. The sound was crisp and clear but varied in volume quite a bit. This may be due however to my one large down point. These earbuds are incredibly uncomfortable for small ears! I tried both of the two smallest soft covers and could not get a great fit. The problem isn’t the inner ear bit though it is the exterior bit that fills up the rest of the ear. I apparently do not have enough space in that area for these buds and it was exceedingly painful the longer I had them in. So much so that when I took one out it hurt too bad to put it back in. As such I was not really able to test battery life. They worked continuously for the 3 hours that I was able to tolerate them.I had my 11 year old son try them and he said they fit great with no pain. I may just give them to him now and continue the search for myself.Overall they are a very nice product at a fantastic price. If your ears are not considered small such as don’t have problems with regular in ear headphones and the like then these should work great for you!
1,Save your money!
3,The battery life is horrible but the design and fit is so good battery kills it
5,GREAT FOR WORKING OUT OR ON THE GO. SUPER SIMPLE BUT SURPRISINGLY LOUD AND GREAT ON THE SOUND QUALITY. %100 RECOMMEND IT!
5,The battery life is stellar and the sound quality iz fabulous. absolutely a wonderful product
4,I've got lots of ear buds including the Airpod Pro Sennheiser and Jabra Elites (65 75 and 85).  for each of the others I bought a separate case and attached a tile tracker to it so they don't get lost.  Tile has helped me find them whether they buds fell behind my desk or I left them in a room I forgot I had been in.That said the Tile functionality on these is pretty amazing as it is built into EACH earbud - that is NOT the case but each bud - a bud drops out of your ear and onto the floor (that happens to me even with Comply foam tips installed) and my used to be go-to move was to silence everything else in the room and then play music at top volume to find the missing bud.  Now with the Tile App it is even easier than that as the sound is louder than music playing and much clearer.As to the buds themselves - the sound is not on par with $200 or even $100 buds but at this price point the sound is better than I expected especially with the Tile thrown in.  The case is small as are the buds and the case uses a lot less plastic than other buds - part of the Skullcandy environmental ethos - but I found it surprising that I had to peel off two large plastic film pieces from the case before I could use it.Also note that the buds have a small sticker on each that covers the battery connection.  I was annoyed that mine were not charging until I figured that out.  In fairness it is pointed out in the instructions.Overall I would think these represent a good value for the sound quality size and good battery life but when the Tile functionality is added these represent a great value.  These are the buds I carry around in my pocket when I'm out and about and I save the expensive ones for home use or real travel.I'm happy to highly recommend these.
4,The skullcandy dime 2's are much better than I expected. I have been testing for a week with various connections and everything has been good so far. For a comparison I have compared these to Samsung Buds+ and to my surprise these have held up nicely.Pros:-good all around sound not over powering with bass semi balanced for music.-auto connection to devices once paired-built in Tile functionality-decent build quality-ability to adjust volume on both ear buds (big plus)-good call quality sound is clear and not compressed. The mics did a good job of voice pickup.-comfort level is average to good and stayed in place while moving or working out.-passive noise cancelation is good with proper fit.-worked with all my devices well including Nintendo Switch Samsung S21 PC  and Google Tv. On the Nintendo switch there was a small amount of latency but they were usable. Music through Spotify at highest quality did not cause any clipping and volume at max did not cause any distortion through any of the above devices.-new Bluetooth 5.2 protocol the new protocol had amazing range as I went four rooms over and the BT connection was still strong.Cons:Average battery life the earbuds lasted a bit over 3 hours per use once fully charged but the case does give about 2 and a quarter charges the advertised battery life for me was about 11.5 hours so 8 hours from the case and earbuds were a bit over 3 hours per charge.Comfort-i had to adjust left earbud with the largest tip for a snug fit it was not uncomfortable but did require finding a good eartip. The other fit just fine with medium eartip.Accesories: included charging cable is micro USB and not USB C also it is only 2 inches in length.Overall this is a very good pair of earbuds for just everyday use. This was my first time using skullcandy brand and these earbuds fit every use or scenario I had day to day. Overall I reccomend these as a good all around pair of wireless earbuds.
5,I bought 2 pairs of these a year ago and for the price they cant be beat.  The sound is good not great. Compared to sony xm4 earbuds they lack clarity and some bass  but at the price theres no complaint. Battery life is about 5hrs for me I use one at a time for work and at homr and never let me down.
2,Don't recommend these earbuds as they fall out way too easily.  Sound quality also isn't the best.
4,As a person who commutes 2+ hours on NY public transportation it's incredibly important for all my items to be convenient and these are!Here's my list to simplify everything down!Positives:- Decent Sound Quality:The sound quality won't blow you out of the water but it isn't bad either. The average person should be fine with these.- Good Call Quality:The mic works well picking up sound and it's useful when I'm walking around.- Small and Portable:These earphones are incredibly tiny and therefore easy to carry.- Inexpensive Price Point:Don't except Active Noise Canceling (ANC) or other high end features at the $30 price point. If you keep expectations relatively average you shouldn't be disappointed.Negatives:- Micro USB Charging Standard:I've transitioned most of my other devices to USB C making the outdated Micro USB standard incredibly inconvenient.Final Thoughts?The inexpensive price point light weight form factor and decent sound quality make these a easy default choice!
4,These are the Dime 2 which are largely the same as the first generation (which are currently still available for $4 less than the price of the Dime 2). The Dime/Dime 2 from Skullcandy are an affordable pair of true wireless earbuds one of the cheapest options available without rolling the dice on a brand that you have never heard of before.At this price point you lose out on a lot of features but they did a good job of delivering on the basics. The sound quality is acceptable I think most people will be satisfied by it. It's not amazing or anything but it's about as good as you can get for a pair of bluetooth true wireless earbuds at this price. These are small both the case and the buds themselves that's part of why the battery life is so short. 3.5 hours for the buds with another 8.5 from the charging case. That's honestly not great most buds give 4-6 hours in the buds and another 18-24 in the case. But again for the price it's really not that bad (in my opinion).The one new thing that these have over the original Dime is the Tile integration you can link these (both the left and the right bud) to your Tile account and find them with your smartphone once you have installed the mobile app and given it the necessary permissions needed to function. It seems to work as reliably as a Tile Mate (current generation) that I also have linked to my account. If you don't need or care about this feature then just buy the original Dime earbuds because everything else seems to be exactly the same on both models across the board.
5,I love Skull Candy have for over 10 years.. the price for these are great.. the noise cancellation easy set up if you read the instructions.. it specifically tells you the battery life so idk why ppl would complain about it
3,The buttons are Extremely hard to use as they are so Stiff
3,Disclaimer: I have had these headphones for a week.These earphones get the job done but they're not suited for music because there is a hollow quality that is hard to ignore. There is decent noise cancelling but I find adjusting the effects cumbersome. I think it is better for listening to audiobooks/lectures and the like because the voices are clearer and require minimal adjusting. So far I am not impressed but they make a decent backup pair.
4,This is a cool set of earbuds -- very small so that it does not interfere with long hair. That's one of the reason I got them (as a gift for someone who has long hair). The tile integration would have been useful if we moved to a AirTag household now. The sound quality is very good for such a small earbuds.The case has an interesting design -- the top of the earbuds are exposed in the case. I am not sure why that is a good idea.One medium complain about these ear buds -- the button is some sort of soft rubber on top of a mechanical switch. It is almost impossible to press those buttons. Of course I can control all the functions directly on the iPhone but it is still annoying whenever I try to use the buttons.
4,A veces se salen si sonrio o hago gestos con la cara.
3,I bought the pit viper edition of the dime headphones. They only stay in upside down in the opposite ears.I wear the right on my left ear upside down and vice versa in the other ear.Kinda sucks tbh. No other buds fit in my ears either so I guess I'm stuck like this?
5,I bought a pair of these expecting them to be mediocre at best given the $20 price tag and being bluetooth. To my surprise they’re really nice earbuds. They’re comfortable seal nicely and get fairly loud. They’re fairly balanced with some nice punchy bass and crisp top-end. These aren’t quite as nice sounding as some of the wired hifi buds you can get for a similar price but they’re definitely worth picking up.
5,These are fantastic! The fit and the convenience is incomparable and if it holds out the battery life is truly astonishing! The sound is not what I would want…the bass is iffy and I have to turn them all the way up to get the range I want…but for the price and when you factor in the comfort and convenience…there are no comparisons available.the sound is a tad flat. But as a spare that I attach to my key ring I don’t mind at all. Why would anyone need a spare? Well if your go-to set runs out of juice and needs to spend some time in it’s charging case then having a spare in your pocket is truly handy. I listen to music all day long and to spare my coworkers from the yacht rock my old self has taken a liking to I always have ear buds in place. But I have been unable to find a pair that doesn’t hurt my auricular (the cartilage outer portion of your ears) until I tried these. Skull Candy made these in a mold that was EXACTLY the right size for my ears. And they fit snugly so walking riding my bike or chewing doesn’t dislodge them. That is a first for yours truly.Also the battery power is incomparable. While it is true I only used them as a backup pair they did get several hours of playtime each day but they didn’t need recharging until the end of the week. And here dear reader is the only other fault I found with the Skull Candy Dime 2 true wireless ear buds. When they ran out of juice they just stopped playing. there was no warning. No pleasant female voice no tone no warning of any kind. But it did not take too much head-scratching to figure out what was up. I plugged them into my portable power station for a few hours and…voila! And just as a side note you might want to limit yourself to the controls on the iPod/phone/tablet these are paired too. The buttons on the units themselves are worthless. Finding them is hard enough but if your fingers are too large (as mine definitely are) than you won’t be able to actuate them. Even if you do you will end up pushing them deeper into you ear canals. I only mention this as an aside and don’t let it affect my rating because this is a very common failing of these units. Even those with touch sensors only work half the time so just use the controls on the phone.Do I wish they had better more powerful sound? Wireless charging? A more useful companion app? Sure but for the price fit and convenience…these are hard to beat!
4,I've been a major fan of Skull-Candy earbuds over the last few years after having  bought different pairs at different price points. Each have been exceptional values for their particular prices and functionality. This "Dime 2" model is the least expensive and newest ones retailing for 30-bucks at the time of this review. Every other pair of earbuds I've experienced in this price-range have been disappointing: tinny sound flimsy and prone to easily breaking light and cheap to the touch. There is none of this in these Skull-Candies. They're not in the same league as the hundred-dollar-plus buds I have but they're far superior to those of comparable price. The sound quality is good connection is as fast and stable as any I've experienced and play-time lasts several hours. There is one less than stellar quality however; notably the charging case of these "Dime 2s" feel rather light and seems like is won't stand up too well to a drop. I'd be extra careful to make sure that doesn't happen. That said these are an exceptional bargain ideal as a back-up pair when you don't want to carry your more expensive ones or as gift that will be very appreciated without setting you back much at all.
4,I love these ear buds so much. My only complaint is that the battery life is very short. The sound quality is great. The noise canceling isn’t the best but it does the job. A lot of times I can’t hear my friends talking to me.
4,I'm happy with these Skullcandy Dime 2 buds.  Set your expectations going in realizing that for $30 these won't best Airpods and other expensive sets in the sound or feature departments.  But they do provide a solid experience and good bang for your buck.  The sound quality is good with pleasant but not overdone bass and nice crisp highs.  Unsurprisingly at this price point you don't get a companion app or EQ controls (or active noise reduction) but thankfully the sound is actually very enjoyable and better than I expected.  The buds also do a good job of blocking sound passively and they stay in my ears comfortably and securely.  To use the touch controls you have to press the buds pretty hard - they don't have capacitive touch response that just requires light contact but contain an actual button under a rubberized layer.  This is my least favorite design choice though I guess there is the benefit that you won't get any accidental button presses!  The case is nice and petite making it good for pocket carry.  It's also very sturdy as are the buds themselves - everything feels very durably made and engenders confidence that they'll last.  Battery life is okay - not great but sufficient.  I also found them perfectly capable on phone calls with no problems hearing others clearly or being heard.  Overall these are solid no-frills buds at a fair price: very good build quality solid sound and pretty good design.
1,I loved the form factor but the battery life and reliability of this unit is abysmal! Do not waste your money! This is very tiny and fits my ears perfectly even when I'm running which is fantastic but the trade off is one hour battery life listening to music and it doesn't always connect automatically to my phone. The battery itself is of poor quality and does not want to charge after a few uses! I had bought a couple of them as disposable headphones. Not worth it even at a low price!
5,Enjoy
1,Don’t even waste your time or money they don’t work and they won’t connect at all
4,These are solid basic Bluetooth earbuds with good well-rounded sound quality. They have the skull candy logo on everything including the incredibly short charging cable charging case back of each ear bud and ear insert piece. I just use the original ear insert piece but it comes with different sizes which is nice.My only complaints are that the lanyard was difficult to get through the angled hole and it is tricky to plug in the charging cable. The port for the charging cable is recessed and I have to press so hard to plug it in I am worried I may damage it.
4,Worked amazing at first but then one earbud started to get quieter and quieter to where now I have to wear them one at a time or it gives me a headache. I wore them one at a time at work so I'm thinking it has something to do with that but still.
1,Took a few days to stop hurting in one ear. They slide out on their own sometimes. Music quality is great. Call quality is terrible. I use them for both so I'm upgrading to galaxy buds 2. Hopefully they live up to the hype.
5,Excellent quality and sound.
3,
5,Audífonos con bajos muy buenos y se adaptan fácilmente
2,The ear buds fall out and noise cancellation is highly dependent on head position because the ability to sit properly in your ear is also dependent on head position. Technically Sound quality is good but since there is a poor fit you can’t actually get good sound unless you sit still… so it’s not actually USEABLE. Battery lasted me 2hr and a couple minute from a full charge. Do not buy. There are options of comparable price with better usability.
3,This piece was uncomfortable on wearing keeps sliding off rubber piece replacement won't stay hurt my ears. Take a while to pair. Can't tell if charge aside when green lites. Can't return cause it's closed for returns. Sounds all right it just hurts my ear and sliding off.
2,First off these headphones barely fit my ears. I have slightly smaller ears and it is work to keep the headphones in which is inconvenient as my hands are often wet at work. Second they're only good for ~3 hours before needing a charge in the case. Finally mine are only a year old and the left earbud is already dying. Just low value earbuds overall.
2,the sound quality is good but the battery life got me only an hour or so which is quite pathetic if you ask me
4,So I ordered these bad bois for some people in my family for Christmas gifts 🎁.  They are really nice ear buds for the price sweat resistant for all the gym people or anyone who actively sweats haha . Decent charge time an they hold I belive 4 hous in each bud pluss the charge case . Easy to use ear click features an the way they are designed it doesn't feel like im pressing them into my head at all . Rather I'm pushing the ear bud it self . I'm buying a pair for my self and a couple other family members
5,These are great ear buds they fit my ears very comfortably and both have great audio and mic quality. The range is also very impressive and the battery life is alright and typical of others I have tried. In all they are very good especially for how little they cost.
1,Left earbud was broken out the box
4,These ear buds do what they're supposed to. The noise cancellation isn't the best but at this price point I didn't expect much. It was a pretty long range get loud and they don't loon big and bulged out of your ear. Definitely worth the spend you won't regret it.
4,hello i love to sing and listen to music and when it comes to this to nice fit and great noise to it awesome.either going outside for a jog or bike ride between basketball and mowing grass they are amazing sleek design battery life works for long time. only downside right now it somehow mine overheated the right earbud and waiting to get back from.
5,Good sound quality. Get me through my workouts with ease :)
1,Absolute garbage. I have had cheap buds that have great battery life. These have about 1.5 hours of talk time. That is ridiculous.I also go to bed with 1 bud in at a time and listen to a podcast. I don't set stitcher to continuously play so the bud is just connected without sound being transmitted. When I wake up about halfway into the night it is at 10% and saying "low battery" alert.These are completely useless for what I got them for.I highly recommend you skip these if battery life is at all important to you. There are other brands that are the same price that last way longer.
5,love these little headphones. I use these when working out or just around the house wanting to get a break from the noises I typically hear from the kids being kids. I can sit next to them in the living room watching youtube on my phone with headphones in and not hear them which is nice sometimes. The battery life is great and the audio quality is too. The price point for these is another win as they are very affordable for what you get. A lot of sound packed into a small pair of buds.
5,I have no complaints these are affordable super small and compact to carry wherever you go and the sound it great. I charged them right when I received them for about an hour and I have used them ALOT and they are still not showing any signs of low battery. These connect very easy to my BT on my phone which is also great because I usually have problems connecting things (Not tech savvy).They are comfortable to wear and they come with a warranty.I have owned a pair similar to these in a different brand and liked them as well but these seem to cancel the right amount of noise and I love how small they are and love that they do not fall out when I am running. I put them on my keychain so I never lose them it has a loop so you can attach them to something (win).
2,The battery life is not quite at the level they described. I’ve had these for a little over a month and the battery life has significantly declined.
5,Got these for my husband to use and my son has the SkullCandy that are a little bigger battery. This set seems to work and sound just as good as the set my son owns and the battery charges at the same rate but does last about 2-3 hours less than his set. Love that these come with 3 different size rubber earpads. Great choice for anyone looking to grab a good set of Bluetooth headphones at a great price!
5,I've tried other earbuds that were $100+ & I absolutely love these over the others! They're super compact easy to use and the sound quality is 🙌 I'm so glad I found these & I use them every day at work. Give them a try I'm sure you too will find they're a great buy!
3,Bluetooth pairing was quick and easy.Sound is nothing great but OK.The controls are not touch sensitive. They are pressure activated. Almost every time I had to take them off and look at them to operate the controls.
1,Nowhere near 12 hour life. Rather flimsy feel than sturdy case I expected. Purchased on prime day thinking it was a deal but no value here. Really disappointed compared to 5 star off brand buds at the same price. Used to be a Skull Candy fan.Update: after 2 weeks I hate them. They slip out from just walking. The rubber pieces are too thin.2nd update: after 30days the right side stopped working entirely doesn't charge and started out with cracking noises.
4,I spend my life either on the phone or listening to music.  My collection of headphones and earbuds is frankly ridiculous.  They range from incredibly inexpensive no-name stuff to the latest AirPods and Jabras each with a purpose sometimes which is simply to take up space or act as a paperweight.I own other Skullcandy headphones and the product has proven to be a reliable mid-range product.  For me the function has always represented a bit of a value performing better than similarly priced products but not comparable to higher-end products.With a $25 price point and a size smaller than any other set of earbuds with a case that I own these have proven to be a good value from Skullcandy.  The sound is surprisingly bass-heavy and the sound does NOT leak outside the well-designed buds - that is someone sitting next to me does not have to hear my music.  I've pictured the case of this one (black) with my Apple AirPod Pro (white case) Jabra Elite 85t (gold case) for size comparison.On calls I'm told that I sound fine that my voice does not have that underwater or tunnel sound that inexpensive headsets have.  Siri understands me fine.There is some cost of going budget - there is of course no noise cancellation and limited battery life.  One thing that's been done to keep the package smaller and lighter is that the case top is cutout to all the headphones to stick through the case - securely - a nice touch that results in less plastic as well as smaller size and weight.The company seems committed to recyclable packaging - the entire box and interior packaging including the "hang tag" are cardboard - no plastic on it at all - and emblazoned with the point that the packaging is 100% recycleable.  The company is making a clear effort here and I respect that.The buds were easy and intuitive to pair.  The only issue I had was that they ship with a piece of tape over the connector of each ear bud which I didn't realize.  Until you take the tape off the buds will not charge.The buds fit into the case with the use of magnetic pulls and they can't be put in wrong.  Though not labeled the left and right buds are clearly distinguishable.One big bonus that is not common is that EITHER bud can be used alone wonderful for conserving battery life if you are simply using them for phone calls.  Many other headsests limit single bud use to just a particular bud.Overall I am impressed particularly at this price point.  The only real downside is the comparatively short battery life but that's a fair tradeoff for the very small size.
4,I got them at a local store as I was looking for some decent wireless earbuds with a smaller case than my powerbeats pro's. In that regard it's done its job well as the dime's case is probably 1/4th the beats size. Another thing which is both a pro and a con is that the case is pretty lightly made so it weighs almost nothing but as such the quality of it is pretty poor but i got mine for $22 so I'm not really expecting much. Sound quality on them is waaaaaaaaaaaaay better than I would've imagined and is definitely comparable to the mentioned beats. On the box it says the buds have 3.5 hour life with the case providing another 8.5 for a total of 12 but as I haven't had a situation to test them like that I'll have too see. Another big reason I bought these is when I don't want to pull out my jbl boombox such as early in the work day or if boss man is pissed off and not having to drop another $100 for some good sounding music is nice. Overall I'd say if your sceptical just buy them and try them out you'll honestly be surprised on how good they are
5,We're too loud for me and I couldn't figure out how to work them without any buttons or anything..I'm too old I suppose..but I resold them and the guy loves them!
1,Buds do not fit in case properly. They will turn on randomly and connect to a device and kill it's battery.
1,I purchased the Dime wireless earbuds a while back because I needed a cheap pair of wireless headphones for school/work. I have small ears but I could not get them to stay in for more than 1 minute at a time. The sound quality was decent for the price but they were basically unusable for me. I am not sure how people wear these.
4,First thing I'm going to say about these ear buds is that they're the best bang for your buck. I gave the rating I did because for $25 they're awesome! But if you want something with all the bells and whistles then you're gonna have to pay for it. That being said let me explain...Pros:-As usual SkullCandy delivers get sound quality. They are my personal favorite brand.-Being able to use each ear bud individually extends the listening time.-The case actually clicks shut securing the ear buds so you can put them on your key ring attach them to your book bag or purse and/or don't have to worry about them falling out if you drop the case.-The case is small and easily fits into your pocket and isn't too bulky to carry around on your keys or attached to you backpack or purse.-The ear buds are small and sleek. They aren't bulky and stick out of your ear like the Jib or Sesh ear buds. Making them more comfortable to wear under a hat or scarf.-When on a phone call the sound is clear on both ends.Cons:-There are no tones to indicate the bud(s) have connected to your device.-There are no warnings that the battery is getting low.-There are no tones to tell you the battery has died.-If you get a phone call there is no ringtone or chimes or anything to indicate that you have an incoming call.-The ear buds are not touch. Meaning you have to push on them to pause/play answer/end calls and control volume.These can either be pros or cons depending on how you look at it:-The battery life isn't bad if you're using each bud individually and swapping them out when one dies. You can easily listen most of the day on one charge if you do it that way. But if you're using both at once you're only going to get about 3 hours give or take. But they do recharge rather quickly. For as inexpensive as these buds are you can't really complain.-The charging port is a microUSB and not the newer USB-C. But it does come with its own cord.In conclusion I believe they are excellent for the price you pay. Definitely worth the buy if you can live without all the bells and whistles. I'm hoping SkullCandy will come out with an upgraded version of this model with all the added bonuses. But I'm still quite happy with this purchase and would recommend them to anyone looking for a basic pair of ear buds.
5,for $20 these have got to be by far one of the better wireless earbuds compared to most on the market raycons dont even hold a flame to the candle these are.
2,Not for small ears. They hurt the inside of my ears no matter what size rubber piece I put on them.
5,Love these skullcandy earbuds. I've had skullcandy before so I knew I could trust the brand. Overall these are awesome affordable earbuds. The only issues I have with them is 1: the sound quality could be better. 2: battery life needs to be longer. Other than that bass sounds great volume is good and I like the way these fit into my ears. I can pair these to all my Apple products with no issues as well as to my Nintendo switch. I would say this is a good alternative to buying overpriced EarPods from other brands as they get the job done and are very nice.
5,I do not like the charge cord is not USB is a cord I am unfamiliar with so I had to buy a different cord so I could charge buds
5,Good sound
3,Sound is decent.  They are comfortable.  They would be great for maybe a workout or mowing.If you plan to listen to music all day to avoid idiots at work you'll be sorely disappointed.  I maybe get 2.5 hours out of them on max volume (idiots here are really loud).
2,Bought them about 7 months ago. Initially they worked just fine. 2 months ago one of them wouldn't pair then it wouldn't charge. Now none of them charge.
1,No necesito poner una imagen del producto ya que simplemente un audifono vino con el parlante muerto. Si se conectaban ambos y funcionaban los botones de ambos pero simplemente no sonaba nada en el izquierdo. Investigando en internet encontre que esto al parecer tambien le ha pasado a muchas otras personas
4,Great product! Would definitely recommend
5,These headphones are really nice for the money. They fit well ( plus have different size inserts to fit your ear) the sound can be a bit dull  especially with heavy bass sounds. The battery life is better than advertised I can get a good six hours before needing a recharge. Speaking of recharge 30 minutes will get you back to about 75% charge. At this price I don't feel worried if they got lost stolen or damaged. Which comes to my next positive I ran these through the clothes washer and they still work flawlessly.Basically get these headphones and enjoy.
5,I used to own Skull Candy headphones back in 2010 and I used to have them for Incentives for my students.Fast forward to 2022 and I haven't had a pair since. So I tried out Dime 2 True earbuds and wow!!! I am blown away!The headphone are extremely well built and come with a charging case which works very well. The headphones paired to my laptop and cell phone work no issues at all.The quality of audio is crystal clear! I love these ear buds! I look forward to what Skull Candy brings us next!!! Well worth for it for amazing Bluetooth ear buds!
5,Let's get the dislike out of the way. The instructions. A bit confusing trying to figure it all out. Likes. Small compact case. Easy to charge. Easy to remove earbuds from case. Great sound quality. Loved the charger. There is no one side it has to be turn to to insert into an adapter.
5,Good Bluetooth headphones for the price! Excellent noise cancellation great sound and good bass. They come with 3 different size eat gels that you can change out to fit in your ears best a charging case that charges your headphones right when you set them in the case and a charging cable to charge the case once you’re home. They also come with a little hook thing so you can hook them onto your keys for easy access. Great value for a low price. :)
3,I have a few Skullcandy headsets: two wired Smoking Buds 2 one wireless Smoking Buds 2 and the Crusher wireless headset. I got the Dime as I was excited to see an smaller true wireless earbud from them that sounded great.They did sound as expected and I was pleased with that. Not at all tinny and full rounded sound with bass (I use an EQ app on my phone)  But there are drawbacks that force me to send them back with fit being the main concern. The housing for the driver is a tad too large so they do not sit inside my ear correctly (can't change my ear shape). That gets painful and you cannot obtain a perfect seal for them to stay in and not allow ambient noise to get through.I dislike the glitchy controls. On my other wireless Skullcandy sets they retain the volume settings from the last use. Not these. You have to adjust them each time they turn on. Because the buttons are tricky to operate you're either turning off the bud or pausing and stopping. In order to adjust the volume you have to adjust them with two quick taps. It was maddening. Never had that with any of my other Skullcandy sets :(I also made a couple of phone calls where I experienced an echo on my end. I use my wireless Smoking Buds 2 without this issue but the Dime had this weird echo/delay that I hated.I totally understand I'm expecting more from an under $30 pair of earbuds. They sound comparable to their other wired earbuds which is a good thing. However there's still little things that needs to be fixed to make them better or at least the next generation of their earbuds better.I've said this before: I won't be happy with a true wireless earbud until the technology catches up so they can make a true wireless Smoking Bud 2 earbud. Smoking Buds 2 are the sole earbuds that fit me correctly.
5,Omgeee they came and they delivered and I am a happy customer.  Thank you
3,Decent bluetooth for playback I don’t recommend buying these for phone calls. Short battery life.
3,I love that you can wear them in one ear and have the other put away as I work in a collaborative space. Part of the reason I got these from my team when I joined was to be able to block out their conversation. Sound quality is good not amazing but it works for its purpose and some music. My biggest issue is that they keep falling out of my ears or hurt if I try to put them in too much. I believe its just the style of earbud because I don't have this problem with the Apple style earbuds and will be purchasing their similar project to this for that reason. If you can't do this style of earbud usually then you should rethink a purchase.
4,I’ve had these for a month now and frankly they’re fantastic. These replaced my busted AirPod Pros. They sound exactly the same. They lack some of the features of the AirPods but they’re totally fine. The sound is fantastic. I work in crawlspaces all day and go to the gym after. I really don’t understand anymore who hates on these buds.
2,Worked good for a couple of months and now does not charge or hold the charge.
5,I was really impressed by these headphones. They have great sound for the price. The charging case is awesome and really does a good job of keeping these things going. They fit my ears perfectly when I changed out the ear pads for the smaller size. You won’t be disappointed in these everyday use headphones.
5,Listening purposes
5,Ear buds has a charging indicator light. Comes half charged. However sound is great. Perfect for working out. Does cancel background noise.
1,I been a loyal customer of the Skull brand  which is why I am so disappointed with the left ear plug has not worked since day one .. I am not going to return or ever buy from this company again .. really
3,I've owned probably 4 pairs of these (I go through earbuds at least once a month and half seriously) and they were pretty good. Battery life is decent and a 15 minute charge does give you 2-3 hours which is a life saver on those transfer flight situations. Average sound quality--not bad (boxy thin sounding mixed with ) like those plastic-y wired earbuds you'd find at a CVS but not good like the Bose Soundsport I got for Christmas a couple years ago. The unfortunate thing is that the last 2 pairs of these I bought there was a serious drop in volume on them. I'm talking at full volume they would output about 40 or 50 percent of what my phone's volume on any other set was capable of. I wont be buying another set of these
4,I was in the market for a new set of wireless earbuds after my old ones bit the dust. These Skullcandy Dime True wireless buds meet my needs pretty well.I really just need a pair for occasional use while I'm streaming movies on my iPad or listening to music while I'm cleaning or cooking. I never use them for very long at a stretch. So for this kind of use these are OK.Fit is good. I like that these have the flexible interchangeable earpieces rather than the molded kind that never fit me well.Sound is decent as well. I'm not an audiophile so I don't have specific needs or expectations as far as things like bass go. I just care that sound comes out and it isn't static-y or garbled. These work as expected.I do agree with what other reviewers have said though -- the battery life on these really is subpar even at this price point. I have a pair of JVC Gumy ear buds that are in the same price bracket and it's hard not to compare the two. The batteries in my JVC ones last what seems like forever. I rarely charge them and they always seem still have battery left when I want to use them. I can't say the same about these Skullcandy ones. I never remember to charge them and every other use or so I find they're out of juice.The other thing I don't especially love about these Skullcandy headphones is their case. The lid has holes in it that are filled in by the backs of the ear buds. Which means the backs of your ear buds are exposed to dirt and germs instead of being enclosed and protected.Overall these Skullcandy earbuds are adequate. They're OK but not amazing.
4,Typically I wear in-ear headphones while commuting or doing chores around the house. I wear around-the-ear headphones when I want an immersive audio experience. Keeping that in mind these in-ear headphones are a decent option for those looking for a budget-friendly pair that doesn’t sound tinny and horrible.For $25 I wasn’t expecting a ton from these headphones. When I opened them they were exactly what I expected. They feel lightweight plastic and cheap. However they were easy to pair to my phone and when I tested them out the sound quality wasn’t too bad. I’m not an audiophile and as I stated I typically only wear this style of headphones while going to and from work but the audio quality is good enough for my needs. They lack clarity and they certainly don’t have amazing bass but they sound decent. I was able to enjoy all of my music without finding myself missing anything due to poor audio.The design of the headphones themselves is pretty good. I can wear them comfortably for around 2 hours before I begin to feel some pressure on my ears. This is standard for my ear shape and better than some other brands that I have tried because of how lightweight these are. They do tend to block out a fair amount of noise although they aren’t noise cancelling. The one thing I found lacking about the design is the ease of use of the buttons. The headphones have buttons on the side like many of this design but the buttons are not easy to use. You have to push on them pretty hard to get them to register. I have to remove them from my ears before using the buttons. I have found myself just using my phone to make any adjustments.Overall for the current price I was surprised at the quality of the sound and level of comfort that these headphones offer. I would highly recommend them as a budget pair for anyone looking for a decent set.
4,I like the sound quality that I get from these earbuds but I don't find it really spectacular. I think it's certainly better than average earbuds of course. There are 3 sizes of earbud covers that come with this but no room in the charging/holding case to store the extras.I found the earbuds initially kind of difficult to position in my ears as the bar that comes down can be frustratingly uncomfortable if these aren't in just right. The control pad is in the middle of the bars and I have to press harder than I expected for my choices to register. That means I've got to press the buds fairly hard into my ear. I with the controls were more touch-sensitive.The charging case holds the earbuds easily and they automatically snap into place after placing them in there so there's no worrying at least thus far if they are making good contact to get charged. I've only needed to charge these the initial time upon receiving them but haven't had them in my ears for 12 hours straight to test the battery life. I've used them off and on for several days and they still are working.One thing I don't like which I think is common for most wireless earbuds and that is the contacts for charging are right there against the inside of my ear making contact. I wonder how safe or healthy this is and would love to see a design change regarding that. I find these slightly less comfortable than another less fancy brand name probably due to that bar where the control button is.Finally the case has a convenient little loop on it that makes carrying them along while on the go even more convenient. Despite the control button needing more pressure to register a command and the mild discomfort of the earbud the sound is good these stay in well and the battery seems pretty good. Thanks for reading.
1,They fit nice and sound pretty good.  But after 3 pairs I've given up on these.  They all lasted about 3 or so months of daily use.  After that connectivity starts to fall apart and battery life was waning.  The first 2 pairs just outright quit on me.  Stopped working and stopped charging.  Pretty disappointed in an otherwise comfortable earbud.
3,My first set the left bud had no sound but the controls worked. Sent those back for a new pair. New pair left bud has sound but is staticky. Maybe because of Bluetooth signal but the right one is fine otherwise. Appreciate the different size buds they include. My ears started to hurt after 30 minutes of use. The button is just awful and causes you to push the bud deeper into your ear. Would not recommend these.
4,product: Skullcandy Dime True Wireless in-Ear Earbud - True BlackThese are a decent earbuds at the price point of 25 bucks do not get high hopes on sound quality punchy bass etc... these just serve the basic purpose of listening music voice calls etc... audiophiles won't be satisfied. I think these need to be looked in context of their pricing and purpose and this will meet those requirements. These are nice entry level earbuds out there in the market from a known brand that you can trust. I have higher end skullcandy that perform great.As seen in picture it comes with the earbud charger/ holder and extra set of buds to choose that fits best in your ear. The bud holder is smaller than usual and also has a low battery capacity that can hold 8.5 h and the pods hold 3.5 h of life. So these won't last more than 3 hours before it needs to be charged. BTW these do not have real (active) noise cancellation the tighter the earbud in your ear the better noise isolation there is not technology or software to actively decrease it.Regarding to the sound quality it is average you can hear well the low and highs (but not very distinct) are decent but lacks the punchy bass. It worked great for phone calls and the microphone works great to give a clear voice to the person on the other side. It is priced great for those who wish to try earpods for the first time. The overall build quality seems to be good and it doesn't look flimsy or easy to snap kind of plastic so it might surprise people knowing that these are only 25 bucks. Dropping a star for a lower battery life.
5,Wow these Dime earbuds are small! I can actually wrap my fingers around the case. Now these are considered budget earbuds so I will keep that in mind when sharing my experience.The case is made of light plastic but sturdy. I like the way the buds are showcased through the openings on top. The lid snaps closed to keep the buds from falling out. The buds have that prolific stem design that some may not like but thankfully they are rather stumpy and do not protrude too much. Since they are so compact and light I find them quite comfortable even after wearing them for a few hours. I used them while running jumping and even flipping and they never fell out. Now these are IPX4 so a little rain or sweat is not going to be any problem.Battery life was OK. I clocked them at a bit over 3 hours. The case provides an additional 8.5 hours which is not great but acceptable at this price point. Also I was a bit disappointed but not surprised that they use micro-USB for charging and I thought Skullcandy had moved from that already. Again keep in mind that these are budget earbuds.Having Bluetooth 5.0 the Dime Ture buds were easy to pair and maintained a good connection at decent distances around my medium-sized apartment. I could not find what audio codecs are used but I suspect the usual SBC and certainly no aptX. Still I noticed a slight lag while gaming and none with video playback.Call quality is passable. I was heard clearly although they do pick some ambient noise in loud environments. For those who like wearing one bud at a time you’d be happy to know that these can be used separately which in theory extends the battery life by 3+ hours.I love that everything can be controlled by the earbuds including volume. As expected these buds have buttons that can be stiff and pressing them can jam the earphones deeper into the ear canal. If you are the type to make adjustments constantly this may be something to consider.The sound quality is decent. I was surprised that the bass has been toned down compared to other Skullcandy offerings and I actually like it. It is not punchy and there is a lack of sub-bass but adds warmth to the overall sound signature. The mids seem to have a bit more presence and make vocals and instruments come forward. The treble is not piercing or fatiguing. Personally I would’ve liked a bit more clarity soundstage and separation but I repeat these are budget earbuds.Although the Dime Buds are inexpensive they are not cheap. I think these are great for on-the-fly use since they are highly portable. I believe the value they bring is undeniable and makes for great backup pairs and gifts. Definitely recommended!
5,Best ear buds I have bought. Easy to carry on my key chain. Battery last me a while I like the light indicator while its charging. I would definitely recommend/get as gift.
5,My wife LOVES her new wireless headphones. Especially when she workouts at the gym.
3,I am terribly disappointed by these earbuds my old earbuds broke and got these as a replacement I am sad since the right earbuds broke after only 2 weeks. The claim for water resistance messed me over since I cleaned them and immediately the sound couldn't be heard. The earbuds sound mettalic and bass had to be added in via samsung Dolby Atmos. And these things only lasted me 2 hours instead of the 3.5 hours listed. And the case doesn't charge them wirelessly. I needed a usb-c adapter plugged in at all times.
4,For a bit of perspective I work overnights; doing maintenance work for my company. Also I should also mention that I bought mine from Walmart. I listen to a lot of metal and it's subsequent sub genres. While I do have the Job wired earbuds (that work wonderfully); the cord would always get in my way. So I decided to get these for the price and the fact that I have always had a great time with Skullcandy.The form factor of these little guys is amazing. They're Soo tiny! Yet (for me) pack quite a punch in the sound department. While I'm not an audiophile I will admit that with what I've experienced with these earbuds is nothing short of amazing. If I have both earbuds in I swear that I cannot hear you coming up behind me to say something. Now I will admit that the battery life is a bit lack luster; however it does off set itself by the fact that if you have one in and say it goes out in 2.5-3 hours you can swap with the other and the one you just put in to charge will be back in action in about 15 to 30 minutes. I have a large ear canal and the cups that come included work like a charm for me.
5,This is what I'm impressed with here: simple design long charge (all day and more) very little stuttering/disconnecting clean look tight fit.Skullcandy continues to deliver with these earbuds. Video shows overview of the case and buds themselves.
5,I bought the new pro Air Max Apple brand brand. Compared to those these are 100% the winner. These but if earbudshave the battery life. People can hear you clearly. Overall my favorite earbuds.
2,
4,These have become my favorite ear buds but I have to adjust them frequently when wearing them because they slip out of my ears.  The noise canceling doesn't completely work for me because the outer round part doesn't sit all the way inside my ear right.  This has been an issue for me with other earbuds too so it's not just Skullcandy earbuds.The sound is great and I like the bass. I listen to a lot of heavy beat styles of music like EDM metal and Trap music to run to because the beat helps me keep pace. These are good for that.These charge well. Make sure you remove the little plastic guards on the earbuds before charging. I haven't had the battery die yet and I have worn these for a couple hours at a time. I always charge them after I use them and I haven't had any issues with them.You can turn them off/on by quickly pressing on either ear bud. This is great for pausing music quickly like when I'm wearing them at work and someone talks to me or when I'm running and I need to be alert.These ear buds come with a case and USB connector to charge them.  I use the USB port on my laptop to charge them.I've used these every single day for the last month and they still work great.
5,Everything described is on point
5,I didn't expect much from $20 headphones but these met and exceeded those expectations.
4,First off I would like to tell everyone what inspired me to write this review as I do not usually take the time (sorry)! I PUT THESE EARBUDS THROUGH THE WASHER AND DRYER AND THEY STILL WORK. Amazing! Also I love that I can keep the case on my keychain (which I clip on to my fanny pack def recommend this setup)
1,Charging prongs are too sensitive if its off by a mm even with case closed it won't charge God forbid you get it to charge and then out the the case In your pocket because then somehow it stops charging.
4,These earbuds were insanely easy to pair to my phone and since doing it the first time I have had zero issues  with having to pair it again.The sound quality is ok.  I mostly use these to listen to podcasts so they do just find in that regard but there is some sound quality loss the louder these get.They aren't any more or less comfortable than similar styled earbuds.  I hate the feeling of them wedged in my ears all the way and I find they often work their way outside of my ears regardless so I do have to periodically check to make sure they're still in and not about to fall out.  I wore them in a long slow moving 2 hour line and they were perfect for that but when I wore them while actively weeding my property for a few hours the constant active movement became annoying in terms of keeping them in place.  I even lost one without realizing it (I thankfully was able to find it).They charge pretty quickly the case they come in is small and lightweight.  The price point makes these a great deal for someone who wants on occasional option for wireless buds.
5,Skullcandy is about offering a really good product at lower than the competition while still being a brand name that you know. I was intrigued by this $25 pair of earbuds that looks like a modern key fob. I saw a new story about this a few weeks ago so I definitely opted to try them out when I saw they were available for me test out.For $25 I was expecting something kind of cheap that I wouldn't have been likely to use especially since I own a number of different pairs of earbuds that cost 10x as much as this product. Despite that I actually like these quite a lot. Nothing about them feels cheap to me yes there are some sacrifices that you will have to make at this point but nothing that is deal breaker for me personally. You get Micro USB charging instead of USB C no automatic play/pause sensors to detect that the earbud has been removed from your ear and the battery life of the bud and the case is on the lower side. But you still get a decent sounding pair of earbuds comparable to many products that cost $50-$75(in terms of sound quality).The buds themselves last 3.5 hour I was able to stretch it to 4 hours on low volume. The charging case is rated for another 8.5 hours of listening time for an overall 12 hours in total. Each bud has a button on the side for pausing the audio. The earbuds are decently comfortable and you get 3 eartip options included in the box along with a tiny Micro USB charging cable. The charging case is about the same physical footprint as the 2nd gen AirPods so it's pretty small. It's perfect for putting on your keychain it will look right at home next to your car key( I think the design choice is very intentional I mean it looks just like a car key).For $25 there are endless choices from no name brands on Amazon but this is the first pair that I've ever seen that I would actually use. I don't like cheap tech but this doesn't feel cheap to me. The audio isn't the best quality you can buy but it's really good for the price. It would be nice if the battery life was better too but again I can forgive a lot in a product as good as this for as low as $25.
5,Por $20 cumple la función. Se conectan en 2 segundos. Son ligeros y pequeños. Diseño y color con excelente contrucción. Al sonido le falta un poco para ser perfecto. Les recomiendo echar un ojo a los Jlab Go Air Pop.

5,I picked this up because I have a few Skullcandy devices and was intrigued by this headphone set. I didn't know how much it cost when I picked it but I checked it now and see that it is a super low priced headset. Personally from testing this I thought that the price was something close to double what it is at the time of review here.... for around $20 this is pretty incredible.Sound quality is pretty good with a nice amount of bass; however the sound is Vshaped but not sharp. I didn't have an issue listening to some music or playing games over the last weeks. I paired it with my Aya Neo because it is small enough to fit into the Aya Neo case without bumping into the device itself. There are not many wireless headphones on the market with a super small and light case like this one.... it literally weighs like 1oz for the entire thing.Putting the case in my pocket I literally forget that it is there but I just leave it in the case for the Neo.The eartips that came out of the box fit my ears just fine so I haven't needed to change the tips (It looks like it comes with some). Battery life has been decent I have just used it here and there for gaming and haven't needed to charge it since I charged it the first time I took it out of the box. Weeks later and it is still not dead (which is also good since some headphones die in a week or less even when not used).Overall there was no audio delay while gaming and sound came through clear. Because I used it with windows I am not sure which codec it uses and I haven't wanted to re-pair it with my phone.Will report back if I have issues with it but so far it has been great.
1,Was a gift that broke after one use. Wouldn’t turn on.
1,I bought these for a stocking stuffer for my husband just this past Christmas. And the earbuds aren’t even charging in the bud case anymore. The case will be fully charge and the head phones will start to charge for a minute then stop charging all together. Seriously don’t waste your money. I seriously wish I could give this zero stars.
1,Wish I could give it 5 stars but does not charged when placed in box and has to be fixed almost every week. And sometimes more
4,Over decent had issues hooking up to my iPhone but decent…
3,Ear buds are comfortable fitting they produce a good sound with music and also on calls. But they do pick up a lot of background noise while on a call or video calls. The people on the other side may have a hard time hearing you but can easily hear what going on in the background.
5,I accidentally washed and dried these and they still work perfectly. They were given to me and I love them so much
3,The sound quality on these is good enough for the price to keep me from complaining. Unfortunately these things are hella uncomfortable. It felt like I grabbed a couple rocks from the driveway and jabbed them into my ears. I don't know if it's the angle or shape of the plastic but they're not for me. The other beef I have with these is the buttons. You have to push them so hard you drive the earbuds down into your ear canal which doesn't exactly feel good. I really don't understand the design there and I can't justify the price of one of their more expensive pairs. I'll keep my eyes peeled for another set like my Mpow M30. Those are comfortable and were affordable before Amazon went on their witch hunt.
3,I have normal sized ears maybe slightly on the smaller side (32 M). These are by far the best looking earbuds I've found but damn if the round parts don't hurt my ears. Better if you have bigger ears.
4,Are they great headphones? Well no not really. Are they great headphones for the price?? Oh absolutely no doubt. The sound is honestly surprisingly good for what they cost definitely trying to punch above there price range. The case is absolutely tiny definitely there biggest selling point. It's almost as small as an airpods case which is an impressive feat considering these have silicone eartips. The really only problem that plagues them is the small battery life and micro usb charging instead of usb type c. All things considered still worth every penny. They make a great backup pare to carry everywhere.
1,Please avoid this product. The sound quality is poor
5,Let me tell you a story about my Skullcandy Dime wireless earbuds.  I had one fall out during my run this morning and I couldn’t locate it in the dark. Came back to search for it when lighting conditions were better. Unfortunately while the sun was rising the rain was falling pretty heavily. I managed to find my lost sheep popped it in my ear and it starting playing music just like normal. I’ve had these earbuds since April and can’t complain about them. Battery life is great highly water resistant( let’s just say I sweat a lot) and sound and call quality is great. They’re a steal for the low price of 20 bucks.  #skullcandydime Skullcandy
3,I bought these from my local walmart thinking heck why not get with the times and get some wireless (I usually use over the ear). I was happy as can be with them at first thought hey these are skullcandy they're gonna be great! And they are as long as you're not using the controls for them. The controls are wonky at best if you want to skip a song or use google assistant then you're golden if you want the volume up or down well whip out your phone because hitting the button 2x will either disconnect them or bring up google assistant. The sound quality is great so if you're someone who can have their phone out while listening to music I recommend them but if you're like me and can't have your phone out during work look elsewhere.
5,These are the best ever earbuds for the money. The bass is unreal. I read a lot of reviews that said that these earbuds sounded distorted. I do not have this problem what do ever. The sound quality is an easy 5 out of 5. Now these do not have the touch screen type buttons on them but a rather old school soft button. They are hard to push but for the price it ‘cannot’ be beaten.
1,La calidad de los audífonos no es la mejor pero lo peor es la duración de la batería es de 5 horas pésimo producto
2,Horrible earbuds.  Too small  buttons are hard to push  Bluetooth constantly cuts out.  There’s better ones out there that are probably cheaper that work better
5,Have two teens both with a pair and they have no complaints.Thry very much like them. Will probably purchase ba third.
2,I don't really care about sound quality for these since I just use them for podcasts while I'm going to bed but for those who care about it sound quality is awful in these things.  Not much better than listening to music out of your phone speakers. I knew they were crappy little ear buds so I didn't expect much in ways of sound quality anyway.My biggest issue is the usability.To use the buttons which you have to feel around for because there's hardly any tactile indication of where the button is actually located.  Then when you find the button you really have to push it hard.  The buttons are located opposite of your ear canal so when you push the button it really jams these things into your ear. They hurt to use.I gave it 2 stars because they pair easily have a nice feel and a nice case.But all other functionality is pretty awful.
5,...but I have to for these. For $25 you can't beat these. I bought a set for my wife and a set for me. Very easy to pair with my iPhone and worked flawlessly. Unlike AirPods you can power these on and off to save battery life. Fit in my ear better and did not fall out like my AirPods did (all the time). They don't have noise cancel technology but they fit in my ear so good that it cancels out ambient noise anyways (probably by 50% or so).You honestly can't afford not to buy these. I will buy more for my daughter and for work. Very impressed by these. I did not purchase on Amazon but purchased directly from Skullcandy because i couldn't at the time. Will purchase from Amazon in the future because of the shipping.I bought these because I just happened to see them. My $250.00 AirPods broke within 6 months. I only ever used them when working out (running). The speaker on my right AirPod just stopped working one day. I can buy 10 pair of these for the price of one and I like these better. These also work with my iPhone and iWatch to turn the volume up/down skip tracks etc...I haven't figured out the volume and skip tracks on the actual earphones yet but I haven't really tried either because I can just use the phone and watch. I have no complaints about these so far.
5,Small Package. Great Sound.Not Quite Enough Bottom End.Great For My Dialysis Sessions.Battery Last Almost 4 Hours.
5,I don't know what these people want for this low price these earbuds pair easily sound amazing are a breeze to operate fit great and the battery life is fine.  God forbid you'd have to charge them every day.  How lazy can you be?Best deal on the market.  Period.  Get some.
1,Bought these to replace my other ear buds and it was the biggest mistake. They never stayed connected via blue tooth. The sound wasn’t good at all I guess you really do pay for what you get.
2,The sound is pretty good but the battery life is horrible for something so large compared to other buds the same size but the WORST thing is the fit.. or lack of they hurt my ears after 20min of use bought as a backup to my jabra elite 7s and these arnt worth being backups
2,Had this earbuds for a while now sound quality is awesome but in a couple of months they started sounding with a crackle it's annoying and I don't even use them every day just occasionally
5,Wow these are better than most $25 ear buds. I’m glad that I bought them for my vacation. If there’s a more noise isolating pair I’d like those for work but these are great. My music sounds great in the airport.
1,Need to read the fine print. Really only both work for about 3.5 hours. The sound quality is poor. The fall out alot no matter what size adapters I've tried. The only positive is connection was easy and worked well. I didn't expect much from a $20-30 set of earphones but I also didn't expect such exaggerated performance specs.
1,I got these as a backup pair of headphones to my Google Pixel Buds at a brick and mortar Amazon location. Figured I could use another set of headphones for the gym or travel. Skullcandy does decent to pretty good wired earbuds. Anyway I get them and to start off the directions given are not clear unless you watch a video. I suggest not using your QR reader on your phone and rather just searching it on YouTube so when it is time to pair the earbuds to the phone it is easier. Firstly the earbuds before pairing to the phone need to pair to each other. That proved to be very hard for me and I never got it to work in all honesty. Then if you were able to get the earbuds to pair you have to get your phone to find the right Bluetooth channel for both ear buds to pair. Everytime I tried when I thought the ear buds were paired I only successfully connected to one channel. If a company is gonna do single Bluetooth channels for earbuds in the future label the the channels for left and right and stereo. I am rather tech savvy and found this too hard.As I type this I have sent these piece of crap earbuds back. Ones I've found for cheaper in Big Lots and Walmart do the job I wanted these to accomplish much easier. Granted there maybe a quality issue where they do not last but when you cannot get both earbuds to connect to eachother much less the phone for stereo usage that is a major design flaw. I feel Skullcandy was trying to fix a problem but then created a bunch of new ones by result. I doubt I will buy anything Skullcandy again.
5,Skullcandy makes great earbuds that is no secret.  When I saw these Skullcandy “Dime” earbuds selling for $25 I had to give them a try.  It’s not that often where you will find name brand earbuds for this kind of price and I was not sure what to expect.  I was amazed by what I received.For just $25 these earbuds are outstanding!  Sound quality is great and I can not distinguish between these or earbuds 3-4 times the price.  These earbuds also have noise cancellation which works as really well blocking out just about all outside noise as I go in my runs.  Battery life is more than sufficient as I have listened to these earbuds for just at 4 hours and they still had some life left.For $25 there are not any better earbuds available at this time.
5,I love these earbuds. They connect and disconnect seamlessly they sound great for earbuds especially for the price and the case is compact and foolproof. They're pretty great but the best is that I sent them through a full wash in a high efficiency washer in the pocket of my shorts and at first they didn't seem to work but the case light came on when connected to power so I charged the case put them in the case and checked after a day and they work again and sound normal! That's pretty impressive. They're a solid design. I did toss them in some rice so not sure if that helped or not.
1,Volume control did not work. Could not turn it up or down. Customer support just told me what I had already read online. They also did not reply to my email after they instructed me send them (the tech) an email and they would follow up.
5,Really like these little earbuds.  The value for what you get is incredible.  The sound is good they fit me well are small so fit kind of stealthy and the battery life so far has been good.  I've only worn them a maximum of three hours at a time but have been extremely pleased.  I know they claim a maximum runtime of 3.5 hours and I have no doubt they will meet that.  I had no problem pairing them to an iPhone 12 and you can use each bud on it's own.  I've thought of attaching them to my car keys so I always have buds with me but since they end up in my pocket most of the time I don't want the extra stuff there.  If you carry keys in a purse bag briefcase etc they're perfect for attaching to your keychain.If you're looking for buds for children that won't break the bank or buds for you that are inexpensive and work/sound well these are your buds.  Skullcandy really got a winner here.
5,These earbuds are amazing the only downside is the lack of capacitive button.
5,These earbuds are easy to use and come with multiple sized ear pieces for a proper fit. They fit tightly to block outside noise (not active noise canceling).They came with a comically small cable for charging. You are supposed to charge the box and buds prior to use although they come partially charged. The box has holes that show the buds so you don’t need to open the case to see if the buds are charging.The buds themselves can last over three hours per charge but can be charged multiple times through the case so that how you get the advertised 12 hr battery time. If you want them to work the whole workday you will need to charge them at some point.The sound is great helped by the tight fit to your ears. I like a strong bass and these buds do not disappoint me.
5,I bought a pair of these to wear to the gym since I didn't want to risk ruining my AirPods. My first impressions were not good at all. I put them in and all I heard was tinny treble with no bass or anything deep. I was ready to return them. However I decided to try a different earpiece size just to see what happened...WOW! Once I got a better seal these things rocked. There is DEEP bass clear treble and a good balance between all of it. The bass is so good with a good seal it will make your chest shake. Seriously. Now for the hyperbole part of my review...they sound better than my AirPods (g2 not pros). I did not expect this at all. If you are even on the fence buy these. They are comfortable and I have yet to have to charge them. A must-buy recommendation.
3,decent sound and battery life for the price i got this at walmart
2,I've had a pair of Sennheiser MX365 wired earbuds for years and I've recently been looking for a pair of Bluetooth earbuds to use too. I had heard good things about Skullcandy and these were on sale for $20 so I decided to try these and I was not impressed. My MX365 ones were about $25 so I figured Skullcandy ones for the same price should be pretty good but I found these to be very thin and tinny while my MX365 ones have a good amount of bass and sound a lot better overall. So the main reason I would not recommend these are the poor sound quality but I also found I find earbuds like these with silicone tips that go into one's ear canal to be uncomfortable and I've found connected earbuds versus "true wireless" ones like these to be better since the cord lets you easily hang them around your neck when not using them. So if you are like me the lack of a connecting wire and the addition of the silicone tips will further make these a poor choice but the sound quality on these are still pretty bad and I found some cheap $10 heyday earbuds sounded about similar. I also tried some earbuds from JBL and Sony that were $5-20 more (after sales) and I would recommend spending some more for something like the Sony WI-C310 (if you don't mind silicone tips) or the JBL Tune 215BT which both sound much better than these.
2,I have used very many types of wireless buds and from the low end of the price spectrum JLab are far superior and at least give you some EQ control.My rationale for giving me such a low score and two was being kind is because the overall sound quality is minimal at best. It's very flat response and it's very low. There is no way to adjust the EQ unless you download an app to your phone which allows you to alter parameters. Otherwise this particular product does not have EQ adjustment built in. Furthermore it states that it has good full bass response.  This is entirely incorrect. I have purchased $5 earbuds that sound better than these and have better overall frequency response and better base push. Granted I don't listen to it rap or hip hop but I do listen to metal and I like a good solid bass to carry it through.This does not do that. And using the controls while they are in your ears especially if you use them while on a motorcycle is not very user friendly.Thus the sound is mediocre at best but they "function." The reason for my two stars are 1) the price point 2) there is no cord (obviously) tethered from one side to the other or tethered from the device to the phone 3) they are in fact comfortable.  So insofar as these qualities are to me the only true attributes spend a little more money and get something a whole lot better.  These are going back to where I purchased them due to lack of Sonic quality and control functionality.
5,These are good Bluetooth earbuds. They connect quickly are good quality sound easy to control and have good battery life. They do get a bit uncomfortable in my ear after a couple hours but that's only on road trips and such so  not a common issue.
2,Haven't had the opportunity to try many buds in this price range but IMO you are getting exactly what you pay for here.Except for fit I find no redeeming qualities to these especially the incredibly short battery charge time.Switching between source devices proved to be impossible without rebooting the buds and/or disabling the pairing on the source. With no app and the only controls for them being on the buds via a difficult to depress button which is directly over the ear opening (ouch!) these are not user friendly.Connection quality is awful. In zoom and Slack meetings one or the other buds would just stop transmitting and had to reboot the effected bud to get it to function.So the only positive thing I can say about these is at least I didn't spend too much before tossing them.
5,So I needed something that I can travel with or simply something that I can take with me in my purse just incase that I need them. These are perfect. They come with their little case where you set them to charge which I love. I love that there is not string to untangle so that saves time. The sound that comes out is great! The comfort is great as well if your like me I can't wear ear buds for too long because my ears start to hurt but these do their job on the comfort part.
1,I got these as a gift and I was very excited as I have just started working out again and wanted a pair of earbuds that I could wear to work out in.  These are cr@p.  DONT BUY THEM.  Im glad I didn’t pay money for these things.  I charged them over night took them to work and went to wear them during my workout after work.  One did not even turn on and the other one died after only 5 minutes.  I have tried wearing them right after charging and they last maybe 30 minutes.
4,You already know going in that the Skullcandy Dime 2 is a basic set of buds so your expectations shouldn’t be super high. I think for most people your expectations will likely be exceeded for every aspect of these little guys other than in the bass department.IN THE BOXThe Dime 2 buds come with the buds themselves in their very slim charging case. 3 pairs of ear gels (S M L with the medium ones already installed on the buds) a short USB-A to micro-USB charging cable and a little lanyard that you can attach to the case to provide a loop for attaching the case to your keyring or for clipping it onto your bag. There’s also a very basic instruction sheet.DESIGNThe Dime 2 buds have a fairly unique charging case. The case has cutouts on the lid so the sides of the buds can protrude through while they’re in the case. This allows the case to be very slim. Combined with the case and buds being almost entirely plastic it adds up to one of if not the most slim and lightweight cases I’ve come across. With the buds inside the case weighs in at a scant 1.2 ounces.The only downside to this design is that when the buds aren’t in the case you’re left with two holes on the top of the case. If you keep the case in a bag purse or your pocket then you’ll likely need to dust off the inside occasionally since it won’t be protected while the buds are in use.The case is super basic compared to other brands. It has no buttons for pairing or anything on it relegating all functions to the buds themselves. The case is strictly for charging. It has an indicator light on the front to show the battery status and a micro-USB port on the back for charging. I wish Skullcandy had made the port USB-C as I think most people are in the process of ditching all of their non-USB-C gear these days. The included charging cable actually has a great design on the USB-A end that works no matter which side is up (solving a common complaint of USB-A).The case lid closes magnetically with an added snap closure to make sure it doesn’t accidentally come open. One very minor gripe with the case is that the lid doesn’t snap into an open position. When you open the lid it will very easily flip back down on it’s own if you tilt the case at all.The buds themselves are a compact design that is similar to many other brands. The 3 included sizes of ear gels should give almost anybody a good fit however for me this style of earbud always tends to fall out eventually so I wouldn’t recommend using these for any kind of fitness activity where your movement is likely to cause them to fall out. The main thing that will determine if these stay in your ears is the distance between your ear hole (yes ear hole is a medical term) and the inside edge of the back of your ear lobe. If this distance is more than the width of the buds then there’s not much you can do.Each bud has a small physical function button on the side (right where the Skullcandy logo is located). The button is covered with flexible material and isn’t the easiest to push (you’ll likely want to use your fingernail to make sure you feel the button depressing). This is actually a good and bad thing. On one hand you don’t have to worry about accidentally stopping the music or skipping a song if you reach up to adjust the buds in your ears like you might do on other brands that use touch controls. On the other hand it can sometimes be a little tricky to activate the function you want since the buttons are a little hard to find.SETUPSetting these up is exactly as you’d expect. Charge them up and then take them out of the case. They’ll be in pairing mode and you simply find them on your device’s Bluetooth menu. If you need to pair them to another device simply hold down the button on either bud for 4 seconds to get back to pairing mode.That’s pretty much it. These are no frills so there isn’t any companion app with additional settings to mess with.IN USEThe buds power on and off when you remove and replace them in the case so using them is super easy. Open the case put them in your ears and you’re good to go. You can use either bud by itself by simply leaving one bud in the case. There is no ear detection in these so they will be on and playing once you start the music even if you take them out of your ears (or they fall out). When both buds are back in the case your music will automatically pause.The function buttons provide quick access to all the functions you really need (once you get the hang of pressing the physical button). A single press on either bud pauses or resumes your music. Holding down the button for 1 seconds on the left bud goes back a track while doing the same on the right bud goes forward a track. Double pressing the button on the left or right bud controls the volume (left bud for lower volume right bud for higher volume). Triple pressing either side calls up your voice assistant such as Siri.For phone usage the controls are super basic. If the phone is ringing pressing either bud once answers the call. Pressing either bud once then hangs up the call when you’re done. That’s it.PERFORMANCEStraight up the main thing to know about these is they have no bass at all. Like zero. You’ll hear sounds that should carry bass behind them but alas there is no bass. So if you live for the heavy beats then these likely aren’t going to cut it. Mid and high tone ranges are remarkably good for this level of bud though. Voices come through nice and clear likely due to the lack of background bass. If you like hearing the lyrics and other instruments in your music and can live without the bass then these will work fine. Likewise if you’re going to use them for podcasts then you probably won’t miss the bass.PHONE CALLSDon’t use these for phone calls. That’s really all you need to know. There’s no sidetone function so you can’t hear your own voice and will feel like you’re talking with ear plugs in (you essentially are) and people on the other end told me that they could tell I was some kind of low quality headset. So… stick to music with these.TILE FUNCTIONThese buds have Tile location finder technology built in so you can sync them to the Tile app and then theoretically use the app to find your misplaced buds. This didn’t work very well for me. The buds synced to the app and I was able to use the app to play the locator tone from the buds a few times but then the app seemed to lose track of the buds and didn’t know they were nearby so I could no longer play the tones or see how far away they were in the app. I’ve seen other buds use a simple system of storing the GPS location whenever the buds become disconnected and that seems to work fine so I’m not sure the Tile functionality really adds much.SUMMARYI like these. Will they be my primary way of listening to music? No but they are a great casual pair of buds that travel light and don’t cost too much so they are perfect for basic listening. These are a nice backup pair to keep around the house and would also be great to take places you might not want to take more expensive buds (camping boating sketchy areas of town etc.). If these were in a larger case and weighed the same as regular buds then I probably wouldn’t recommend them but in this instance you trade off some sound quality in exchange for a small and light package and that might be exactly what you’re looking for. For what they are they are very well done.
5,For the money these are amazing. The sound is perfectly fine for me and the battery life is fine too. Just they could be more comfortable as they make my ear lobes a bit sore. Also they are so cheap that losing one isn't a big deal. I highly recommend these.
5,These Skullcandy Dime True Wireless in-Ear Earbud their so small! Their small but it doesn't compromise the audio quality. The only thing that I don't like so far about these earbuds is that you have to press the button on the side of each earbud to power them on after you put them in. Other than that these Skullcandy earbuds are really nice. They are comfortable and they are so small it's really impressive to get such good audio quality from these earbuds. I would highly recommend these Skullcandy Earbuds.
1,I bought these at Walmart while traveling since I forgot my primary set of headphones. I fully charged them when I first got them  and upon first use the battery life was so short  they're not really usable for daily use. My battery life is somewhere around 2-4 hours. I thought forsure I wasn't charging them right or it was somehow my fault but after day long charges and many attempts the battery life is just waaay too short.
1,Literally fell out my ears about 35 times a day. Right now they just…won’t turn on even after charging for a full 24 hours and trying every pitiful attempt at fixing the issue from the web. So now I’m out a pair of headphones. Yay. Unfortunately headphones are one product where you get what you pay for.
2,Well I will never get the high rating for these. They dont last no more than maybe three hours??  the box need constant charging and the sound is subpar. I've had 10 dollar wirless earbuds that sound a million times better and last a work shift and school classes.  These dont and was a waste of money. They are comfortable and light. but that about it. This will be the last skulls candy's headphones I will buy.  I dont get the hype around this name.
1,I bought them thinking they would have the amazing sound and easy use like the regular skull candys but these don’t get anywhere near the hours it advertised and also the buttons sucked so bad they hurt if you try to change a song if you are even lucky enough to get it to do what the buttons are supposed to do I smashed them with the hammer
5,Phenomenal earbuds for the price. I’ve had 2 pairs of Airpods and they dont compare to these. Better noise cancellation better fit and my favorite part; they bring the BASS! Can’t believe they are only 25 dollars I would recommend these to anyone that is looking for true wireless earbuds. Thanks Skullcandy!!!!
5,These ear buds were really easy to pair with my iphone.  They fit comfortably in my ear and the sound quality is great.  I have no complaints.
1,Only one ear works would love to get fixed or exchange
2,Don't understand how these things get such good reviews. I found the controls balky and difficult to use let alone remember the sequencing for all the various touch commands. I gave up and returned them.
2,I have used these for about a month and hate them. they are uncomfortable never fit right in my ear and become dislodged with I move my mouth. any prolonged listening leads to severe pain in my ears from discomfort. while only around $20-30 you are better off using that for a better pair.
5,another big hit from Skullcandy!!!
1,I don't want to say anything about the fit since everyone's ears are different but these are definitely the most uncomfortable earbuds I've ever used (Wired or wireless). The box describes the product as having "12 hours of battery life" yet when I first used them on a full charge I barely got 3 hours in. So it's just a constant cycle of charging them for 10 minutes just to use them for 5 and then you need to actually keep the charging case charged as well and that also dies very fast so it's hard to tell when these things are even charging without seeing the little red light. The sound is very flat and there is nearly no bass in these even in songs I literally created myself to be bass-heavy I can't hear the bass 90% of the time. I get that 'you get what you pay for' and I didn't expect much but God damn do these things suck. I just want to stop as many people from buying these as I can seriously guys there's so many other options don't waste your $20
1,The most god awful ear buds I don't consider my ears to be small but I can't stand to wear these extreme discomfort and painful. Oddly shaped. I can wear my Indy's all day but these only about a 60 second.
1,I bought these as an emergency backup and I couldn't stand them after two days. I tried all three sizes of cushions and they all would fall out of my ears. The smallest cushions worked best but even those would fall out while talking or eating.One earbud would not turn off and would drain battery. So not only did they not fit well they also would not stay charged.I had no luck with the touch controls either but after the other issues I did not try to hard. I know these are $20 earbuds but they are not worth it.
1,I obviously did not read where the battery only last for 3 1/2 hours. That’s ridiculous. My other headphones lasted 10 hours. These 3 1/2 hours? Really? Please don’t buy if you need a longer battery life. There are other ones on the market that have longer battery life.
1,CAN'T RATE IT BECAUSE COULD NOT GET IT TO WORK
2,Cut in and out constantly with phone in pocket just walking around. Work fine if you sit still and leave your phone right in front of your face. Frustrating.
2,First red flag...No USB C.  Seriously?  USB C has been around for how long?Sound quality is decent.  Not bad at all.Volume and sound quality for phone calls is good too.  The deal breaker with these?Battery life sucks.  You can expect 1 1.5 hours max out of these.
1,Battery life sucks. There super uncomfortable always falling off. It took a while to connect to my device overall; they are not worth $20.
2,Sound quality is good however they are constantly falling out of my ears which is very annoying. Also the buttons on the earbuds seem to serve no purpose other than Pause/Play and On/Off; cannot get them to skip songs or adjust volume at all. Pretty disappointed I've loved Skullcandy previously.
1,Never buy this ear pods waste of money battery times so bad ear fitting very disappointed
1,Worst earbud ever. Not even sure if they're authentic . on call the person on the other can barely hear me. Ithe sound quality is extremely bad. trust me do not buy this.
1,It’s worst than any other cheap pods and quality Except battery life.
1,I got these in and LOVE how small they are! They go right in my ear and I connect them to my phone pretty easily. Then I start playing music and walk one room away from my phone in the house and it starts cutting out and disconnects completely. I walked like 5 or 7 feet away when it cut out. I then connected them again and put my phone on top of my car outside and walked about the same distance and it disconnected again. It has extremely short range.SO I started carrying my phone to listen to music but then the problem is these headphones fall out non stop and don't stay in my ears. Just problem after problem with these and I've never had a pair so awful! I've had dollar tree headphones I loved more than these!
5,These are my favorite ear buds ever.  The sound quality is amazing and they are affordable! They are so cute and compact.  They cancel out the noise pretty well.  Another thing that was important to me was they they don't stick out much from my ears.  They are pretty flat
5,So i ordered these and although the battery life isn't long you can use 1 bud at a time which is very important to me since I'm using at work. Most Bluetooth ear buds require the dominant bud to be in case in order to charge but I can swap each one out as needed so these last my entire 8 hr shift. I am very happy with the sound quality as well as the noise cancelation for the price. I grew up using skull candy ear buds great to know that after 20+years they still provide the same great quality. Ordered these for my husband and ordered a pair for myself 2 days later.
4,Pros: They are cute! I love the bright color! The way the little earbuds snap to the case gives me visceral satisfaction! They make sound go into my ears and make it possible for me to have phone conversations while pacing around (my preferred method) without getting tangled in my cord. The charge seems to last for a very long time; at least I've had them for quite awhile and only charged them once so far.Cons: They are not super duper comfortable for long wear; by the end of a forty-five minute session I'm more than ready to take them out and not have little plastic things jammed into my ears any more. That could of course be more about the shape of my ears than the objects themselves I don't know.Overall: GREAT for the price I am super happy with this purchase!
5,These are great for daily use. Sound quality is very good for the size. Also because they're smaller they don't fall out of my ears. Even the case is smaller than the case for my previous true wireless earbuds. But the size comes with a battery life tradeoff and it seems like they need to go back into the case for a recharge more often. All-in-all not a bad tradeoff for my purposes.
3,They are good for the name. But since I have little ears. They didn’t fit in snug enough. So hearing what I should be hearing was hard. Connection was perfect.  The ear pieces (extra ear plug things) was great to have and easy to replace to fit. I should have gone with something from skull candy. Despite the small ear thing. I would buy from them again.
4,These earbuds sounds great even compared to $40-$60 buds. They aren’t super comfortable for all day use but a great bang for your buck
5,I adore these they are small and cute and comfortable. I have to use them on very low volume because they are quite LOUD. The bass is decent and honestly I don't mind it. They're amazing for the price!
4,Las dimensiones del producto son muy buenas no molesta al tenerlo en el bolsillo el sonido es de buena calidad y la batería es duradera sin embargo no se ajustan bien al oído con frecuencia tengo que acomodarlos y cuando camino o estoy en movimiento siento que se van a caer... No sé si estoy usando la medida correcta pese a eso me siento satisfecho con la compra. Lo recomiendo.
5,These earbuds are a pleasure to use. Small compact and typical skull candy quality. Price is very good for the value. I use them daily for pod casts and phone calls.
4,Nice sound quality for listening to music and whatnot. However it sounds terrible for the other person if you use it for phone calls. Battery life is acceptable.
1,I was expecting a quality product since Skull Candy usually makes great products. But these do not hold a charge. I recieved a refund.
4,I like these headphones. They work well. They are convenient and the are easy to set up and swap back and forth between my cell phone and my computer.
5,These earbuds are awesome. The sound quality and noise canceling are far above what I expected for the price. Definitely recommending and will purchase again.
5,Battery life great convenient for being small. Listening to music or watching videos.
4,Was super surprised how comfortable they fit. The case for them is super cool and awesome to carry around on my keys. Battery life could be better. But all in all great sound and great for.the price.
5,Nice for the price
5,Great base!
5,I'm able to listen to messages and talk in private.. comfortable..
5,love them
3,I have fairly small ears. So it was a hit or miss that this was going to work. It didn’t. Still too big for my ears. But otherwise great product. Wonderful battery life. If it was just fit my ear shape
5,Awesome sound skull candy is one of the best
5,Exactly what my son wanted
5,Love them
5,Good sound but battery dies easily 😔
4,Sound alright but don't have great battery life. Small and compact good for the gym. Really cheap feeling case but for 20 dollars they're about the best you can get
4,I let 3 hours of Youtube play on my cell and still had 10% of battery life left. Not the best of sound quality  but good enough  for me since I don't listen to music on them
4,Cheap but. Nice
5,This product is very good. The comfort the quality everything about it is very good. I would recommend if you're doing exercise or working.
5,Great earbuds for the price. Definitely recommend
4,I disliked the battery life on theses ear buds. They did not last very long an hour at most ☹️☹️
5,First things first these are not to be compared with AirPod pros or anything at that level but for $20 the sound quality is amazing and they fit great in my ears (airpod pros fit well too for reference). Battery life is definitely a little underwhelming but the tiny size and light weight make them super easy to take anywhere. I put these on my keys and they definitely come in handy when I catch myself without my airpods!
5,Didn't expect these tiny buds to be so powerful. Impressed. I can listen to my music the sound is good no compromises. Gonna buy couple more to equip my whole family with them :)
5,For the money it would be hard to beat these little sound powerhouses. 2.5 - 3 hours of continuous play self-recharging carry case for even more play time crystal clear highs balanced mids and acceptable bass make for a head-bumpin' Goa Trance mix worthy of Uncle Sam's Disowned Nephew's demanding eardrums. Four Stars across the board but a bonus star for overall value! ⭐
4,Ordered wanting green got blue/teal. It’s not even listed or pictured in the photos 🙄 other than that yaaay headphones.
1,using this earbuds i have to talk loudly person from the other side of the call is not able to hear me properly. this problem is not there with other earbuds i use which is of same type.
5,I love it
1,Unit is very uncomfortable. I thought it was the rubber ear piece but it’s actually the design of the ear piece.  After about 30 minutes of use the pain starts to creep in.  Worst part is after an hour and 10 minutes it dies. I’ve been using it for about two weeks and can’t get it to go past an hour and 10 minutes
5,No problems enjoying it now
5,La relación entre precio y calidad es buena son pequeños y fácil de que se queden en tu oreja son cómodos. La batería tiene buena duración y el estuche es básico.
5,Love
4,Great for podcast good for music the battery life is a little over 3 hrs at 65% volume I only wear one at a time at work so when the battery runs low in one I switch to the other
5,La batería dura bastante el volumen máximo no es el mejor pero por el precio suena bastante bien son cómodos y de un momento a otro olvidas que los llevas puestos. es muy fácil llevarlos en los bolsillos no ocupan mucho espacio. y cargan bastante rápido para su categoría.Los recomiendo 100% para alguien que necesite algo para el GYM o escuchar música casual o YouTube.
5,I bought as a gift for my little cousins ​​they loved it it's looking good 👍
5,Exactly as I expected
5,Insane how good these are for the price
5,My kid needed a new pair of earbuds for school.  I got these for him. He will use them at school.
5,Kids like it as a gift. No complaints so far.
5,Comfortable earbuds that lSt through the work shift. I like how the case clicks shut and it has a loop to attach it to a zipper or key ring.
5,I bought two pairs and I’m glad I did especially for the price
5,Great sound compact fits on keys . Couldn’t ask for better for $20
3,The shape I find it rubs on my area above the ear lobe and begons to hurts after about 30 minutes if wear.  Otherwise great sound and battery life.
4,I like them but the battery only lasts at most 2plus hours while playing musicfit good and stay in
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Love them! little dangerous things! Loud! Glad I have them! Thanks Amazon! And Skullcandy!
5,Surprising sound quality at this price point. They aren't Sennheisers but they didn't cost $250 either. They are lightweight and feature rich for what they are. They are excellent for working out and stay in my ears nicely when I'm in the gym. Some complain about the battery life but I'm never in the gym for more than an hour or two so that makes them perfect for my application. They are also at a price where if they get busted up or lost I wouldn't cry I'd just buy another set. The case is small and lightweight as well and easy to put in your pocket or attach it to your keychain. Honestly at this price point I am having a hard time coming up with anything to complain about at all.I should mention that "noise canceling" is really just sound isolation due to a good seal when you put them in your ears. They did block out a lot of the noise when I was working out so unless somebody wanted to get my attention quite loudly I didn't hear them. These probably wouldn't be good for running outdoors or any other activity that would require you to be able to be aware of your surroundings.
5,I will order another pair they work really good and keep a really good charge sound really good
5,Great price and do the job
5,My brother said he liked them. I don't know for me though because I bought some for myself and the sound was all right but it has no bass. I need BASS
5,You get what you pay for. I use the every day I like them good deal not expensive.
3,I have purchased two of these and despite their waning battery life (about 4 hours and below) I love them. they are low profile and disappear into your ear. They do hurt at first and if you wear them too long. I will finally have to give up on these though because I lost all of them. the black color is too hard to see soI've washed these into hell! they no longer work. I mean on a good note they did survive about 6 washes and going through the dryer!Get these if you are on a budget and get a bright loud color not black.Update: They started working again!So after getting washed again I thought they no longer worked however since I had purchased an earlier set I swapped out the charger and presto! they started charging and are back in working order.Wow! not joking these things are sturdy.
5,I bought these headphones for my son for Christmas and he loves them!
4,I was having trouble with a more bulky pair of wireless earbuds so I tried these smaller ones since they were so cheap. I love them! My only issue is having ear piercings. If you have a conch piercing or any other inner ear piercings the ear buds WILL fall out frequently if you move a lot while wearing them. I had to size down the ball on my lower conch barbell and use my triangle lobe plug so I could maneuver them in a way to make the earbuds to fit securely. They still try to fall out when I bend over or sweat too much but they are still my favorites. I haven't had connection or battery issues at all. I only use them for a couple hours at a time but I've never had the battery die in that time or after three days of use without recharging the case. Great inexpensive and available in my favorite color!
5,Me encantaron  boy acargarlos con cargador de otros audífonos x k el cargador es diferente alos demas d lo otro me gustan suenan bien agarran llamadas puedo andar con solo un audifono en lo k se carga el otro eso es lo k keria.grasias..
4,At it's current price of $25.99 I'm not sure if I'd say these are worth it.  I only paid $20 and for what I got I'm satisfied but I wouldn't call them good.  The sound quality is decent enough and for what I paid it does the job.  The noise cancelation is more or less non-existent UNLESS that's referring to the fact that these things plug your ear.  The battery life on the other hand lasts quite long.  I don't have time to measure that so I can't say anything specific abiut it.  However I CAN say that I use them during my 30 minute lunch at work and another 30 minutes for when I work out so I tend use them for about 1 hour each day and I can go several days without having to charge.
4,This is a $20 set of ear buds. If you're wanting audiophile quality sound you're not going to get it from these. But if you want better than average call quality and good sounding music playback these will give you both.No the bass isn't booming and the highs aren't in the stratosphere but the sound is better than acceptable. Especially at this price point...Maybe there's a better sounding set out there that's available for $20. Maybe there isn't. I can't say.What I can say is there's no way you should be disappointed with the sound these put out. Not if you have reasonable expectations. These are worth the $20.Back in the day I had a $179 set of Motorolas and these sound every bit as good as those did. More recently I had a set of off-brand BT ear buds that didn't sound as good and made my ears sore. These are comfortable.I've got wired JVC and the wired buds that came with my iPhone. These sound a little better than the JVCs and are roughly on par with the ones from Apple.TLDR; These sound good and are worth the money.
5,I’m usually always happy with any Skull Candy product. I never buy another brand! For $20 you really can’t beat these!
5,Works perfect
3,The sound quality is excellent and the noise cancellation is so good it was worrisome. I would never hear anything behind me. Godzilla could be crashing through town and I'd just be bopping along. The problem is these things are huge. They were immediately uncomfortable in my ears and became increasingly uncomfortable as I wore them for about an hour. My ears hurt now. It's not the part that goes in your ear canal that was too big for me either it's everything except that. I have never had this problem with any other earbuds before. I can't speak to battery life because I could only wear these for an hour before my ear holes were on fire. I don't even have tiny ears. Who are these made for!?
5,These are absolutely amazing… let alone for this price point! I’ve brought 3 pairs just the last two months for me and my kids! Highly recommend!
5,Easy listening and durable and great sound!
5,It’s rare for me to find a pair of earbuds that fit my ears really well. These skullcandy earbuds fit the best out of any that I’ve owned and for the price they are an amazing pair of earbuds. Good noise cancellation and sound. The only downside is the battery. The case just doesn’t last long at all; it will maybe charge the earbuds 2-3 times before you have to recharge the case and the earbuds don’t last that long. Other than that they are amazing quality and might just be the best value wireless earbuds on the market
5,No dislikes at all
5,I just received these yesterday and they are working great. The sound is amazing and they're very comfortable in my ears. They really block out other sounds. I couldn't even hear my boyfriend talking to me when I was listening to some music and he was in the same room with me. The last pair I had lasted me for 3 years. I hope these last for a long time. I'll let you know if they don't.
4,Good sound great fit and small size! Only issues are no USB C charging and small battery life but for $25 it’s amazing. ( I hate micro USB so I just attached a magnetic charger to it for easy charging!)
5,Love them exactly what I was looking for. Great sound quality. Small and perfect. Love that I can listen from only while the other in the case.
5,I saw these through a sponsored Facebook ad and had to have them.  Right out of the box it tells you to fully charge them so I did.  It took about an hour.  They are not kidding with the name Dime.  They are very small which is perfect for me.  I have a hard time finding headphones that fit and stay in my small ears.  As with most headphones these come with three different sized rubber pieces that help fit it to the size of your ear.  The carrying case comes with a strap so you could attach the whole case to your keys.  The entire case is as small as most key fobs.They sound exactly as you would expect with Skull Candy products.  The sounds is clear and crisp.  You don’t lose anything in the smaller size.  They seem to cancel out most background noise as well.I may have to buy a pair to keep at home and one to put on my keys.  I would highly recommend these to anyone especially if you have small ears.
5,Great! These are really worth it
5,I got them yesterday but love them already
4,I tried all 3 of the different sizes and none of them seem to stay in my ears. The sound quality is great though when they aren’t falling out of my ears. The battery life is also pretty long. Not sure if I just have weird shaped ears or if the earbuds are shaped weird.
5,I've tried many cheapo and regretted it. These are the best for the price. They fir really well and don't fall out easily
5,Pods are smaller and less likely to catch on anything. The sound quality is amazing and you can hardly hear any outside noise when both buds are in. Only drawback is battery life is not as long as my indy fuel pods but still a awsome set of pods
5,Very good
5,I got these for Christmas and they have absolutely blown my mind for the quality verses the price I paid. I expect something kinda okay since they are so cheap in price but wow were my expectations blown out of the water! Not only do they sound amazing but they survived going through the washer and dryer?! I dried them and charged them... I figured they'd be long gone but once they were fully charged they worked just fine. Truly amazed by everything Skullcandy sells I highly recommend the brand and these Bluetooth earbuds!
5,I bought these as my old earbuds were on a cord which sometimes would get caught on benches or machines while lifting and would get ripped out-these solved that problem! I don’t know if it’s due to my ear piercings (I have my conch pierced in one ear and my daith pierced in the other) or something else but unless I have them in upside-down while lifting heavy they tend to get loose and then I can hear the gym more than the music. But if I wear them upside down this doesn’t happen lol-so I always wear them upside-down; problem solved. They sound great and are LOUD I listen to them at one notch above muted and they are plenty loud above all of the gym noise. I love them!
5,I wouldnt have believed it if someone let me try a set of these and then told me they were only twenty dollars.
5,The price is very affordable and the headset is just wonderful I love it.
2,My old BT had stopped working so I decided to find one that didn’t need the ear hook to hold in place.  I found this & decided to give it a try.The fit was perfect but with that being said I had to send them back because it would just disconnect in the middle of a call.  The battery would say fully charged and yet it would deplete rather quickly even if I wasn’t using them.  The sound with volume all the way up was still not enough.So… I decided that instead of going thru the hassle of a replacement and maybe having the same issues I decided to purchase one of my old BTs cause I knew it worked very well.
5,I love these! So compact and the sound is great. They don’t fall off and they stay on while you are moving around. Just buy them…you will like.Now go get your squat on!!
5,To sum things up better than wasting your hard-earned money on an airpod this is route you should choose. Have good sound quality noise cancelation and reliable battery life. Love them. ❤
4,One week of uses after I gave my wife my airpod 2. This one  Not comfort fit.  My wife tried these and it does not stay on keeps on falling off when running.  No Matter which ear cushion we used.  It fits ok on my ear but have to jam it in to stay.  Will keep for slime time.Heard so much hype about this brand so tried.
5,El tamaño y calidad de sonido son justas al precio
5,Not bad
5,Perfect
5,Great quality What can I say this item works as advertised.
5,Great quality for the price I use them for my Nintendo switch lite.
5,The headphones work very well considering the price. I have had no complaints from anyone I speak to over the phone while using these buds.
5,Overall these earbuds are really great.  They always connect the first time by Bluetooth whether it be to my iPod or my phone and the sound is amazing.  My only complaint is that when I use them for talking on the phone so I am hands-free they pick up every single sound around me which can be a little annoying to the person I am speaking to.  A good example is that my husband sneezed the other day while I was using the earbuds on a phone call.  The person I was on the phone with heard it and said it was so loud that my husband could have been on the phone call with them and my husband was literally on the other side of the house!  So they work great on all things except noise cancellation.
5,I used to use Skullcandy headphones in high school and I loved them. Haven’t used them in a long time and I was pleasantly surprised to find out they’re still great! Pretty awesome sound quality the noise cancellation is really good and I love how small they are. For the price you really can’t beat it. Highly recommended 👻.
5,I bought these as a replacement to some other earbuds that didn’t work and these turned out much better for my teens sons (who always fight over their things that are alike) I’m glad they offered a variety of colors they connected really easily and my kids love the sound and the way they look!
4,I've had thise for 3 months now.. The quality of sound is good meaning I can hear my callers and my callers can hear me clearly. As for music I'm not a tech person so I can't speak on bass or subwoofer or whatever. I can hear the music and it's okay. I didn't buy it to listen to music just for phone calls. This also feels VERY comfortable in my ears. The reason I give this 4 stars is because they don't stay in the ears for long. With clean ears and clean ear buds these just keep falling out especially if walking. There is no way these can be used while running or any exercise. If the motion doesn't make them fall out the sweat will. And these will roll/bounce pretty far when they fall. It comes with 3 ear adapters. I tried changing the ear adapters but nothing worked. I hope they can fix this issue. I might buy these again just to have around the house.
3,They die within an hour or less
5,Bought 2 for me and my bf  we have no complaints automatically connects and the battery last long
5,This is the first pain of ear buds that are actually comfortable for me.
5,work better for me than my sesh Evo or indy but alot cheaper left a bud outside last night it rained the bud charged up and still works great
5,This is the second time I've bought these earbuds my husband likes to steal mine they have really great sound quality so it's easy to lose yourself into the music they have good noise cancellation my coworkers like to sneak up on me all the time and the battery life is great and last for a long time.
4,These are great for the size and price. I have several of the Skullcandy ear buds and you will get a better quality and longer battery life with the more expensive pairs however for $20 these make an excellent backup set small enough to keep in any purse or gym bag. They also charge very quickly and can be used independently of each other which is a major plus.
3,Poor sound quality and not the best fitting.
5,Fine for anytime
5,The battery life is ultimately the only issue that I've run into with these amazingly tiny and high sound quality earbuds.
5,The sound is very clear (as expected from Skullcandy) the noise cancellation is pretty good for the price and they adapt fine to my ear.The only cons is that the battery lifetime is very short so you need to charge them almost daily or every 2 days.
5,Comfortable and lous
5,This product is pretty good. It has great sound quality & noise cancelation.  The battery life is sometimes hit or miss. Depending on if your using it for listening to music or on the phone.
5,Works great good sound very comfortable
5,These Lil suckers take forever to die. The sound is aaaaaamazing and they are nearly weightless
5,Skull candy Dimes are a great solution for a grab n go earbuds. The sound might not be what you would desire compared to other expensive ones. You have to consider you are paying only $20 for that price they are amazing! These earbuds come in a very small case easy to store anywhere and take around. I've been using them for two weeks now and have no complaints at all the do what is says they do. Would get them again if I need too!
2,THESE ARE GARBAGE! First off I’m just very disappointed the earbuds are designed terribly they don’t fit in my ear comfortably and they come with this weird short ear tips instead of normal ones (refer to picture left is og earbud right is one I put on from other skullcandy) so they barely go in your ear. Second they almost never turn on automatically when I take them out the case and when they do turn on its a b*tch to get it connected to my phone. Also when you charge the case it disconnects your headphones and turns them off. The only good thing I can say about these is that when I finally used them for 45 seconds the sound was good THATS IT! Don’t buy this worthless pair.
5,I got them for work they work great they’re small enough to put on your lanyard with keys and not be all bulky.
5,So I love Skullcandy and decided to cop these. I love bass and earbuds but didn’t want to spend $200 on AirPods Pro. These have booming bass and can get pretty loud all sounds are loud and calls/mics are decent tried on Discord in stereo and hands free and it sounds pretty good and clear. Love how comfortable they are and don’t hurt after a few hours. Highly recommend for Discord and calls music is good. Why wait try them out!
5,Funciona increíble materiales muy resistentes y se siente bien al tacto el color es perfecto
5,My 11 year old son loves them and they look very cool - charges super fast lasts long
5,I absolutely love them! Great sound quality and noise cancellation. I just wish the battery life was longer.
5,I’ve always liked skull candy and these sound great for the price easy to sync just take them out the case press the power button on each ear bud and boom your phone will connect right away
5,Got these for my kid not the greatest in sound quality but I kinda knew that going into it. For the price they are worth every penny.
5,It cheap and works well. Battery life is good as well.Update: the earbuds and case survived a wash cycleand dryer cycle.They are durable!
5,amazing sound quality trust me i am saying this from my experience they are amazing and small for small spaces or sneakin in school and stuff trust me when i say that this an amazing product for only 30 bucks its crazy the only thing is the battery life is pretty bad but if you just wanna use them sometimes not constantly all day please buy these bought the Indy Evo's a year ago and they where no better than these trust me this is a steal. indy evos are like 60 and these are half the price truly amazing. hope this helped you decide. btw this is coming from a 13 year old
5,I done lost 2 pair of air pods and I came across the skull candy headphones and they are on the same level as apple remember skull candy was one of the brands that started off small and they really improved I just bout another pair just to have ..
5,Son muy buenos se conectan muy fácil y rápido. Además son muy cómodos y el tamaño es perfecto.
5,at this price point they honestly put other more expensive earbuds to shame. and the bass is definitely the highlight on these.
5,Sound quality is okay for the price I paid. Does a fair amount of canceling out noise. Battery life could be a little better. Overall it was a good buy.
5,Love it works good
4,Muy útil para mi gusto en la música
4,*UPDATE* After a few weeks the left ear stopped working. i will have a replacemnet set without havingto return the old par. Thanks so much!!!Loves these all around but the battery is the weakest feature.
5,PRICE WAS GOOD
5,These are my favorite wireless earbuds ever. Magnetic base quick charging good battery life and great distance (can still hear on the opposite side of my house from my phone). Works great with the Galaxy S20+!
5,Excelente audio
5,I bought these about a year ago mainly because I wanted to listen to music when I’m cleaning but don’t want to blast it to the rest of the house. I’d never used earbuds before so I didn’t want to start off spending a lot.  I’ve used my husbands iPhone apple earbuds and the sound is pretty comparable.  My grandson who has had lots of brands said he was surprised at how good they sound!  The noise canceling is so good that I only wear one at a time if I didn’t I wouldn’t hear anyone talking to me!  For me battery life has been good!  I don’t need to wear them all day but I’ve used them for many hours and no problems.
5,These are very well priced perfectly sized earbuds. I bought them for my nephew and he really likes them for music games apps movies. However whenever we would receive a phone call from him while he was using the headphones the connection and sound was horrible. In his case we didn't really need them for phone calls so I gave them 5 stars because they worked the way i wanted them for what i needed. If i was going to recommend them though I would caution about phone call quality.
1,Battery life is awful at just under 2.5 hours of continuous use.  I wanted these to replace the headset I use nightly to stream my shows for 3 hours before going to sleep. Other headsets last for days on one charge.  I can't even get through one night with these.
5,Sound quality was astounding for $25. Lots of bass and the highs are crisp. Definitely lacks in the midrange but the listening experience is still enjoyable. I never have listened to headphones or earbuds that sound this good for the price. Build quality is great fit is great would definitely recommend.
5,I like the way the earbuds fit in my ear. I have trouble finding the right earbud to fit my ear. They are very comfortable to me. I tried several different products but these earbuds are a great fit.
5,I bought it for my dad's birthday he uses it often and he likes it it was a very good buy
5,These were bought as a Christmas gift.  They work great and my kiddo was certainly happy with them.  He has been using them nonstop.
5,To be totally transparent these feel like cheap plastic earbuds. The case is too light and where most competitors use magnets for the lid this one uses a hard plastic click.But these are 20 dollar name-brand earbuds so you should set your expectations correctly. For 20 dollars these are fantastic. They stay connected (I actually connect mine to my work PC) the battery may be a little better than advertised? and they're very comfortable.I was actually using Sony MX4s prior to these. The Sonys sound better of course but they're also 350 dollars. My main purpose for these was meetings with light music listening while working... and these are very suitable for that. I actually bought these to 'try' a pair of earbuds and to see how I feel about using them while working and I think I much prefer the experience over big headphones.  I may eventually spend an extra... 30-50 bucks and get a higher end pair of earbuds but for now these totally get the job done. When I upgrade these I'll definitely put them in my car or suitcase because I think these would shine as  backup headset.One note if you're using these with your PC (especially if this is your first time using bluetooth headphones on PC) - Open your audio settings you'll see Hands-Free AG Audio and Stereo. Use Stereo. Once you set it once the PC will remember. The Hands-Free AG Audio will let you use the microphone on the earbuds but you sacrifice audio quality. Like you won't be able to listen to music with Hands-Free AG turned on. With stereo you can listen to music well but you lose the microphone. I personally have a dedicated microphone on my desk but most webcams have a fine microphone already so use stereo and rely on another mic it's a much better PC experience.
4,Always a SkullCandy Fan. These are great Travel ear buds. Love that I can put them on my keys. They are not as comfortable as the Indy buds. The buttons are a little hard to press and they hurt your ears if you push it while wearing it. This makes it a paint to change songs or volume.
5,The Skullcandy dimes are a great pair of headphones at a great price. Sound quality is excellent and so is noise cancellation. The headphones you don't have active noise cancellation but with a different size rubber inserts that you put on the earbuds you can get a secure almost soundproof from the outside world fit. They come in a box that recharges and securely fits on your keychain. The only negative I have to say is battery life but for the price these make a great gift and a great extra pair headphones just to keep on your keychain for when you need them.
4,it works
5,Amazing little buds.  They do sound great and are very light and comfortable.  Good Bass and nice mids and trebble!  When they die they die.  Meaning the case charge and ear buds wont warn you really so every 2-3 days plug them in.  Well worth it for beach wear travel or every day use.  I love em.
1,Didn't  like them because they didn't  come with a charging  cord. Was never able to use them.
5,Wow! Much better than the usual BT earbuds in this price range
5,Some of the best on the market!!!
5,Great product. I've had one drop into a cup of coffee and one left in my pants pocket was found at the bottom of the washer... I wasn't optimistic that they survived my lack of brain cells but much to my shock and delight they still work perfectly!Highly recommend.
5,They fit comfortably  lightweight and the sound is so clear. Great price point for such a quality product!
5,We love these at our house. They do not have the best battery life. You get what you pay for and it is enough for regular use. If you are keeping them in your ear all day then they will not last.Skull Candy has quality sound for a great price.  My office just purchased many of these to give to a local high school to pass out for Christmas.
4,I wanted cheap wireless earbuds for one specific use and these work perfectly so far.  No issues connecting them via Bluetooth--very simple to pair!  The charge does not last as long as my Pixel Buds and don't sound quite as good but this is not a critical application either.  It should however use a USB-C port and not the now-outdated micro USB port.  But again for $25 I'm not going to complain too much over that.  It was nice to find a pair at this price point for what I needed at a lower cost than some wired earbuds.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I love the quality and they are really good
2,These did not fit in my ears. The sound quality is probably great and they probably cancel noise better if they fit you. They just don't fit me. They don't stay in regardless of which size silicone I put on.
5,Love  it
5,The sound quality is far better than expected for a low cost earbud. The noise cancellation is is nearly absolute. Caution: the buds fall out of the ear easily.
5,The Skullcandy Dim 2 headsets work perfectly well and fit comfortably in my ears. Thank you
4,I purchased this for a Christmas gift for my son. While he is excited about it he reveals that he has no way to charge them.  We had to purchase a charger for the product.
5,$25 delivered. Good Value.  I have nothing to use to compare sound quality but they sound good enough for my tinnitus ears.  Why people pay Hundreds for White Buds just to boost their self esteem in their peer groups is beyond me.Easy to set up & use even for Boomers like me!
3,I tried all the different ear cushions and all of them doesn't fit properly and hurt my ear.
5,My kids love there! Great fit! Great sound! Great battery life!
4,Bought these say 3 weeks ago? And honestly for the price they could be infinitely worse but they deliver enough noise cancellation to get lost in your music and provide enough battery life for sitting back and relaxing. I put these in at work one at a time and right around the 2 and a half hour mark it starts letting me know my battery is low. Doesnt matter much to me. They do tend to slip out a bit not entirely but they are much more for light movement not so much anything past that. I am thinking about getting the sesh evos for something that fits in and stays put and keeping these for light work all in all a good brand. Skullcandy exceeded my expectations bought a pair of inkd earbuds a while back and they died on me so Skullcandy really upped their games
1,Opened them charged them left earbud wont turn on at all. What a waste of money
4,Easy setup. Sounds great. Fits great. Different sizes for your ear.  The buttons are not easy touch like some.  Does not show battery life.  Seems like a good price overall.
5,Great sound quality easy to use! I’ll be buying these for other family members!
5,i love these they are amazing the only thing is that i don’t like how the case snaps close instead of magnets. but they are great.
4,Honestly they are great for people with average to larger ears. They do not fit kids or ladies ears that well. Tend to fall out.
4,Good price will have limited usage.  Pleased so far.
4,I got these on sale for $20. They are great for that price. The case is well built portable and easily fits in my pocket. The buds have a nice design that also fit well in my ears. In addition the sound is nicely balanced in the middle. The problem is the battery life. It's short as you have to at minimum charge these buds once or twice a day and the case every 2 to 3 days. It also isn't bass heavy which is fine with me. So if you want bass heavy buds or ones with long battery life look elsewhere. Otherwise these are fantastic for the price.
5,I don't know why people would spend upwards of $100 for earbuds when you can get something this good for 20 bucks.
5,I don't know why people would spend upwards of $100 for earbuds when you can get something this good for 20 bucks.
5,Needed something that I wouldn't be too bummed about loosing at work.  This is it.  They are quick to pair with my iphone.  Sound good. Not too muffled or bass heavy.  fit in my ear well and don't fall out unless I'm really moving around a lot.  I'm a gardener so a lot of up and down and fast movements.
4,Use for my books
5,I really love these earbuds. I Like the magnetic case it grabs the earbud and seats it in its case to charge up. I also like that once I paired the earbuds they automatically pair to my device each time I take them out of their case. That is so convenient. They sound great and the batteries last throughout the day. My only complaint would be that they kind of just rest on your ear and at the slightest bump will tend to come unlodged from the ear canal. Overall these earbuds are a great value and I have purchased additional sets for my family members for Christmas.
5,Los audifonos no se apagan automaticamente al meterlos en su caja  y finalmente tras un mes de uso el audífono derecho ya no funciona para nada  revise videos de comentarios y aparentemente es un problema frecuente  quiero un reembolso
2,I was excited for these. They are compact with great sound and noise cancelation however. They do NOT stay in my ears at all unless I am sitting perfectly still.Can't wear them biking or gardening or even just walking without them falling out they do come with different sizes of silicone ear adapters none of them work with my ears.Super disappointed because I threw away the packaging after using them a few days listening to podcasts on my couch. Now I wish I could return them.
5,Very comfortable and works well for the price.
5,Gave them to my boyfriend who looses earbuds a lot for Christmas and he can’t stop raving about them. Great BBC quality for the price.
5,Good product. Happy with the sound quality and comfort.
3,What can you say about $25 earbuds well I can say that they're not very loud they're very base heavy but overall for the $25 it's not a bad buy if they're a backup pair of headphones on another note if you pair it with an equalizer and then dummy down the base will actually get a pretty decent sound profile
5,Definitely a good pair of cheap Bluetooth headphones. Small build with good battery. Feels a little “cheap-plasticy” but don’t drop kick it and you’ll be fine.
5,100% recomendados excelente calidad por precio
2,The longest they stay in is like 5 minutes. It took a while for the left earbud to even work at all. Very awkward to wear. No matter how much you adjust them they will never stay in there right unless you painfully jab them in. Even then they stay in for 5 minutes at most. Maybe don’t get these if you have small ears like me. Sound quality is fine but doesn’t sound much better than my regular iPhone 11pro speakers.
1,Dañados se realizó devolucion
5,Good product
5,Worth the money as a backup pair
5,Decent pair of blue-tooth wireless earbuds. I like this brand of headphones and it's a decent price as well. I have these as a back up pair for another brand I had purchased which are amazing quality. Would recommend to people in need of a decent pair of earbuds they also have a pretty good battery
5,The fit is great literally snaps into my ears. The color green is awesome and case is small and compact. I’m going to enjoy using these while I working out at the gym or moving about around the house while caring for my baby. They are stylish and versatile.  The sound is ok not totally bass blasting but definitely going to work for music or podcasts. I recommend these if you are looking for an inexpensive choice that looks great and works good verses an expensive one you can find when lost thru their app or one with a wireless charging case.
5,Sounds quality is amazing especially with the price. These ear buds are light comfortable and sounds great.
1,The battery does not stay charged and it will not charge too full charge
5,These are the very first wireless ear buds that I have ever purchased...I basically  listen to podcasts while exercising  and they are very good..very nice price point s well
5,These are the first wireless earbuds I’ve ever bought for myself. So I cannot give you any comparisons on sound quality and battery life but if you want a pair of earbuds that are tough then these could serve you well. These have survived being mauled by a teething puppy and taking a spin in the washing machine and are still kicking. The buttons still work. The battery life hasn’t changed. The sound hasn’t changed. If I ever need to buy another pair it will definitely be another pair of these.
3,I bought these on a recommendation but the left ear piece only stays charged about 20 minutes (the right is fine) and it has never fit in my ear quite right. They sound good when both are working. I only had them about 5 weeks when the issue started.
5,I’ve tried a few sets of these different brands all around the same price point long story short- I like these the best. Small fits my ears decent quality they actually WORK when I want them to. Great buy.
5,Great purchase
5,i've been using them most of the day decently comfortable my only complaint is pressing the button on the side takes a good amount of force holding it in your hand no problem but with it in your ear its not so fun i control them primarily off my watch or phone great sound quality. i was immediately surprised but i shouldn't have been. i've never been disappointed by skullcany. another hit for sure.
5,These earbuds do not have the best sound quality but they’re not bad either. Great for listening to books on Audible  while cleaning or  replaying school lectures. I just ordered a second pair for work!
1,la calidad de el audifono no es para nada buena la bateria no dura ni la mitad de el tiempo que dicen las indicaciones y el sonido no es tan bueno
4,The quality is better than the price would suggest. The only drawback is they don’t stay put in my ears very well. I always have to fiddle with them.
5,I love them.
5,Had them for almost a year now and they're still working great through out my daily walks rain or shine.
5,I use these walking from my car to office and back. Sound is great for my use - to listen to podcasts.
5,Se escucha muy bien y son muy comodos
5,These were easy to set up and use straight out of the box. All the pairing has worked effortlessly and the microphone quality is good. There’s a mic in both buds so you can use one at a time or both together. I use earbuds mostly for listening to podcasts and doing video/audio calls not for listening to music… the sound quality seems fine/excellent for that. I have listened to music too and it sounds well balanced between treble and bass (but I’m no expert). These are not actively noise-cancelling they just block some sound by nature of being an earplug. I looked at many more expensive/fancy earbuds with equalizer apps etc. but since my usage needs were basic I decided to try these economical ones. I’m really pleased with the choice. As a final note I have really small ears (for an adult) and these fit ok. I changed out the silicone buds for smaller ones I had from another headset and I have to make sure I position the outer part just right to avoid pain on my outer ear but as long as I get it right these are comfortable to wear for hours and don’t fall out while I’m moving around.
5,I originally bought it for my phone and it sounds alright but it sounds way better on my husband's phone.
5,sound quality is better than my older wired set and I really enjoy the portable rechargeable case.
1,Battery life is HORRIBLE tough to connect.  Says 3 hours.  Barely got 39 mins.  VERY DIFFICULT to charge too.  Instruction manual worthless and even harder to find info on line.  Would give indication lights that have no explanation anywhere.  Very dissatisfied and shocked skullcandy. A brand I have used for years would put crap like this in the market
5,Amazing value awesome design and packaging.  Functionally perfect small lightweight with a great features.I remember my old skullcandy wired buds I loved and lost 15 years ago!  They were the best I ever had now fast forward to today Ive owned at least a dozen different brands of wireless earbuds in the 20$ - $150 range.  These really have premium design and practicality and amazing value.  How can something so cheap bring so much happiness I use them like crazy thats why I keep coming back to these.No regrets clip them to your keychain purse back pack.  Pick your favorite color so your wife kids and ipads all have assigned buds
5,Nice small ear buds to keep at my desk at work! Didn't need anything fancy.
1,Everything is good except the life of the battery. I got roughly 2hrs or less out of this set no matter how long I charged them. Never again.
5,Love these...small and great for small ears good sound quality...love them better than my Airpods ...which my husband took over :)
5,I collect headphones and earbuds that said; these are no nonsense well built and comfortable.These are my go to for listening to audible at night b4 bed.Only - is the short earbud battery life but for the price overall Amazing buy!!!
5,enjoyed
5,Love them work great cancels all nose but the battery doesn't last long
4,For below $30 they sound better than others fit nicely
5,I love them I have buy so many by far this are awesome
5,I collect earphones and earbuds.  My favorite brands are Skullcandy for Bass and Sound.  I also buy Sony and Bose.  These Skullcandy Dime earbuds sound just as good as some $200 earbuds.  I'm about to buy another pair.  The sound clarity is amazing on these.  It has a good bass bump. The background vocals sound good as well.  SKULLCANDY changed the landscape with these amazing low-cost earbuds.  This will make a great CHRISTMAS gift.  If you got kids I would stock up.
5,I bought these so I can wear them when I go to the gym. I like them so far. They do their job and stay in place.
5,The battery life for the skullcandy last all day long with perfect sound overall...
1,These do not work for my kids. I purchased two pair and they are the worst headphones we have purchased
4,Sound is good.  Very comparable to other brands in same cost category or higher.  Big drawback for me are the hard-click buttons.  My other devices have the soft touch features and once you're used to those it's hard to get used to hard click buttons.  You can't advance to the next song or use any feature without pushing the device deeper into your ear.  Deal breaker for me.
1,No noise canceling battery life sucks fall out if you sweat all round terrible.
5,Sound is good battery life is good happy with this purchase
5,They fit on her key ring... cant lose them
5,
5,These earbuds fit comfortably in your ear which is huge for me. Bluetooth auto connects fast when removing from charging case.
5,The earbuds have great sound and noise blocking effect but did not stay in my ears well I gave them to my son and he loves them they were a perfect fit for him.
5,Well instead of black and green the case is actually like a dark navy and the buds themselves are more of a jade than a traditional green. Can't complain tho hard to find green things. Overall I love all skull candy products. The charging cord was a little confusing at first still uses a standard USB port but it just fits inside it differently. Make sure when you get it to take off the white tabs that prevent the buds from charging while you charge the case. They're super comfy decently loud. Well worth 20$!
5,This is my second wireless earbuds and I am greatly satisfied with the product.
5,Perfect for the money! Exactly what I wanted! Sound quality is good!
5,Nice sounding earbuds
5,Surprising really good for 25$ Bluetooth earbudsonly complaint is more bass would be nice and the battery life is almost unusable unless your using them for 30<
5,I like carrying my headphones with my keys so I always have something to listen with. Super light weight and fast charging
5,They are exactly what they say they are!
5,It's good. Quality good. Battery life is good for tasks and you can use one bud while the other charges. Sound Quality alright.Would recommend to a friend if they need a pair of buds for excercise music and meetings.
5,Wow! I purchased the wired ones and they were damaged so I said let me try these out. Skull candy makes excellent products without breaking the bank. I have some Beats headphones and they don't close to the functionality of the Skull. They sync immediately once placing in your ear and I could cut grass and hear them clearly without cutting off and on. Man I liked them so much I bought my wife a pair. I haven't did an Amazon review in a long time but these were worthy of giving Skull Candy a thumbs up!
4,great sound for the price but they have a tendency to fall out of my ears
5,I'm very happy with this purchase. I really like the size is very practical. The battery is ok. Great sound volume is ok can be better
3,I only have one gripe for this product…..  the buds fall out of the ear when I talk and it is annoying.  I’ve tried all the other silicone pieces and still do it.  Great audio great sound.
1,Battery life is very bad on these they won't  go past 2 hours without dying
1,One of the earbuds stopped charging.Guess I'm going back to buying Jbl only
5,Great product for a great price 👍😊
5,These are awesome especially for the price! They’re little come with two more ear fittings a short cord charger and a carrying rope. I’m glad I got these!
5,It comes with 3 different rubber sizes. I use the smallest. Charges fast and last me for days. I been using this for weeks and recommend it.
5,Very cool
5,Great
5,Good but not great charge only last about 3 hours. Not enough
5,These have great sound and the background noise is almost non-existent. The price is low for the quality of the product and the life of the playback is great too! They last through a couple movies or through several hours of music zoom meetings or phone calls. They recharge quickly too which is also a plus. Overall a great purchase from a company I'm glad to know about!
5,I gave my iPods to my niece. For some reason they always kept falling out. It was to the point that I was nervous to lose one. Which is ridiculous because I would never leave the house without them so they were useless. These ones are cheap easy to use and super durable. I use them to work out or to watch a show while cooking. Are use them when I’m working out in the pool and even dropped one which floated to the bottom. I thought it wasn’t going to work anymore but to my surprise The audio was still going.
5,They are okay for the price and size. I will totally recommend them for gym time or small breaks
3,The sound quality is good. But they only last about 1.5-2 hours for real. Having to charge them twice during work sucks... The mic also picks up a mouse urinating on cotton from across the room. Which is goodpending.
3,Just got these the other day and while I like the design and comfort it seems the battery life is horrible. The case and the headphones were charged completely I used them for an hour and started hearing the “battery low” message every few minutes… on top of that at times songs skip as if I’m listening to a CD player
4,Overall I recommend these earbuds if you can find them for around $20. They are small and very portable. That sound quality is very good and they charge quickly. My only issue so far is possibly the range. I have my phone in my back pocket of my pants when I bent forward that connection was spotty. Something to keep in mind if you are working out with your phone in your pocket. It is set it on the table I didn't have that issue. Nonetheless for the small size price and sound quality I would definitely recommend these earbuds.
5,Me encantan estos audífonos dura full la batería se escucha super duro son cómodos y lindos pequeñitos 10/10
5,Love using these for single ear stay aware of my surroundings walking my dog in coyote country music listening. Also taking calls on the walk is effortless. Love the sound reproduction and fit in my ears (ymmv). Happy I bought these.
5,Very easy to carry when I work out Auto very clear
5,My boyfriend seems to be enjoying them very well. We plan on getting his mom some as well.
5,Live them. They were not to expensive and the quality is awesome.
5,Cheaper earbuds but still sound midrange
5,Ok fine buds not good some time coming itching
5,This is my first set of blue tooth ear buds and I am so happy with them.  They make walking and listening to books on tape so pleasant.  They keep outside noises out quite well and are just what I wanted.  To decide what to get I asked my 14 and 12 year old grandsons and they said these were the best high quality low priced pair.  I have been thanking them for their recommendations ever since.
2,So I cut these on at 7:30 pm they died at 4:38amThey do not last 24 hours only reason why I bought them was bec I had a pair of headphones like them a long time ago and wanted to try out the wireless ones but no so I have the iPhone 11 Pro Max and ima try out the iPhone headphones next as well as them beats and give a product review and also the headphones where but very loud and the cord to charge it up was not a average cord I basically had to plug it behind a tv
3,I really wanted to love these. No other company has the great sound Skullcandy has unfortunately they are struggling on the functionality front. I replaced my Indy buds with another brand simply because the functionality sucked (touch controls very picky couldn't use just one bud etc). When I saw these Dime buds I thought it would be perfect but alas this is not the case.Yes the sound and music quality is fantastic but the fact that the functions are controlled by actual push buttons instead of normal touch controls is almost a deal breaker for me. I thought they were broken at first but it turns out you just have to push really hard exactly on the skull logo to do anything. This is not comfortable to do painful in fact. Why they thought buttons were a good idea is beyond me. People designed this tested it approved it and now sell it and this huge design flaw made it all the way to us.
5,Let me start by saying I have three other pairs of cheap wireless earbuds that I hate.  All the other ones I have tried have had the charging cases stop recognizing the buds easily the buds fit too loosely in the charger and the battery life is pretty bad.  These fit snugly in their case with a lid that snaps closed they pair with their case without cleaning them or having to blow on the charging points....  They are very small so the battery life is of course not long on these either but they pop right in their case charge super fast and can be used one at a time so I can have one bud charging while one is in use.  These also have the best audio quality for people hearing me on the telephone of any of my inexpensive wireless earbuds which has been a significant issue with the others.  My one complaint with these is that they are very small and are very easy to drop out of your ears if your not careful they definitely wouldn't hold on for exercise in my opinion.
5,3 different sized for different dieter ears amazing sounds quality easy sync. Overall great for the price
5,Good product good quality and sound.
3,The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because  of its price point. They are super cheap. If you want to use these for audiobooks or podcast they might workBattery life sucks. They wont stay on securely (keeps falling) with any of the tips included. Sound quality y one of the worst Ive experience there is nearly no bass at all. Also there is a weird skipping lag when im listening to music while my phone is on my pocket...it shouldn’t happen.The overall design and concept are beautiful.. I really wanted these to be good. This product might be a good gift for a teenager tho.. not for me (33 yo everyday working man)
5,I'm not an audiophile by any means but I have worked as a sound engineer and these are great for any casual listeners. I use them a lot for working out and the snug fit keeps them from falling out and they do a good job blocking out outside sounds. The battery life does leave a bit to be desired but for the low price it's forgiveable. I probably wouldn't use them for something like studio recording outside of emergencies but again that's not the intended purpose of these.
5,I lost my other pair and I got this as a replacement and I love them as much as my previous pair. I had the jib true ones and the dime ones fit my ears better I have small ears and headphones tend to feel awkward. I would say these fit the best out of jin true.
5,Battery life is great one charge last over a day. The sound is good noise cancellation is okay.
4,Really great for the price but I only get about 2 hours of play time. Way under the suggested time
4,The music sounds great but they don’t stay in your ears. I have small ears and even the small ear buds don’t help with them staying in place.
5,Me agradó
5,Absofuckinglutely awesome! Beats $100 buds all day long!
4,Idk it's worth prize but then again battery life is runs out quick and left ear bud turns off and off 🥱
5,Solid set of ear buds for the price. Couldn't be happier.
2,Battery life is ridiculously short even after charging overnight. Sound quality isn’t great especially when running. Save your money. Meh is what I wish I could rate them
5,They will work great for the school year!
4,Not the most comfortable and the battery doesn't last long but they're the only keychain earbuds on the market. For a hell of a price too
5,Like that I can use one earbud or both. I like the case also.
3,Having to send them back. No one can hear me. Had to reset them worked for a day then back to no one hearing me.
5,Love them. My son has the same ones.
5,I used the product to listen to music
5,These fit perfectly in my ears. I'm sure they won't fit perfectly for everyone but for me they lock in my ears perfectly and comfortable. Music and listening to podcasts quality is great no issue.  They connect to my android phone instantly price can't be beat! I recommend.
5,I got these for my husband as a present and he LOVES them! He keeps them in his pocket to listen to podcasts music etc during random downtime. They are compact and highly portable. Very comfortable fit. Great sound quality. And the cost to value ratio is outstanding!
4,Just like how shown I would definitely recommend. I love them. The only thing that I dislike about them is the battery life definitely isn't 12 hours. They are still very good tho
5,It doesn't hold a battery for any length of time. And it runs hot in your ear. My money down the drain.
2,Updated! the sound is great But I do not recommend these earbuds the battery dies out within hrs. Half the time when I'm on the phone the other person can't hear me; must be some kind of issue with the connection to the phone. So in the end save yourself the money and buy something more reliable theses are not!
5,Bought so I could listen to music at work without bothering anyone else ... I only use one at a time.  Popped one in my ear as soon as they arrived didn't bother charging.  It lasted about half an hour and needed to charge not surprising.  The other one had been charging that half hour so I popped that one in.  It's been 3 hours and it's still going.  Music is very clear.  Didn't buy to use for phone calls and don't know if I will.  For the price I think these are great.
1,These are so uncomfortable I returned them. The sound quality is subpar. The noise cancellation is also barely detectable. I realize these are super budget friendly but you can’t wear them for more than 15 minutes without your ears killing you from the thick plastic. There are so many better fitting and feeling budget TW earbuds out there. I highly suggest ENACFIRE E90’s. They’re only $10 more and worth every penny as far as sound and comfort go
5,Skullcandy has a reputation for good quality Ear Buds so it was no surprise that even though these were only $25 they are still worth every penny! I will be ordering two more pairs as a gift. They are small and I love the size of the case. You can't expect long hours of play because of the size but these are all around good sound and good quality!
3,Great design. Fits very well and are comfortable. Feels a little cheap. Sound is tinny and has no bass. But $30 is a good value.
5,Looks good works good
5,Im a technician and Use these every day to call clients and listen to music while I'm working. I can Hardly hear my drill if I have both buds in. Sound quality is awesome. Had it for a year and Battery lasts a whole work week and more on 1 charge if I only use it for calls.
5,I got the green ones for my son during Christmas and liked them so much I needed a pair for me. I got the red ones they have great sound to them. The bass is greatthe battery life is good to.
1,you get what you pay for I was used to the Sesh evo which imo are outstanding for the money so i was hoping for something comparable to them I was clearly mistaken these sound very very horrible and the mic as I've been told by the numerous calls I've made is the most static and boxed in sounding calls. save your money and go for the higher end ones
5,no problem connecting them to my phone and great sound quality.
5,I work in a shop. They help protect my ears around loud equipment.
5,Works great
5,I expected better but you get what you pay for
2,So if you have an iPhone just know you can only play one side at a time. Iphone does not allow you to connect to two bluetooth connections at a time and both pods are separate bluetooths. You cant configure this in accessibility because iPhone only allows special sound configurations for air pods or beats products. So pretty much these are useless and I gave this to my sister
5,They work good they could be a little louder but overall good quality for the price.
5,Great for calls. I can hear clearly & people say they can hear me fine. With the large size ear pieces they are very noise canceling. Comfortable.Music & YT come in great. I don't do a lot of music so battery life ain't no big deal to me. 3.5hr run time on a 1hr charge + extra charges in the case. Awesome. Price is great  for what you get. I love em.
5,I bought these because of the affordable price. My boyfriend snores loud enough to suck a curtain off the wall so I wear these to sleep. I lost them in my yard (fell out of my pocket) and found them 3 days later after two days of heavy rain. THEY STILL WORK! The sound is still as crisp as the day I bought them. Awesome earbuds. They weren’t kidding when they said “water resistant”!!
4,There's are such a great value I've had no problems with pairing and the sound stage is just amazing. They are cheap and the build shows that but how it is to use and overall sound quality is incredible
5,Lo uso poco. Se escucha bien pero al hablar las personas receptoras no escuchan bien mi voz.
5,I was pumped to receive these charged like instructions state. I connected only to realize the left side ear bud wouldn't work. I continue to charge all no working finally started working my phone said 100% for ear bud yet left ear bud disconnected on its own. Waste of money
5,These little earbuds pack a punch. They definitely fit in the Skull Candy lineup with the bass hits and sound quality. They come with three different sizes of cushions so they'll fit in your ears. I went running with them and they stayed put. I haven't run the full test of the battery yet so I'll have to come back for that but I believe Skull Candy when they say they'll last more than 2 hours per charge (yes the case charges them but I'm talking single charge here). The microphone sound quality is reportedly good. I haven't listened to a recording of myself but people I've talked to on video calls and regular phone calls have said they can hear me really well. I have absolutely no complaints.
5,Honestly shocked at what a deal these are. I’m a big apple fanboy and these are incredible. I purchased these after my pros battery degraded to the point they wouldn’t hold a charge. I cannot believe that these are only 25 bucks!Excellent sound quality excellent battery excellent build quality all for 25 dollars. Yes you don’t get ANC yes you don’t get wireless charging I don’t care. I’m obsessed with these
5,Se quedan en mi oreja muy buen sonido y el tamaño perfecto.
5,Perfect except that I feel like the battery runs out fast not necessarily from the actual earbuds but from the case after they charge. I am consistently surprised that I have just charged the case and it needs charging again after one or two goes.
4,I absolutely love these fit is perfect (ish) and the sound quality is pretty darn good for tiny headphones. I would like a little bit more top end but what can I ask from headphones j prefer over AirPods?
5,They where the best for what you pay for them
5,Comodos buen sonido facil de llevar.
5,My ears are small so this shape hurts my ears a bit after a long period… but the sound is clear and loud… wasn’t expecting it to be so clear… and I’m being heard clearly on the mic… the battery life with non-stop play is about 2 1/2 hrs
5,I got these because I love my gym headphones also by Skull Candy but I needed something more compact for being out in town. I love them! They connect super fast they have amazing sound quality and they never let me down. I've had them for a little over a month and I've only had to charge them once despite using them every day. I'd recommend them to anyone.
5,Love the color and ease of use
5,These are truly the best over all wireless earbuds I have ever had. Truly portable with the little lanyard and plastic loop. I have had them on my belt key chain as a shuttle bus driver for over a month now and haven't lost them or had the box open. VERY secure inside the box it snaps shut and the buds are magnetically held in for charging so they don't fall out. I will be getting another pair. Very few wireless earbuds have any way to carry except at the bottom of a bag or pocket. No built-in lanyard or hook method just a little box so easy to lose!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!
5,good quality
5,Just as expected
5,Son mejor de lo que esperaba son mis primeros auriculares (directamente al oido) inalámbricos había tenido audífonos inalámbricos pero se escuchaban peor que los alámbricos que tenía y pensaba que iba a ser igual tengo unos Sony alámbricos de 100 pesos y me parece que los superanPara los que dicen que suenan muy poco yo también me confundí pensé que era muy poco lo que se escuchaban pero investigando encontré esto:El esquema de control es el siguiente: reproducir/pausar/responder/finalizar llamada (presionar una vez) subir/bajar volumen (presionar dos veces) asistencia digital (presionar tres veces) y saltar hacia adelante/atrás (presionar largamente).Los audífonos tienen su propio audio no es el del teléfono solamente y tienes que subirlo dándole dos veces al botón derecho de forma relativamente rápida
5,Son muy ligeros los botones responden de inmediato con las gomas extra puedes elegir las que mejor acomoden a tus oídos
5,I love the the small profile size I love the fit in the ears. They Can get a little uncomfortable with extended use- however I feel that's more my anatomy at fault and not the product.The best feature in my opinion is the back-to-basics push button built into the earpiece instead of the haptic finger feedback touch that never seems to work properly in other earbud products I've tried.Another bonus as compared with the SkullCandy Indy's both earbuds can work as a solo earbud.Battery Life is Short - but that's as advertised. they're great "get me to work" earbuds.I'm not an audiophile - but skuillcandy has always consistantly sounded better in my ears than other brands on the market and these in my opinion still up there for the baseline of skullcandy's audio quality
5,La verdad estuve a punto de no comprarlos por las reviews que decían que no tenían un buen volumen. Que bueno que no les hice caso si esa gente hubiera leído las instrucciones muy probablemente se enteraría que dependiendo del sistema operativo del aparato al que lo conectes es muy probable que tengas que subirle el volumen no sólo al aparato sino también a los audífonos. El instructivo es digital adentro de la caja viene un código QR que te lleva al mismo. El único pero que les pongo es que a veces se siente cómo que se cae el auricular no se cae pero se siente cómo si pasara y es algo un poco molesto-
5,Pleasantly surprised with the quality of these right out of the box. I thought I'd need to break these in a while and eq the heck out of them. Turns out I was wrong the sound quality is just fine right out of the box. I also like how they just work - pair them once and you're good. You can pick up or put away either earbud at any time and they just do what you expect them to do no muss no fuss. Haven't tried the microphone for calls.
5,Excelentes audífonos en cuanto a calidad precio la batería de los audífonos me duran perfectamente para mi rutina de ejercicio que es de 2 horas puesto que tiene resistencia IPX4 al sudor y pequeñas gotas de lluvia la primera vez que los use como son mis primeros audífonos de este tipo (si he tenido otro audífonos Bluetooth pero son los que se ponen alrededor del cuello) entonces como dije son mis primeros audífonos en este tipo me dolió la cabeza después de usarlos 1 hora pero si tu estás acostumbrado(a) no tendrás ese problemaEn cuanto al sonido es bueno sin llegar a ser excelente los bajos uff suenan durísimos cuenta con dos botones que si tienes los audífonos puestos al querer apretar un botón te metes más el audífono y te llega a doler te recomiendo que te quites uno de los dos para apretar el botón y no lastimarte cuenta con dos micrófonos uno por audífono y suena decente si estás en la calle con mucho ruido si llega a captar eso ruidosSi van a comprar los audífonos los de que son de México y solo les sale envío gratis tomen en cuenta que les llegaría de 7 a 9 días aproximadamente en mi caso tardó una semana por qué aduanas retuvo mi paquete dos días pedí los audífonos martes miércoles ya estaba en aduanas y jueves ya había pasado el proceso aduanal y hasta el domingo en la tarde ya había salido a México y dos días después ya los tenía en mis manos
5,Wo soll ich anfangen?Mir gefällt an diesem Kopfhörer von vorne bis hinten einfach alles. Ich halte mich kurz:Die Verpackung ist fast komplett aus Pappe. Nur die earpads befinden sich in einem kleinen Plastikbeutel-umweltbewusstsein izz da.Verpackung aufgemacht das Case plus Kopfhörer kommen einem entgegen. Das Case ist aus Hartplastik aber fühlt sich echt stabil an. Rastet ein beim auf- und zumachen. Sieht echt besonders aus im Gegensatz zu anderen.Kopfhörerdesign ist schick. Finde ich gut. Kopfhörer sitzen echt sehr gut in den Ohren bei mir. Hatte schon lange nicht mehr Kopfhörer die so gut gepasst haben.Die Kopfhörer haben oldschool Knöpfe die man drücken muss. Finde ich gut. Kein stoppen der Musik lauter machen leiser machen nur weil man kurz gegen den Kopfhörer gekommen ist wie bei anderen. Nein den Knopf muss man drücken.Klangqualität ist natürlich subjektiv aber ich kann sehr selbstbewusst sagen dass meine letzten Kopfhörer nicht so gut ausbalanciert waren wie diese hier. Die kommen zu einem und klingen von Haus aus GUT. Normalerweise muss ich immer am Equalizer viele Einstellungen vornehmen. Bei diesen hier nur minimal. Höhen gut Mitten gut Bass gut. Leichte Tendenz in Richtung Bass (was ich gut finde denn ich höre meine Musik gerne bassreich). In dieser Preisklasse gibt es auf jeden Fall viel Müll was Klangqualität angeht. Diese zählen nicht dazu. Unter Berücksichtigung des Preises echt stabil.Ich wollte schon immer Skullcandy ausprobieren. Hätte ich schon früher machen sollen denn ich bin echt sehr zufrieden. Endlich mal ein Kopfhörer der mir in keinster Weise negativ aufstößt. (Bis jetzt hehe)Vielen Dank für eure Aufmerksamkeit. Ich hoffe meine etwas wirre Rezension hilft bei eurer Entscheidung im Segment des audiotechnischen Genusses.
5,Me sorprendió el sonido cuando escucho música en Spotify o YouTube se escuchan excelentemente (desde las apps). Igual con aplicaciones de vídeo como Netflix HBO etc. Se escuchan muy bien. Peeeero lo único extraño es que si los conecto a mi computadora y escucho Youtube desde la web se escucha sin bass muy feo xD y para hacer videollamadas se escuchan muy bajito. Pero desde un iPad o celular se escuchan excelente.Para hacer ejercicio me parecieron muy cómodos. Nada más hay que cuidar que no se resbalen por el sudor. Viene con 3 pares de gomitas. Elige el tamaño que te ajuste las que venían por default se me salía el audífono pero al ponerle la pequeña me quedó perfecto.
5,Ok so I actually have a review of these....I paid $30 bucks.They fit perfectly in my ears with the largest of the included ear things. Comfortable and secure.I work outside in the winter and these actually won't fall out. They also really do work as ear plugs when things get noisy.Yes..the buttons on the earbuds are stupid and useless. Just use your phone $30 bucks.... it's gonna be ok.Sound quality is actually great for the price. Skullcandy isn't a quality brand but in this case it's more than adequate. I'm happy with the podcast sounds and the heavy music. Good enough bud!These are the first earbuds I've owned because I always assumed I'd lose them right away. But these really feel like I'll have them for a while. I'm surprised at how well it works.Also it's nice that as soon as you take them out of the case they connect right away every time. 2022 is the future!For $30 you really can't go wrong. I'm really happy with these.
5,Funcionan muy bien el.nivel de volumen está perfecto lo uso para juntas dentro de las fabricas y la cancelación de ruido me permite escuchar muy bien a pesar del ruido ambiental no tiene buen indicador de batería por cuando se acaba la batería solo se apagan pero dura lo que dice en la caja el tamaño está perfecto después de un mucho tiempo de traerlos puestos son un poco incómodos funcionan muy bien
5,Ces écouteurs sont pour moi idéale pour une marche une séance de vélo ou pour des déplacements au travail de 30-60 min. Dans ce contexte la durée de vie de la batterie est plus que suffisante et pourrait durer facilement la semaine.Ces écouteurs ne sont pas pour écouter en continue pendant 3-4h.Ils tiennent très bien dans les oreilles et c'est vraiment super que lorsqu'on les sort de leur boitier elles s'allument automatiquement et se connecte déjà prête à être utilisée.Le son est très bon et semble bien bloquer le bruit ambiant également.La qualité du micro est OK.
5,I love the orange colour they came in they are awesome for the price I paid great valueNice compact case although the chord it came with to charge the case is actually quite funny because there’s no such thing to plug it into.Def just a regular android chord is fine to charge it same port.
5,Los audífonos como tal son grandiosos se ajustan bien al oído y son muy discretos emparejan perfectamente y sincronizan casi al instante. Además funcionan independiente el izquierdo del derecho por lo que no me estás usar ambos.Su unico problema son la batería dura menos de lo que yo necesito pero cumple lo que prometeTuve la mala fortuna de que me llegara el un millonésimo en malas condiciones pero la devolución y reembolso fueron rápidos.
5,I bought this as a gift for my mothers birthday and she thought they were perfect the color is adorable and they are easy to sync to your phone. I recommend these very much they work well and they are really not expensive unlike other brands.
5,Llevo mucho tiempo escogiendo a esta marca y e tenido casi todos sus auriculares cómodo ergonómico eso si facil de perder la batería no es la gran cosa dura lo necesario si tienes una App tipo Dolby Atmos o tu celular cuenta con esa tecnología será de lo mejor experiencia en audio obviamente si sabes controlar el programa :D 👌🏻
5,La verdad  los audífonos me sorprendieron la primera vez que me los probé tienen un sonido muy nítido y se siente la calidad al ponértelos por el precio que pagas esta de 10 puedes usarlos para toda ocasión y no se resbalan tan fácilmente te viene con gomas para que tus oídos se acomoden respecto la la batería les dura lo que acuerda el producto un maximo de 12 horas el estuche y cada uno 3 hr yo lo e llegado a usar como por 3 a 4 días sin cargarlos solo manteniéndolos más o menos
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Muy buena calidad en el audiosencillo de sincronizar y muy buen audio para manos libres la única desventaja es que son incómodos al principio tarada en acostumbrarse y en algunas ocasiones se sienten flojos y se caen pero con el tiempo se ajusta.
5,El color está increíble y la verdad por el precio son una gran opción. Yo los uso para hacer ejercicio y hasta ahora no he tenido problemas las cargas duran mucho y se sienten duraderos.
5,I just got these today and I love them ! The case is a little hard to open but it’s such a small and light case I love it. They fit perfectly in my ears. They have great sound quality definitely recommend. The headphone controls are hard to use but for me I don’t mind taking out my phone to pause my music. They go so loud and they don’t hurt my ears at full volume like other ones
5,For tiny earbuds with a tinier case these are pretty solid! Great to have as emergency earbuds in your car backpack work desk etc.
5,Aunque no encuentro la manera concreta para ponérmelos y ajustarlos todo va perfecto la duración de la batería la cancelación de ruido exterior es muy buena y la calidad de sonido también característico de la marca. Excelente compra! Lo volvería a comprar para regalarlos.
5,Best wireless earbuds out there considering price/quality. Compact design and pack a powerful performance. Only set back is charger cable is very short and is a universal generic USB cable...no plug for wall outlet.
5,Perfectos para rutinas de ejercicio tengo canales auditivos pequeños y tuve que conseguir gomas más pequeñas que las “pequeñas” que venían incluidas como extras.Potencia enorme para ser tan pequeños.
5,Me los regalo mi esposo y son real mente increíbles! Se escuchan muy bien y alcanza larga distancia para seguir hablando por teléfono.
5,Muy buen sonido y fácil de emparejar con el Bluetooth ideales para corredores y llevar tu música a dónde quieras.
5,Ive been using these for about a month and they’re doing great. There is just two things that I need to mention when you increase the volume to the highest other people can hear it. The second thing is that i ordered it in true black but I received them in grey. I believe overall it’s a very good product and I will keep using it.
5,awesome pair  quality is good for the price cant beat it . Battery life is very good was surprised how  good they were .
5,These earbuds BUMP! Totally my favorite buds I own! Thank you Skullcandy! Mini and Mighty
5,Price to performance on these earbuds are outstanding. Was hesitant to switch to bluetooth earbuds but was willing to try these out for the price. Only downfall is these buds don't connect to skullcandy's app for more customizable audio settings. All in all totally worth it.
5,Me encanta llevo mas de 6 meses usándolo se me han caído y son muy resistentes funcionan muy bien la batería rinde bastante bien. Precio calidad excelente
5,These are great little earbuds. They stay in your ears which is a huge thumbs up. So many others do not even the very expensive ones. Sound is great for the price. I would recommend these over JBL'S
5,Si tienes orejas grandes son excelentes y pese a no tener cancelación de ruido activa la pasiva es muy buena.La duración de la batería es aproximadamente de 3 horas sin cargar pero aún así muchos audífonos en el mercado son así.Muy recomendados
5,Muy buena calidad de sonido buena duración de la batería en general recibes más de lo que pagas.
5,Lindos cómodos fáciles de usar y con excelente sonido. Y por el precio fue una buena compra.
5,Fueron para regalo llegaron antes del periodo señalado y de primera impresión  le gustaron a la persona que recibió el regalo. No puedo añadir más detalles.
5,Happy with these headphones. They sound good and battery lasts long. I even accidentally washed them with my clothes and they still work! Only complaint is they don't fit well or stay in my ears
5,Aunque no sé amoldaron a mi oreja su calidad es muy buena tanto en material como en audio
5,No te aislan completamente del ruido pero sí te permiten olvidarte de lo demás y su sonido es muy ligero sin incomodidades. Soy Aspie y me ayudan a relajarme aunque son de mi esposo realmente.
5,Básicamente solo los utilizo para ver videos de Youtube en las noches para no molestar a mi familia cuando estan viendo la tele asi que me sirvieron a la perfección 😃👌Lo recomiendo ampliamente
5,Bought for my teen son. He enjoys them. For the price they are good.
5,A mi en lo personal me ha funcionado bastante bien el precio fue justo y me funciona sin problemas la batería dura bastante el sonido es bueno no tiene problemas de conexión yo lo recomiendo tienen buen tamaño.
5,La verdad dudaba mucho pero salieron muy buenos el material es bueno y creo el mejor en calidad precio. Si buscas unos con buen bajo la verdad buscaría otro modelo pero sin duda que fueran Skullcandy
5,El sonido es nítido la conexión también es buena relación precio calidad para hacer ejercicio no los recomiendo mucho ya que en uno que otro ejercicio se te pueden caer para correr no hay problema.
5,Me gustaron por lo practico que son y como se acomodan perfectamente a mis necesidades (soy estudiante) lo malo es que me los robaron así que si lees esto persona que me los robo ojala se te pierdan
5,I love that you can use one side at a time or both. I love the sound quality. I love how they fit. I love how long the battery lasts.
5,BUEN PRODUCTO
5,Son cómodos pequeños con gran sonido y perfectos para el día a día
5,Muy practico y compatible con la mayoría de los dispositivos.
5,Muy buen material del producto y excelente calidad de audio aíslan muy bien el sonido exterior muy cómodos para usarse durante horas y tiempo de batería dura bastante
5,Son buenos
5,Muy prácticos para usarse. No incluyen un sensor de batería sin embargo algunos dispositivos muestran la cantidad de carga. Recomendables.
5,I've had these for months by now and these are so worth it I love them and the fact that I can hang it from my keys means I never loose them.
5,If your looking to use them for 3.5 hours at a time these are great for the price.
5,Por el precio son excelentes se escuchan bastante bien y son cómodos solo que escojas bien los taponcitos que te quedan
5,Have been using them daily for the past two weeks haven't had a hitch connect instantly once turning on
5,Por el precio de los audífonos cuenta con muy buena calidad de audio están un poco grandes pero se ajustan bien.
5,La verdad me impresionó que a la hora de correr no se mueven en absoluto
5,Work really great and easy to use
5,Yo los.comprw hace un año y aún jalan cómo al inició ojalá no suban de precio. Dale compar sin miedo. Saludos
5,Calidad garantizada y excelente precio
5,Super rapport qualité prix
5,Gente por accidente metí estos audífonos a la lavadora y funcionan como si no hubiera pasado nada.
5,Se escuchan bastante bien para el precio son cómodos y pequeños fáciles de transportar
5,Es muy cómodo y práctico fácil de llevar
5,Me gustó mucho el producto lo adquirí porque me los recomendaron y comprobé que son excelentes.
5,Muy bien producto muy buena calidad múltiples funciones muy cómodos y no pesan recomendados
5,Más de 1 mes de uso y son una maravilla no tengo ningúna queja muy recomendables.
5,Muy buena calidad sonido perfectamente estable y balanceado…sin duda una gran opción. 10/10👌🏻❤️
5,n/a
4,Son buenos audifonos TW (True Wireless) se escuchan realmente bien las almoadhillas que uso son las M (Medianas) aislan bien el sonido exterior y mantienen los bajos en un punto donde no saturan los medios y agudos.La bateria no la he agotado completamente despues de usarlos 3 horas le quedaba 40% de bateria a los 2 audifonos asi que creo que si llega a las 3 horas y media de uso (con un volumen medio pero suficiente para mi)He leido otros comentarios que el volumen es bajo pero en mi caso con mi Google Pixel 3a es caso contrario con un 20% de volumen ya se escuchan muy bien creo que pasando de la mitad del volumen ya es fuerte para mi.El microfono para las llamadas es decente si me escuchan claro pero de haber mucho ruido si se puede filtrar el sonido de alrededor. En una habitación en silencio no debe haber problema te escucharán bien.No he tenido ningun problema de desconexión ambos se emparejan rapido entre si y a mi telefono.Los controles pueden ser algo confusos al principio pero te acostumbras rápido.No le pongo 5 estrellas porque al menos a mi me llegó sin las almohadillas S(pequeñas) y L(grandes). Solo traia las Medianas que en mi caso son las que siempre uso así que decidi quedarmelos. Lo curioso es que la caja venia sellada quzá fue un error de embalaje en la fabrica no poner las otras almohadillas.Dejando ese detalle creo que por su precio son una excelente compra si no quieres gastar mucho pero buscas calidad.
5,Buen producto. Si no quieres gastar mucho y quieres algo de buena calidad súper recomendable.
5,me gusta mucho que al guardar los audífonos se apagan.súper bien eh!
5,Muy buenos audífonos para correr no tan cómodos pues se llegan a resbalar del oído
5,Son la onda!
5,Costo del producto bueno
5,Good bang for the buck!

3,Soo I bought these to replace my Airpods (Gen 2) that just recently started breaking down.Pros:- They sound good! For the price and being wireless amazing quality!- They’re small! Very nice form factor.- They look nice while in my ears. They don’t stick out like a sore thumb stem is smaller and the black color definitely helps maintain their low profile- Charging case is a great size. Easy carry- They connect fairly quick setup was easy and switching between 1 or 2 earbuds is very seamless!- Great earphone magnets in charging caseCons:- Micro USB- The buttons are just… horrible. If you’re buying these just remember you’ll likely have to use your phone for everything. Play pause skip etc. because the buttons are just down right trash. They’re not touch sensitive ofc so the earphones dig into your ears so much cause of the pressure it takes to press the buttons. Also they can only be used when BOTH earbuds are in use. Otherwise only the play/pause functionality works.- No fast charge of any sort- Case lid is nice and has a nice magnet but I don’t get why they have this “snap” mechanism in place to close it shut properly via force makes it pretty hard to open.- The earbuds are kinda annoying to take out of the case cause of the design- The part that sits inside your ear is a little big. So long use = ear fatigue. They hurt hahaSide comments:- Mic is alright. Nothing crazy good but not the worst. Quick calls indoors but not something I would use often. Definitely can’t be used outdoors.- Case has two solid holes when the headphones are in use. Just something to keep in mind- Small case = small battery but that’s dependent on each persons use case.——Overall for the price I like them and would recommend them IF you have ears for them cause otherwise they hurt. It seems like most of the drawbacks are because of design choice rather than price. If you’re someone who likes on earbuds control definitely avoid these. Skullcandy made a good pair and I cant wait for a gen 2 of these if they decide to make one. Will be returning these most likely cause they are not for my ears.

4,Je m'en sers à la salle de sport je les trouve pratiques. Toutefois l'un des deux à tendance à tomber. Plusieurs adaptateurs sont fournis pour trouver la taille de son oreille ça n'a malheureusement pas suffi à régler mon problème. Cependant je connais quelqu'un qui n'a pas ce souci.La qualité de la musique est bonne. Rapport qualité/prix satisfaisant.Globalement je recommande.
4,The headphones are pretty solid overall good fit and look really good sound. But the control buttons are not usable. You have to press them VERY hard basically pressing it far into your ear. And due to the tiny design of the headphones you can't really grab the stem and do it at the same time. Play/pause is really tough because of this and a double press for volume up/down is something I'd NEVER consider attempting
5,En mi opinion unos de los mejores audifonos calidad-precio que he comprado. Muy buen sonido y bastante comodos y ligeros. En cuanto a la caja bastante pequeña y comoda de llevar en un bolsillo. Lo unico que no me gusta de la caja es que queda con dos agujeros cuando sacas los audifonos. Dos agujeros por donde podria entrar polvo agua etc. Aunque el diseño es bonito lo veo peligroso. Pero de resto muy buenos audifonos entran perfecto en mi oido y nada que se caen.
2,I got these earbuds to replace my taotronics that die due to water damage. The sound quality is acceptable they don’t sound as good as headphones but they’re good enough for daily activities and workouts.Unfortunately the connection issues are too big to overlook. After a couple weeks with these I can definitely say I’m never using them again. They randomly skip bits of a song. The left earbud disconnects sporadically. And what’s even worse for some reason one of the earbuds will suddenly lose volume.I tried to ignore this for a while. But the frustration of having one earbud blasting music while the other is whisper quiet for minutes (on one occasion hours) at a time was too much for me.The last thing you should probably know about these earbuds is that they don’t pair automatically when taken out of the case not do they disconnect when put back in. You must manually connect them and disconnect them every time you want to use them (I’m using an Iphone XR).So bottom line if you don’t mind your earbuds disconnecting skipping bits of tracks and playing sound at different volumes these are excellent for the price.Don’t get fooled by the skullcandy brand however. These are about as good (or worse) as any pair of TW chinese earbuds in their price range.
3,Got these yesterday and plugged them in as soon as they came that was around 2pm until lugged them at 11:30pm. i started work at midnight by 2 am am they were already powering off. Dead.. I will use a different plug today to see if maybe I have a faulty outlet and if all goes well tonight at work and they stay useable for my shift I will update this review to a more positive one. They look great fit great noise cancelling as they claim but the battery.. no good :(Update on my review. Still not good... charged the ear buds in a different outlet green light when i got up for work so yea they were charged. Start work at 10pm and by 12:40am they were shutting down. Not a good purchase at all. My cheap back ups work for 3 or 4 days without needing a charge as do all my other ear buds. These do not compare and the price is far to high for something that might only work 3 to 4 hours.. i do not recommend waisting your money on these.
3,Les comparto mi experiencia con estos exelentes audífonos que la verdad es que me encantan son cómodos y muy prácticos y la calidad de audio es decente.Pero hasta ahí ya tengo aproximadamente 3 semanas con ellos y la verdad tiene muchas cosas negativas como positivas1. Positivo: prácticos por qué no son abultados y caben donde sea2.Negativo: La batería no tarda casi nada (después de 2 horas a lo mucho 2 y media)3.positivo: son muy prácticos (pensados para traerlos de llavero en mi opinión es muy genial)4. Negativo: después de usarlos por dos horas seguidas al final te termina doliendo la partedel oído dónde se sostiene el audífono.5. Negativo el diseño al final de cuentas termina afectando el botón de contestar/ colgar/ play/ pause ( ya que al traerlo puesto y al presionarlo se siente como se sume asta adentro del oído y en lo particular es desagradable.6. Positivo carga rápido7. Negativo es la entrada vieja de mini USB y no es que me moleste sino que mi teléfono es USB C y me obliga cargarlo con el cable original y no con el mismo de mi teléfono. Para mí punto de vista es negativo.En conclusión son buenos pero la neta no me sorprendieron como los seh Evo que ya compré también.
5,These earbuds are great for the money. They sound good and have a decent battery life. Wore these for a 2.5 hour flight with no comfort issues. I think people need to experiment with the different sized grommets to find the comfiest size. Obviously they aren't going to be as good as airpods or the Samsung equivalent but for the price they are a great entry level product
3,Have only had these for a day thus far purchased from Warehouse salePros: nice look good price sounds good stays put feel comfortable paired easily (right out of the box) comes with 3 different sizes of ear piecesCons: convoluted operating instructions for different functions hard to remember what side does what how many taps or how long to hold. Have to carry instructions with me while I’m getting used to them.  Do urself a solid n Make sure your well rested and adequately caffeinated before attempting.
4,Decent overall but lacking the bass the wired skullcandy possess
4,Los cogí por comodidad para ir escuchando música en cualquier momento sin cables.Son muy cómodos y no pesan además la bateriy dura bastante.Lo que es mejorable es el sonido. Necesito subir mucho el volumen para escucharlo bien y la calidad no es la mejor.Por el precio que tiene no se puede pedir más.
4,PROS:-Son super compactos y te los puedes llevar en cualquier bolsillo sin ningun problema. (Dejo comparativa del tamaño entre los Dime y los Sesh)-Precio muy accesible.-Tienen una calidad de sonido muy buena para el precio que tienen.-Muy comodos hasta sientes que no llevas nada en el oido y sientes que no se te caen.CONTRAS:-Entrada micro-usb.-La estacion de carga se tarda mucho.-El cargador es ridiculamente pequeño.-Puede costarte abrir la cajita.OPINION PERSONAL Y CONCLUSION:Este modelo me ha dejado un buen sabor de boca a pesar de sus defectos ya que por el precio que ofrece estan muy bien la calidad de audio la comodidad lo compacto y tienen una duracion decente de bateria se me hacen muy buenos para un precio de 470 MXN (los compre en oferta).Si los quieres usar para un uso casual estos earbuds son una buena opcion pero si tambien las quieres para hacer ejercisio tambien son buenos ya que cuando salia a correr con estos audifonos no se me caian aunque eso si si hace movimientos bruscos si se te caen asi que tomen en cuenta eso.Asi que en conclusion: Si valen la pena comprarlos son buenos earbuds aunque recomiendo mas que los compren cuando esten en oferta.Puntuacion final: 8/10
4,The sound quality is pretty good and battery life is very good.  My only negative is that they need to be fully inserted into your ear canal and ear lobe otherwise they have a tendency to fall out.  I personally find that the circular part starts to become uncomfortable on my ear after extended use like watching a movie.  Having said that I think they are OK value for money.
4,Se conecta rapido al  bluetooth del celular no es tipo esclavo pues puedes utilizar cualquiera y guardar el otro.Nunca tuve fallas en la desconexion es muy eficiente.Son comodos algunas veces.Son portátilesLa pila le dura unas 2 horas.Son de boton asi que cuándo intentes usarlo te presionas la oreja y es incómodo ahí.El sonido en lo personal es muy malo por el costo de 450 a 500 pagaria maximo 200 (peso mexicano).Se sienten revueltos los sonidos.Yo los devolví  porque no se me hizo justo 450 pesos mexicanos por estos audifonos los considero caros por tipo de sonido que dan la marca es buena pero estos audifonos dejan mucho a desear.
4,Para lo que me costaron es una buena compra.No soy alguien super exigente con audífonos y la verdad se escuchan muy bien para su costo.La batería dura lo suficiente y algo que me gusto mucho es su tamaño.La cancelación de ruido es aceptable.El único pero que les pongo es en la comodidad. Después de cierto tiempo comienza a molestar el oído (sin llegar a ser algo excesivo). Además de que en algunas ocasiones sientes que el audífono se va a salir de tu oído y suele ser algo molesto.Le doy 4 de 5 estrellas por eso. Pero en términos generales estoy mas que satisfecho con la compra.
3,Pros :1 Comes with Nice funky colours and good looking2 Nice sound quality and noice cancellation3 Ok for this priceCons :1 Very bad quality bass2 case quality and design is not good the case doesn't close automatically and you have to click it to close it.3 Comes with macro usb port and not type c port.So....overall I will give it 3.6 stars but if you can increase your budget around 200 rupees more you can go for OnePlus Nord earbuds which are WAY more better than this.
4,I love it they feel really comfortable in my ears the noise cancellation is pretty decent they sound great too.It's been a month of using so far it's holding up nicely.Sometimes they can fall out during random activities but otherwise they do pretty good with exercise and movements. I would just be careful and/or avoid wearing if I'm on a bike or bending over in front of a drain or something where it can get dropped.They work pretty amazing for the price point!
4,Tengo varios puntos positivos y negativos:Positivos:- Tienen muy buen sonido.- Tienen un volumen muy fuerte y es lo que buscaba.- Aíslan muy bien el sonido exterior.- Son prácticos y cómodos de llevar en un bolso o mochila.Negativos:- Son algo incómodos y después de un rato de usarse cansan los oídos- La batería les dura muy poco máximo 2 horas.- El botón no es práctico ya que al querer presionarlo también se empuja el auricular en en el oído y duele.-La entrada es micro USB y creí que ya no se usaba.
4,Están súper. El precio es muy accesible la calidad del sonido es muy buena pero yo soy de orejas pequeñas y se me caen realizando pesas se caen ocasionalmente pero si me muevo mucho se me caen con cada movimiento. Los compré para hacer ejercicio pero no lograron su cometido aunque si me funcionan por ejemplo para trabajar en escritorio. Aíslan un poco el ruido.
4,Los materiales son decentes y son agradables al contacto con el oído solo que en ocasiones se llega a desfasar uno de otro pero se arregla en el mismo momento.El sonido es bueno ya que tiene buenos bajos y para el deporte están muy bien aguantan salpicaduras así que no habrá problemas con el sudor y aíslan bien el ruido.Tal vez sea solo yo pero hay ocasiones en las que me quedan perfecto con las gomas que tiene pero en ocasiones se las tengo que cambiar ya que siento que se salen.Pero en general son una muy buena compra y una excelente experiencia a un buen precio
4,i like this skullcandy earbuds cause the buttons are not sensitive compare to the other ones the only hindsight is the case cause when you take out the buds the case will be open on top and the dust might go inside but all in all its good for the price and its handy like a keychain
3,Etos audífonos a decir verdad no se oyen mal la batería dura unas 3 horas y en el estuche posiblemente cumplen con el complemento de tiempo total de carga son muy ligeros sin embargo son incómodos después de una hora no se sostienen bien sí es que corres o caminas menos en caso de que mastiques ya que el movimiento natillas los va expulsando del oído. Por lo menos en mi caso así lo es tengo otros audífonos y no sucede eso.Como algo práctico puedes usar solo uno sin ocupar encender el otro tiene un botón en cada uno para pausar reproducir adelantar o atrasar el track sin embargo al momento de presionar debes hacerlo hasta que haga click cuando otros responden solo al tocarlo.Los recomiendo si no deseas invertir más de $500 en unos audífonos pequeños contra agua e inalámbricos con un sonido cumplidor.
4,Para una oreja pequeña están un poquito grandes pero es cosa de acostumbrarse a usarlos.No tiene controles touch si no que es un botón el cual cuando quieres utilizarlo hay que enterrarse el audífono en el oído o como tal quitarlo y cambiarleEl estuche es de buen material y tiene un muy buen tamaño puede pasar desapercibido facilmente.
4,Son cómodos para su uso prolongado la duración de la batería es bastante razonable y el tamaño del Case es muy práctico. El único gran defecto con el cual me encontré es la conectividad entre ambos auriculares. Al encenderlos es frecuente que solo uno del par reproduce la música lo extraño es que el otro auricular sigue teniendo sus funciones de control pero no sé escucha
4,La calidad de sonido es muy fiel y es muy cómoda para el oído se ajusta muy bien y tiene una duración adecuada lo único que es un poco incómodo es el control de los audífonos para encender/apagar cambiar de canción play/pausa; tengo que sacar el audífono para oprimir los botones y ejecute la función. Fuera de eso es excelente
4,A few weeks into ownership and I have no complaints.Bluetooth connection consistently quick.Fit good in my ears.In case Charging no problemLow and loud sound great - no distortion!
4,Don't last long. From a full charge they last a little over 3 hrs listening at a low level. Other than that they're decent. Sounds good. Decent quality for what you pay for. Just wish they lasted a little longer.
3,For 30ish bucks these are pretty good. Sound quality is solid but not great. Noticed I was putting the volume up louder than what I’d normally use. The sound is pretty balanced still sounds good with using one earbud in at a time.The issues are with the fit. I have pretty small ears and read one review that said if your ears aren’t a specific shape they’ll feel weird. That reviewer hit the nail on the head. The flat shape sticks out at an odd angle so they don’t fit snug and I’d be leery of using them while exercising. I have yet to test them out with speaking but I’m not holding my breath.
4,El case es bueno audífonos cómodos duración de batería buena el sonido no es el mejor más enfocado en graves pero es bueno para ver videos y escuchar música para personas comunes
4,It didn't even last for 5 monthsIt is good for only few months better buy another product then this.
4,El volumen no es completamente lineal lo subes un poco y en un momento sube bastante con una sola vez que presiones el botón y la otra cosa que no me gusta es que los botones son eso botones y al presionarlos hundes el audífono en tu oído.
3,These are not hifi sound delivery systems. I got them to replace the generic wired ear buds that came with an old Samsung phone and they certainly sound better than that. They do not have true sound cancelling so do not expect that and you will not be disappointed. My biggest issue is what other have commented on: they are not ergonomically designed. They fit one ear fine (with the largest ear attachment size fitted) but the other ear will not seat correctly or stay in place so they would be atrocious for exercise were that why I bought them. Fortunately I only got them for chill music/podcasts and for walking to and from parking and they live up to that.
3,Sonaba bastante bien solo que cuando estaba en el gimnasio se tendian a caer es más para caminar u hacer otras actividades.Me vino mal por ello tuve que devolverlo pues empezo a escucharse mal sin embargo creo que es cuestion de suerte.La duracion de las baterias era muy buena y pues al ser chiquito podias llevar la caja a todas partes
4,Es un buen producto se conecta rápido y la batería a mi me dura entre 4-5 días (depende del uso que le des) el único pero es que la calidad no se siente muy buena y en lo personal se le suelen salir con facilidad los auriculares.
4,For a pair of cheaper earbuds they work great. There’s no noise cancellation and the battery does deplete quickly but the sound is really good and they work really well for phone calls!
4,Estan bien por el precio pero tiene ciertas cosas negativas no dura mucho la carga de los audífonos 3 hrs maximo de uso continuo el botón del audífono es muy incómodo y difícil de usar y la carga tarda mucho no es tipo C.
4,Il prodotto è buono e valido l'unica cosa che ho notato è che il suono non mi sembra altissimo avevo già dei vecchi auricolari (con filo) dello stesso marchio mi sembravano più potenti. La batteria non dura quanto indicato ma circa la metà. Forse a quel prezzo mi sarei aspettato qualcosa di più pero posso ritenermi soddisfatto.
3,Cuando me llegaron el botón del auricular izquierdo no servía no hacía ninguna función por suerte la garantía me la hicieron válida en Skullcandy.Por lo demás están bastante bien calidad de audio descente los materiales se sienten bastante resistentes son muy pequeños y portátiles (yo los uso para llevarlos a la escuela) la batería si le dura las 3.5 horas que anuncian el único inconveniente sería que a las horas de uso se hacen algo incómodos.
4,Los compre para un huawei y se escuchan muy bajo. Por casualidad los probé en un iphone y se escuchan mucho mejor luego en un moto G60 y también se escuchan mas que aceptable.
3,These headphones were great for the first few months. After month 6 one had a battery issue and does not charge. The rubber ear comfort piece on one side broke after about 8 months. There is no extra piece in the package that fits properly. Would not buy these again.
4,Buenos medios y agudos bastante balanceados pero los bajos no tienen tanta potencia y se quedan un poquito cortos. Recomendaría más la versión siguiente a esta.
3,I bought these cause I have always used wired skull candy headphones. I can’t walk more than a few feet from my connected device before it cuts out and the touch controls don’t work at all. Otherwise they are not bad
3,Son económicos pero lo malo es que la batería dura poco (cerca de hora y media) si se usan continuamente. Cuando tienen el 100% de batería suenan perfecto pero cuando tienen un 40% el audio es de mala calidad y se descargan rápido (en 10 min).Al parecer son de buena accesibilidad pero mala calidad tratándose de una marca reconocida he tenido audífonos de la misma marca pero alámbricos y nunca tuve ningún problema en este caso estos earbuds no cumplen con las espectativas
4,Los uso para el gimnasio son buenos aunque les falta un poco de volumen tiene buenos bajos. Mi oreja es pequeña y al principio me lastimaba un poco pero me acostumbré.
4,Son muy bueno pero las instrucciones no específican que tanto tiempo se debe de cargar la caja para que esté al 100 y el botón para realizar los comandos es único imperceptible
4,No dejan ejercitarse bien se caen continuamente su sonido no es muy bueno una decepción.
3,El diseño la claridad de audio y el volumen es bueno aunque los siento ligeramente incómodos al oído aún con sus gomas más pequeñas he notado que la pila le dura muy poco. Creo que hay mejores opciones.
3,Incomodos de usar no se ajustan ya he tenido que atraparlos de varias caídas siente que en cualquier momento se te van a caer tienes que ponerlo con mucha presión para que queden muy justos y aun así en cuanto menos lo esperas ya están por caerse además de que incomodan. No los compraría ni recomiendo comprarlos.
4,Esta bien pero el sonido no es tan bueno como otros skullcandy que tengo
4,No me gusto que los botones para adelantar o subir volumen no se presta para un buen manejo ya que teniéndolo posicionado en la oreja no es nada cómodo realizar las diferentes funciones
4,Esta bien por el precio el sonido no me parece de muy buena calidad. En mi caso como mis orejas son pequeñas me molestan un poco.
3,These are quite practical. Lightweight easy to use and pair. However they are too quiet for my taste. Also they glitch the connection very y easily both with Android and IPhone so not the best of the best. If you are short on budget they are ok. If you can afford a bit more then don't get these.
2,My biggest beef is the control button.  You have to press it so hard that it actually hurts!  The buds don't stay put in my ears even though I tried all three ear gel sizes.  No bass unless I held them in with my fingers.  They're a pain to take out of the charger and someone else reviewed that the charging case has a magnet for closing.  Pointless.  Extremely uncomfortable for me.  Huge disappointment and I'll be returning them.
4,Son cómodos buen audio buen precio excelente marca y color.Recomedado
4,Pues buen sonido solo el detalle es la duración de la batería pero por el precio está bien
2,I have used several different sets of Bluetooth headphones off Amazon. This is the first set I bought with a reputable brand name it is also the poorest performing in every category. The button ergonomics aren't great they place pressure on your earlobes when you try to use them. Sound quality isn't great but I believe it's because the noise cancelation isn't fantastic and that creates extra air in the music and eliminates any added bass. Headphone battery is okay but the small case will only charge them about 1.5 times before you have to recharge it. I purchased two sets for my fiance and I my ears are big and they fit okay but hers are small and they don't fit at all. The one positive I can give on these is Bluetooth connectivity is fast and responsive.
3,Les écouteurs tiennent moins bien dans les oreillesSûrement trop lourds ou gros pour l’entrée du canal de l’oreille
4,These ear buds are worth the 30 bucks works excellent zero complaints
3,Tiene una calidad de audio excelente y su control de audio es perfecto su duración si es un punto gris y sobre todo que he tenido problemas con la terminal de carga del audífono derecho no lo detecta y no lo carga o en momentos si y otros no
4,Lo único que le faltó es algo que te indique la batería que tiene la caja en donde se guardan los audífonos
2,These are cheap headphones literally and figuratively. When it comes to Bluetooth there are few in this price range and they beat out most but they are heavily flawed.-The battery drains when you have one headphone in the other sitting in the case is playing music.-They do not stay in your ears well at all tried every form of size just walking can cause them to fall out forget using them working out running etc.-They disconnect constantly your battery will be fully charged and all of the sudden you just hear nothing your phone gets confused as you go to unpause the music because the phone still thinks they're connected. You then have to manually shut off the headphone disconnect them and reconnect them.If you're looking for a Bluetooth headphone spend a little extra if not buy a decent pair of wired headphones for the same price as these better sound quality won't have to worry about any of the issues listed just have to deal with a pesky wire.
2,I bought these to pair with my fire stick. They do that fast and easy. When in use it cuts the sound to the television so no one else can watch and listen to the tv. (unless i'm not doing it right) As an older person with hand issues the volume control was impossible to adjust. The volume control at max was still not loud enough to hear the tv show conversations. The low price was attractive but if they don't do the job I need now they are just a waste of my money. Sorry that's my personal opinion.
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The microphone is not so good as there are gaps in voice during phone calls. Does not fit perfectly on ears and falls often. Battery is not as advertised. Great for listening to music only.
4,Only just purchased but seems to be Excellent value for money.
4,Solo que en ciertos dispositivos no tiene el sonido tan fuerte.
4,Se salen mucho de las orejas todo lo demás está muy bien
4,I love these ear buds
5,I wasn't expecting much from such cheap earbuds but I am so far at least very happy indeed. I wanted easy to wear easy to charge functional earbuds which didn't cost too much. All those criteria were satisfied. I'm sure they are not brilliant for music but to my ear they are plenty good enough. A happy purchaser.
4,Me gustaron más o menos creo q sí están prop🧸🫒😎😱
4,Tiene buen sonido y excelente precio
3,Esta buenos buen sonido pero en 2 meses uno casi no se escucha como que bajo el sonido
3,I charged them as soon as they arrived and one first use the battery was low after a 10 minute phone call. Not impressed
3,Los audífonos eran buenos en calidad-precio pero los míos tuvieron problemas con el Bluetooth y se desconectaban de la nada por eso tuve que pedir devolución.
4,Bien por precio
4,Pretty good
2,Never cranked them to max volumekepted them clean never overcharged them.After two months right ear bud lost half it's quality sound by over half i have it cranked now can barely hear anything out of it.Battery lasts like 2 hours rather than 3-4
3,Los uso para al momento de ejercitarme pero no los puedo usar mucho tiempo me lastiman las orejas incómodos. La batería también no dura mucho.
3,left side of the earpuds is not working..only right side…i need both earpods are working..can u send me a replacement of this item that i buy?
2,Decent quality for the price but i dropped one earbud in snow and it would only play at half the volume of the other one and the quality had been distorted. Also theses ear buds will turn on sometimes while in the the charging case which can be annoying. My new earbuds have neither of these problems and cost me only ten bucks more.
4,
3,Es un poco incomodo  e lastima las orejas   seria bueno que incluiran unas orejeras comodas (almohadillas)
2,Todo iba bien se escuchaba bien eran cómodos pero lo malo que a las semana se fueron descomponiendo el centro de carga del estuche a los audífonos dejo de cargar
2,They didn't fit in my ears and were also falling. That would be good cheap earbuds if they did stay in place.
3,Oversensitive touch button. It activates pause or dial when adjusting position in the ear
3,Sounds great for first few months the poof the one goes quiet and the other is fine
2,No sé si es sólo mi equipo o es en general.El audífono derecho se queda prendido en rojo (como si se estuviera cargando dentro del estuche) y no puedo prenderlo. ¿Alguien tiene el mismo problema? ¿Alguna idea de cómo resolverlo?
1,“”Bought for my dad for Christmas and so disappointed.. he had them fully charged and had them in for 15 minutes and they died.. terrible terrible battery life.. beyond disappointed..””UPDATE!!Be sure to remove the white sticker on each earbud. It blocks the charge while in the package. 🤦‍♀️ Figured that out today. So far since removing the sticker they have been working great. Haven’t died yet. .
3,Produit correct sans plus
3,No me gusta que aveces se desconfiguran
3,Tienen fallo
2,Advertises 3.5hrs of use however I had fully charged them and after an hour and a half of use i was getting low battery warning .
4,Okay for the price.  Sometimes the sound is not loud enough in noisy environment
2,Very uncomfortable in the ear.
4,they function as I expected for the price although they're ever so slightly louder in one ear than the other (I swapped them over to make sure it wasn't my hearing). if you're finding they don't say in super well because of the shape of you ear try putting them in the opposite ears upside down I find they fit better that way. sound quality is as expected for the price range
2,Son incómodos la batería dura poco no los reconoce de repente el Bluetooth
2,Unreliable
1,Updating review to one star. The life of these just gets worse and worse. Don’t waste your money. I am now lucky to get 2.5 hours once fully charged. I also have the mpow Bluetooth earbuds off Amazon  that have a wire between ear buds and they last 3x as long. I also like the wire so that I can pull out a bud from one ear without stowing it.  Overall I like the fit and design of these buds. The product description says they have a 12 hour battery life which is just not true. I get about 4 hours max of charged time before battery low indication starts.
1,Noise cancellation very bad but it’s not an issue for me they are uncomfortable to wear the sound is bad even for audio books I would t dare listening to music with those. And to top it off they skip out of your ear easily so there’s no way I would go out jogging with them.Only plus side is the battery last as long as was advertised. Can’t wait to loose them to buy new ones
5,Als Besitzer von Overear-Kopfhörern der "gehobenen" Klasse (u.a. AKG K-500) war das Klang-Ergebnis zunächst enttäuschend!!!  Klang mit den serienmäßigen Stöpseln grottenschlecht.Erst nach Verwendung von Silikon-Ohrstöpseln wurde die ERWARTETE Klang-Qualität erreicht! Für alle Käufer des "Skullcandy Dime True Wireless In-Ear Kopfhörers" diese EMPFEHLUNG:
1,The first week was great the buds would last a few days before needing a charge noise canceling was good good sound quality and controls but now battery won't hold a charge for more than an hour. Maybe I had a bad pair wouldn't recommend due to that reason
5,Because these earbuds are Skullcandy I automatically trust the company to deliver me something that sounds good. I have several Skullcandy on ear headphones that sound great and are good to wear.So these are my first earbuds from the company and I am pleased. The first thing that struck me is the ergonomic design that made it easy to put them into my ears without fuss or messing around. I don't need to twist them about very much they just seem to slot in and stay there. The sound is good but the push button controls are a little awkward initially but you get used to them. To be fair at this low price it would be wrong to complain.The case is very small and seems sturdy to me. I like the slightly different approach to the case design. The earbuds just slot back in without any messing about.So my overall feeling is that I would recommend these earpods to anyone who wants quality good sound and a bargain price.
1,Very disappointed in sound quality very scratchy sounding also they pop out of my ears when I move around so working out in them is going to be a no … comes with buds case and cord no cube to charge will be buying something else
1,I charged my ear buds until the light turned green used them just to test out the sound and they died in the next 15 mins even though it says the battery is supposed to last 10 hours. I tried charging it again leaving it to charge for longer but it still didnt do anything.I would not recommend these
4,Por el precio que cuestan son buenos
1,Bought these earpods and was only able to pair them to my phone once. Within 2 minutes the left ear dropped and the earpods unpaired from my phone. The buttons are hard to press and the sound was awful. These are the worst earpods I've ever used. Do not buy these.
1,I charged 2hours and within 5 seconds it’s disconnected nd switched off than charged again the same process occurred. I couldn’t through it into the trash because I have to send back it. Overall it’s a garbage product.
1,Se descompuso con facilidad no los tire no se mojaron los use de forma muy responsable y antes de que pasara 1 mes el audífono izquierdo dejó de escucharse al punto de que ya ni siquiera se conectaba al celular.NO RECOMIENDO COMPRARLO
1,Los audífonos son muy incómodos. Carecen mucho de bajos y se caen fácilmente (no se amoldan fácil al oído). La batería dura muy poco y para utilizar los controles del audífono te lastima los oídos.
1,I took off the plastic covings blocking the charging prongs and yet it still doesn't charge. When they worked they were great but I got 1 charge and a bit out of it.
1,The volume is trash and the battery life doesn't last long at all I had another pair for the same price that worked 10x better than these one.
1,Don’t waste your moneyOnly used once an haven’t been able to charge them since
1,Battery life lasts maybe an hour noise cancellation is non-existent the sound quality is incredibly low and they won't stay connected.
1,Bought these for my daughter for Christmas. They barely lasted a month before they stopped working.
1,Many cheaper sets do better than these. Not worth the price.
1,Says battery 🔋 life for 12hrs doesn't even last for 3hrs
1,No enciende el foco indicador de carga y la batería dura 3 horas en audífonos y estación de carga.
1,Al estar haciendo cualquier actividad los audifonos se caen son incómodos y lastiman.
1,Opinaria si no me hubieran salido defectuosos deja de prender un audífono
1,Worked fine for a while and then left one stopped working
5,Arrivato prima del previsto. Molto belle con un bel suono. Molto soddisfatto.
1,Doesn't work p.o.s
4,Great sound quality especially considering the price - wasn't hearing much bass to begin with but after trying the different size rubber ear pieces I realised that the large ones were better for my ears & now have the perfect amount of bass for me. I'm only trying them for the first time now so I can't speak to battery life or how breakable they are but the material feels sturdy despite it being plastic. They're comfortable to wear and I don't feel like they're wanting to fall out even when shaking my head around. Not to mention they look pretty sick too so I'm pretty chuffed with them. Bought these at just over £17 so for the price they're an absolute steal great product overall.
5,Used these on the airplane cancelled out all sound
5,Great sond and well made
4,This are absolutely brilliant earphones for 2.6k. Been using for 2 weeks in workout and training sessions. This aren't for flat sounding or for audiophiles but good for casual listening. Do not expect any noise cancellation technology at this price but fit is snug enough to block surrounding noises.Pros: 1. Superb sound quality (Probably the best considering the rivals boat noise etc..)  2. Clarity treble punchy bass all very clearly balanced sound. (You will notice there's no distortion  even at 100% volume)  3. IPX4 water resistant is a plus if you plan to use it in gym walk etc.  4. RockpopEDMInstrumentals all sound so very good for the price.  5. Super lightweight and funky pop color.  6. Doesn't look like a giant button popping out of ears like most in this price range.Cons:1. The fit might not be perfect for all ear size and it varies.2. Battery life in 3.5 hours(which could have been more) and the port has 12 hours but provided the size and weight of the buds it is justifiable just need to charge more than others.3. The case is open and exposed to dust and stuff when you take off the buds so make sure to keep it clean place.4. Tends to shake out of position while running fast in treadmill otherwise fit is snug and comfortable.Overall a very nice buy if you can sacrifice battery life for decent sounding truly wireless buds.
3,Skullcandy is always my go to headphones or in earphones my son purchased these for me and i tested them once they were charged all was good at first but the next day my son tried them and the sound was all distorted sound like years ago when people use a tape machine and the batteries were running out it's the only example I can give to that but then turned my phone off the on again and it was fine
4,I have had these for like 1-2 weeks and there are no issues with it (for me) . i have given my view on the earpones below .They look super cool .The best feature for me is that we can use any bud individuallyOne major issue for me is the fit they fit really weird and i have to adjust them perfectly so that it is a comfortable fit ( then also they tend to loose up a bit after sometime ) .The sound quality is avg. i guess ( there are some better sounding earphones in this for sure ) but again personally i bought it for looks and as a sort of secondary earphone ( uk for gym and casual stuff ) .The loudness of the earphones is a little low compared to others but its not bad either .The batter is okay i guess . they last about 2-3 hrs .The connectivity is really good ( i havent connected it with other devices other than my phone so i dont know if there is a problem in connecting other devices ) it conmects up really fast.
3,Tres bon rapport qualite prix le son est franchement bon pour cette gamme en comparaison dautre ecouteur essaye.Parcontre je nuis incapable de les porter plus de 30min sans avoir des douleurs au pavillon de l'oreille.Pareil sur dautre personnesLa forme fait que le bord appuie  continuellement...Dommage
4,Decent ear buds for little money. Don’t expect superb sounds but neither are you charged with a corresponding price.
4,It's good
5,Brought as a gift my nephew. These are great the sound is amazingly clear nice loud volume. I brought a pair for myself
5,Son practicos y tienen excelente sonido por un buen precio
3,I’ve bought so many pairs of these earphones they are really good for a month and then without fail every pair I’ve had one earphone has gone really quiet even on full volume there’s hardly any sound…. Only good for a temporary fix while waiting a new pair
4,The sound quality is really good when listening to music or media but the headphones are not good for taking phone calls. The microphone seems to pick up a lot of background noise and anyone I’ve spoken to on the phone while using these has commented on the bad quality. Very good all round earphones amazing for the price but lacking in some small areas.
4,I use these for school and they are really good for the price. Comfortable in your ears and good crisp sound. The bass on them isn't the best but that's to be expected. The one thing I'll complain about is the battery in the earbuds itself. 2 and a half hours goes by fast! Other than that good set of cheap earbuds I would highly recommend.
5,Preisleistungsverhältnis Top!!
5,Le migliori cuffie che abbia mai acquistato
3,I think we have better options than this in such price. Mic doesnt work properly When outside the home.
4,Not bad but they do fall out a lot the battery life on the pods themselves is 8/10 but the case is only enough for one recharge.
4,Nice pair to use I went more for the colour they look pea green in the photo but they are not so pea green as I hoped for a little disappointing as to that  connecting is easy I went in utube to do this  go to devices and click on on it . When charging the ear pieces I turn them off .
3,for songs and calling
4,They are really nice and has good sounds but the battery runs out so fast.
4,My husband is a big fan of any earbuds.The Skullcandy Dime True Wireless Earbuds is used mainly for audiobooks listening and overall he likes the pair.The sound's quality is average but having in mind the price this is not surprising.Battery life is good like let's say my hubby doesn't need to charge the earbuds every day.What is most important for my hubby is that he finds the earbuds very comfortable to wear for several hours something that I don't get for in my case earbuds is torture. )))Skullcandy Dime True Wireless Earbuds are budget-friendly earbuds that work best for audiobooks having a good battery life and are comfortable to wear.
4,These headphones have decent battery life usually living around 3-4 hours and charge pretty fast and have good sound cancelling definitely worth the money. My only really complaints is that they some time are a littel lose (that might just be my small ears) and there so small that you can often lose them
3,I struggle with in ear gunny headphones but I got on ok with these. Might be a personal preference but they just don't have enough bass so some songs can sound pretty tinny (listening to rockpunk mostly)Look good and are comfy just not the top end sound quality I expect from skull candy.
3,fairly decent value for money but they aren't very comfortable compared to some other branded buds I own  the battery life is alright the sound quality is alright too when listening to music but when using them to talk on the phone the quality isn't great tbh but ive noticed recently when putting the headphones back in the case the buds aren't recognising that they have been put back into the charging case and are staying on dont seem to be charging properly  pretty sure I paid extra for the product insurance and as predicted doesn't seem to be any info on this at all..
4,Don’t have any noise cancellation and to charge is also difficult cuz one side bud goes fully charge but other side doesn’t connect left at 10 battery always
5,Great value great product recommended.
5,Bought this again as liked the quality and audio output
5,Thrilled with these!
3,Well where to start. They fit alright inside the ear perhaps not as good as apple or Samsung products. The three different sized pieces are handy.Sound quality could honestly be better. There is zero bass and it makes songs sound “tinny”. Battery life is good just long enough.
4,These headphones are mediocre and it’s a perfect example of you get what you pay for. Being not too expensive you are paying for mediocre quality and sub par sound quality. These aren’t bose or beats but they do the job if you want a pair of cheap headphones to kick around in when you don’t need to worry about wearing $500 headphones in while out for a run or whatever it may be.
3,I have returned this product after few days. Its just okay for calls. If you like to listen to music and you respect good sound quality then buy something else. I have also galaxy buds pro and there is a massive difference in sound quality - yes skullcandy is much cheaper but for this price it should sound a little bit better i think. I had Indy model in the past and it sounded better than those. i generally like this brand but wasn't happy with dime 2 model
3,These were the quietest headphones I've ever ownedIf you're after loud with good bass headphones I'd invest in some Superbeats instead
3,Colour shown in the pics is completely different from what I received. I bought green one and when I got the buds those are more of blue not green which looks bad.
4,For the price point they are very good. Are they better than the high end super expensive ear buds? No. Do they do the job and do the job well for a good price? Absolutely. Value for money 100%.
4,Easy to pair out of boxcomfortable to wear and sound quality good for this price range.As I imagine ear buds would be easy lost so bought a good brand at low price and suit my needs very well.Battery life also suits me as I would only use approx 1hr at a timejust pop into case and they recharge.Would recommend for walksgym etc but for better quality obviously headphones would be best.
3,Plastic quality is not gud and it has buttons not touch sensor
3,good quality sound and battery life noise cancelling too. Just not quite comfortable in-ear for me and case is quite fidgety
4,First of all you won't get a pair of bluetooth earphones at this price from other reputed brands like Sony Sennheiser Shure JBL etc. Skullcandy itself is at par with the above mentioned when it comes to brand image. It is an American company after all. I really dont have any audio or call connectivity issues with this pair of earphones. I would have given these a 5 star rating had it not been for two missing features which aren't mentioned on the official Skullcandy Amazon page. They are -1. No USB-C port. It has a micro USB charging port which in 2021 is really surprising and somewhat outdated. Not to mention it can be quite annoying to charge since you have to use a separate cable. My solution is to buy a USB C to micro USB adapter and leave it attached to the case. Still I think the manufacturer should have switched to USB C.2. Secondly there is no indicator (% or bars) for battery level. Just a small LED light near the charging port to show whether it is charging (red) or fully charged (green). To know the battery level of the earphones you have to connect it to a mobile phone and you will be able to check.
4,I love everything about these but the volume could be a bit louder as I can still hear background noise.
3,The buttons work perfectly small design and good battery life I found max volume wasn't loud enough and they would fall out of my ears
5,Sehr coole InEar Kopfhörer die auch super halten beim Sport( Laufen und Gewichte)
4,These earpho es are  rilliant for the price.
4,Just don't like that after nearly an hour it gets a bit tiring on the ears.Also doesn't really connect to some laptops which is a limitation.
4,Pros - Great value for the money and really great sound including noise insulation.Cons - really low battery sound and the case takes hours to fully charge.
4,Pros:They fit my ears perfectly and they don’t stab my ear or anything.Looks alright when you have them onQuality of sound is really good bass is good just needs to be a bit higherConnected easilyCons:I feel like it’s a spotify thing but volume can be a bit higher on these. On soundcloud I can get the volume i want but on Spotify it’s just a bit below.They are kinda slippery so you could drop them easilyBattery life could be a bit better but 12 total hours is fine for meOverall:Really good for the price that you’re paying. It’s in the middle of good and perfect.
4,Produit tout à fait conforme à mes attentes. Je ne m'attendais pas à de la haute qualité et j'ai été agréablement surpris. Aucun problème de d'appairage.Les seuls petits bémols changer de chanson augmenter le volume... C'est pas très ergonomique ! Mais surtout assez déçu par la couleur verte au final qui est beaucoup plus pale que sur les photos.Je recommande quand même ne serai-ce que pour le rapport qualité/prix.
3,Started off really liking these.Fit my ears well and connection was easy but after about a month the sound in the left earbud has reduced to about a half and seems to be getting quieter the more I use them. UPDATE - right earphone has now stopped working completely so am now left with one very low volume earbud.
4,Great fit look good. Battery life disappointing.
3,For the price they are enough.Uncomfortable for most ears.The battery life sucks.Fully charged case and pods gets me around 3h a day of Playtime.Overall for the 15£ I paid and given that it's used to work it's ok.
4,if only they had good battery life. they would have been best budget tws buds any company has ever made 😔
4,I like these and 3 pairs for different occasions shame that it’s not touch has a button but works great good sound and very light sometimes forget to take out
5,He pagado mucho más por cosas mucho peores. Tenía algo de miedo porque había leído varias reseñas diciendo que el sonido no era bueno o que los cascos eran incómodos. Para nada.La caja es minúscula lo cual parece que es un problema al principio pero es bastante cómoda en el bolsillo. Y además ¿para qué querrías que fuese más grande de lo necesario? El audio es decente. Nada impresionante pero se consigue un volumen bastante alto sin que se escuche la música fuera de los cascos: ideal para cuando quieres hacerte el malote mientras escuchas a Britney Spears por la calle. He notado que los bajos de algunas canciones no se aprecian tanto que con otros cascos mucho más grandes pero prefiero mil veces eso a que me duela la cabeza después de tres canciones.Los cascos son cómodos como ya he dicho. Casi no los notas. Se adhieren bien a la oreja y puedes moverte y hacer ejercicio sin miedo a perderlos. El tema 'atajos' en los propios cascos.. sin más la verdad. Están bien pero termina siendo más útil fácil y rápido sacar el móvil y hacerlo desde allí.No he probado el micro porque me da ansiedad hablar por teléfono y no tengo la costumbre de hacer audios con cascos conectados.
4,It's OK. Definitely not a 5 star product. It's crude and sound is ok not great but ok.
5,Slightly more expensive than other cheap alternatives but they work very well .The sound is really good ample bass very clear they pair easy and recharge in the holder .Very comfortable in the ear make sure to use the right attachments for your ear size ..Have had various alternatives to branded and these are the best so far .Skullcandy made an affordable option that actually works.Would definitely recommend especially for the kids.My teenage daughter absolutely loves them
5,FOR £20 BATTERY LASTS A FEW DAYS SOUND QUALITY IS BETTER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE EAR FITTING FOR ME WAS GOOD AND NO OTHER PROBLEMS AS YET
5,Great product and quality  but battery life could be better to be honest...
3,negatives - bluetooth struggled at times when phone was in my pocket a bit uncomfortable for prolonged usepositives - reasonable pricing an acceptable audio output for the pricemiddle of the road but grand if on a budget
4,Ich habe nach günstigen Bluetooth Kopfhörerern unter 30€ gesucht. Da ich mit Skullcandy in der Vergangenheit schon öfters gute Erfahrungen gemacht habe habe ich mir diese gekauft.Ich bin wirklich sehr zufrieden mit denen und benutze sie fast jeden Tag!Leider muss ich einen Stern abziehen weil die Kopfhörer in der Ladecase manchmal nicht laden. Außerdem ist schon so ein "gummistöpsel" verloren gegangen. :/
4,sound is good however the battery is not long enough for me
4,Easy to use and the small case is just fantastic..got it clipped to my car keys so always have them.Both stadard and stereo listening options.Up load I can't hear any external noises..which is required in abusy office environment...I also ready another review that stated poor base compared to others.....not the case in stereo mode and placed properly is ear...the sound is fantastic. I got these for £15 excellent value
3,I've got small ears & although these say small & mighty they didn't deliver.They made my ears sore & the sound just wasn't loud enough.
5,Great product value for money
5,After a drunken company day out left mine in my shorts pocket and aimed them for the dirty laundry basket. Still hungover put the washing on a 40 degree C full wash and 1400 spin then into the tumble drier.Unload dryer discover earbuds swear leave on side for two days then think 'I wonder'. Pop into ear and working the same as day one.
5,i have used this product often at home and the sound quality is impressive for the size. the bass is really defined and punchy. definitely worth the price! would highly recommend. only slight problem is the time it takes to connect but that might just be my device (oakcastle mp100). overall a good product that i am very pleased with purchasing.Edit: it's connecting fine now I just needed to reset the earbuds by turning off both earbuds then I pressed the button for ten seconds on one of them then put it back in the case and did the same with the other. This fixes any problems with pairing or connecting
4,Not so comfortable for long use but you can listen to it for one hour pretty easily.
4,Nice sound and light weight
3,Used 3 times left earbud looses charge in case which then drains the case.. absolute pain
4,Not Excellent but good product from skull candy. Sound quality is good Noise canellation not upto the mark. Charging as they mentioned. Call quality is okay. Overall a Genune Product to bye. If you are going to spend 3k on other brands like Ptron Boat etc you can go for this model from skull candy.
5,The media could not be loaded.
5,Bass bisschen wenig aber für den Preis echt gut und nivou wie Apple air pods 2
5,I love it but instead of type b charger port can you please design type c because type b is very rare now a day
2,You would be disappointed if you found Skullcandy Dime earbuds in a Christmas cracker! They're cheap and it shows! The overall sound quality isn't good at all even allowing for the low price they're poor in almost every respect. Similarly priced earbuds from other companies (Enacfire Anker) on Amazon are far superior.I'm a fan of Skullcandy got a couple of their wireless headphones and the sound quality is truly fantastic (build quality isn't great though) but the Dime's aren't a good product. Maybe Skullcandy QC missed the ones that I received. I've returned them.
4,Ok per smartphone senza ingresso 35mm è buono per chiamate e video. Non buono per gaming l'audio arriva con ritardo sensibile.
5,Definitely a good buy
4,The earphones are great for their price but a little uncomfortable at first.
3,I like the colour. Easy to find in one’s handbag. Great for my purpose which is commuting. My only criticisms are that the noise cancellation is not up to standard. Also the headphones do not let you know that they are about the lose their charge.. they just don’t work which is most frustrating!
4,Great for value amazing sound. I've had these for awhile and have had no major issues other than needing to wipe the charging bit.
4,Good for the money
4,Noise cancelation and sound quality is good but battery draining very fast
3,Comfortable but left bud won’t charge and keeps randomly disconnecting when used as new the sound was great
4,I couldn’t justify spending a small fortune on EarPods. Was looking for some at a low price without having to compromise too much on sound. Also wanted a well known brand that were straightforward to use and had reviews to back up what was offered. Glad to got these and a real bargain.
4,Good product for this price range
1,Very very bad design. It is not fitting inside the ears every time slipping when our ear muscles moving coming to sound quality it is very bad no bass nothing. There is no touch control on ear buds it has clickable buttons it is very hard to press but when press buttons that ears buds coming out off ears again we need to do adjustment to fit inside the ears. Overall it is very bad product bad design
3,Sound okay fit not great design is okay. A good deal but have started crackling after three uses. I have the 3 year care pack so will have them replaced.
5,The earpods are very good quality especially considering that they are some of the most reasonably priced on the market.
5,I really like them good quality nice design and really good value for the money.
5,Best earphones I've hand by far. The carry case is a bonus as its a power bank that gives earphones a bit of extra charge
5,Top in ears. Preis Leistung 100%Akkulaufzeit könnte etwas länger sein aber siehe ersten Punkt.
4,Have found them good for music podcasts WhatsApp calls  and similar but poor for regular phone calls. Very comfortable. Good price.
4,Short battery life is only disappointing thing in it
4,Buona qualità ad un prezzo abbordabile si sentono bene si può telefonare (io le uso prettamente per quello) e molto importante per me l’utilizzo di un solo auricolare per le telefonate! La qualità audio è buona ma non eccelsa ovviamente è correlata al prezzo del prodotto ma come ripeto ne vale la pena se si ha un budget limitato. Isolamento acustico di medio livello e non elettronico. Per la durata della batteria non posso ancora esprimermi perché per le telefonate son più che sufficienti. Unico neo per i miei gusti personali la pressione nell’orecchio dovuta al gommino che cercando di isolare il più possibile fisicamente potrebbe infastidire leggermente ma ripeto è mio personale e molto soggettivo per il resto le trovo molto comode non ingombranti anzi minuscole e non indifferente un po’ eleganti. Consigliato!
3,They're OK they're alright at your desk. They're not so alright outside definitely don't go loud enough . Somewhat tinny.Charge quick and last well.You get what you pay for and they are very cheap.
4,Item arrived very quickly in good time for Christmas.  My daughter was really pleased with them and had them charged and in her ears very quickly.  They are very small and can easily be carried around in a bag but apparently very good sound quality
3,First complaint: they say you have 12 hours with this but it is "3.5 in your ears and 8.5 in the case." I don't even understand that now after I've figured out that it means my case can recharge the earbuds. Second complaint: the way to pause raise or lower volume etc. is confusing even after reading the manual five times.Now these sound great and fit well. But I'm not happy with them. I keep re-reading in the hopes that I am missing something but ultimately I'm stuck with earbuds that are good for 3.5 hours.
4,These are very nice looking earphones they are small and very easy to use Despite having no touch controls they are ok not very comfortable to wear because they are made of plastic so they are not good for everyone.I used a few different pairs of earphones in recent months and they are second that are not staying securely in my ears:( but I like them how they looks and plays so yes I would recommend them.
5,I love the design thy for my ears perfectly and don't fall out. I can wear these while running and have no problems. The sound quality is brilliant and the battery lasts a long time and they charge quickly I'm very impressed given the price well worth it
5,Great value for money
4,Small but comes with a bang...difficult to control though when in the ear as you need to press it hard and might end up hurting your ear canal 😁. The sound is average but can change your experience if you play your equalizer right. Good for Christmas present will not disappoint your receiver. So 👍👍👍
4,The sound and battery life is good but it doesn’t stick to the ear. They fall off at every slightest move you make especially when you try to lay your head it just falls off.
5,They say that cheap things are bad but this one is what I call great because the bass sounds is way better than the one of my Airpods intact everything about it is better than my sirpods I love it
5,For the price they are good great pair of cheap earphones for the gym if you want something you don't have to worry about sound quality is good enough to enjoy a bit of music while working out I've had better but that's the difference you get in price. They sit in the ear fairly well not really had to many issues with them falling out. Cheap and cheerful.
5,Calidad/ precio. No puedes pedir mucho mas. Si no te quieres gastar una locura de dinero en algo que al cabo de un par de años dejará de funcionar esta es la opción.
5,They are very cheap and are good quality definitely better than trying to get fake airpods. Dad uses them a lot while gardening but finds them a bit on the quiet side.
5,One of the best I have tried and they are cheaper than other name brand ones heavy recomend these great sound quality and comfy to wear
2,Sound Quality - Base - Compressed - Treble - FineComfort - Rub on the bottom side part of your ear if you don't place them right different size earbud covers don't matter what size still sound BadBattery Life - not sure cause I don't wear them long enough to run them downI like Earpods or Earbuds with Xtra Base Sadly these just don't Cut The Mustard😕
4,Great value for money. Best thing is you won't even notice them after some time. Light weight and comfortable. Audio as good as price range. Great for everyday use. Only drawback is that side part is exposed when inside the chatging pod.. so might get dusty and dirty.
5,Nice sound quality
5,Value for money Dont hesitate with negative reviews available _ its good only..go for buy..I bought this for 2500 in offerplastic Quality  is extremely good & Rigid Looks like premium car key Magnetic Locking  Have to press & Pull little hard.

4,Toll
4,Very nice pair of headphone good level of bass just little complaint with case not soo bad but to open it i have to use my nails 😉
3,I got these because a relative recommended me getting skullcandy earphones after my wired earphones died. These arnt the best but it's better than my old wired ones in some way due to my job I end up breaking my wire earphones which is why I bought these so Im not constantly spending money one new ones every week.My only problems with the earphones is that they don't sit right in my ears even if I change the buds they're uncomfortable and I have to constantly make sure it's not gonna fall out. The sound quality isn't the best either it could be better. One thing that is good about them is the battery life I use them for the entire day and they last so long. Overall the earphones are okay.
5,These are the best ear phones I've had for a good while. And for the price they're totally worth it. Highly recommended the colour is spot on too. 👌😁
2,Worst sound during phone call. Lot of disturbance in call. battery life is very poor.
4,They are good for the money. Mostly use to listen to music or podcasts on the train on my way to work. Cancel noise well enough.Only issue for me is that one is a little big for my right ear. So I can use it but it cuts into my ear if I use it for long periods of time. If you have small ear maybe avoid.
1,worst earbuds I have bought till now. Sound is good but charging problem occur in just 2 months. Already made a complaint for one & now another one got charging problem and their replacement & exchange policy are also worst even if waranty time is on.
3,As it was more plastic built i wasn't not big fan of this and also you should have right ears else it may cause a little bit pain in your ears and also buttons weren't good it should be pressed hard to engage them.Sound and all were good but the usb port  plastic built were disappointing actually.
2,The volume of these headphones is low. Even at the highest volume they are still low. There is no bass as well. I am disappointed with these headphones and have gone back to using my generic brand headphones which have better bass and volume.
5,Very nice
4,Not the best sound and don’t keep out loud back ground noise.They are good for the money and I am experimenting with the size of the rubber bud things so may help with back ground noise
3,Good in terms of sound quality but doesn't fit into ear. Causes pain
5,I've had these for a few months now and use on a daily basis. The sound quality is really good nice bass. I've tried other cheaper alternatives and these are by far the best for the money. The battery life ain't too bad either. Well worth the money....so much so I bought two pairs 😅Only issue I've had is the Bluetooth dropping out but this might have been an issue with my phone rather than earbuds.
2,It's  one of  the  worst  product  i got a damaged  product   i have  tried  contact  service  center  they are  not  even  responding  overall  worst  experience  ever don't  ever buy a skull canday product  worst  service  ever
4,Pros- Compact box (pocketable)- Short stem (looks good)- Flat sound profile with a little bit of base (they sound better than what you would expect looking at the driver size) good low mid and high with subdued base. No distortion on high volume... (they are similar to sennheiser cx180 - which I like)- Good value moneyCons- Inspite of the small size it is not as comfortable as you would expect... When compared to oneplus bullets wireless (image attached) you can see the circular part that goes inside your ear is bigger. So it hurts on prolonged usage...- MICRO USB connector with small cable- Trash microphone- Average battery life
3,It's a stereo earphone if your looking for bass go for any other model this is pretty basic one
3,It takes forever for the earphones to actually charge and by the time you've got them charged the battery doesn't last at all. They're awful in ear they fall out easily and if you try to adjust them slightly you can't hear the sound. You cannot adjust them without the sound cutting out everytime I have to fully take it out and put it back in 50 times before I can hear sound. Also too small and very easy to lose the size also makes it harder to put it in the ear as it'd easy to drop.
4,Comfortable and does the job well for its size. Very quick connection to devices. Very good price.
4,Sound
4,Noise cancellation is so good I won't ever hear a motorbike passing by.Loved the sound quality and the bass.It's so compact and super light weight.Charges very quickly.But the issue is when over calls if a vehicle passes by it creates a sound too loud for the person on the opposite end that they can't hear our voice anymore.
2,The most important thing to know. Ther is no noise cancelling bcz of that it's getting a lot of disturbance to others  when we are speaking in call . We can't bare it . Apart from that everything is fine .
4,Als Übergangslösung gekauft seitdem oft verwendet. Soundqualität für den Preis ok nicht unangenehm im Ohr. Insgesamt für das Geld voll in Ordnung.
5,Bought for my son and he's very happy with them. Uses them to listen to music  so is happy with the sound quality and also how comfortably they fit his ears.
5,I love them so so much they are great value for money
4,The sound was really good the comfort was not much for me and the battery life can be increased a bit as i wear more than 3 hours sometimes
5,Good product got to replace some that we lost.No complaints
4,It’s sounds okay. Can be used for every tasks pretty cheap and good for the price!!! But don’t buy this is you have small ears like me. Research on other pairs.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Probably the best tws earbuds in the market right and in an affordable price mini but mighty the sound quality is top notch the bass is good it's small so you can carry it anywhere love the magnetic lid on the case also the earbuds are magnetic didn't expect it to be it was also easy to connect to the device for the first time it will take some time to learn all the controls haha. But overall it's great i would suggest you to buy these over any other brand in the market right now it's price is low so it's easy to afford than some flashy airpods
4,Nice product in this price range...👍
5,Just what I was looking for at an affordable price. Decent sound quality and delivery was quick
2,after using these regularly for a couple months the battery life has declined pretty badly. they sound good however i wouldn’t recommend purely because of how bad the battery life gets
5,They where perfect for on the plane could watch my show with no issue sound was amazing
5,First time I have used anything like this was sceptical but the comfort quality are second to none would highly recommend
5,Well my Sister she loves them Small case powerful and quality sound through the earbuds as Skull 💀 Candy 🍭 knows how to do it. Long battery life .Buy it !
4,Alles in allem sehr gute KopfhörerSound und Tragekomfort sowie die Bedienung sind gut für meine Bedürfnisse zugeschnitten.Beim Aufladen der Kopfhörer in der Powerbank muss man aber manchmal noch einmal nachdrücken da der Magnet manchmal nicht dafür sorgt die Kopfhörer fest genug auf die Ladekontakte du drücken.Stellt allerdings kein Problem dar sobald man es einmal weiß.:)
4,Sound quality isn't the best but I mainly use them for listening to podcasts around the home or at the gym - does the job for the price. Won't replace high quality headphones for music.
5,The delivery was really fast and the sound from this Earphones are really really good i love it.Maybe later i will buy other pair
2,Second time buying these earbuds and both times only one ear works or the other one just refuses to connect at the same time as the other. Good earphones but be weary they’re very dodgy
4,I got this to wear in one year while I ride my bike inside helmet. It's compact and does not hurt my ear. But it keeps falling off if I use it for daily use.This is a better option for lower price than the Chinese Bluetooth setup for new sports helmet.
2,For £20 I didn’t expect top notch sound quality and I actually think the quality is better than I was expecting. It’s good enough for my use which is to listen to music/audio books to fall asleep to.Battery life seems ok but I do only use these for a short period of time.The main issue is that they just don’t fit in my ear comfortably. I’ve tried all the different size ear buds and makes no difference. They only stay in if I really jam them in and it’s not comfy. They slowly start to fall out which is just irritating.As I mainly use these lying down not moving and for a short period of time it’s ok. I can’t use use these in any other situation though because they fall out.The controls on them are tricky to use because it just makes it more likely the earbud will fall out.If they could fix this issue by redesigning the shape slightly they would be an absolute steal.
5,Sound quality is great and really comfortable
3,They don't sit well in my ears personally and the sound is a bit tinny
1,Am 18.6.20 gekauft beginnen nun genau 1 monat danach die ersten probleme.Wenn man die hörer in die ladebox legt sollten sie ausgehen und sich aufladen.Das problem ist das die hörer spontan immer wieder angehen dann an bleiben und den akku leer ziehen bis dieser so oft tiefenentladen ist das die teile kapitt sind und gar nicht mehr geladen werden können!Hatte zufor die hesh2 und die hesh3 over ears die viel besser halten.Aber wie es auch laut Rezessionen scheint sind diese earbud Kopfhörer von skullcandy alle nur plastik müll ich bin echt schwer enttäuscht und hoffe nun mein geld von amzn zurück zu bekommen mache mir aber keine große Hoffnung...
5,Bought these for my son and he absolutely loves them. He said that the are comfortable and sound quality is good. Never been disappointed with any of my Skull Candy purchases.
2,As nice looking and easy to use as they are these buts are very uncomfortable (for me anyway).. They don't hold in my ears very well and the sound leaks out easily.. At one point I tipped my head to the side and the bud just fell out (at one point I yawned and one bud fell out too haha)..I changed up to the large size bud which was ok for a short time but my ears started to ache I've reverted back to my wired Skullcandy Smokin' Buds far more comfy and just work..
4,After 6 month of usage one side not working.No service nearby to rectify.not worthful.
4,Good nonsense earphones...simple to use and decent sound quality for the price... audiophiles should avoid though.
2,The product I received was completely weird.  Let me explain how  while doing a stereo test I founded out that the output of the buds are completely messed up  the audio which should come from right is coming from left and vice versa Its hard to explain but the stereo or 3D sound is completely messed up.
3,While connecting to TV or any other appliance sound is barely audible. Other earbuds are so clearly audible.
2,Bought these as a back up to my everyday headphones. Sound isn’t great and they don’t play loud enough imo. Comfort wise I would say you can wear them for about 20 minutes until they start to irritate you I find them falling out of my ears a lot when I’m training which is not ideal.
3,Battery and sound not best but ok
4,Honestly really surprised look at the price It really is amazing that they sound this good. Really well balanced natural sound. Not as comfy for me as some other makes I have tried but everyone has different ears so it will suit some and not others.
3,The battery backup is very low
5,Reasonable with great sound quality. efficient pairing. happy with the product :)
4,Really small case and light - easy to carry aroundEarbuds themselves also light and can't really feel them in the earsSound quality is fine not amazing but good considering the costCompatible with my iPhone and no problems with distance up to 5-10m so far
5,Good sound quality and comfortable in ears. Once fitted in ear properly they don't fall out. Battery life is pretty good. All in all a great buy. Cannot go wrong at this price. Very happy with them.
3,Sound quality is good..but there no noice cancellation..when we are on call with someone the background noise is too loud.
3,Low bass issue& comfort issue & battery too
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Prodotto arrivato nei tempi previsti. Packaging buono e come da video. Il video è stato girato di nuovo dopo l'unboxing perché l'app si è chiusa e ha cancellato il primo lo strappo sul retro non c'era originariamente. Cosa strana è che i ricambi dei gommini auricolari sono privi di una confezione a sé e manca uno di quelli small. Per me è un problema perché è proprio la dimensione che uso di solito. Sto valutando se usare quelli che ho a casa o chiedere il reso.Come audio per ora non posso giudicare la confezione specifica di caricare il prodotto prima dell'uso.
2,It's not worthy to buy with this amount of money. Sound quality is quite nice not not for nice music. Also it's not comfort use for a long term. The ears is starting to hurt after a while.
5,excellent sound quality
2,Most importantly the sound quality. It's ok for podcasts or audiobooks but pretty poor for anything else. You really need to twist and force them deep into your ears to get just a half decent sound which is very uncomfortable. I tried all the sizes of replacement buds that are supplied in the box and had the same experience with them all.The case is quite quirky but difficult to open.They are extremely lightweight even when in the case.......in fact lightweight is probably a good all round description lightweight in every department even the price.Wish I'd just doubled up on my spend and just bought cheap end Sony etc.
5,Love the soundThe feelThe colourThe lookIt's all good
5,Great product comfy stylish and the sound quality it great.
5,Suis très satisfait..le produit est au top niveau
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Nice small and sound perfect
5,They are very nice compact little headphones the sound quality isn't too bad charge time and battery time is decent. I find them comfortable walking running ect. I have a tragus piercing with a loop stud that usually ends up feeling uncomfortable with certain headphones but these ones have been really good not had that discomfort issue. I would recommend these but bear in mind I used wired Asda headphones before I bought these.
5,Its been 2 monthsbattery and all other functions working perfect.
5,Daughter loves them
2,Poor quality sound. I have a skullcandy earphone set which is very good and that's why I decided to buy this. But unfortunately sound quality was way below my expectations.
5,Super cheap and uber small. Great little wireless buds. Very comfortable and light. Charging box is tiny! Not used the mic yet but everything else is great. Simple to set up and use straight away. Super happy so far
5,Love the case which provides battery easy to use and fit really comfortably.  Sound quality is good no complaints!  Good value for money.
5,Great headphone for the price! I've had airpods I'm not saying they are the same but certainly come close and for the fraction of the price
1,Worst earbuds auto connecting n auto disconnecting not working sound is good but overall it’s very bad
3,Cant expect much for the price the fitment is bulge on ears and pains after a continuous use for about 30min and base level is zero. I wouldn’t recommend these earphones
5,For the money you really can’t argue. The sound is better than you would expect for the price. Not the best bass but like I said you need to spend a lot more to get that. Battery is decent seeing 4 hours roughly but charge in the case quickly. As comfy as any other in ears. I prefer over ears but for smaller daily use these are damn good for the money.
5,Good value for money and comfortable design. The pair I had before getting these were huge and fell out constantly 🙄
4,Battery capacity is a bit low  apart everything is fine
5,These are pretty good budget Bluetooth ear buds - fine for podcasts and acceptable for music.
5,These earbuds are great value for money if you are looking for a cheap pair. Sounds quality is really good. Battery lasts around 3 hours in each bud until it needs a charge. With the functionality to use only 1 bud at a time this means they are above most others in this price bracket. The comfort is pretty good. The buds don't fall out and now I've worn them in for a few hours they are comfortable. Good buy.
5,For everyday use it is perfect
1,Worst product ever. Never expect this from skullcandy. Can't able to return it
4,I bought this product since I'm a huge fan of Skullcandy and the looks of the buds are fantastic and sounds pretty good considering the price. Definitely suggest buying these for daily use
3,Song still plays when buds are in the box.
1,Battery promble
5,Love them
4,Sono rimasto molto soddisfatto dal design compatto di queste cuffie. Per la loro grandezza hanno una buona qualità abbastanza comode e performanti!
3,Quality is not so great but ok at the price range.  Kept slipping from my ears while workout.
4,Having used other wireless earpods before these were the cheapest buy the only downside I could feel was the mild uncomfortablility and the fact they weren't tailored to integrate with a phone. Millage may vary as ear sizes do.
4,For what they are worth they are good but definitely do not compare to Apple AirPods
4,Quite happy with this purchase. The build quality looks good and the size of the case as well and the earphones are compact. The sound is better than the other earphones available under 2.5k. With the compact size the only sacrifice made by Skullcandy is the battery backup in both the case and the earphones.
5,I wasn't expecting these earbuds to sound too great given the price point but they have more than surprised. The sound is very bassy more than loud enough for the size of the drivers and had clear mids and highs. Battery life isn't fantastic but for the size of the device you can't really complain plus you have the charging case to have your back. Overall really good product for the price. Would very recommend.
4,Satisfied
2,Produit assez discret apparaillage en bluetooth rapide. Gestion des basses suffisante néanmoins autonomie perfectible et réduction du bruit inexistante. Impression que les écouteurs brident la puissance et gestion sonore du smartphone.Les écouteurs disposent de boutons afin de les allumer à faire lorsqu'ils ne sont pas portés. J'ai arrêté de les utiliser car les embouts en caoutchou irritent les oreilles et l'angle des ecouteurs font mal.
3,Great little wireless earphones. Unfirtunately my ears are small and bulky part is hurting me. I have to adjust them all the time otherwise they will fell off. I just have small ears.
1,Although these headphones were great at first they just died and stopped working after 3 weeks. Refused to charge or turn off when returned to the case initially then just wouldn’t connect to anything and finally just wouldn’t turn on (probably due to the case not charging them).I bought these for my partner and the jib trues for me. Do yourself a favour and spend the extra tenner as the jibs are excellent
5,Bought for my son for Christmas. They fit well with different size ear buds that come with it. Connects easily to his iPad. He says the sound quality is good. Battery power could be better as we seem to charge them very regularly.
1,Le produit est défectueux les fonctions tactiles ne fonctionne pas ! Aussi j'ai retourné l'article et je suis toujours en attente de mon remboursement ... Je déconseille fortement ce produit je ne recommande plus
5,These little earphones are absolutely amazing was worried they’d sound tinny because I’ve had that issue with other earphones similar in price been using them almost every day for 2 months
2,This earbuds were great for the first few month but as of recent times even if i put them back into the case they keep playing and it drains the battery life and the left has also stopped working entirely
5,Awesome
3,Battery life is lucky to last 3/4 hours
4,Excellent value for money. Work like a dream
4,Good one anti scratch case light weight.The buttons are not good need to take it off and press it as it need a little pressure to press it.
2,Good sound qualityComfortable fitSmall caseHowever no USB-C charging? In 2022 that is unacceptable.
5,Bon son pour le prix et reste bien en place
3,Maximum Volume not good..
4,The product is good for listening music on the go. But for calling purpose its not suitable at all. People on other will be able to hear your surrounding voice except your voice. No noise cancellation. For music lovers it a go.I had to return the product for the same.
4,Nice
5,Surprisingly good considering the price
5,It's very good nice purchase sound quality is also very good and it can canel noise to a good extent looks nice and the case is also pretty hard so no chance you gonna drop it . One flaw that I saw is interface is not the easiest but you will get a hold of it after some
5,Really great and a fab price
5,
4,Good product
2,I am writing this after 1 month use..The battery life is poor and it keeps falling off..Overall not a buy
5,Great value for money. Nice compact size perfect for hanging off car keys. Tho they are very easily lost Due to there size. Would recommend a bright colour so the standard out more if lost. Case is well designed the top locks firmly as not to open by accident. Fit is secure for me but it can be different from person to person like any other  headphone
3,Charging cable is not working
5,amazing for the price sound quality is good (they don’t fit my ears very well but i have extremely tiny ears). they work for calls which is perfect as a lot of wireless earphones are awful. they hold charge for ages! *make sure to take the white sticker off the earbuds or they won’t charge… it took me ages to figure that out
2,Upsetting.
1,
2,I am facing some issue with this product.1 - Auto connect is not working on mobile2 - Earbuds not disconnecting while charging3 - Battery backup is not good.4 - Sound Quality Is Not Good
3,It was alright but for 40 you can get much better and the battery life was poor and had lots of connectivity problems
3,The sound is good and they are very comfortable to wear but I have a lot of connection issues with them.Sometimes putting them in the case doesn't turn them off and sometimes they don't turn on when you take them out. Bit annoying
3,Lacks a bit of low-end and maybe too much midrange compared to cheap wired earbuds. But very good sound quality overall. They are not comfortable to wear more than 15 minutes every hour or so (at least to me).
5,I just wanted some cheap wireless buds to use on the go and for the price these are fantastic I've used a couple of cheap options in the last and they always felt and worked cheaply but these are pretty high quality for the price they sound really nice they are easy to use and everything highly recommend them.
5,I read a few reviews before buying these and a lot of people said the sound quality was not good or was “tinny”.The sound quality could be better yes if I paid a lot more I would not say it is tinny….. for this price I would say they are definitely worth buying.Build quality is good instructions not the clearest.
5,Product is fantastic nice neat package and automatically syncs
5,The Bluetooth can be a little spotty at times but overall a really good sounding pair of earbuds definitely worth the price.
2,Lacking in Bass and the Bluetooth connection cuts out when using other apps. Not the Mae West...
1,Doesn't seem to be a fix for this and happens with every pair I've had. The left bud goes so quiet it's only good as a spare because you have to have volume so loud the right becomes deafening to wear at the same time. And no I've not gone deaf. Common fault I think. Just abiut to ask amazon to arrange a return.
5,Miles better than the rest of cheap buds I have tried just hoping they continue but impressed for the £££
4,Pros:Auto connects every time.Good for music.Fit is good.Con:Not good noise cancellation.Power-off button is hardOverall the its worth as backup ear phone for calls and good ear phone for workout and music
4,Bought for my daughter. She says they are comfortable and the sound quality is reasonable. She finds the warning alerts irritating.
4,Sound and base is not high. Suitable for low sound music listeners
4,nice but only problem i face it discharge very fast not if use 2 3  hrs regularly than it discharge very fast as compared to other company earpiece
2,Worked for about 2 uses in which they sounded okay. They feel incredibly cheap and have stopped working even though I’ve had them less than 3 weeks. Waste of money
5,I've bought one for myself and one for my brother. Both happy with what we got and how much we paid for it. I would recommend them bought 3 more for my friends and all are happy.
5,Good
1,They might fit your ears they didn’t fit in mine as the rubber tips always slip out when I get that sort of design.
5,Sound quality and background sound cancellation of these buds is excellent for a remarkable price battery life as stated very pleased with my purchase
5,Connectivity is great. No drops or disconnection. Decent sounding for the price. Good build quality and fits nicely in the ear. Decent battery life.
4,I liked the sound quality...afterall its skullcandyIts really very light weightIt fits to ear vey wellThe thing that i disliked is the buttons...i was expecting it to be touch...
5,Van muy bien sonido estupendo cómodos y relación calidad precio 10
5,Great quality for the price. Very comfortable and secure to wear in ear. I'd like more bass but that may not  be possible within the limitations of earbuds. I very much like the look and feel of them and the magnetised charging case. Only improvement would be some visual indication of the charging status but that also would be ambitious at the price. I'm using them for my PC my phone and my tablet and they are not disappointing.  I would buy these again (in Gray incidentally)  very happily. Thumbs Up
3,I was afan of skullcandy products due to its sound quality at such reasonable cost. So I immediately ordered dime. Although the sound quality is good the max volume is very low
5,This is best u will get for ur buck.... It's amazing for outdoor and indoors but yeah battery is small but who cares avg people listen to songs 3-4 hrs a day and it's fine for that
4,Good product.
5,Ich habe die Kopfhörer meiner Schwester geschenkt und sie ist absolut begeistert. Das einzige was nicht so angenehm ist dass man als Außenstehende die Musik ab einer gewissen Lautstärke hören KANN. Sonst ist alles gut. Preis-Leistungsverhältnis ist mehr als zufriedenstellend!
4,The buds are amazing for the price at which they are offered. Bass is normal good for music lovers. Calling is not very comfortable. Skullcandy can improve on calling feature. The voice is bit low once on call.
3,Everything is good sound great noise cancellation is not much press button is the irritated one fits in the ear perfect
4,Great product for the money but the charge on the earphones itself is frustratingly low.
5,These are better fit an do everything the same as the one's I paid 120 for frikin crazy defo buy em
4,Good quality. Stay charged for a long time. Excellent for the price.
5,These are great for price
5,I prefer louder head phones or ear buds but the standards makes ear bud levels stop at a certain point to avoid damage. These are comfortable and good quality for the price. Easy to use and happy with purchase
3,Einfach zu leiser. Kann ich nicht weiter empfehlen.
4,Excellent value great all round buds. Only downside is case is a bit fiddly.
2,Uncomfortable battery not great sound very tinny
4,For the make it's just fine. But overall these earbuds couldge been something else of the fit was in ear intact.
1,The headphones refused to power down when docked for charging. Returned and refunded.
2,Cheap?..yes. Cheerful? Nope!These are inferior in every way sound  comfort and battery. Yet the Yobola white earbuds which are CHEAPER than these but have both better sound quality AND battery!I gave them away. I'll stick to Yobola for true value for money.
2,Not worth the price.
2,Got headache due to severe treble of this earphone they never turn off buttons are so hard to press it feels like pushing something in your ear
5,Excellent for the price
5,
3,Bluetooth automatically getting disconnected after every 18mins !
5,Great ear buds good price maybe a little bigger than the really expensive brands but comfortable and great sound quality also come with a few different sized cushions so you can be as comfy as possible
2,Product have issue with microphone connection it takes multiple reconnect to have proper microphone connection ….it will auto connect only for other media sound but not for microphone…
5,Good battery case also hold charge. Light and small. Great sound
5,Good for the price well worth a buy
2,Roll on
1,Suddenly stopped charging hardly used as use my wired ones more have tried other chargers no luck.
3,Sound is average think and buy..
5,These wireless ear buds are absolutely amazing. They’ve survived rain and sweat.Battery life is long sound is great.A big plus is the size of them as well: they’re compact so they don’t protrude alot from your ears and they’re also short.Highly recommend these to anyone wanting to get some wireless earbuds.
2,I originally got these headphones to use on my exercise bike via Bluetooth to replace my Apple Airpods.  However I quickly noticed that the sound just wasn't anywhere like the quality I got from the Apple headphones.  All the bass was lost and I couldn't get them to fit in my ear comfortably despite trying various sizes of the buds.  I switched their usage for headphones on podcasts - this wasn't so bad on the sound as voices don't require such an amazing headphone.  They are still not comfy though so I'm going to look for a replacement.
5,Ottimi auricolari. Sono comodi nelle orecchie non danno fastidio né cadono a differenza di molti altri auricolari. Buon suono buona trasmissione vocale nelle chiamate. Ottimo acquisto consigliato!
1,The sound quality of the product is not good at all it is not worth buying .
4,Headphones- 8/10  Seller- 1/10 because small size rubber plug was missing. Please dont cheat loyal customers like this.
5,Really nice I like them
5,Ottime cuffie facile da usare anche in modalità mono. I tasti fisici sono un po’ duri da attivare quando si hanno le cuffie in ear ma i comandi ben studiati. Ottimo il pairing batteria sotto la media ma il case è piccolo e tiene un paio di cariche extra
1,The lowest pair of earphones I've ever had so so bad.
4,There is a sound difference between two earbuds.
5,Love these buds very comfortable & sound quality is better than some more expensive ones I've tried.
1,These are crap. The right bud has stopped working and keeps switching itself off. I have no idea how to contact the manufacturer
1,I just dislike everything
2,mignon mais sans intérêt au regard de ce que l'on trouve : écouteurs pas super pratiques à retirer du boitier. plastique un peu cheap j'hésitais avec une paire de JVC et ceux là pr le quasi même prix; là l'ergonomie est moins bonne les matériaux pas très agréables une fois dans l'oreille. quant au son je ne sais pas je n'en ai pas eu ça n'a pas fonctionné. mauvais rapport qualité prix
5,
5,Ich finde sie super. Funktionieren Akku hält lange und haben ne super Klangqualität. Für den Preis echt zu empfehlen 😊
1,The thing won't charge
2,Buttons sometimes work try it already 3 of them and same story. Pause and Play works for 10% out of 100%. Also other funktionalities seems not to be there. Sometimes the sound have distortion. Fit is ok. Very good in my ears. Microphone is really bad. Dont make calls with them outside. It's an disaster
4,Good product. I am fully satisfied till now.
5,i love these earphone verty comfortable and the sound quality is soo good
1,Worst earphone ever. Only one earphone works but will only charge to ten percent. What a waste of money. Amazon shold not be selling such a bad product.
2,First impression is sound quality and bass is not upto mark. Calling experience is pathetic. Overall not worth buying
4,No ear pain ..fit perfectly..decent sound effect...
5,Quality sounds and simple to use
5,nice
5,Könnte ein tick lauter sein aber ansonsten bin ich sehr zufrieden
3,They last around 3hrsApart from that decent.
5,Love the colour and are fab
5,You get everything u need in a earpod...I am using this with Pixel 6 and it works flawlessly..global warranty is also provided for 1 year. Water resistant ipx67 12 hrs+ battery high quality sound noise cancellation at it's best and look is also cool.
5,Really good sound quality especially for the price. I've changed the tips to memory foam for comfort and so they will stay in better. But love my dimes they work perfectly.
5,Zero disturbi suono molto buono è durata della batteria 12 ore! Davvero molto compattecustodia di ricarica piccolissima come una chiave di una macchina!
2,Battery dies fast not as loud as others I’ve used my partner has them in all black and they’re really good.
4,Very comfortable with the Design but Bass is normal and clear
5,Loved the sound from these hence the 5* but unfortunately after not even 24 hrs one fell out as I crossed the road to my front door and got ran over by a car. Proper spewing! But great product and would highly recommend
4,These little pods are great for the money - especially when on a budget. They are made from plastic and are very lightweight - the battery life is equal to my old Airpods - at an 8th of the price!!! At this price point don't expect the best audio however these aren't Tinny at all but there is some slight distortion at Max volume! I have had far worse at a higher price point. Recommended if you're on a budget or new to pods - you won't be disappointed.
5,Perfect product. Crystal clear sound quality and with punchy base (Not in excess) that is needed for your ears. You will experience a premium sound from these. Never have second thought buying them. Skullcandy rocks with its premium products. Loved them. Smooth Pairing from smartphone and In-between the earbuds as well.They are little less comfortable in ear I guess it will take some to get use to it as earlier was using Apple Airpods.
5,Perfekt
4,Wonderful sound and user guide were very helpful. Glad to have purchased it
1,Left earphone had a battery life of 30 seconds right one 10 minutes--I followed proper charging instructions. Not recommended if your daily run is longer than that.
1,der Sound ist so dünn da hat mein Handy mehr Bass die schlechtesten Kopfhörer die ich jemals getestet habe.
1,Very poor sound quality.Tinny and no bass.
1,i think they forgot to add bass will mark for minus in bass and please avoid to buy this product if you're looking for good bass tws earbuds.
4,May feel pain if used for long time..
5,The keyring bit is amazing allows me to wear the charging case and the sounf quality is amazing definitely worth the money
2,Is fine but battery is not good
1,Battery capacity is not even close to what it claims to last for 10 hrs if we charge it to 100%. After the 1hr of use again I have to charge it. I am writing this as I have observe this issue since 5 days of use. Looks like it's a defective product. I really thought this product would be amazing to use as it's really tiny and compact but to use this is really irritating as nobody wants to charge this after every hr least we can expect that battery works at least for 10 hrs. I really want to return this product
1,Won’t power on -only powered on once and sound only through left ear
5,My sons Christmas present he is going to love them thank you.
1,Not worth to by we have push the button very hard and it will not wake up
5,What can I say they do exactly what they say they’ll do and easy to set up brilliant.Thank you Skullcandy..
5,Sound quality is better than expected however still not the best. But for the price it is acceptable.
1,Purtroppo non sono durate nemmeno un mese  peccato …Amazon sempre il top per tutto
5,Great earbud.  Sit well. Feel comfortable.  Sounds great.Easy charge and connection to phone.Magnetic connection in case so feels secure in there.Very please.  Recommended to friends.
5,Really happy with these. Lightweight good fit and solid battery life.
1,The buds don’t fit properly n it comes off from the ear within minutes even when you are not moving n the voice is also not that good
2,Earbuds skips a beat several times a song. Amazon offered full refund for return but do not want to go through return process.
1,They don't hold a charge!!! I charged them up and they don't even hold that to the morning after using them for 15mins!!
5,Ok
5,very good
5,Skullcandy very good thanks
5,More than what i expected
5,Its a blast!! 🔥🔥 To be very frank ..... It has skullcandy signature sound which is full in itself..!! Its so very crisp and clear ......no distortion .......and there's plenty bass. I personally loved it. ❤️ It's premium segment earphones in budget category. Kudos to skullcandy!!  The build quality is also good  doesn't feel cheap . And they are so tiny......yet amazing sounding. Definitely recommended.
1,Size of the box: smartBuilt quality: worst (charging connection issue with in a week)Ear comfort: painful and looseFit: worstMids and vocals: above averageCall quality: not good but matches the industry standard in the segmentBass: goodBox says Made in china product print says made in Vietnam?????
5,i just had a few issues but not with the headphones make sure that your bluetooth on your phone is okay
2,They aren't terrible. You only get decent bass if you push them really hard into your head. The battery is rubbish though. I've got 2 sets of Chinese ones that cost less than £20 that are better value for money and better battery life and sound quality.
5,Have to say these are unbelievably good in terms of sound build and quality for and unbelievably cheap price. Better than buds I have paid 5 times more for. Perfect for my running akd gym visits.
5,These are really good.The noise cancellation is surprisingly good as well as the sound quality. These are definitely worth the price if you need a pair if wireless earphones.
5,I like the product and it's very reasonable and worth it. Thank you Amazon.
5,Bought these from here a couple months ago battery life is fantastic and the sound quality is good for the price.
1,The battery life is very poorit can only last upto 3-3.5 hrs only!!
5,No complaints
5,Não se pode encontrar melhor produto que este na gama de preços.
5,Very good value for money good sound but compromise was made for small size in battery length being 8 hours
5,If you can include a smaller earbud as well for people with small ear holes
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Very poorly madethe sound us terrible not worthy. I bought this because of the brand but I'm really disappointed with this one.
5,Seem fine haven't really used them yet just tried them out when connecting them to my phone. For the money seem OK for the price
5,Incredible for 30 quid best ear phones I've ever used. Brilliant sound quality and best of all they stay in my ears.
2,Like - Design and colours availableSound quality okay for the price but better options availableDislike - Fit of the headphonesMaterial and battery life
4,As far as the tech side of these earbuds they are very good indeed. Small compact little earphones that live in a charging case. The case is magnetic so when you go to replace the earbuds in the case the magnet almost pulls them out of your fingers and into the right position in the box. (Actually the magnetism is so strong it’s a bit tricky getting them out of the case sometimes!  I’ve find turning the car upside down and shaking then it into my palm works best.)  It is a bit of a shame the case don’t have a digital display to show  you the exact level of charge of the case and/or earbuds.Bluetooth connection to your phone is very quick and straightforward and once paired they will automatically re-pair with the last device next time you get them out.  Sound quality is very good.My problem is that I find it hard to get on with the bog-standard foam ear pieces that come in the box. There address three sizes of them but they are those soft foam things that almost all earphones come with and to me they aren’t comfortable and they don’t feel secure in my ears. I’m perfectly willing to accept that this might just be because I have awkward ears - most other people seem to get on with them!  But to me they always feel like the things might pop out of my ears at any moment.
5,It's a very good pair of earphones. Great sound and battery life. Works really good. Easily gets paired with the phone. Looks good.
1,Pathetic. 1st copy of apple air pods are way much better
1,My new earphones do not charge. I’ve wasted £25. I’ve tried to reach out for support but couldn’t get any help. If possible I want a full refund or a replacement.Please do not buy these earphones if you’re worried about quality or if they charge.
2,I got defective product and there is no way to replace from skull candy how this buds are waste
1,Excellent sound quality but literally the worst skullcandy ive ever seen in matters of operating.You have turn on each bud manually by long pressing the button on the buds each time you keep them in the case for about 5 mins. Case is made up of hard plastic and you cant even open the case with just your thumb because you have to press it to lock the lid of the case. It gets so annoying after a while. Really not worth the money.
1,Not a price worthy product lots of improvement can be done Noice cancellation is totally zero bettery life is ok enough.
5,Excellent product only one negative I feel it having average battery 🔋life.But noice cancellation and sound quality superb. And elegant design
1,I have bought this earphones as a gift. I habe been already using earphones from skullcandy and i know the sound quality and everything is great. But this one is the worst earphones i have ever come across. Main problem is the microphone. If you are talking to someone on call it cancel your sound with other noise. So the other person can only hear some part of your speech. You have to literally keep out right earphones and keep it near your mouth so the other person can listen. I wouldn’t suggest this.
5,I got it on sale at 70% discount. It is as good as it is mentioned. Battery life is good. Sweat proof holds onto ears properly. Overall a bingo purchase
5,Nice little headphones fit good and sound quality is as good as my old skull candy
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I like nothing much because it is not working
1,In the pair left side bud s has been offed/ damaged and required to change /repair
5,Perfect earbuds for money
2,Skullcandy worst product
1,Really good headfones for a couple of days. Then the right one stopped working now the left only works for a minute or so. If the price is too good to be true you know it's not. Don't buy these
1,Nothing is good
5,It’s the best wireless airbud and comfortable
5,
2,The sound quality was not good as per the price.It seems like sound is fading away. Also while wearing it seems like it is hurting the ear.
5,Would recommend
1,Very very bad quality. It stopped working after one month. Useless product.
1,Sound it is great but you don’t have any comfort quite the opposite: it physically hurt the ears you need to stuck them so they will not fall (it will hurt and you always will be afraid of them falling).Not practical buttons as well.I wish I have never wasted my money on this and the company to have never created such a horrible product.What a regret.
1,Battery gets over in 2 minutes
1,Sound is pretty poor and not very loudBluetooth drops outCheap and not so cheerful but then again sub £20
5,Toller Klang super Preis Leistung
5,Its small but voice quality on call is perfect. Handy recommend to all
1,Soy fan de la marca SKULLCANDY estos auriculares són una auténtica decepción. No encajan en el oído se caen. Apenas dura la batería. no tiene un gran alcance. Mal. He comprado unos Redmi Buds por 2990 que són todo lo contraio un diez!
1,I’ve put these buds in charge 3 times until the LED changes to green. Everytime I use them I hear “battery low” and about 10 mins later they die. Do yourself a favour and buy a proper pair of buds from a decent brand!
5,
5,It is an amazing product especially considering the design and sound quality over its price really happy with it.Only one thing I have a Lenovo laptop it keeps disconnecting with it sometimes but rest of my devices it's working perfectly.
1,mit abstand der schlechteste Support den ich auf Amazon jemals erhalten habe!Nach 3 Monaten bereits defekt gewesen keinen Cent wert!
2,The worst ever I have tribe were already broken I ordered 2 time and it was so worst
2,Damaged box
1,Microphone  not responding sometimes please do asap please
1,Right ear bud is loosing sound need a replacement
1,Ganz schlechte Qualität! Hört sich total „blechern“ an! Habe ich umgehend zurück geschickt! Die Rücksendung ist am 05.04. angekommen! Heute 29.04. habe ich  mein Geld immer noch nicht zurück erhalten! Ganz mies! Ich würde da nicht kaufen!
5,Good product....sound quality could be better
1,First it will work perfectly but after 1 month battery life is very less and sound quality drops
2,One ear buď stopped working not recommended
5,Nice sound colour and quality. Fit ear nice stay snug even when perspiring.
5,Sound quality is good
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             This product is not working after one day of delivery
1,Very bad purchase. The button controls are difficult to operate while in use. The sound quality is bad and the whole music experience is ruined. I have used buds from other brands this one is by far the worst.
1,They said it has total battery life of 12 hours (10+2) 10 hours in  ear buds case and around 2 hours in ear buds itself but i didn't get the case charging of 10 hours they cheated... And moreover they provided me a used product. Shame on you Amazon team.
1,My earbuds is not working and charging is not working some times and songs sometimes stucks not comfortable in my ear😔😔
2,Son chulos y tienen buen diseño e insonorizan bien el exterior aunque el sonido es justito en calidad
4,I was interested to compare these to my existing ear buds which were probably twice the price a couple of years ago.  My immediate reaction was that I liked the charger case.  It closes magnetically and the buds also seat themselves magnetically - far better than my existing ones.  These paired fine with both my phone and my tablet (I watch sport on the tablet quite often).  There is no app that goes with these and you don't get treble/bass type tweaks as far as I can tell.  However the sound I thought was pretty good for something inexpensive.You do need to get used to the controls however once I did I found them simple enough.  You get a leaflet with the buds that have the basic controls on.  I guess at times I found them a little insensitive but that may be me getting used to them.  Strangely "pause" didn't work on the BT sport app but that is probably a "feature" of this indifferent app.  The buttons (one on each side) worked with everything else.  One thing I did like with these was the fact that you can use just one bud - either of them.  An annoyance with my other pair - Jabra - is that you can't do that.My biggest issue here is battery life I think.  On these it is pretty poor compared to much of the competition.  Anyone using these a lot would probably fine this an issue.  For me it comes under the heading of "OK" I guess.  I think I may well use these more than the Jabra now.  They are probably more comfortable and easy to use for good enough sound.  Probably 3.5/5 but I'll call it 4.
5,Awesome quality for the price.
2,the bass iss too low and the volume in games is also low....!!
4,I used Skullcandy headphones throughout my childhood and they were always the ones to have due to their quality. It’s been a while since I’ve used a Skullcandy product so when I saw these I was excited to give them a try. The product looks the part with a cleverly designed charging case that displays the earphones. The battery life is strong and has been enough for me to listen to podcasts every night for hours without needing to re-charge too frequently. Each earphone has control buttons on and holding one down also powers the headphones on/off. Unfortunately I found the audio quality to be very poor and ‘tinny’ I have used lots of cheap non-branded wireless earphones and they all have had of equal audio quality if not better yet have cost me less. If you’re not an audiophile then I wouldn’t worry to much but don’t buy these expecting any strong bass.
1,This is the worst quality product I have ever used I think it is fake
5,Comfortable and well made!Great sound quality and great to be use every day!Fast connection!Recommended it!
1,These worked great but since the end of December (not long after purchase) they've started to glitch. They don't disconnect when you put them back in the case any more which means the battery runs low and because they don't connect to the case they don't charge. Waste of my money unfortunately.
2,Not Worth...
1,Purchased to listen to podcasts while walking the dog have never had an issue with any of my other Skullcandy headphones but these do not stay in I've used all three tips even sharkfin tips purchased online and they still come out pointless purchase.
2,Dislike
1,I was disappointed with the seller sending in a renewed product instead of new!Product is ok but have a feeling of getting cheated by a seller of a reputed product. Hope Amazon is knowing this mal practice by seller to certain customers.
1,Terrible product don't buy it... Volume sooo low and it's not powerful... I spent my money buying it and I'm not satisfied
5,Good
1,The earphones are good but the battery life is so bad. Not sure if the product I received is bad or everyone experiences the same but not really happy with this product.
5,Wow!  Little price - great product!
5,Wow i realy like this colour structure sound all.....its my second earbuds in 3 months beacuse i like all the buds produced by scullcandy.
1,No means of fixing issue seems that Skullcandy have released a faulty design and are selling it regardless to just reap the profits and deal with returns as most people won't be bothered to send them back.Shady move for a company I previously had a little faith in.
1,Great value for money but the right one stopped working after just a month :( was very disappointed...
1,Sound quality -0Durability -0Charging quality -0Not charging more than 10%Noice cancellation -0Unhappy with this product Nd telling all buyers not to buy
1,After charging the earpods it still get switched offf while using and the voice is also not coming properly
5,Good product
1,È arrivata solo la confezione con le istruzioni ma delle cuffiette nemmeno l'ombra. Ho richiesto il reso ahimè
1,Worked for about three minutes and died! Wish I'd take other reviewers advice. Abroad so can't return.

5,Battery life good

1,If bought can't able to return them more over what is called policy is third class product it's like 100 ruppes headphones
1,Poor quality Earbuds completely damaged and replacement problem.So don't buy the expansive product On this app
1,Battery life is terrible you won’t make it through the day without charging.
1,I got them for my mum for christmas. Delivery was faster than expected quality of sound really good she loved them a lot but after a few uses they don't charge anymore.
4,I was really impressed by the sound quality of these skull candy ear buds. For the price (£35 at the time of writing) I was really impressed by the richness of the sound and depth of the bass - definitely hold their own against the echo buds and air pods (1st gen) we have in the house although (unsurprisingly not up to the quality of air pod pro). However they lose points on fit (despite having three size tips). I found they would stay in place if I was reasonably static - so great for sitting on the train but once I got out and about they wouldn't stay put. Reading other reviews some people find the fit fine - I guess it depends on the shape of your ears!
4,A name you can trust these skullcandy earbuds although I would say that they are at the budget end of the spectrum are still outstanding. Now I’m no hifi expert but I found the sound crisp and clear with great bass.The earbuds come in a tiny charging case which makes it easy to carry in a pocket or bag. The buds needed charging on arrival they took about 2.5 to 3 hours to fully charge make sure you remove the white labels from the buds before charging. Also 3 more pairs of rubber ear pieces  so you can adjust the fit comfortably. Unfortunately the buds came with the tiniest USB cable I’ve ever seen and only suitable for using on a laptop power bank or extension you have no chance reaching a wall socket with them and there was no plug supplied either.Once they had charged the red charging light went out and turned green. Remove the ear pieces from the case and pair via Bluetooth on your phone once you have paired they will stay connected so you won’t need to pair again.The usable time is advertised as about 12 hours on a fully charged case and only 3.5 hours on the buds themselves which isn’t long I’ll confirm this over the next few days and report back.The only thing that would have made this better is if the case had been Qi rechargeable but it’s a minor niggle.All in all they are great buds and I’m happy to recommend.
1,Stoped working after while n button are too hard to press when it's in the ear..it's kinda hurt your ear if you try to press the button while wearing it..Rest build quality was good enough
1,Item just arrived today. I charged them fully before use. The left earpiece is fine but the right one will not turn on at all. Can someone from SkullCandy please contact me. Really disappointed.
1,Poor quality
5,It's a descent product for the price!
1,When the earphones aren’t falling out of my ears and not hurting my ears the sound isn’t so disappointing but then the left ear decides to turn off the sound and even when I try to reload it still doesn’t work.
1,Just got it yesterday l first use after charging it worked for 2-3 mins then kept saying battery low and switched off charged it again and same happened. Don't waste your money
4,Very comfortable in-ear buds very small case with usb charger lead. The case has a small cord to attach to your keyring. They come with 3 sets of ear rubbers small medium and large. They connected really easily via blue tooth to my Mac. I normally listen to the spoken word rather than music and the voices sound crisp and clear.The earbuds are fitted with Tile technology so they can be located via the app on your phone.Amazing little earbuds for the price
3,These headphones have "average" written all over them. They're pretty cheap but it shows in build quality. The box is a bit flimsy and the design is a bit blocky. Fit is OK but I had issues with the bluetooth pairing and battery life is not great. All of those in my opinion are forgivable if sound quality is up to par but again in this case it's little more than average. Bass is a bit muddy trebles are a bit tinny and to my ears there's a harshness to the mids. They're OKish it's not that they're unlistenable by a long shot but there are much better in ear headphones in this price bracket.
5,Loved it for it's quality with given offer price.  Happy. Stylish as well.
1,Will not hold charge. Longest they lasted was 30 minutes.
1,I didn't like the sound quality of skull candy very dissatisfied😮‍💨
1,It’s such a shame as for the short amount of time they worked the sound quality was good. Unfortunately they wouldn’t hold a charge (the most I got was around 15 minutes) sent back.
2,Comfortable×0

5,Nice ear budsI struggled to connect them to my phone  at first but with a teenagers help it was actually easyThere nice and sleekThe sound is great good value for the costBattery life is amazing I use them a lot and charged lasts wellI would recommend instead of paying a lot for other brands
1,Product does not fit properly both in the case and on the ear. Sound quality is bad... Not worth the money
1,It stopped working after 5 months of usage.really disappointed
1,One of worst earbuds it won't fit properly to ur ears not value for money. Cheap plastic. I also ordered by seeing good reviews I don't know why ppl post good reviews on worst product
5,Really happy with these wireless headphones from Skullcandy. The little ear pods come in a small plastic case that is also used to charge them up with the USB cable supplied. Once charged and paired with your relevant device the pods will power up and connect automatically when you take them out of the case providing your device is within range. Once in the ear they offer a really comfortable fit and don’t move around - even when doing yoga! Perfect for popping in your pocket so you have them with you wherever you go.

5,In that price it's awesome
1,Noice cancelation is not working
1,It stopped working after 15 days. Please help me return this product
5,personally I found these very comfortable I use my Apple AirPod Pro's all the time which I've found fit OK but not great (I seem to have quite small ear holes compared to the average) these on the other hand I found fitted and stayed in my ears better than the AAP's but probably due to the fact that they're even smaller than the AAPs! which I thought were already pretty small.Anyway comfort aside how do they sound? Personally I was very surprised at just how good these are. Comparing them to the AAP's (which cost 6-7 times the price!) they told their own bass mid top all sound good... I find my APP's lacking in bass for my personal taste and feel these had more bass to them. Yes the APP's do have the edge on sound but 6x better? no. These are really very good plus for me very comfy and unlike my APP's they don't feel like they're going to fall out of my ears and need adjusting every few minutes.Set up was pretty straight forward press and hold for 3-4 secs and the phone says hi click connect and they're connected. My only criticism is you can't tell if they're on or off there's nothing to tell you I placed them back in the case and the phone was indicating they were still connected? Anyway minor grumble maybe they had.So from me these get the full 5 stars hope that helped
1,Not being charged by case and battery only runs for an hour.
1,In airpods missing battery life indicatersEarbuds switch is too hard.Charging cable is b types i  expected as c type.
1,Dont buy it. After using of 10 days it's left one has abnormal noise .
1,Waste product and loss of money and worked less then one week

5,Wow I can’t believe the size of these earbuds carry case it’s so small in fits in your pocket so easily. I really like you got a choice of earbud cushions within the pack.Very impressed with instructions as a single sheet double sided opens up to a comprehensive guide how to use charge everything you need to know with really good graphics to really show the main uses of these earbuds absolutely fantastic.USB charging cable isn’t the longest About 3 inches which is a little bit disappointed means the case when charging is it hanging from a plug or you have To use the charging extension lead which is not ideal. The battery life is on the longest but you have to appreciate the size of the unit depicts the size of the charge for me 12 hours is okay as I only really listen to music an hour or two a day and then I only where when I go out shopping et cetera turn the 12 hours is quite adequate.Overall very impressed with the quality size and even the price point of just under £35 very happy.
1,Stopped charging after less than a month. Do not buy
1,Worst product and service by amazon Regarding refund 👎👎👎👎
1,Bad product hardly we can use 5 to 6 months
3,Look these are cheap and cheerful earbuds so don’t expect sound quality to be on a par with anything significantly more expensive. Still they do the job and they did fit me well compared to some as they are quite small. The only frustration was trying to tell whether they were on or off and the buttons which I found I couldn’t operate unless I took them out of my ear.
5,I have been using these skullcandy earbuds with my new iPhone13 and they are great.They are nice and small but definitely pack a punch. The sound quality is as good as my Apple ones. The battery life is excellent too and the case holding them is great. They are comfortable to wear and stay in during exercise
1,not fitting in the ears properly… ear is hurting
1,It’s not good for your ears and after 10 minutes it’s started paining
1,my voice is not reach the other person in journey time and left bud is not fully charged

1,Very bad sound quality during call Voice was not clear at all low sound on listening music.
1,I can buy a headphone worth 500...and that will be better than this...no words to say
1,Is not working
1,No sound no bass
1,Waste of time quietest earphones ever had
5,These earphones are great they charge quickly and have a long battery life. The music quality is very good and they are small too which is a bonus as they are less noticeable in your ears. Amazing!
5,I have really enjoyed using earbuds over the last few weeks. They look great in the black design and are easy to set up and connect to devices via Bluetooth are easy to charge via the case - which is also sturdy and stylish - and the buds themselves look great and fit in the ear with ease. The sound quality on them is excellent with a good balance or bass and treble and the volume limits are also good. The buds charge quickly using the case which itself connects to a usb c cable to them mains. Charge time is usually around the 2 hour mark which gives you between 6 to 8 hours use.Overall I would certainly recommend these ear buds they are easy to use
1,No bass only flat voice very worst qualityNoone should waste money in this product
1,Not chargingWHO WILL SPEND 2800 FOR ONE TIME USE EARBUDS.....PLZ DON'T BUY....WASTE OF MONEYY....
1,Waste
5,These ear buds are excellent.The sound is very good good balance.These ear buds are very comfortable they are very small so fit in your ears comfortably.  They are comfortable for me and believe me that is not easily done there are so many ear buds which I can't wear because they feel horrible or keep falling out so I'm really pleased to have found these.With a full battery charge you will get around 12 hours from them.There is a User Guide in the box with the ear phones.I do hope this review has helped you.
5,Great value and good sound quality easy to pair up and recharge very portable and good battery life
1,good for music but bad audio while on call.
1,One airbud stopped working within 2 months
1,Not good sound quality
3,These are pretty basic buds from Skull Candy which are neat in size and aspect have relatively good comfort very ordinary sound and generally feel like they're a budget option which is just about reflected in the price. The real problem is the battery life which feels very short compared to many other models I've tried. The convenience of a charging case is diminished when the absolute max you can get is 12 hours in between full charges.
1,The right ear bud is found to be defective. It doesn't work.
1,Main problem in connection with phone Not comfortable to wear
1,Battery life was utter flop
1,Overall not happy.

1,Microphone is poor other person can’t even understand conversations
1,I want to refund about that items
1,No sound quality. Noise cancellation
1,Boat is way better than this crap.
3,These are fine. They are trading a bit on the name I guess. No real benefit over some non branded names and if your ears fit apple airpods well then these may not fit you as well. I found they fell out unless I was just listening and not moving (or talking walking chewing).At this price they are cheap for the brand - and don’t get me wrong they still sound good - however compared to other cheaper non branded earbuds they don’t offer anything exceptional above and beyond.So they are fine. If you love the brand and know this style of earbud fits you well I may recommend them.
1,Not satisfied with the fitting of the buds
1,It was waste of money
3,Basic earphones.Instructions are adequate.Easy to use.Sound is quite tinny.I found them uncomfortable.
1,Nice 🤷‍♂
1,No
1,Not good quality
1,Need more improvement
1,Sound quality
5,These Skullcandy earbuds deliver a good sound with a good balance right across treble mid and bass.  Nice nothing special just nice which is a good thing.  For voice calls the quality and volume is absolutely acceptable.Overall though I found it frustrating that I was constantly pushing the earbuds further in my ear as I attempted to use the button on each stem.  Perhaps that will change as I get used to them.  Having to manually power off is new to me too.Packaging is professional which is what you would expect from a Skullcandy branded product.  It makes you feel as though you’re purchasing a premium product.Inside contained :- 2 black bluetooth earbuds inside a charging case- Short USB A to micro USB charging cable- 2 spare pairs of earbuds (3 sets in total each pair a different size)- User guideSo far so good 👍These are really small / compact wireless earbuds completely without wire.  Like AirPods but flatter smaller and probably lighter too. They are really small. See the picture of them compared to a one pound coin.The charging case is and feels plastic.  It opens and importantly closes firmly but it does not seal magnetically.The stem is small but you’re still able to hold it between two fingers. Additionally each stem has a ‘button’ that you press for functionality.  Each earbud feels as though they are well made albeit plastic and light.Once fully charged pairing is simple and automatic simply select “Dime 2-black” within the Bluetooth settings. Note that you have to manually and individually power on both left and right.  This is important because the reverse is also true. You must power these off as they will not automatically power off when you put them back the case.  Easily done though as the case has two holes which the stems perfectly fit into and the function button is accessible so it’s easy to power each earbud off whilst they’re in the case.Both earpieces in ear and pleasingly I can play or pause go back to previous songs or skip songs.  Play/pause from either earbud long press the right bud for the next song long press the left earbud to go backwards. Double press for volume (left = decrease volume right = increase).  Either earbud can be used to answers calls.I found the button a bit challenging sometimes with me having to press harder than I probably should and this meant pressing the earbuds further into my ears.Sound quality ...It’s a good sound with nothing to really complain about. It’s well balanced.  Sound is delivered in stereo (should be an obvious point) and it is very well balanced across the music spectrum - treble mid and bass. Bass included.  It’s also worth mentioning that the volume is loud too. Not louder than most but I have encountered earbuds where the volume is too limited. These Skullcundy’s are not.  Everything is good. Not spectacular not fancy but good nonetheless.  A point to note is that you can use just one earpiece should you prefer.No cutting out whatsoever and they stay in well.Phone call quality is good too. I could hear clearly and could be heard clearly too.Battery life seems to be a divider of opinion. These will give you up to 12 hours of play - 3½ hrs via the earbuds and a further 8½ hrs via the case.  The earbuds battery life is fine for me (airpod pros only provide about 1 hour more). The real issue is the case which delivers one of the lower charges I have encountered. That said the sum of the parts will see me through an entire week without needing to recharge the case.Finally these are IPX4 - rainproof and sweat-proof.  They have tile finding technology and as mentioned earlier can be used individually.At the current price I am actually loathed to mark them as 4 star although I could have based on my button challenges and the need to manually power these off !!If this review has proved helpful please do let me know by clicking the below ‘helpful’ button.  Thank you.
1,No me gustaron
1,COMPRE LOS AUDIFONOS EN AGOSTO 2021 Y PARA DICIEMBRE YA NO FUNCIONABA UN AURICULAR.MUY MALA CALIDAD
3,These are great for music I personally think it’s great value for the price; but I had a lot of issues with it when talking on the phone with them on people tell me the sound keeps breaking off or their can’t hear me properly 95% of the time.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Súper prácticos era justo lo que necesitaba sin gastar mucho y sin arriesgarte con una marca china que se descomponga en 1 semana. Lo único malo es que son un poco incómodos después de varias horas y el audio no es premium pero se escucha bastante decente.
5,Perfect fpr the price. I use it to listen to my online lectures and with the noise cancellation I can listen to my prof wherever I am
1,No me gustaron
2,Los audífonos me llegaron defectuosos no sonaba el izquierdo el diseño es muy práctico y el sonido es de calidad media se escuchan mejor y más alto cualquier audífono alambrico de un precio un poco mejor.Si ubieran funcionado los recomendaría ya que el precio es bueno.
2,Second pair of Bluetooth wireless earbuds I have owned. I like the little charging pod I don't like how often I need to use it! I have found them difficult to pair with an older laptop as well. Can't be done without putting one in charger and then removing to initiate Bluetooth pairing. A button to initiate pairing would be an improvement! Wouldn't recommend these overall.
5,La verdad me han gustado mucho los audífonos dude un poco en comprarlos por los malos comentarios pero la verdad yo tengo cero queja se escuchan muy bien y su funcionamiento van muy adecuado a su precio los recomiendo ampliamente la batería no dura todooo el tiempo que señala en la descripción pero para nada es mala.
3,
4,Llevo un mes usándolos y la verdad me sorprendieron tiene una buena calidad de sonido además de que tiene un buen aislamiento de sonido exterior (los he usado en el transporte publico y en carretera). Son fáciles de vincular tanto para celular como computadora y el micrófono es pasable. Un poco incómodos al principio pero ya con el tiempo me acostumbre. Para el precio que tienen la verdad son muy buenos.
5,El modelo Dime cumple en relación calidad/precio. Sus funciones son muy básicas pero su funcionalidad es excelente. Como comparativa tengo los Indy y su sonido es muy cercano a ese modelo con bajos apreciables profundidas y claridad así como el aislamiento sin ser activo funciona muy bien. La poca duración de batería y el diseño abierto del case son sus puntos más bajos. Aún así los recomiendo mucho si buscan una opción accesible y de gran calidad de audio y ergonomía.
4,Son muy buenos pero tengan cuidado pedí dos pares y solo me llego uno en el transcurso de la entrega se robaron un par de audífonos que encargue:(
1,He usado muy poco tiempo los audífonos y les he dado un buen trato pero aún así al audífono derecho o no le dura nada la batería o simplemente no carga además se desconectan fácilmente hasta por moverme por lo que ya no me son útiles.
4,Como siempre Skullcandy no decepciona. Los earbuds son cómodos pequeños y fáciles de manejar. El único pero es la relativa poca capacidad de la batería.
4,Me agrada como se escucha me parece un muy buen producto para el precio que tiene solo que la distancia de conexión por Bluetooth no es muy grande
4,Lo que no me gusta es que el micrófono es malísimo para llamadas y no es compatible con Google assistant
3,Me agrada el sonido aun que hasta el momento aun no me adapto por completo ya que se me caen de los oídos incluso con las gomas mas chicas hay agarrar el modo de ponerlos y a veces cansa los oídos por lo misma razón.
3,La duración de la batería tanto de la caja como de los audífonos no dura lo que dice. Y son algo o cómodos. Pero por su precio están bien
5,Estoy sorprendido con lo practica que es la presentación y empaquetado del producto muy bien optimizado el tamaño de su caja.En cuanto al diseño espectacular agarré el color negro porque se me hace el más normal.Y la calidad de sonido es muy perfecta se están usando en celular (Samsung A30).Muy muy sorprendido.El único punto "malo" puede ser la entrada para cargar que es Micro USB pero nada que afecte al producto. Se actualizará la calificación conforme se vaya usando y pase el tiempo pero para ser las primeras impresiones ofrecen demasiado.
1,I received these as a Christmas gift.  My first impression was that they fall out of my ear extremely easily regardless of which earpiece size I use.  After about a weeks use they stopped automatically connecting to my phone then after about a month they stopped turning on automatically when removed from case.  A little while after that the right earbud stopped turning on all together and now the left earbud turns on but will not connect to any device.  Complete garbage.
4,Me gustó porque están pequeños y tienen un sonido parecido a los jib true lo malo se sienten corrientones como de baja calidad quién sabe en el futuro

4,A la fecha de hoy 24/01/2022 por lo regular uso los audifonos alrededor de hora media por dia hay un punto en el que si se vuelven incomodos pero depende como los acomodas en el oido.Por la forma que tienen dan una buena cancelacion de ruido.Los tengo vinculados a un celular asi como un nintendo switch y en ambos equipos funcionan bien.Algo que me sucedio recientemente es que los deje de usar los guarde en su caja con alrededor del 70% de bateria (segun lo que me indicaba el equipo) y al dia siguiente estos ya no tenian carga. Los cargue ese mismo dia y ya funcionaron bien pero si fue algo que me parecio extraño. Seguire usandolo y actualizare en el futuro esta reseña.
5,Los compre ya hace dos meses y no he tenido ningún problema recomendables audífonos
5,Qualités du son wow
5,Great price and awesome quality.  I love these.
5,Connect good
5,i  bought  for  my  son  birthday.  he was  happy  with  it.thanks  guys
3,Good sound quality very short battery life.  Couldn’t keep them in my ear they work great for my 12 year old.
5,I got these last December and over that time I ran into a few problems but nothing too serious until now my right ear bud won't charge properly I'm not sure what's wrong with it it'd say it's at 90% or 80% after a full night of charging then a few minutes later it'll go "battery low" then die/disconnect I looked at the case and earbud they both seem fine I'm not sure what the issue is but the left one is still working fine
1,These were pretty okay throughout the first few weeks of the purchase but their sound quality along with its battery life began disappointing me. Even for the price these earbuds are not worth it. I have used them for 4 - 6 months in total and they did not serve well as intended. They will only serve as a piece of plastic and wired components after a decent time of use. They also get dirty very easily because of its "unique" design.
5,Muy buenos relación calidad precio el sonido es  decente
5,Connect good
1,Simplemente el audicular derecho no prende y se desconcectandel dispositivo al que se supone está conectado.
5,Great price and awesome quality.  I love these.
4,Bueno
5,Great brand and great product  I stand my skull Candy no complaints at all.
1,Says fully charged battery died within 20 minutes. Very disappointing. Would not recommend.
5,i liked the battery life
5,Fit great sound great and priced great so stop humming and hawing and push the buy button.
5,I am satisfied with these. The fit can be a little more comfortable though.
2,Sound quality is pretty sub par. Cheap plastic feel. Returned.
2,Sound quality is pretty sub par. Cheap plastic feel. Returned.
2,Al inicio funcionaban muy bien y por el precio estaban increíbles pero al mes y medio empezaron a tener problemas para cargar los audífonos ya que los pines de carga fallan o ni hacen un buen contacto y eso hace que los audífonos no carguen y se conecten al teléfono en inmediato y la poca batería que tenían se termine sin que te des cuenta
3,La duración de la batería tanto de la caja como de los audífonos no dura lo que dice. Y son algo o cómodos. Pero por su precio están bien
3,Están bonitos ligeros y cómodos peeero se escuchan muy bajito. No los recomiendo para hacer ejercicio. Los tuve que regresar.
3,Me agrada el sonido aun que hasta el momento aun no me adapto por completo ya que se me caen de los oídos incluso con las gomas mas chicas hay agarrar el modo de ponerlos y a veces cansa los oídos por lo misma razón.
3,I really liked these maybe it was the pair I got or maybe it was an anatomy issue but they scratched up my ears and I had to stop wearing them.
5,El tamaño es bastante cómodo y con su cuerda es bastante útil yo no los uso muchas horas continuas así que nunca he tenido problemas con la batería lo único malo es que el estuche no te indica el nivel de carga que tiene y son bastante cómodos
4,Están muy buenos el precio es el correcto no te venden una maravilla pero Estanbien
4,Como siempre Skullcandy no decepciona. Los earbuds son cómodos pequeños y fáciles de manejar. El único pero es la relativa poca capacidad de la batería.
4,Buen precio. Una calidad de ensamblado muy buena. El sonido es aceptable. Aunque como todos los Audífonos Bluetooth se pierde calidad de audio entré mas lejos esten de la fuente.
4,Son muy buenos pero tengan cuidado pedí dos pares y solo me llego uno en el transcurso de la entrega se robaron un par de audífonos que encargue:(
2,En cuanto meto mi teléfono a mi bolsillo del pantalón se entrecorta el sonido
5,Perfect fpr the price. I use it to listen to my online lectures and with the noise cancellation I can listen to my prof wherever I am
5,These are the best wireless headphones ive had. they last for a full 8 hour shift at work and they fit in my tiny ears and my bfs larger ears which is awesome.
1,COMPRE LOS AUDIFONOS EN AGOSTO 2021 Y PARA DICIEMBRE YA NO FUNCIONABA UN AURICULAR.MUY MALA CALIDAD
4,This is a good decent wireless earphone based on the amount. I like how it's tiny and wireless. No strap. The quality of sound is good. Nothing spectacular.Although there are three issues I noticed.1. The connection may sometimes be on and off. Not sure if it's because they are other bluetooth devices but if you're listening to a video you may need to play back.2. The deaign of the case is interesting. I feel like if it's in our pocket then dust can go into the case. If there's too much dust buildup it may cause a slow charge.3. It doesn't have any noise cancellation feature but if you change the size of the ear pieces to a slightly bigger ear piece it almost acts as noise cancelling. However when you do that it's hard to listen to others when they try to have conversations with you.If you don't mind any of these issues then I'd say go for it. If you do there are probably better more expensive wireless earphones out there.
5,Me encantó este producto le dura mucho la batería y tiene muy buena audición
5,Sound is nice and they fit my ears nice without making them too sore which is always a problem for me. Controls are easy enough to remember. They connect immediately when you take them out of the case.
5,Muy buen producto cumple con lo dicho realmente dudo que encuentres algo mejor por ese precio lo único que me arrepiento es de no haberlo comprado antes
5,Más cómodo de lo esperado muy bonitos; quizás solo el cargador es un poco corto.

1,No carga

2,La batería me duraba menos de 30min en uno de ellos y 40min en el otro a pesar de haberlos cargado como dice el instructivo e incluso más tiempo del requerido. Solo tuve el producto 2 días conmigo porque llegó un punto en que uno de los lados ya no encendía :( No creo que sea un mal producto solamente el mío vino defectuoso.Lo regresé. Lo que hice fue hacer la solicitud de una devolución esta se hace por DHL y no tiene costo.

1,La batería dejo de cargar no sirven
2,El volúmen está bien pero no son muy cómodos si los quieres usar para ejercitarte no son la mejor opción se salen del oído. En mi caso al mes de uso el auricular izquierdo dejó de funcionar ya no carga por lo tanto no enciende talvez solo fue mi caso pero si tienes oportunidad de comprarte algo mejor hazlo al ser la versión económica de Skullcandy si dejan mucho que desear. Desafortunadamente no los pude devolver porque ya había pasado justo el mes.No volvería a comprar estos audífonos.
2,I bought these for me and my dad and we both have the same complaint: they hurt your ears bad. You have to wear them in a specific angle for it to not to hurt while you’re wearing them. So that’s uncomfortable and pretty annoying. The ear tips don't give any cushioned feel at all. Especially since the ear tips are so thin. I think it was made to have some kind of noise sealing effect when you wear the earbuds. Otherwise there’s no comfort at all. Another bad point is that even if you put the earbuds in the case (where it would usually disconnect from your device) the earbuds would randomly connect to your phone when you just want to listen quickly from your phone. So that gets annoying because it happens often.Pros:- cheap- good battery life (16 hrs with the charge from the case)- lightweightCons- really painful to wear when you don’t have it angled right- ear tips aren’t comfortable- quality of sound is average- random connection even if the earbuds are in the caseThe TL;DRI guess its to be expected to have such problems when you get cheap earbuds like these. I just had higher expectations since Skullcandy makes decent products and they did not deliver with these. And the cons of these earbuds do not outweigh the pros and the price of it. Go look somewhere else.
5,Excelente calidad de sonido no he visto que le afecte el sudor...el único "pero" es que son pequeños y se me han extraviado entre las sábanas de mi cama 😅
1,No los recomiendo para nada
2,Los audífonos se encienden solos incluso cuando están dentro del estuche lo que hace que se les acabe la batería. Compré los míos hace tres meses y ya no funciona para nada el audífono izquierdo.Básicamente son desechables no los recomiendo.

4,Todo perfecto excelente audio y materiales de construcción pero son algo incómodos
5,100% Recomendado 👌
5,Son lo que se menciona en la descripción.
3,The sound is very good for the price. The issues that I have: the tile app is more hyp useful. I have used the tile app 5 years ago and it useless then and it hasn't changed since. The controls do work but you have to push harder than normal  pushing into your head very uncomfortable so I use my phone to control them. I still think they are a buy because of the sound for the price.
4,Buena calidad
4,Buenos audífonosCumplen con su función correctamente
3,These are pretty good little headphones. Sound is pretty decent and noise canceling pretty good too. My only issue is and I don't know if maybe I got a faulty set but im finding that my right ear bud doesn't connect to the port in the case for charging too well... more than a handful of times I've went for it (I use one in at a time and I favor the right side more than the left) it had no charge even tho I KNOW I just charged them both over night. I've read the instructions and made sure it was actually off and still have this problem. I push thru but just be aware. Could just be mine? Other than that good little headphones!
3,Tienen muy buena calidad de audio pero Aún cuando les cambies las gomas del tamaño para ajustar mejor se caen con mucha facilidad a menos que no te muevas y tampoco hagas expresiones faciales y el botón para activar acciones es muy duro el movimiento.
5,Excelente audio
4,Good Earbuds so far it does the job! good sound good mic looks good. The commands work but I prefer to control it by the phone.
5,Great noise reduction excellent quality. Very happy with them
5,Es excelente ya es el segundo par que compro
3,Muy mala onda poco más de mes y medio de uso y uno de los pins de carga se daño muy mala compra no los recomiendo
3,Son buenos el audio es bueno pero no son cómodos si migras de otros audífonos son gomas a estos
1,No sirve un audifono
5,La verdad es que por el precio y la marca es un muy buen producto estéticamente son cómodos y su pequeño tamaño los hace aún más agradables en comparación con otros Skullcandy la duración de la batería es buena al rededor de unas 4 horas continuas y al rededor de unas 3-4 cargas de su estuche particularmente en mi caso lo recargo una vez a la semana aprox. Buen sonido pese a su precio sin exagerar bajos ni agudos ni distorsionar el audio para las llamadas tal vez necesites hablar un poco más alto para que el micrófono capte tu voz y pese a todo super satisfecho con el producto.
3,Tienen un buen sonido son cómodos y compactos pero el problema que tienen es que aparte de tener micro USB tienen constantes problemas de conexión y se tienen que desvincular y volver a vincular para poderse conectar
1,USB type c would have been nice

1,Fully charged it and yet it says low battery terrible voice quality and very uncomfortable to wear. Barely used it once because it's literally useless. Overall would not recommend it.
2,Fussy not easy to set up glitchy sound quality poor
5,I use this for my daily communication since i am on the go all the time.
1,LA CAJA LLEGÓ ROTA Y LAS GOMAS ADICIONALES VENIAN SUELTAS
3,Received with a missing pair of gel buds. Only 2 pairs the large pair is not in the box. Sticker seal looks like it was opened before.
5,While they're not exactly noise cancelling they work really well! Great value great sound quality and they last pretty long. I haven't timed how long they work off of one charge but when I do I'll update this review.
1,No servían
1,No servían
3,They sound great but don't fit properly..tried all the bud ends. Maybe good for just sitting but for exercising not so good
5,I like the rubbers that it comes with to get a custom fit for your ears no one size fits all. Colour options are lovley. I needed the noise canceling and wireless feature to make listening to music as a housekeeper more convenient than fighting with wired headphones.
1,Después de varias semanas de uso los audífonos hicieron un ruido como de cortocircuito mientras me ejercitaba y dejó de funcionar el derecho. Me parece que le entró sudor. Esto me lleva a la conclusión de que no son resistentes a la humedad por lo tanto no cumplen con lo que ofrecen. Fuera de eso la batería tiene una duración decente y la calidad del sonido es buena. Lástima. Hoy mismo los regreso.
4,solo le hace falta mas bajo y cansan el oído
5,Excelente opción. No tienen un sonido profesional pero tienen buena definición son cómodos y prácticos. Lo malo es que la batería no dura mucho digo si dura sus 3 horas de batalla y además lo cargas con el estuche. Además tienes la ventaja de que si se pierde uno el otro sigue funcional.
3,Tienen un buen sonido son cómodos y compactos pero el problema que tienen es que aparte de tener micro USB tienen constantes problemas de conexión y se tienen que desvincular y volver a vincular para poderse conectar
2,The charger wasn't working properly. Had to return immediately.
5,good. buy em don't hesitate cuz u won't regret it
5,The noise cancellation or isolation is the only bad feature anout these other than that these are the best bang for your buck.

Lástima. Hoy mismo los regreso.
3,La batería dura muy poco más o menos unas 3 horas por carga y la caja sólo te da entre 1 y 2 cargas.La caja tarda una eternidad en cargar más o menos entre 4 y 5 horas.Visualmente son muy atractivos el diseño es muy bonito y agradable al tacto.El sonido es decente sin más.Por lo menos para la forma de mis orejas se sienten incómodos e incluso dolorosos al usarse.Son buenos para hacer ejercicio no se caen.La conectividad es muy buena no presenta problemas.
5,Para mí parecer en general están "bien" pero no pasan de ahí siento que por el mismo precio o un poco más hay otras opciones mejores en cuestión de sonido siento que les falta más bajo los agudos bien las voces se escuchan claras y separadas de los instrumentos lo que sí es que no tienen tanto volumen como otros pero te acostumbras.Para ejercicio no los recomiendo al cien puesto que a mí en general los audífonos de distintas marcas y modelos que e probado me van bien pero estos se desacomodan tan solo estando de pie estático.En cuestión de alcance son buenos siempre y cuando no pongas una pared muy gruesa de por medio.Me han resistido buenas salpicaduras de agua.Y bueno eso es todo por mi parte no soy un profesional en esto pero me encanta escuchar mi música con la mejor calidad posible.
4,Great price point but not great for small ears. Keep popping out while eating or talking
4,Très léger . Se déconnecte parfois je ne sais pas pourquoi mais en général c'est bien pour le prix.
4,First impressions It’s pretty good consider the compact design at this price pointFor less than $40 u get what u paid for the sound quality is excellent at this price point control is not the same as other headphones in general for example double tap on right ears is volume up and single long press is skip to next track. It’s usually the other way around as far as I remember. I need some time to adapt to that. Build quality is sturdy but don’t expect it to be outstanding material is kinda cheap but what do u expect for this price. What I like most is the noise isolation and the compact design it’s a snug fit for my ears and it sealed of outside noise very well. One thing I would recommend skullcandy to improve is to perhaps makes the earbud more round so it’s more comfortable to wear long hours. But in general I think it’s a good earbuds u can take it out to abuse them in the gym without worrying you might lost or break the earbuds
3,Por el previo que se pagó sirven pero la batería no dura y se caen al correr. Materiales muy duros y de poca calidad. Esperaba algo mejor.
4,Très stable dans l'oreille
2,Debo decir que son los primeros audífonos inalámbricos que compro y la verdad me parecieron poco prácticos a la hora de subir o bajar el volumen o cambiar de canción pues tienes que apretar la calaverita y al hacerlo te lastimas el oído.También se salen muy seguido si te mueves mucho o tienes los oídos pequeños a pesar de colocarle los protectores mas chicos. Son audífonos de buen sonido sin llegar a ser muy buenos  por lo que pagas supongo que están bien pero la verdad no los recomiendo.
5,Buena duracion de la bateriaComodosExcelente sonidoExcelente compra
5,Son audífonos de excelente calidad desde la construcción hasta la calidad de sonido. Mucha gente los califica de que no tienen suficiente potencia pero es por que leen el manual.Los audífonos tienen un control de volumen adicional al del celular se podría decir que es propio. Este se ajusta dando dos clics rápidos al auricular derecho (subir) o izquierdo (bajar) para variar el audio. Una vez que ajustas eso la potencia te impresionará. Una vez que ajustas el volumen interno este no sé reinicia así que estrellita dorada a ese punto.Yo los compré en azul para mí y en negros para mi novia (esos le gustaron a ella). A mí me encantó el color azul con gris pero en ambos los acabados son increíbles.Su primer cuasi-defecto aunque es común en casi todos los audífonos de este segmento es que los botones físicos son difíciles de presionar por la cantidad de esfuerzo y siempre sientes que te sacas el cerebro en comandos con más de un clic o de clics presionados. Solución saca el adifono y haz la acción o hasta en el celular.Lo único que definitivamente no me gusta es su micrófono pero creo que es algo de lo que pecan este tipo de audífonos la calidad es regular pero recoge muchísima información del exterior. Si los usas en una habitación cerrada sin demasiados ecos suena decente. Pero si sales a la calle y hay tráfico o viento te tocará quitartelos para contestar desde el celular.En general son preciosos son muy comodos y su potencia es buenísima. Tienen una calidad de audio muy buena comparado con opciones genéricas que se escuchan metálicos sosos o les falta brillantes o potencia. Son excelentes si como yo los buscas por precio una opción de buena construcción y que principalmente los quiero para oír música mientras viajo en transporte o hago limpieza. No son para recibir llamadas o jugar en línea no los recomiendo. Y para el ejercicio no los he probado pero no me dan mucha confianza a ratos siento que se me empiezan a resbalar y caer.Creo que hasta en $600 lo valen y serían una excelente opción. Pero en los $460 que los compré son impresionantes.
4,Es cómodo pero no tanto en un par de horas lastima la oreja se cae no con tanta facilidad pero si hablas masticas o caminas más rápido de lo normal se caen. El audio es bueno aunque hace un par de días no tienen tanto volumen como cuando los adquirí pero creo que es problema de mi teléfono. Lo que más me molesta es que se desconecten fácilmente del teléfono y a veces están conectados pero no reproduce audio.
4,fine
5,Muy Buen Sonido  Skullcandy nunca me decepcióna.
2,No me gustó
3,Leí comentarios de que eran mucho mejor de lo esperado. Por el precio la verdad mis expectativas no eran muchas y las cumplieron ni más ni menos. Obtienes por lo que pagas. Los materiales son de baja calidad así como la calidad del sonido con el volumen al máximo se distorsionan mucho lo cual es entendible por unos audífonos de menos de $30 USD.Me gustó mucho el tamaño son muy pequeños y portátiles. Tienen buena separación de instrumentos y buena duración de batería. La conexión Bluetooth se interrumpe a través de una pared y a más o menos 5 metros de distancia.Son medianamente cómodos pero muy ligeros en lo personal no los usaría para hacer ejercicio porque si se me han llegado a caer.Los controles de botón en el audífono son un verdadero martirio es muy difícil acomodarse para apretar los botones lastima la oreja. Yo prefiero quitarme uno para apretar el botón o de plano hacerlo con los controles del celular.
5,Son cómodos y utiles
5,I got this headphone two years ago and it has been working non-stop since. Just charge it and it will serve you well. Just make sure to block your phone's bluetooth connection (or your laptop's) if you experience connectivitiy issues.
5,Muy buenos audífonos la batería en verdad dura 12 horas.
5,Son buenos en sonido me llego igual en la fecha estimada
5,Son cómodos y utiles
5,These are great for the price! I love how they are small and not obnoxious looking. I haven't needed them for more than about 4 hours straight but the battery lasts and I haven't had them die on me yet.  I bought 4 pairs as gifts. My only issue is that the holding case feels kind of cheap but that's not really a big deal.
1,Used multiple cords to try to charge and they never turned on. Very disappointed

5,Son cómodos útiles buenos bajos sonidos claros y batería duradera si quieres algo de bajo costo y de buena calidad te recomiendo mucho este producto
3,El sonido es increíble de eso no queda duda pero no son ergonómicos son demasiado grandes y después de un tiempo de uso los oídos duelen.
4,El diseño es muy práctico y muy ligero sin embargo el nivel no es adecuado aún en volumen máximo se escucha muy bajo con el volumen a la mitad en mi celular no se escuchaba la música tendré que devolverlos
5,Es muy bueno el sonido a veces me falla un poco el alcance después de unos 10 metros
2,
5,La duración de la batería es increíble y la calidad del sonido tambien

5,Me parece un artículo fácil de usar e instalar. Es cómodo y funciona bien

4,Por el precio está muy bien. Pero para ejercitarte o algo parecido no. Pues las medidas de los plásticos son muy pequeños en mi caso se me caen.
2,Didn't take very long at all before they developed that dollar store blown out kinda sound don't buy these.
2,Los audífonos suenan bien pero no son muy cómodos después de estar usándolos un rato y se descompuso el estuche después de 2 semanas. Los devolví y me regresaron el dinero después de poco más de una semana así que todo bien una lastima porque si me habían gustado
5,Compre este modelo en rojo y anaranjado el producto llegó rápido y en buen estado al principio pensé que el volumen estaba muy bajo o que venían en mal estado pero no leyendo el manual me percate que los audífonos tiene su ajuste de volumen y sorpresa el volumen genial y la claridad la bateria dura varios días si no se usa prolongado y la carga inicial dice el manual es de 30 min. pero en realidad con el uso su cajita cargadora te indica cuando ya está óptima la batería y se pone en verde el foquito que indica carga para mi cumplen su función perfectamente.
5,Soy muy fan de la marca Skullcandy y estos audífonos fueron los primeros inalámbricos que utilizo de la marca y no decepcionaron para nada excelente calidad/precio los audífonos no se resbalan el sonido es bueno y son muy prácticos ya que el estuche es muy pequeño y caben fácilmente en el bolsillo del pantalón. Por el precio que me costaron (los agarre en oferta) estoy muy contento con mi compra.
3,El sonido es increíble de eso no queda duda pero no son ergonómicos son demasiado grandes y después de un tiempo de uso los oídos duelen.
5,Me encantó el producto lo recomiendo
5,Excelente producto buena conexion dice que soporte hasta 10 metros y me ha mantenido conexion hasta 20m buena calidas de audio y llamadaa
5,Es muy bueno el sonido a veces me falla un poco el alcance después de unos 10 metros
5,La duración de la batería es increíble y la calidad del sonido tambien
5,Muy buenos audífonos la batería en verdad dura 12 horas.
5,I got this headphone two years ago and it has been working non-stop since. Just charge it and it will serve you well. Just make sure to block your phone's bluetooth connection (or your laptop's) if you experience connectivitiy issues.
5,Son buenos en sonido me llego igual en la fecha estimada
5,Buena relación costo/calidad

5,Son cómodos útiles buenos bajos sonidos claros y batería duradera si quieres algo de bajo costo y de buena calidad te recomiendo mucho este producto
4,Por el precio está muy bien. Pero para ejercitarte o algo parecido no. Pues las medidas de los plásticos son muy pequeños en mi caso se me caen.

4,I wasn't expecting much from these little earbuds but I wanted a cheaper option for my work commutes and something I wouldn't be (completely) broken-hearted about if I ended up losing an earbud. For the price these are actually really good. They aren't noise cancelling but I didn't want them to be. The battery life isn't the greatest but again for what you're paying it isn't that bad.I do really like that I can use one earbud at a time which is generally what I do when I'm commuting or at work. That way when one of the earbud batteries gets low I can just switch and let that one charge and then repeat the process till my day is over. It isn't ideal but it works.

5,Me parece un excelente producto uso la marca desde hace varios años y cumple bien su función dude un poco por el precio sin embargo funcionan muy bien.
5,Para el precio están bien son cómodos tienen gomitas de 3 tamaños trae una "cinta" para que lo puedas poner tu llavero buena duracion de batería buen audio se ajustan bien aun que siento que para correr se me caerían
5,Es un producto económico pero tiene buen sonido.No me encanta que tenga botones porque lastima mis oídos al pulsarlos.TIP si no se apagan o encienden al conectarlos a su case carguen el case a la electricidad y se resolverá el problema.
1,TRIED 2 PAIRS NEITHER WOULD CHARGE PAST 10%. TRIED ALL TROUBLESHOOTING POSIBILITIES AND THEY STILL WOULDNT CHARGES!! DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!
5,Tengo más de un mes usándolos y son perfectos para mí aún que su batería con uso continuo solo es de alrededor de 3-4 horas se adapta perfecto a lo que necesito...Excelente calidad en llamada muy cómodos y fácil de controlar.
5,Tres bom
5,I wanted to give a true and honest honest review about those earphones so there is.For the sound quality I would say it's pretty good. It really does the job more than any cheap earphones. Sadly they don't have noise cancelling option so yes I did heard better basses. If it's your priority you might consider buying high quality expensive ones. Though for this price they are completely worth it.I like how practical they are. First they fit really well into the ear doesn't hurt and aren't heavy at all. I like how small the case is and how it can fit every pocket. The battery hold on alright I usually charge them once a week (I use my earphones everyday).Also I can't spend a day without using the application "tile" to locate them. It's really useful for those who loses everything. I had to buy new earphones last time because I lost one so I'm happy it's not a problem I'll have anymore.To conclude I would at 100% recommend them. For a everyday use they would be perfect.
5,Super!!!!
5,Son unos audífonos muy pequeños el estuche lo ando cargando en mis llaves y va de maravilla solo está el detalle de la comodidad en el oído pero eso depende de la forma del oído de cada persona pero sin duda alguna es un excelente producto.
5,Son razonablemente cómodos basta con usar las gomas que mejor se te amolden. Quedan bien en el oído y nunca han estado cerca de caerse pero no puedo evitar sentir que se van moviendo un poco. El sonido es muy bueno y la batería es lo que dicen las especificaciones.
4,Son buenos de acuerdo al precio bien.
5,Muy prácticos buen sonido el único detalle que tiene es que el botón para acciones está muy incómodo tienes que quitarte el audífono para poder accioanrlo correctamente
5,Pros:- Renown brand- Easy to pair Bluetooth- Comes with three different size silicone tips- Sound is neutral easy to listen- Bass is good without being overkill- Hold well in ears- Matte rough surface of the plastic make these earbuds easier to take out of their case compare to those POS generic Chinese glossy case and earbuds.Cons:- To use the buttons you need to push quite hard on them and that hurts ear’s tragus as hell (extremely uncomfortable). They should have made the clicky buttons more sensitive.- No EQ settings to customize the sound to your personal preferences (the Skullcandy app does not support this model of earbuds)If you like using the onboard control buttons forget about these Skullcandy Dime earbuds and DO NOT buy them because you’re gonna HATE them! But if like me you never use those onboard buttons anyways because they’re all glitchy and annoying to use well then yes go ahead these earbuds are a great buy and you’ll love them.😊👍 If my review helped please consider giving me a helpful vote thank you!  👍😊
2,Pros:1. Sound quality is clear enough for me.2. Connection is good.3. It is real solo.Cons:1. The earbuds make my ear painful and when I am eating/chewing the earbuds fall off.2. The stem is shorter than noraml one which makes hard for grabbing from ear.3. The worst thing is that it is with press button instead of touch buttion.I have to press it really hard to start or end a phone call which makes my ear more painful..... This is the worst design ever.I have decided to return them with no hesitates. I have purchases two different sets of earbuds from AMZN before both of which are much better than this one... But I lost these small things so easy. Really miss them now.
4,Los audífonos funcionan correctamente y no es extraordinario buen costo beneficio.
4,So buenos pero el volumen y la duración de la batería no sin lo que esperaba

4,So buenos pero el volumen y la duración de la batería no sin lo que esperaba
4,Son buenos de acuerdo al precio bien.
5,Son de los audífonos más cómodos que he usado son buenos bonitos y baratos. Me gustaron mucho los compré con muchas dudas ya que no soy de audífonos inalámbricos pero de verdad que no me arrepiento la calidad de audio es buena y no lastima los audifonos embonan bastante bien en em oido y todo llego rápido y en perfectas condiciones. :)
3,Compre estos audifonos porque considero que el precio para este tipo de audifonos y de una marca reconocida era muy bueno. Mi decepción es respecto a la comodidad puede que esto dependa de la fisionomía de cada persona pero en mi caso son bastante incomodos me molestan desde el primer momento en que me los coloco y por lo mismo la calidad de sonido que percibo no es buena.
5,They are great and battery last awhile have not charged them since I received them
5,I like them. Work great. Volume could have been higher. Other than  that great buy
4,Si resisten al agua tuve un incidente donde se me mojaron mucho y con la caja y si sirvieron jaja. Eso me gusto. Muy buenos para realizar cualquier tipo de actividad. Me gustaron tiene buena duración de 2 a 3hrs. Buen sonido. Es un producto que se caracteriza por su calidad-precio.
3,Es bonito el diseño pero son demasiadamente incomodos a cada momento se salian de mi oido solitos y llegaba un momento en que lastimaban muchisimo ni cambiando las esponjas de los audifonos se notaba alguna mejora por mi parte no los recomiendo.
1,Soy fan de skull Candy son los segundos audífonos TW que compro de la marca y al igual que el modelo anterior audífonos costosos toscos incómodos y no suenan para nada bien.
5,Los audífonos tienen una calidad de sonido sobresaliente lo sorprendente es que aún así la duración de su batería es muy larga.Su material es de buena calidad y su peso es tan bajo que se mantendrán siempre en su sitio.
5,Llegó antes de tiempo y estoy muy satisfecho con el producto ya que son muy cómodos al usar
3,Son audífonos cómodos el control viene integrado en cada uno pero se deben presionar bastante fuerte lo cual no resulta agradable. Respecto a la batería no dura nada si los apagas y los dejas en su caja siempre están "cargándose" por el contrario si no los guardas se descargan rápidamente. Una carga de todo se supone que dura 11 horas pero a lo mucho disfruté de 4 horas de uso.La conectividad es aceptable siempre y cuando no adelantes de canción donde pueda haber más dispositivos Bluetooth.
3,Estos son unos audifonos de bajo precio pero que hacen el trabajo. No los compres si esperas una calidad de audio excepcional
4,While these are probably not the best earbuds I've ever used in terms of battery life or sound quality or form factor or any of that... like most Skullcandy products given the price I paid for them I feel like I got away with highway robbery because something of the quality I did get is usually much more expensive. I cherish something that just works and gives me a good idea of their worth right away and these earbuds definitely let you know that you got something at an excellent value which is exactly what you want to get from an electronic product.
2,Es buen producto de buen tamaño no se caen los audífonos el único detalle es el volumen es muy bajo y los graves no se aprecian tanto si no eres exigente en cuanto a sonido es buen producto su tamaño es pequeño muy ligero.
2,Had brought this product for its value for money it stopped working a few weeks in and the battery takes a full 8 hours to charge. 10/10 would not reccomend
5,Skullcandy Dime True Wireless In-Ear Earbuds arrived in a nice package. They are ideal for a gift.  They have some nice features:- Easy to pair and stable connection- Acceptable sound quality- Clear calls- Better than expected battery life with a charging caseReally I cannot ask for more at this price tag $29.98. Very satisfied with these earbuds.
5,I had airpods for around 2 years but then lost one of them. I bought this as a replacement instead of spending the insane amount for airpods and these are honestly really good. I got my sister a pair and she agrees as well. Only negative is they’re a little more difficult to connect than airpods lol
5,I like them. Work great. Volume could have been higher. Other than  that great buy
1,The sound is pretty good for the price. But as other people are saying here we have to push the bud very hard to control the volume and skip songs.After two months my earbad started acting weird - when I turned the power off and put them back in the charger they tried to connect to my phone again. Even after a few hours of charging right earbud didn't get charged enough saying "battery low". Then a few weeks later the right bud stopped charging at all. Very disappointed.
5,Super comfortable to wear! Noise cancellation is awesome! Louder with the iPhone for music as opposed to watching movies on the iPad but awesome for the price! Highly recommend

5,Los he usado durante una semana para emoezar como siempre gracias a Amazon llegaron en cosa de nada y bien empacados.En cuanto a su funcionamiento no le piden nada a algun otro pues cumplen con la buena calidad que siempre ha usado skullcandy el producto al ser importado viene con todo en inglés pero son super intuitivos así que si desconoces el idioma no te va a costar para nada usarlosTrae gomas de repuesto y su cable cargador.El unico problema que podría encontrarles es que yo no estoy acostumbrada a usar este tipo de auricular con gomas así que al principio me resulto incomodo y doloroso pero después de una semana estoy muy adaptada a ellos.Dandoles un uso bastante regular ((no diario y no mas de 2 hora a 3hrs al día)) me han durado prácticamente 8 días en lo personal muy bien y más que suficiente.
5,Unbelievably amazing for less than $20. Why would anyone buy AirPods when they could just buy these?
4,They are just the right size to fit in any pocket. The battery in the charging case is a great idea having them charge while you are not using them so you start with full power everytime.
3,Son audífonos cómodos el control viene integrado en cada uno pero se deben presionar bastante fuerte lo cual no resulta agradable.

3,Excelente relación precio-funcionalidad aunque venía incompleto le hacía falta una de las 4 gotas de repuesto. 🙄
5,Muy cómodos y excelentes para el momento de hacer ejercicio.Su precio está más que accesible para la calidad de audio que manejan yo colocaría a estos audífonos dentro del grupo de los Xiaomi Pods Pro y los Airpods de Apple. Considerando qué sus controles pueden ser un poco confusos  o imprecisos.Pero de igual manera conserva el propósito principal de su HiFi.

5,Llegó antes de tiempo aún siendo de importación. Compré 3 pares y sin problema sólo uno tiene el defecto que no cambia las canciones hacia adelante sólo hacia atrás.Buena relación precio-calidad (lo compre en oferta).
3,El paquete llegó un poco antes de lo esperado y con todo lo que menciona la descripción del producto incluso parece que la batería de los audífonos dura un poco más de lo que mencionan al igual que el estuche de carga dure algunos días sin conectarlo el único pero es que el micrófono que viene integrado no es muy bueno si estás en la calle se escucha el ruido alrededor y si estás en un cuarto silencioso tiende a escucharse eco a pesar de esto fue buena compra :)
3,Excelente relación precio-funcionalidad aunque venía incompleto le hacía falta una de las 4 gotas de repuesto. 🙄
5,Están muy bien vengo de unos earpods y la verdad nada que extrañar excepto que aquellos llamaban la atención de los ladrones y estos pasan desapercibidos suenan bien la calidad de audio es bastante descente y la calidad de materiales es respetable y pues la bateria dentro de lo bueno los recomiendo al 100%
4,These earbuds sound acceptable for the price but compared to more expensive pairs these are a bit tinny and the sound does feel quite a bit lifeless... I think it can be fine for younger people who are not too fussy about price and just want something to listen to and care more about the colors  options than the sound itself.
5,Es una compra que de verdad vale la pena considerar porque definitivamente es completamente increíble como suenan y que tanto duran lo que dice en la descripción todo es correcto y también viene con códigos QR dentro del empaque dónde puedes ver el vídeo de todo lo que tienes que saber de ellos y sus características principales! La comodidad al inicio es algo de lo que te vas a acostumbrar porque puede que te duelan las orejas porque el auricular es un poco grande pero después de un tiempo tus orejas se adaptan al tamaño del auricular. El aislamiento de sonido es increíble
1,This is the worst one I've bought so far. It won't fit into my ears and the battery life is 👎🏻
1,Inconfortable fait intensément mal au oreille 10min max et 2 jours de mal.. je suis pas la seule pas capable des porter y sont juste vraiment pas confortable!Qualité de son très ordinaire

5,La calidad de audio es genial solamente que la batería dura un par de horas solamente.
5,Unbelievably amazing for less than $20. Why would anyone buy AirPods when they could just buy these?
5,Okay for the price these are seriously awesome! Everyone and their grandma should have these. The battery life on these little pups are way above average and if they're the low pop them in the case for a snappy recharge. Can't tell you how many time's I was able to get these charged up so quickly before a gym session when I forgot to charge them up the night before. They're also great for the commute and a super comfortable fit. #1 purchase or gift idea!

4,La calidad de los materiales y las características son buenas naturalemente se oyen bajo aunque le suba al dispositivo después supe que el volumen integrado de los audifonos es independiente. El alcance del BT es bueno. Los botones integrados son de toque duro por lo que en ocasiones será mejor quitarte uno para poder hacer una de las diferentes funciones que incluyen
5,Holy crap buddy you wouldn’t expect things that small to be that good the battery is surprisingly long bluetooth range surprisingly far dont fall off nice fit just if youre looking for rlly nice earbuds for a rlly good price buy theseee
4,Connection is very strong with iPhone 11 no problems .  Comfort is so-so the body of the headphone is a bit large so it presses into my ear and is a bit uncomfortable.
5,Me gustaron mucho mas que los xiaomi y de otras marcas chinas
5,Me han salido buenos buena calidad como todos los skull-candy
5,Muy buenos y cómodos
5,Me gustan mucho son muy prácticos y fáciles de lleva te aíslan bien con el sonido y suenan muy bien también. Lo único que no me gusta es que no me avisan cuando la batería está baja simplemente ya no prenden y ya.

1,Ya no encienden prende la luz como si estuviera cargando pero no encienden :(
5,El sonido es muy bueno para unos audífonos inalambricos el tamaño es realmente cómodo también son del tamaño de la llave de mi carro así que cabe muy bien en la bolsa la batería aún no se me ha acabado y tengo usando los un día entero. El único inconveniente es que tienes que tener la oreja adecuada para este modelo de otra manera se te saldrá del oído si o si. Dejando eso de lado son compactos bonitos suenan muy bien si los agarras en una oferta te los recomiendo mucho. Solo ten en cuenta que si no tienes la oreja adecuada se te caerán y la única manera de medirlos es teniendolos a la mano.
5,Nice for the price.
5,Me gustó que cumple lo que promete buena calidad de sonido y material
5,Pequeños prácticos cómodos. Muy buena relación precio-calidad
5,Me han salido buenos buena calidad como todos los skull-candy
5,Ligeros fácil de conectar buen audio y muy buen precio
5,Tienen un excelente sonido además son cómodos yo los utilizo en el trabajo y la pila les dura buen tiempo y la cancelación de ruido es muy buena
5,worth your moneygood for petite ears good audio quality
5,Se escuchan perfectamente.Son rápidos para emparejar.De repente se llegan a salir del oído (después de un tiempo determinado).
5,Excelentes en cuanto a calidad precio no son tan cómodos pero en general son buenos
4,El producto está muy bien lo único que le falta para estar perfecto es que si entrada de carga sea Tipo C fuera de eso está muy bien buen sonido buenas funciones y comodos
5,They hold the battery pretty much full day with continuous use with smaller case than EarPods
5,Très satisfait!
2,Sirven bien para escuchar podcast pero para musica son terribles no tienen nada de bajos
5,Me gusto el sonido.  Y sin tamaño ideal
5,Se escuchan perfectamente.Son rápidos para emparejar.De repente se llegan a salir del oído (después de un tiempo determinado).
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 It is a fine buds for this price range.I love the color of the Orange Yellow one. It has a pastel-ish orange to it and looks cool. The case however is really light and thin - sometimes it doesn't fully close you kinda have to press on it another time.The magnet in this case is really good tho. It hold the buds in place and doesn't make any rattling sound when you shake it.The controlling buttons are way to small to press when the buds are in your ear. You really have to press it with your nails and have to press it HARD.My ears are usually hurt after 1 hour straight wearing the pieces - and since it has a stem you have to really switch it around your ears to find the sweet spot.For sound quality it is okay the price. I'm no master in sound quality but I think the buds sound crisp and clear.** Update: I left it in my pocket and put everything in the washing machine. This baby survived!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Producto de Calidad respecto a su precio y Marca. Los Materiales el diseño y Sonido son de manera equilibrados tomando de referencia el costo. Ampliamente recomendable. Se adquirió el modelo Gold Red junto con los Black por ese motivo las fotografías muestran contraste con respecto al color y presentación apegado a mis preferencias (se intercambiaron los audífonos de su portable) 3hrs de batería en audífonos por carga completa de portable (no son touch lo cual en nada interfiere respecto al desempeño y calidad.)
4,Product is easy to use. Nice to have multiple size heads to try. Like em lots
5,My son approves
5,Buena calidad precio pero si tienes oídos pequeños es mejor considerar otros audífonos. Parecen pequeños pero en donde tiene la batería son más grandes de lo que aparentan.
5,Muy cómodos buen sonidoMuy pequeños nada estorbososNo se caen aunque ya depende de cada persona
4,Buenos a pesar de tener un mes con ellos
5,Muy barato y muy funcionales
5,Me gustaron  muy buenos audifonos.
5,Excelentes para el precio que tienen. Se conectan fácil y rapido
5,Cómodos los uso en juntas del trabajo y entrenar. Lo único es que la batería no dura mucho fuera de eso excelente
5,Excelente para hacer ejercicio se adapta muy bien.
5,La batería me decepciono un poco uno no se siente tan cómodo en general por el precio están bien
5,Cumplen con la función de escuchar música. No son aptos para hacer ejercicio ya que se caen facilmente pero sin movimiento son prácticos.
5,Calidad se sienten de muy buena calidadComodidad al principio duele la oreja después se quita ese dolorTienen buena calidad  de sonido y volumenBateria duran alrededor de 2.5 hrsTengo unos meses con ellos y son bastante buenosLes daría un 8 de 10
5,Muy buenos lo único malo es que no indica cuanta pila le queda al contenedor
5,Muy barato y muy funcionales
5,My son approves
1,Looks super cute and plastic feels high quality. However sound quality is terrible for the price. It Doesn’t sound a lot better than dollar store headphones. Doesn’t even fit the ears properly. When they are in feels uncomfortable and it feels like they are going to fall any moment which they occasionally do. I do not recommend it at all.Update: people cannot hear me when I talk on the phone if I don't yell. It is a total waste of money at this point. Will never buy this brand again.
4,Audio quality is a lot better than expected at this price point! They paired instantly to my iPhone and reconnect seamlessly every time. I like that I can use each bud individually and if you decide to use both they pair up trouble free.The only issue is that they are somewhat awkward fitting. I find them more comfortable to wear upside down on the wrong ears! Ymmv.
4,Son buenos pero después de un rato cansan los oidos
4,Proporcionan buena calidad de audio pero despues de un rato de traerlos colocados en el oído suelen ser algo incomodos y se empiezan a caer.
3,Los audífonos funcionaron bien por 3 meses pero después de eso comenzaron a tener problemas para conectarse después no se vinculaban y al final dejaron de funcionar. Me decepcionó que una marca tan reconocida brindará un producto tan poco duradero
4,Muy cómodos muy buena conectividad y buen sonido. Su punto débil es la duración de la carga de la batería. Muy poca.
5,Lo conecto a Mac PC android iOS sin problemas. Pensé que el sonido sería muy bajo por el tamaño pero es muy bueno. Puedo escuchar podcast hacer llamadas ejercicio y básicamente traerlos todo el día.  Me encanta que no tengas que descargar ninguna app para que funcionen y que se puedan usar individualmente comoanos libres.
5,Es un buen producto con buen sonido y buena bateria aunque siento que se acaba muy rapidoalgo que no me gusto fue la ergonomia el audifono derecho me queda bien pero el izquierdo no se amolda de forma correcta y a veces se me cae
5,Muy buenos la verdad si no eres tan exigente
5,Valió la pena la compra de estos increíbles audífonos. Me llevaron en una cajita muy completos tal y como aparecen en la imagen del producto. excelente diseño tanto de los audífonos como de la base donde se cargan y se guardan. Muy compactos. la base solo la he cargado una vez desde que me llegaron los audífonos se cargan en su misma base. La carga dura mucho. Ya tengo 2 semanas con el y hasta la fecha me han funcionado muy bien excelente sonido no escuchas nada de afuera. Sinceramente estos audífonos eran lo que estaba buscando y lo encontré. Los recomiendo ampliamente. Vale la pena cada centavo que gasté por ellos.

4,Very good for the price  sound is good not great no ANC performs as advertised.
3,La calidad de audio es muy bueno pero el volumen es bajo aún al 100% no se escucha fuerte como unos alambricos de la misma marca adicional a eso son relativamente grandes y después de un rato se caen
4,Bought these for my 12 year old nephew with small ears and he loves them.  Says they sound amazing and fit his ears well with the smallest tips.  He would recommend
3,I especially like the case and charging system - it's slick and simple.  The case plugs into my USB the earbuds snap in magnetically and connect and disconnect (on removal or replacement in the case) automatically.  The sound is good.  The problem I have is that the fit in my ears isn't great - my ears are small and these tend to fall out occasionally.  I use them for yoga (a headset doesen't work my hearing isn't great) and it's a nuisance but I can make it work.  So good product works very well but the fit for me at least is not ideal.
1,Se escuchan demasiado bajo y no son lo que esperaba
4,En general cumplen con su función se escuchan bien y cumplen con el aislamiento de ruido. PERO no viene los artículos completos: geles para los oídos (S L) solo llegaron con los M montados y no traía el cable de carga micro USB ni la guía de usuario.
4,Teniendo en cuenta el precio del producto creo que vale la pena. La calidad del audio como punto de referencia es más baja que la de los EarPods de Apple pero mejor que la de los audífonos genéricos que puedes encontrar por menos de $100 es decir no es muy nítido el sonido pero tampoco mete ruido.Si se va a usar por ratos y solo para ciertas actividades es un buen producto.
1,Mine lasted 6 months before they stopped working. Battery lasted me about 5 hours the volume was pretty low in my opinion but not terrible. I have since switched to aux adaptor and I am probably not going to buy another pair of these
5,Los compré para regalo en lo personal me encantaron dudaba en hacer la compra pero valió la pena calidad excelente audio muy padre y por un precio increíble. Los recomiendo.
4,Están bien relación calidad precio duele la parte de arriba de la oreja aunque con el tiempo te acostumbras un poco
3,Se escuchan bien pero no fuerte..su sonido de la escala del 1 al 10... le doy 7
4,I like them
1,Complete junk
4,For the price it’s okay but the microphone is werd you ear everything but not the voice haha
1,I was disappointed with this product. When it worked it sounded fine. However there were times when the connection was spotty and broke up. Additionally when I was in Microsoft Teams meetings or Zoom meetings the persons in the meeting could not hear me clearly or the sound broke up very badly when I was speaking. The length of time when fully charged was also disappointing as it would go down after about 2 hours of streaming. I had to return the product and will be going back to a wired connection.
1,El diseño es bueno se adaptan bien al canal auditivo. Pero el audio es muy malo. Es muy bajo el volumen (aun subiendolo al máximo y no soy de escuchar a tope) malo graves y bajas. Se escucha si estuviese muy lejos la música.
3,Personalmente no me quedaron ni las gomas mas pequeñas yo necesito gomas aun mas pequeñas en consecuencia se me caen todo el tiempo el sonido es aceptable el precio a mi me costaron 350 y tenían descuento
4,Very good for the price  sound is good not great no ANC performs as advertised.
5,Excelente producto llegó un día antes de la entrega establecida.Cumple con las funciones que hacen mención en la publicación.
3,Me ha encantado el producto desde que lo compre lamentablemente no sé si es parte de los materiales con los que están hechos los de estos colores pero mi hermano ha comprado los rojos yo los cuido mucho mejor y la caja al cerrarla dejan de cargar los audífonos ya los tengo que estar apretando desde las ranuras para que vuelvan a cargar pero el sonido y la batería para el precio están de maravilla
5,El audio no es premium pero hace un muy buen trabajo y destaca mucho en los bajos los materiales los siento de buena calidad y son cómodos por tiempos prolongados la duración de la batería es buena teniendo en cuenta que son audífonos para la ocasión un estuche muy bonito y compacto su punto débil es el nivel de volumen ya que lo siento bajo aún llevándolo al máximo esto se compensa un poco por la buena canselacion de sonido que tiene.Aún así lo recomiendo
5,Excelentes en calidad precio el audio es muy bueno el tamaño y la ergonomia. aislan bien el ruido exteriory soportan perfectamente las salpicaduras no los recomiendo para ejercitarse porque pueden caer aunque el ajuste es bueno lo unico es que la bateria es de duracion algo corta pero definitivamente son una excelente opcion
4,Bought these for my 12 year old nephew with small ears and he loves them.  Says they sound amazing and fit his ears well with the smallest tips.  He would recommend
3,Se escuchan bien pero no fuerte..su sonido de la escala del 1 al 10... le doy 7
3,Other then the sounds quality being not so good the build quality is pretty good tbh better then I thought plus for the price but overall if you aren't picky with sound quality these are a good choice because they last up to 12 hours and the build quality is very good plus its waterproof!!

3,Well I have to say these earbuds are decent quality the sound quality is definitely lacking but for $40 earbuds I'd say you definitely get what you would expect for that price.
5,Se escucha bien y el precio esta súper bien

5,Prácticos y muy buenos!!!!!!
5,A mí me salieron muy buenos para el precio la verdad si conviene. Son para un uso casual
2,Su vo
1,I bought these to run with I couldn't keep them in my ears walking from one room to the next. No idea how they sound as they're not off any use to me if they cannot stay in
5,Excelente sonido con excepción de la duración de batería muy cómodos. Los recomendaría por tener un muy buen precio
5,Son muy cómodos para correr y hacer ejercicio. La verdad no tengo problemas en ningún aspecto 🤞🤞
5,A mí esposo le gustaron mucho. Son de buena calidad la batería dura lo suficiente
5,Tengo tres meses con ellos la batería dura bien tienen buen sonido. Lo único es que se salen de los oidos son buenos para caminar con ellos más no para correr o mucho movimiento al menos a mí se me salen y después de mucho tiempo puestos pueden llegar a ser incómodos. Pero por el precio sí los recomiendo para actividades que no requieran mucho movimiento.
5,para lo que los necesito están perfectos!!!una gran calidad de audio.
5,
4,Aún cambiando las almohadillas después de 30 minutos es incomodo.
5,Fue un regalo
5,Es súper cómodo y es una gran ventaja el tamaño tan compacto.
5,Ejercicio
5,Excelente calidad de materiales y audio
5,excelente precio en relación a la calidad
5,Tienen muy buen bloqueo de sonido externo sonido perfecto solo que si eres mujer quedan un poco grandes pero fueron un regalo y le encantaron
2,Bought these as a Xmas gift to myself. I’ve used them for 2 months and found them hard to stay in my ear even tried the different buds it comes with. Example I bent down and one would fall off. The charge is not good only lasted about 2 hours and I had to charge. Overall quite disappointed in the product.
5,No me gusto que lastima un poco el oído

5,Excelente calidad de materiales y audio
5,son pequenitos y suena genial
5,excelente precio en relación a la calidad
5,Que tienen un buen sonido son cómodos fáciles de transportar y la batería dura mucho tiempo.
4,Lo que mas me gusto fue su case es super compacto y estéticamente me gusta he tenido algunos problemas a la hora de hacer ejercicio ya que varias veces se quieren caer por último el sonido no es excelente pero esta bien diría que está promedio
5,Todo bien fáciles de usar muy cómodos
5,Muy buenos audifonos aunque si tus orejas no se ajustan a los audifonos de gomita sera complicado el utilizarlos
5,La verdad que están muy bien por su precio. (Yo pagué cerca de 400 MXN).+ Me gusta mucho lo simple que es para conectarse por primera vez con el teléfono. Ya conectados basta con sacarlos de la funda para que se enciendan y se conecten en segundos. La batería dura bastante para un uso ligero de día a día yo los cargo cada semana.El sonido es bastante bueno considerando el precio y que son Bluetooth.+/-  Los controles para cambiar el volumen cambiar canción pausar etc. Son muy complejos puedes hacer todo con sólo tener dos botones uno en cada audífono. Me gusta que puedes hacer todo con sólo usar esos botones pero hay muchas combinaciones que debes de recordar además de que cuando presionas los botones empujas el audífono dentro de tu oído y puede llegar a ser muy incómodo.-Lo único que no me gusta mucho es que después de un tiempo te cansan bastante. Son algo incómodos para usar por mucho tiempo. Y serán más incómodos si tus orejas son pequeñas. Es la única desventaja que les he encontrado después unas semanas de uso.Debatí conmigo mismo si dejarle 4 o 5 estrellas. Le dejo las 5 porque por el precio no hay nada mejor. Compré estos audífonos porque mi nuevo teléfono no tiene entrada mini jack 3.5mm. Si quería usar mis audífonos de cable tenía que comprar un adaptador para USB tipo C que costaba 250 MXN. Por sólo 150 pesos más pude comprar estos audífonos por eso estoy muy feliz con mi compra.
5,Que tienen un buen sonido son cómodos fáciles de transportar y la batería dura mucho tiempo.
4,Lo que mas me gusto fue su case es super compacto y estéticamente me gusta he tenido algunos problemas a la hora de hacer ejercicio ya que varias veces se quieren caer por último el sonido no es excelente pero esta bien diría que está promedio
5,Los encontré en un precio excelente.No esperaba una calidad de sonido suprema porque es entendible que por el precio  no obtengas algo premium  pero barato no significa siempre malo.Skullcandy cumple y la verdad estos audifonos desempeñan excelente  se han caido  mojado y es la fecha en que funcionan de forma excelente  la pila me dura semana y media . Añadiendo que los uso todos los días
4,Realmente no me quejo la conexión es muy buena y el sonido es decente
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Lo que no me gusto es que los graves no son tan profundos
4,Cuando hay muchos auriculares(inalámbricos) cerca hay interferencia. Todo lo demás muy bien.
2,These earphone will hurt unless you have huge ears the shape of it is way to big and unatural it's a if they made these uncomfortable on purpose returning these for sesh at least theyr way more comfortable and have better connection also I'm pretty sure that theres no delay when playing games
4,For the price they sound just fine. You can attach them to your keys. The case includes tile so you can easily find them if they are misplaced or stolen. The earbuds themselves are sleek good looking. Battery life is not the best however and includes a micro usb charger and not usb c unfortunately.
5,I just needed a pair of cheap headphones for the gym. These are good; i’d buy them again
5,Vale la pena lo que pagas
1,Calidad de sonido el esperado para está marca nada que sorprenda. Muy incómodos. Las gomas lastiman las orejas ninguna medida ajusta bien y el diseño del audífono hace que se resbale y se caiga tengo diversos audífonos y no es cuestión de la forma de la oreja. Valen la pena si tú intención es comprar unos audífonos que puedas perder en algún momento y no te duela en el bolsillo.
4,Por precio creo que es una buena compra la batería en ocasiones te llega a durar más de lo que esperas y no son estorbosos. Lo malo es que en ocasiones cuando haces ejercicio o estás mucho tiempo en movimiento suelen salirse del oído pero creo que por el precio lo vale. No son touch.
5,Excelente
3,Work well but could be louder and less hard in ear. A little uncomfortable but wearable.
1,Will be returning. Previously purchased many Bluetooth headphones and earphones around same price point that had double and triple the battery life.It barely lasts 1-2 hours!
5,Llegaron rápido y sin ningún problema y el producto tiene buenos graves
1,Automatically gets disconnected and connected. Also the battery gets drained up quickly.Won’t recommend to buy it!!!
2,Siempre se caen y su volumen no es muy bueno
4,La duración de la batería de los audífonos tal cual es de solo 3 hrs lo cual se me hace muy poco comparado con otros productos de precio similar. Igualmente el volumen del audio se me hace un poco bajo.
3,What I found good:Battery life - 4-5 hours between rechargesSound quality - not the best ever but good. Had to crank up the volume though.Case is very small & pocket-friendly with no weird shapes or protrusionsConnection is great at short range. Lots of other reviewers reported problems but I haven't had any.Price is very reasonableWhat doesn't work for me:These don't fit my ears comfortably. I could only wear them for about 50 minutes before my ears just hurt too much.Noise cancellation isn't very good at all.Conclusion:These might work for you or they might not. Do some research then decide if these are going to meet your needs or if you should look for something better.
5,El tamaño los hace super transportables  y discretos se escuchan bien y cancelan bien el ruido
5,Todo genial quiero otros
2,El sonido agudo es muy bueno sin embargo los bajos son prácticamente inexistentes y siento que se quedan un poco cortos en volumen.
3,Se escuchan muy bien pero son enormes y nada ergonómicos lastiman los oídos.
5,Excelentes audífonos nunca se acaba la batería... recomendados al 100 para ejercicios cardiovaculares.
1,El paquete venía sin los audífonos solo contenía el cable y unas gomitas 😡
5,Buenos
5,Los uso para trabajar y la batería muy durable
5,I just needed a pair of cheap headphones for the gym. These are good; i’d buy them again
1,Just waste of Money

2,After two months one stopped working and won’t work at all kinda garbage quality and very plastic-cy

4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Los compre en promoción y me sorprendieron bastante que si bien no obtendrás las comodidades de un gama premium son perfectas para introducirte a este tipo de audífonos. Los compre con la intención de usarlos al hacer ejercicio pero no lo he pido usar realmente no son muy cómodos si los colocas en tus oídos y hablas o masticas el auricular se sale y creo que probablemente al usarlos al correr se me caerán y espero darme cuenta.En general el sonido es bueno para su precio aunque debes colocártelos de la forma correcta y la batería dura lo que dice el empaque apenas 3 o 4 horas máximo con un volumen medio alto su empaque es práctico muy pequeño y fácil de llevar a todos lados. Si no eres muy exigente estos audífonos son perfectos para ti si buscas comodidad cancelación de ruido y larga duración busca otra opción.

1,Automatically gets disconnected and connected. Also the battery gets drained up quickly.Won’t recommend to buy it!!!
3,Se escuchan muy bien pero son enormes y nada ergonómicos lastiman los oídos.
4,they're great headphones the only problem is that they fall out easily from time to time.
4,The sound quality is ok. The battery life is ok too. For that price works very well.
5,excelente calidad de audio los bajos son super profundossuper cómodosjamás se me han caidosi es un poco molesto el botón fisico que hay que apretarlo pero pues solo es agarrarle el modosi les falta tantititititiittio más de volumen final pero la verdad yo nunca los escucharía tan alto al usarlos al 70-80% en el gimnasio es más que suficiente para estar cómodoy si nada de ruido externoduración de bateria si es buena sin embargo cuando la cajita ya no tiene carga estaría bien que te avisara o que existiera app en el cel para ver cuánta carga tienen
1,Just waste of Money
5,Muy cómodos rinde la pila el sonido es muy bueno sin problemas de emparejamiento los reconiendo
4,La duración de la batería de los audífonos tal cual es de solo 3 hrs lo cual se me hace muy poco comparado con otros productos de precio similar. Igualmente el volumen del audio se me hace un poco bajo.

4,Calidad de Audio: un 10 de 10 se escuchan con una calidad muy buena dan versatilidad entre bajos medios y agudos.Comodidad: Podría mejorar son un poco incómodos pero nada que reprochar en general bien.Duración de batería: Muy buena la carga es rápida.Los míos venían con una falla en el audífono derecho tienes que presionarlo para que se escuche y con pequeños movimientos se escuchan más bajos.Son buenos audífonos con calidad de audio no son para ejercitarse en mi opinión pero en general son buenos.
4,It doesn't noise cancel very well. It still picks up a lot of noise and for this price it doesn't do that job well at all
3,These buds do everything as advertised. Easy to pair etc. They are not loud enough for me however and the sound is just okay.  Also they fall out easily when walking or exercising.  Lastly the buttons on the ear buds are not easy to use.  Conclusion for $30 you get an okay set of ear buds with good battery life.
5,Cómodo accesible se escuchan bien los bajos a un precio razonable
3,Battery life
3,El color naranja parece más color durazno el sonido es bueno pero no cumplió mis espectativas los compré como reemplazo para unos jib true y el sonido es más bajo (comparando con los jib true) la caja no se cierra con broche magnetico usa un seguro mecánico que no se que tanto dure
4,Sólo que son muy grandes y por lo tanto muy incómodos entonces da miedo de que se salgan. En llamadas me llegan a decir que no me escuchan o que me escuchan lejos
5,Yo también pensé que estaba mal porque subí el volumen a todo en mi cel y aún sonaba bajo. Después de investigar sucede que aparte se tiene que ajustar desde el aparato apretando el botón del derecho 2 veces rápido para subir y del izquierdo para bajar.¡Suenan muy bien lean el manual!
3,El audio es bastante decente el problema es cuando usas el microfono al menos para mi en la computadora detecta 2 dispositivos dimes stereo y freehands audio al usar el microfono solo se puede escuchar por freehands el cual suena bastante mal una pena. Si no vas a usar el microfono no hay problema
4,Je trouve que pour l'instant c'est parfait le son est bon. Il n'y a pas de default de fabricationmais c'est juste la première journée que je l'ai alors je sais pas pour plus tard^^Mais j'aime bien!
1,Solamente me funcionaron una semana y el lado izquierdo comenzó a fallar el audio se entrecorta y ya no funciona correctamente además no harán valida la garantía ya que las compras en Amazon US no aplica y solo perderás tu dinero.
5,I have no issues with it at all. Bought one for my daughter too and she has no problem with it either.
5,It’s unreal that these are on par with there Indy evos I love the button instead of touch controls (always skipping songs…etc) the only down side I say is the 3+hr charge time but for 30$ unreal
4,Excelente sonido rápida conectividad algo incómodos después de mucho tiempo en uso. La batería no dura lo prometido pero aun así son buenos para su precio.
5,Estan super chidos les dura mucho la batería y aparte son cómodos y tienen un super sonido por el precio Lo único que no me gusto es que no tienen entrada de carga tipo C y por eso tardan demasiado en cargar
3,After years of using fake AirPod style earbuds I decided to try something a little differentSadly these done fit my ear canal. They don’t stay in.They’ve already fallen into my soup while eating lunch.Now on the search for the AirPod style with silicone ear hook that have served me well for running and working out:(
4,La batería se agota más rápido  si los utilizas para hablar por telefono
5,Son buenos llegan a ser algo incómodos después de un largo tiempo de uso el sonido es bastante bueno y no pierden calidad en uso de volumen alto. Cumple con las expectativas.
5,Son prácticos buen sonido y para llamadas el micrófono también es funcional cuando el ambiente está con poco ruido.
5,Muy buen sonido para su tamaño cómodos y accesibles.
1,Will be returning. Previously purchased many Bluetooth headphones and earphones around same price point that had double and triple the battery life.It barely lasts 1-2 hours!
5,Llegaron rápido y sin ningún problema y el producto tiene buenos graves
2,El audífono y sus gomitas no son nada ergonómicasduelen tras un rato de uso la calidad de audio es pecima use el Dolby para arreglar un poco el sonido para darme cuenta que skullcandy no sabe hacer audífonos :vy para colmo enterarme que Amazon tritura los reembolsos yastoihastalamadrequédense con mi maldito dinero
2,Sounded nice for the 3 bike rides I used them on. At the end of the 3rd ride one fell out hit my leg ad went flying into some tall grass and brush. Spent 20 minutes looking for it. Maybe if I didn't buy the black it would have stood out but lesson learned. Ordered a pair that loops over earlobe. Was constantly having to push them in while riding. Lucky they were cheap

4,Son unos audífonos que pese a su precio me sorprendió su sonidollegaron dos días antesy todo en perfectas condiciones.Algo incómodos al querer cambiar de músicao subir volumen ya que presionas un botón.
4,La batería se agota más rápido  si los utilizas para hablar por telefono
5,Bloquean todo el sonido y aparte que se escuchan super bien  recomendado para los de la vieja escuela que les gusta el base.. pero... si pueden compren la garantía que no tengo ni 4 meses y ya no sirven😑
5,Estan super chidos les dura mucho la batería y aparte son cómodos y tienen un super sonido por el precio Lo único que no me gusto es que no tienen entrada de carga tipo C y por eso tardan demasiado en cargar
1,Malisimos el diseño es muy comodo y se ajustan perfecto pero el sonido es muy bajo hay otras opciones por la mitad de precio que se escuchan al doble.
5,Los uso para trabajar y la batería muy durable
5,Los uso para mí celular y hasta el momento cumplen con su objetivo gracias
3,Se escuchan muy bien pero son enormes y nada ergonómicos lastiman los oídos.

5,Me gusto mucho el diseño y se oyen muy bien
5,Son prácticos buen sonido y para llamadas el micrófono también es funcional cuando el ambiente está con poco ruido.
5,Se los regale a mi esposo y le gustaron los utiliza para su trabajo durante 8 hrs seguidas y dice q solo lo carga una vez entonces su pila dura como 5 hrs continuas
4,Buena batería y sonidoPero duelen las orejas y se caen rápido aunque le cambié las gomas
5,Los uso para mí celular y hasta el momento cumplen con su objetivo gracias
5,La calidad de audio y el precio son excelentes además que la batería dura bastante tiempo si buscan unos audífonos de buena calidad y a un precio accesible ésta es su mejor opción
5,Son bastantes cómodos para el ejercicio y la vida cotidiana en sí la duración es buena. :)
5,Los uso para mí celular y hasta el momento cumplen con su objetivo gracias
2,El sonido agudo es muy bueno sin embargo los bajos son prácticamente inexistentes y siento que se quedan un poco cortos en volumen.
5,Ok
5,Todo genial quiero otros
5,Vale la pena lo que pagas
5,El tamaño los hace super transportables  y discretos se escuchan bien y cancelan bien el ruido
3,El sonido Excelente! Pero llevo menos de un mes de uso y se me han caído Miles de veces del oído! Sería imposible hacer ejercicio con ellos simplemente no me ajustaron he tenido que evitar que caigan al WC más de tres veces y buscarlos en el pasillo del avión. La batería dura suficiente para uso normal el tamaño súper práctico la cajita pequeña pero es muy difícil abrirla después del click (tiene un imán y ademas una pestañita). El micrófono funciona muy bien pero definitivamente los cambiaré por unos de diadema mis orejas no son para este diseño
4,Tienen buen efecto de sonido la batería dura para lo que necesitó pero para realizar alguna actividad son poco incómodos ya que se salen de su posición y los controles son un poco confusos.Sin problemas para estudiar ver una película o estar sentado escuchando música.
4,Estoy satisfecho no tuve complicaciones para enlazarlo a mi dispositivo los uso cuando voy de camino al trabajo aun siguen a prueba pero hasta ahora todo bien el producto llego a tiempo sin daños.

2,L'éttuit pour recharger les écouteur est mal fait mon ecouteur gauche ne recharge pas si elle n'est pas placer dans un angle je peu passer 10 minute a ésseiller de la placer pour enfin quelle charge
1,I got a few uses and then the right one stopped working completely. Then the left one quits half the time too. Waste of money
3,Si pero esperaba mas
5,Dude en comprar el producto debido a los comentarios que hay sobre el volumen pero la verdad es que es un volumen bastante decente no sé si las personas que tienen esas malas reseñas no sabían que se sube el volumen haciendo clic al audífono derecho si tiene un tope pero es bastante alto el volumen. Así que si tienes dudas sobre comprarlos por ese detalle no dudes más!!!
1,
5,Muy buen producto
4,4⭐ de 5Calidad de Sonido: El sonido para mi ha sido prioridad siempre mi percepción del audio es Media (ni de principiante ni de experto). La calidad del sonido y el aislamiento es ligeramente superior por lo que pagas la verdad que esperaba más de estos audífonos. No destacan los bajos. Se recomienda modificar el sonido con ecualizador.Calidad del material: es ligero no hay algo que destaquen en la calidad es muy básico. La tapa tiene que hacer clic y es difícil destaparlos y el hacer que encajen en su sitio no es tan simple ni practico. El interior del estuche se raya con facilidad. Las gomitas o cojines son muy flexibles.Botones: opino lo mismo que muchos no es fácil ni practico ya que los introduces más dentro de tus oídos y es molesto por que se desacomodan. Tiene controles básicos aunque cuando funcionas el control de Asistente de tu Celular El volumen es muy alto.CONCLUSIONES: Lo recomiendo para ser tus primeros audifonos aisla bastante bien el ruido y el sonido es aceptable es justo por lo que pagas aunque yo los conseguí en $475 tal vez no estaría ligeramente inconforme si me hubieran costado 400. Una vez leí el comentario que decía "Nunca compres audifonos para hacer ejercicio que cuestwn más de 500 pesos". Los recomiendo son aceptables ideales para hacer ejercicio son cómodos no se caen aíslan muy bien el ruido exterior.
4,Calidad de materiales  buena relación precio excelente las gomas lastiman mi oído tuve que estar cambiándolas hasta que una se adaptó  por el precio no podemos pedir un sonido excelente. Cumplen con su objetivo. Si buscas un sonido de otro nivel sube de nivel a Bosé harman kardon etc .
5,Very simple yet awesome sound im very picky about the sound of my music and they work very well great bass too!! Thank you!
3,Compré dos pares porque quería usar uno para hacer ejercicio y otro para mantener en mi habitación. Un par funciona a la perfección el otro salió defectuoso el auricular izquierdo no carga y se descarga sin prácticamente ningún uso. No los volvería a comprar. Estoy en proceso de devolución de un par.
5,Does what you need it to do. Quality make. Decent sound. Good fit. Great price
4,Algo pesados pero excelente sonido la entrega como siempre antes de tiempo y en perfecto estado
5,No puedes ponerte muy exigente  son muy buenos por su calidad que ofrecen en relación a su precio se escuchan muy bien  la verdad es que en ninguna aplicación se deforma el sonido sus materiales se sienten bien la batería del estuche te da buen rendimiento  aparte que carga más rápido los adifonos el estuche es el que tarda en cargarse  pero realmente lo puedes dejar conectado cuando no los usas y siempre irán bien  son excelentes para el día día  me refiero a si caminas  te transportas  haces ejercicio  tiempos de 1–2 horas el uso  la batería aguanta y son pequeños  puedes usar 1  te saca del apuro para llamadas manos libres . Como dije si esperas mas y te quieres poner exigente ve y paga unos de mas de 70 dlls si solo quieres tener algo que sea bueno y no eres exigente o empezar a adaptarte a audífonos que puedes perder muy fácil  puedes empezar por estos .
5,You can't get anything this good for this price. Totally worth it.
5,Super bon petit produit!! Le son est bon !!
1,One of the ear buds has a scorch mark on it from charging….
1,I can’t even barely use it for 15mins. Because low battery and doesn’t charge.
5,The first product purchased was bad because the earbuds were not being charged inside the charger case. I returned it and bought a new one just for a try and the new one is super star! Working greatly and charging well. My son loves it!
3,Good earbuds especially for sound quality and noise cancellation but the controls are nearly unusable and battery life could be better for sure. Overall definitely worth the price for good sounding earbuds
1,No recomiendo esta compra esta muy bajo el volumen de los audiófonos a mitad de tu celular el volumen es casi nulo y no tienen nada de bajeo.
1,Son muy grandes le cambié la goma a la mas pequeña y aún así se caen además el audio es de muy baja calidad no los recomiendo.
5,Es buen producto. Se vinculan rápidamente y tienen buen aislamiento de sonido. Dependiendo la forma de tu oreja puede doler un poco al colocarse y a mi parecer los botones de mando son un poco incómodos.Sin embargo estos detalles no le quitan mérito como excelente audífonos.
2,Let me preface this review by saying I've owned tons of headphones from $8 Monoprice to $1500 Shure's. Over 10 years ago I bought my first pair of wired skull candy headphones at [insert box store here]. They were GOOD for the time and the cheap price tag.HOWEVER. Hard stop. Skull Candy has their "forever return policy" for a reason. Their headphones are trash quality and break often at the 6 month to 1 year mark. I returned my first pair of headphones TWICE for a full "free" (plus shipping) replacement. Ask yourself why this company is willing to replace in perpetuity. It's because their product is cheap and pretty bad. And don't get me wrong the sound quality was actually quite reasonably for $30.◘◘ So why give this new Bluetooth version 2 stars? Are you basing it on the old pair you weirdo? ◘◘No I'm not. These headphones are their entirely own pile of... not good. They sound tinny and their microphone call quality was described by three people (WITHOUT PROMPTING) as tinny. They have slight connection interruptions that I haven't heard since Bluetooth 4.1.They're just overall bad. I'll tell you though I really like how they designed their charge case. The fact that it sits flat on the table instead of all these weird rounded ones that fall over is great. But is the case design good enough for me to recommend them? Nope. I can't.◘◘ Conclusion ◘◘Can skull candy make decent headphones? Maybe. I've never tried their more expensive offerings. I gave them 2 stars because they're low quality for the price but they do work. They're just nowhere near up to the quality of even some random Chinese brands I've had in the past few years. I'm simply not impressed and I cannot recommend anyone buy these -- the warranty is a trap not a blessing. Up your lowest purchase price to $50 and you'll be much happier.
5,Estos auriculares los compré para mí hijo ya que yo compré otro modelo de la misma marca pero la verdad estos si son muy deifientes la batería dura muy poco la calidad de sonidos es más baja la verdad les aconsejo comprar mejor el otro modelo que es Skullcandy Jib
5,No puedes ponerte muy exigente  son muy buenos por su calidad que ofrecen en relación a su precio se escuchan muy bien  la verdad es que en ninguna aplicación se deforma el sonido sus materiales se sienten bien la batería del estuche te da buen rendimiento  aparte que carga más rápido los adifonos el estuche es el que tarda en cargarse  pero realmente lo puedes dejar conectado cuando no los usas y siempre irán bien  son excelentes para el día día  me refiero a si caminas  te transportas  haces ejercicio  tiempos de 1–2 horas el uso  la batería aguanta y son pequeños  puedes usar 1  te saca del apuro para llamadas manos libres .

5,Prácticos útiles y una buena compra
1,No venía la audífonos
4,Work great. Easy to wear. Long battery. Love them !❤️❤️❤️
1,Now won't charge one of the earbuds. We can see that the case isn't making contact to be able to charge. This is concerning.
5,Me gustó su color rojo son de buena calidad se ajustan bien al elegir las siliconas para tu oído.La batería le dura como indica skullcandy la calidad es muy muy buena tiene buenos agudos así como bajos impresionantes lo ideal es escuchar música con graves porque estan pensados para hacer ejercicio con ellos.Los recomiendo mucho realmente son pequeños.
5,Gracias
3,The media could not be loaded.
5,These are my first wireless earbuds for a cell without a headphone out. (Thanks Apple for abusing us all!) They work fine once you train yourself. Sound fine. Inexpensive so I don't expect high-end headphone experience.
1,Poor quality
5,The first product purchased was bad because the earbuds were not being charged inside the charger case. I returned it and bought a new one just for a try and the new one is super star! Working greatly and charging well. My son loves it!
5,The headphones are very little and fit perfectly in my ears. The sound is remarkable considering the size and price. The case is awesome and fits perfectly on my key ring. I'm ecstatic with my purchase and will recommend to family and friends.
1,I got the defective piece as the right side bud doesn’t charge
1,Its took 3pmins to play music in one charginh i dont know what happen. Wasting money
3,Was bought for playing pod cast at night. I have no major concerns with sound quality but find the battery life is short. After a couple hours the bud is dead and needs to be put back in case
4,Work great. Easy to wear. Long battery. Love them !❤️❤️❤️

5,Does what you need it to do. Quality make. Decent sound. Good fit. Great price
4,4⭐ de 5Calidad de Sonido: El sonido para mi ha sido prioridad siempre mi percepción del audio es Media (ni de principiante ni de experto). La calidad del sonido y el aislamiento es ligeramente superior por lo que pagas la verdad que esperaba más de estos audífonos. No destacan los bajos. Se recomienda modificar el sonido con ecualizador.Calidad del material: es ligero no hay algo que destaquen en la calidad es muy básico. La tapa tiene que hacer clic y es difícil destaparlos y el hacer que encajen en su sitio no es tan simple ni practico. El interior del estuche se raya con facilidad. Las gomitas o cojines son muy flexibles.Botones: opino lo mismo que muchos no es fácil ni practico ya que los introduces más dentro de tus oídos y es molesto por que se desacomodan. Tiene controles básicos aunque cuando funcionas el control de Asistente de tu Celular El volumen es muy alto.CONCLUSIONES: Lo recomiendo para ser tus primeros audifonos aisla bastante bien el ruido y el sonido es aceptable es justo por lo que pagas aunque yo los conseguí en $475 tal vez no estaría ligeramente inconforme si me hubieran costado 400. Una vez leí el comentario que decía "Nunca compres audifonos para hacer ejercicio que cuestwn más de 500 pesos". Los recomiendo son aceptables ideales para hacer ejercicio son cómodos no se caen aíslan muy bien el ruido exterior.
4,Calidad de materiales  buena relación precio excelente las gomas lastiman mi oído tuve que estar cambiándolas hasta que una se adaptó  por el precio no podemos pedir un sonido excelente. Cumplen con su objetivo. Si buscas un sonido de otro nivel sube de nivel a Bosé harman kardon etc .
1,The max volume is really low if you are listening to anything where there is background noise they are useless
5,Me gustó su color rojo son de buena calidad se ajustan bien al elegir las siliconas para tu oído.La batería le dura como indica skullcandy la calidad es muy muy buena tiene buenos agudos así como bajos impresionantes lo ideal es escuchar música con graves porque estan pensados para hacer ejercicio con ellos.Los recomiendo mucho realmente son pequeños.
1,
5,Muy buen producto
1,Bought skullcandy for years and suggested to my friends but this one is so bad.Getting off and on without touching.I tried with other phone too but same problems
3,Not noise canceling. Sound is a little tinny and distant. Big like a thumb stuck in your ear.Quality matches the price.
3,Me gusto que se escuchan muy bien ñ no tengo mucha experiencia en audífonos inalambricos pero esta marca me gusta admito que no son tan comodos como los alámbricos de la misma marca pero son buenos en tanto ala bateria pues dura unas 5 horas continuas hasta que te manda alerta de low batery si los recomiendo
3,Si pero esperaba mas
5,Dude en comprar el producto debido a los comentarios que hay sobre el volumen pero la verdad es que es un volumen bastante decente no sé si las personas que tienen esas malas reseñas no sabían que se sube el volumen haciendo clic al audífono derecho si tiene un tope pero es bastante alto el volumen. Así que si tienes dudas sobre comprarlos por ese detalle no dudes más!!!
3,Me gustó el diseño está cómodo
4,Algo pesados pero excelente sonido la entrega como siempre antes de tiempo y en perfecto estado
5,Very simple yet awesome sound im very picky about the sound of my music and they work very well great bass too!! Thank you!
3,Compré dos pares porque quería usar uno para hacer ejercicio y otro para mantener en mi habitación. Un par funciona a la perfección el otro salió defectuoso el auricular izquierdo no carga y se descarga sin prácticamente ningún uso. No los volvería a comprar. Estoy en proceso de devolución de un par.
3,Work great
4,Good value.
3,Good earbuds especially for sound quality and noise cancellation but the controls are nearly unusable and battery life could be better for sure. Overall definitely worth the price for good sounding earbuds
5,Muy buenos
5,Es cómodo para realizar ejercicio
5,Excelentes Audífonos a buen precio
1,I know these are small and cheap but I don’t think they’re that useful maybe for a jog or something.Felt like the 8hours battery life was a bit deceiving… After re-reading it it seems that the 8 hours is referring to the charging case and not the earbuds themselves.They have terrible connectivity issues. You have to repair them every use it seemsGood comfort no complaints there beside the buttons on the earbuds aren’t really useable while wearing… pushing on them while in your ear is definitely uncomfortable however I don’t really see the need to. Sound quality seemed fine good for the price point.At the end of the day they’re good for you if you just need earbuds for an hour gym session or jog(though they might fall out?) or just for riding the bus. If you want to wear them for work forget it you’ll need something with more battery.However Soundcore offers a much better earbud at 49.99$ (p2 mini) with much more battery life and better sound quality.Check them out before buying these!
3,The sound in these are amazing. That’s probably the only good part. They always fall out of my ears and has always been inconsistent in charging and doesn’t last long without one. A bit disappointed as when I need them I can’t rely on them. They will be my back up pair now as they’re too inconsistent and will be looking to replace them going forward
2,No son touch tienen un boton dentro del audifino que para presionarlo se tiene que hacer mucha presion contra la oreja o bien quitarlo.La posicion o angulo de la goma cansa rapidamenteLa bateria no le dura mas de 6 hrs incluyendo la del estucheEl colmo es que el sonido no es muy alto y sin bajos notablesNo los recomiendo
2,Didn't fit my ears properly
5,Me gustaron son prácticos y cómodos
3,Por el precio supongo que están bien. Tienen buen sonido (no excelente pero bueno). Aislan considerablemente el ruido con las almohadillas hay que quitarlos para escuchar bien a las personas. El material es de plástico rígido habrá quién los prefiera así. En mi caso son bastante molestos en mis oídos me lastiman un poco y eso hace menos agradable la experiencia. Quizá la forma o tamaño de mis orejas influya... Mido 160.
5,Son excelentes  super ligeros la caja compacta buen sonido lo unico negativo es que la caja se carga algo lento  pero es una excelente compra aobre todo por el precio
5,Me gusta demasiado lo practicos comodos y compactos que son. Me encantan demasiado! Lo malo es que la bateria les dura poco (nada grave) son buenos para viajes sencillos o para ir en el transporte.Pero se nota que dura un poco menos que audífonos mas grandes (es obvio por el tamaño)La calidad de audio me gusta mucho. Nada del otro mundo pero es muy buena.Al ser compactos no se sienten nada estorbosos. Las llamadas se escuchan muy bien. Esta version que compre no tiene tile.
4,Para  el precio está bastante bien
5,Fue un regalo para mi esposo y le encantó hasta ahora todo super bien y le facinaron.Buen regalo si gastar mucho
5,Se escuchan muy bien. Gran micrófono. No son tan cómodos de operar con los botones pero ajustan bien. Duración de 3h antes de necesitar recarga.
4,Su diseño y rápida sincronización.
5,Creí que por su precio iban a decepcionarme pero todo lo contrario fue una buena compra y su calidad de audio me encanta! c:
5,Muy buena calidad precio increíble y me llegaron en menos tiempo de lo esperado. Super cómodos
5,Excelente producto al principio hubo algunos inconvenientes con las intervenciones de conexión con otros dispositivos alrededor del teléfono celular.
5,Buena relación calidad-precio. Más cómodos que la mayoría de los inalámbricos.Definitivamente los recomiendo.
5,Excelente producto  cómodos  baratos y la calidad del audio es Excelente  solo su uso es un poco complicado para quienes no somos muy fans de la tecnologia
5,Audífonos que uso cuando hago ejercicio algunas veces se caen por el movimiento durante el ejercicio. El sonido es muy bueno

1,If you're considering buying these they're trash and to be honest should be thrown in said trash. I'm so tired of trying to charge these things for 6+ hrs and only having 10% battery life. Like what the hell?? Getting a refund.

5,La batería le dura muchísimo y son bastante cómodos y prácticos los recomiendo ampliamente sobre todo por el equilibrio entre calidad y precio.

4,Por el precio esta bien no esperes más de lo que ofrece pero es bueno para lo normal del día
4,I've been using these for a couple weeks now at work. I'm in residential construction and they work great to cut the sound when i'm using tools or doing demolition. I will say the only reason I give it the 4 stars instead of 5 is that it slightly bulges in one spot so you get ear fatigue where it starts to hurt. I never use them long enough to run the battery out since i'm constantly popping them in and out of the case where they keep charging. Worth the money if you're looking for cheaper headphones. Also the sound quality is great -- Good bass well balanced not too much high end. I did have the True Jib ones and they were a bit more comfortable and last longer for battery but I lost one of them and wanted to try something a little different.
5,Mi esposa está encantada con su regalo le son muy prácticos a la hora de caminar sin llevar el teléfono en la mano tienen un sonido perfecto no cabe duda de que compraré otros iguales
5,La batería le dura muchísimo y son bastante cómodos y prácticos los recomiendo ampliamente sobre todo por el equilibrio entre calidad y precio.
4,Buen sonido los bajos no son profundos pero la batería te puede durar de 3 a 5 horas un poco incómodos pero te acostumbras pésimo micrófono.

4,Good and bad
3,Seriously they have some of the worst base and low/highsthese are good for watching youtube videos and/or phonecallsthe earbuds are 100% mids and nothing else.base will make the drivers crack and sound awful. DON'T BUY if you are looking for decent sounding earbudsthe best thing i can say about them is. cheap and they are absolutely tiny comparedto other earbuds on the market right now.i don't get the other reviews on here. they claim these have decent sound quality andether they do not know what is "good" or i got a bad pair.not sure. but they sound terrible compared to say my razer nari (and that was 100$)these are 40$ i expected better for 40$
2,Sonido no muy bueno
1,I regret this purchase
1,Durée de vie pas longue
1,I didn't like them they don't sound loud and I'm very disappointed with the brand
3,El sonido está bueno por el precio que están pero sinceramente no los recomiendo ya que después de un rato de uso continuo llegan a incomodar los oídos aparte de que el agarre en tus orejas no es el que prometen!
2,The battery life is horrible especially in case you might be able charge once. Spend abit more to get something worth it.
5,Si quieres unos audífonos Truewireless de buena calidad y de una marca reconocida estos son la mejor opción. Porque si bien hay MUCHAS opciones de "marca blanca" (normalmente clones de los airpods) por poco dinero suelen tener una calidad de sonido mediocre y muchos problemas de conexión.En Skullcandy se propusieron hacer la opción más económica posible sin sacrificar calidad de audio y lo lograron. Suenan muy muy bien tienen un perfil de sonido casi justo en el medio van un poquito hacia los bajos pero dentro de lo decente nada exagerado.  Lo que se queda por el camino es la batería y la construcción del estuche.La batería les dura unas 3 horas y media y el estuche por el lado bueno es pequeño y superportátil lo puedes traer de llavero (es más o menos del tamaño del control remoto de un carro pero más grueso) pero es de plástico ligero además no trae tampoco mucha batería cargará unas dos veces casi tres los audífonos antes de necesitar recargarlo además no son de carga rápida tardan más o menos una hora en cargarse completamente desde cuando te salta el aviso de "battery Low".AVISOS- Tienes que sacarlos al MISMO tiempo del estuche la primera vez para que se sincronicen entre sí. Si no al no encontrarse entre sí funcionaran independientemente y tendrás que seguir las instrucciones de reinicio de pareo y sincronización.- Los audífonos tienen su propio volumen independiente del dispositivo así que si te suenan "muy bajo" aunque tengas el cel o la compu a todo volumen es por eso tienes que subir el volumen tocando dos veces el audífono derecho.- Prueba todas las gomitas que trae para encontrar el ajuste perfecto son muy cómodos siempre y cuando uses las de tu talla puede darse el caso de que en el derecho es la mediana y en el izquierdo es la pequeña pruébalas todas a ver con que te acomodas mejor.PROS- La calidad de audio corresponde a audífonos mucho más caros.- Precio- 0 problemas de conexión (Probado en Windows 10 Debian 11 Android y iOS).- Los imanes del estuche son MUY fuertes así que aunque se te pase cerrar bien el estuche no se van a salir.CONTRAS- Batería: Depende del uso que se le dé pero para algunas personas las 3 horas y media puede no ser suficiente y al no tener carga rápida hay que esperar un buen rato en lo que cargan.- Los controles en los audífonos son botones no son táctiles y son algo duros de presionar.- Los audífonos tienen algo de resistencia al agua y al sudor pero el estuche no así que si te agarra la lluvia es muy probable que los audífonos sobrevivan pero su estuche no.
4,El sonido es claro pero si es menos práctico el cambiar de canción o el volumen que otros modelos también después de un rato se te caen o tienes que reposicionarlos pero en general son buenos
2,All is well and good but then the left one stopped working. I will be looking into returning them.
5,Practicos comodos y muy faciles de llevar. Muy recomendados por el precio la calidad de sonido es muy buena mil veces mejor que otros productos sin marca de china. Durables ya se me cayeron dos veces y no las ha pasado nada. Recomendados sobretodo por que son muy facil de sincronizar. La duracion real de la bateria en uso es de 3 horas en espera aun no se pero son mas de 4
4,Son lindos y ajustan bien resisten para hacer ejercicio y la duración de la batería es aceptable lo malo es que los controles no son touch y cala en el oído cuando aprietas el botón pero por el precio yo diría que es una buena compra.
2,Lasted 7 months before right ear would not hold charge more than 30 minutes. Not very comfortable they keep falling off my ears because the cushion is to close to the plastic/battery enclosure.
5,Excelente producto cumplió con mis expectativas.
2,Good for just listening music. Not recommended if used for phone calls the person on the other side hears only the background noise. Though the bass is powerful. 10/10 on sound quality. 1/10 for calls
5,Bought these for my grandson and he loves them!!
4,No encienden al sacarlos del estuche y tampoco se apagan al meterlos tengo que dejar presionado cada audífono 4 segundos para que enciendan
5,Me gusta que la batería dura bastante y que el sonido es bueno hasta para contestar llamadas.
5,Me gusta mucho la calidad del sonido la batería dura muchísimo y el estuche es muy practico tipo llavero. Excelente producto a un muy buen precio.
5,
5,Si no usas las gomas de tu talla son incómodos
5,Son de los mejores en relación precio calidad muy resistentes buen sonido stereo  el estuche me parece muy original de buena calidad.
5,Me encantaron porque tienen el tamaño perfecto y buena calidad de audio
5,Muy cómodos
5,Cumplen todas mis espectativas
5,El sonido la batería y la comodidad son lo mejor. Tiene buenos bajos y muy buen volumen.
5,Superó mis expectativas el sonido es muy bueno el primero día si se me sientieron incómodos pero poco a poco esa incomodidad se me fue excelente batería y al momento de guardarlos no pesan ni nada EXCELENTES AUDÍFONOS!!!!!
1,I didn't like them they don't sound loud and I'm very disappointed with the brand
4,los compré para correr la marca me encanta y tengo varios productos de ella. se escuchan perfecto para mis distancias la batería aguanta bien lo que si es que mi oreja es pequeña y el modelo es algo tosco si no tengo cuidado pueden caer o si uso una banda (buff) con mucha presión llegan a ser incomodos por su tamaño.eso no deja de lado que me gusten muchisimo.
1,No son comodos no se conectan facil tienen mala calidad de audio y poco volumen hay mejores como los buds 3 lite de xiaomi o los lenovo lp 40 pro
5,Le verdad están muy bien para su precio
5,Cómodos y fácil de conectar
5,
5,Por lo que se paga se obtiene un producto incluso superior en calidad a otros audífonos BT con el doble o triple de precio. Recomendables.
5,
4,Funcionan correctamente la pila les tarda no se caen de los oídos pero el sonido no es espectacular están bien por el precio
5,Buena duración de baterías y se escuchan muy bien muy cómodos
5,Cumple con sus funciones a buen precio
5,Muy cómodos y practicos
4,Funcionan bien en general
5,Por lo que se paga se obtiene un producto incluso superior en calidad a otros audífonos BT con el doble o triple de precio. Recomendables.
5,Me gusta mucho la calidad del sonido la batería dura muchísimo y el estuche es muy practico tipo llavero. Excelente producto a un muy buen precio.
4,En sonido está excelente y la batería es buena. Lo malo es la comodidad desde de un rato son algo molestos el estuche no sabes cuándo es que ya está cargado.
5,La relación calidad precio es muy buena! Fue un regalo para un adolescente y le encantó.
4,Ya llevo 2 semanas con estos audífonos y la verdad son muy cómodos para hacer cualquier cosa un sonido bien relacionado al precio los bajos son muy buenos la batería le dura unas 3.5 horas más lo que le sume su estuche. Muy buen producto
3,No son aptos para hacer ejercicio se caen constantemente
4,Audífonos cómodos aunque si hay que estar los acomodando en la oreja porque se desajustan co. El movimiento en general bien la batería dura como 2 hrs en uso continuo... Buena relación costo beneficio
4,En sonido está excelente y la batería es buena. Lo malo es la comodidad desde de un rato son algo molestos el estuche no sabes cuándo es que ya está cargado.
3,Es buen producto tiene buena calidad de audio solo que la pila le dura poco y el cable que viene para cargar es muy corto pero si lo recomiendo.
4,Funcionan correctamente la pila les tarda no se caen de los oídos pero el sonido no es espectacular están bien por el precio
4,Muy buena calidad para el precio mal en Android en iOS (i11) excelente funcionamiento
1,No encendian y eso que segui las instrucciones de uso por primera vez.
2,The battery life is horrible especially in case you might be able charge once. Spend abit more to get something worth it.
5,El paquete llegó antes como siempre el producto está mejor que lo que se muestra en las fotos se conectaron sin complicaciones me gustó el tamaño tan pequeño de la caja. Trae 3 tamaños de gomas y un mini cargador como de 10 cm (suficiente cumple con su función).El sonido es muy bueno no lo he probado en llamadas pero la muusica se escucha muy clara y la señal Bluetooth tiene un alcance dentro de casa entre 8-10 m aprox.Espero me duren buen tiempo. El precio me pareció adecuado al producto.
4,los compré para correr la marca me encanta y tengo varios productos de ella. se escuchan perfecto para mis distancias la batería aguanta bien lo que si es que mi oreja es pequeña y el modelo es algo tosco si no tengo cuidado pueden caer o si uso una banda (buff) con mucha presión llegan a ser incomodos por su tamaño.eso no deja de lado que me gusten muchisimo.
5,Son una gran opción se oyen muy bien y bloquean el ruido exterior completamente así que cuidado si los vas a usar afuera les recomiendo que vean el video de tutorial antes de usarlos se cargan primero y la experiencia va a ser muy buena
3,Las baterías dura lo especificado se caen al hacer ejercicio.
5,As usualy Skullcandy headphones are amazing and at an optimum price.I can listen to high quality music to a moderate level and disconnect from the outside world.I'm clumsy and loose things very easily so the quality/price ratio is important and I've been using that brand for a very long time.The only issue is that Amazon sent a grey one instead of green. But they don't care...
5,Excelente
5,
1,I just ordered theses and received yesterday. They won't charge past 30 percent (even though light indicator is geeen) and die within 15 to 20 minutes. I've had other blue tooth headphones so I know how to change and wear. This isn't user error. Im very disappointed and will be returning them. Will stuck to other brands
5,Muy buena calidad y la pila dura bastante tiempo
5,Fits great for my ears sound is clear and it’s about 70% for noise canceling. I can’t have it full blocked as I have a baby lol. Used a lot when she is napping.
5,Cómodos y fácil de conectar
4,me gustaron por el diseño son cómodos pero no les dura la batería tanto como esperaba tenia otros que eran de una marca x y esos les duraba la pila un montón y se escuchaban muy bien pero no eran tan estéticos eran mas toscos y los cambie porque ya no pude emparejarlos pero tenia con ellos como 3 años  y siguen jalando pero por separado. y estos que según son de una marca mas reconocida la batería no esta buena
1,I have owned the dime pair of skull candy for 2 years never had a problem ordered myself the red ones the left one wouldn’t hold a charge I even went threw the methods to try to charge it I wil be sending these back and getting a new pair from somewhere else
5,Great sound. Definitely better audio quality than most true wireless earbuds. Fit will take a couple days to get used to. The fit remind me of non-custom professional in ear monitors. Great acoustic type of isolation. Battery could be a bit longer but for $40 come on.  Save your money if you want something more expensive. For the price they are a steal.
1,La calidad de audio es mala y carecen completamente de bajos los tuve que devolver
1,No son cómodos para ejercitarse la batería dura 1 a 2 horas y solo funcionaron menos de tres meses.
5,These are probably the best cheap wireless earbuds I've ever used.  Doesn't sound like your listening to music or videos through tin cans.  The touch controls can be better but whatever they were 29.99.  2 and a half charges using the case.  I get the whole day of usage.  Pretty comfortable in my ears not too heavy.
4,No encienden al sacarlos del estuche y tampoco se apagan al meterlos tengo que dejar presionado cada audífono 4 segundos para que enciendan

2,Por cien pesos menos los f9 bajean mejor que los dime true por otra parte OJO sienes orejas pequeñas no te ban a quedar asi fue en mi caso tengo que nerlos apredanlolos con la mano y eso no es grato.
2,El auricular es muy grande a pesar de que tiene gomitas de diferentes tamaños el principal problema es que estira la oreja de una manera que en 15 minutos lastima de forma crónica además de que el sonido quedó a deber la verdad.

1,I regret this purchase
5,Superó mis expectativas el sonido es muy bueno el primero día si se me sientieron incómodos pero poco a poco esa incomodidad se me fue excelente batería y al momento de guardarlos no pesan ni nada EXCELENTES AUDÍFONOS!!!!!
1,I didn't like them they don't sound loud and I'm very disappointed with the brand
4,Son lindos y ajustan bien resisten para hacer ejercicio y la duración de la batería es aceptable lo malo es que los controles no son touch y cala en el oído cuando aprietas el botón pero por el precio yo diría que es una buena compra.
5,Practicos comodos y muy faciles de llevar. Muy recomendados por el precio la calidad de sonido es muy buena mil veces mejor que otros productos sin marca de china. Durables ya se me cayeron dos veces y no las ha pasado nada. Recomendados sobretodo por que son muy facil de sincronizar. La duracion real de la bateria en uso es de 3 horas en espera aun no se pero son mas de 4
4,E leído muy malas reseñas de estos audífonos dude en comprarlos pero me animé para probarlos a ver cuánto me duranEn la estética es lo que esperaba son discretos muy buena calidad en el material e usado otra marca y son molestos los skullcandy son cómodos muy buena calidad de sonido las funciones son más cómodas con el celular que directamente con los botones pero para el precio de los audífonos no hay que ponerse exigente todas sus funciones sirven y su caja de carga es súper discreta muy satisfecho con la compra
4,The product was fine especially for the price. It's was a bit confusing go figure out the buttons are mechanical but it didn't take me long to figure out. The only complaints I have is the noise cancelation isn't perfect but the sound quality makes up for that.
2,La batería nunca cargó y sólo funcionaba el audífono derecho.No son tan cómodos e incluso cambiándole las gomas no se mantienen tan fijos en la oreja.
5,La bateria dura aproximadamente 3 horas de uso continuo
4,Es comodo la bateria me dura 2 1/2 o 3 cargas pero lo que no me gusta es que se escucha el ruido externo en su máximo volumen
3,Las baterías dura lo especificado se caen al hacer ejercicio.
5,Fits great for my ears sound is clear and it’s about 70% for noise canceling. I can’t have it full blocked as I have a baby lol. Used a lot when she is napping.
5,Excelente

1,Over all its good but it’s always stick out from ears need to push back after some time if dnt it falls down each time
5,el producto llego bien y en perfecto estado también funciona muy bien y cumple con la descripción.
3,Ya habia comprado unos skullcandy y nada que ver a estos el audio nada que ver a lo que me tenía acostumbrado skullcandy
4,I'm not a newbie to wireless earbuds. I love them and have owned a number of pair.These come from the legendary house of Skullcandy and bring a different form factor to the table.*General*These buds have a suprisingly small form factor so when they're in your ear they fit more flushly thereby making them less noticeable than others and if you choose a more neutral color no one will notice they're there. (I chose grey)  And while wer'e on the topic of color the Skullcandy  Dime is available in a variety of colors with the notable absence of the "always fashionable" white. You might want to have  talk with marketing there.I can't really comment too much on battery life becasue the case keeps them charged and I don't make it a habit of walking around all day buds in my ears although I could.Pairing is so incredibly easy and I might even venture to say it's among the easiest I have ever experienced. Switching devices is also simple.*Sound*So this is where an earbud shines or fails and Skullcandy always seem to deliver. Dime is no different.  Now if you're expecting studio quality sound well no one delivers that in an earbud.  The highs are crisp and clean so that's good if you're listening to POP but I found the bass was not delivered with any measure of guts.  It was there to be sure but Skullcandy could have put a little more attention on it.*Value*Skullcandy Dime are solidvalue for everyay listening and as a solid telephone ear piece.
1,Really cheap. The sound is horrible and I couldn't enjoy listening to music with these. Also it's not synchro if you watch a video or else.
1,Save your money it brakes after a week.
5,They work great and are easy to use. Would purchase again
5,Great sound and battery life
5,Se mantienen estables se escuchan fuerte la pila es aceptable por el precio y conectan rápido y no se distorsiona
4,Vary good
5,Works perfect
5,These tiny earbuds are simply best in this price range. The sound quality is on par with the expensive earbuds. No connectivity issues. They are extremely comfortable to wear. I used to return Skullcandy TWS products before due to multiple connectivity issues. But not in this time. The Skullcandy guys seem to have fixed all connectivity issues typical for this brand. Now the connectivity is its advantage. They are pretty good being connected to Android or Windows devices (not tested them on other devices). Well done! A realy good job. Now it's my main TWS device
5,Ayer recibí mis audifonos hoy los cargué para comenzar a usarlos y son perfectos !la calidad del  sonido es excelente se escuchan claramente todos los sonidos en las canciones y tiene una excelente cancelación del ruido externo el único detalle que tienen es que vienen con el volumen demasiado bajo mismo que se ajusta presionando dos veces el audífono derecho esperas un segundo y repites la operación hasta que escuches un "pitido" una vez hecho eso no hay problema alguno con ellos.Los recomiendo 100%  tienen muy buen precio y excelente calidad !
5,I have no complying have had Bose and I always find skullcandy has excellent qualitySound and greet prices
4,La duración de las baterías es buena son fácil transportarlos aunque abrir el estuche es un poco molesto. Su conectividad es muy buena y apenas los sacas del estuche se conectan automáticamente llegan a ser cómodos y son muy buenos con relación a su calidad y precio...
4,Tiene un muy buen sonido son cómodos y tienen un gran volúmen. (Yo no los he ocupado al máximo pues me reventaria los oídos). Aisla muy bien el sonido (ten cuidado si vas en la calle). El problema son las llamadas pues la persona que te llama escuchará un sonido muy distorsionado. Pero de ahí en más son una buena compra.
4,These are decent little headphones. They do hurt my ears a bit with prolonged wear and don't stay charged as long as the ones I previously had but they work for what I need them for.  Good sound quality and easy to pair and use.
5,For thirty dollars these headphones are good. You can't have an expectation of studio quality sound at that price point but that being said the sound is clear and everything is pretty balanced. It pairs easily with my iPhone; the left and right earbuds individually and together. Great purchase and great value for someone not looking to spend 100+ dollars on a wireless earbuds.
3,No son lo que esperaba
4,Por el precio es bueno pero en comodidad no tanto solo es acostumbrarse
5,Son súper prácticos
3,These are great for listening to music podcasts audio books...but horrible for using when on the phone. There's an echo most of the time and the person on the other end of the phone often cannot hear me. I don't use them for anything other than listening to podcasts and audio books. The battery life is pretty good and they charge fairly quickly.
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I bought those skullcandy dime wireless earbuds back in January of 2022 they where AMAZING at first good sound quality for what you are paying for nice compact design for easy traveling. But then after awile the lift earbud bass went down in quality i did not really mind at first because i did pay 30$. but then the other day i went to use them and you could barly hear out of even on full blast i tried everything in the book to make them work again nothing. i was actually quite surprised considering it was skillcandy my other 40$ pair by them lasted a whole 3 years. But i do have to say skillcandy was EXTREMELY helpful and very fast with geting me a new pair.  i also seen alot of the reviews are ppl complaining about that battery life. and yes although the earbuds themself only last 2-3 hours the reason why it says 12 hours is because you can charge them in the case without the it being pluged in. Skillcandy has had absolutely amazing products and i really hope it was just my one pair with this issue. Please dont let me down skillcandy i hope that my replacement pair will satisfy.
2,Soy muy bonitos fáciles de llevar a cualquier lado y baratos. Valen la pena!. ^^
5,Por ahora todo luce bien
5,Son buenos tienen buenos bajos y el sonido es muy limpio. En cuanto a llamadas todo esta perfecto aun usando cubrecamas y estando en la calle me escucharon muy bien. Lo único que no me gustó es que deberías especificar que los controles es mediante botón físico. Es mi única observación fuera de eso es un excelente producto
3,Tengo una semana con los audífonos y noté que la duración de batería de cada uno es diferente cuando el izquierdo marca 10% el derecho tiene aun 60% después de 2 hrs de uso el sonido es bueno para el precio y son cómodos procederé a hacer cambio.
5,Buen sonido y calidad de audio muy buena cancelación de ruido
5,Me gustó el tamaño y el sonido se escuchan mejor que los Indy xt en un tamaño más compacto.
5,Llevo aproximadamente un año con ellos y siguen funcionando al 100%. La batería aún dura bastante tiempo con carga completa. El sonido es aceptable para unos skullcandy. Son cómodos aunque después de un tiempo prologado después de usarlos como cualquier audífono in ear comienza a molestar. Son mis favoritos!
5,Es un muy buen producto no se te caen al correr y se escuchan muy bien

5,Work great! Great gift for teenagers
3,Los acabo de recibir se escuchan muy bien buenos bajos no se por que hay muchas reseñas que dicen que no tienen mucho volumen como lo dice otro comentario una vez que te llegan  sigue el instructivo para subir el volumen(opriman dos veces el boton del audifono derecho) y listo estan geniales vere cuanto tiempo me duran.Actualización: a los seis meses el auricular izquierdo dejo de funcionar.
4,Fuera de que lq bateria es pésima son buenos
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               los uso de llavero de lo pequeños que son el sonido es muy bueno si te gustan los bajos fuertes y muy muy ligeros la conección es casi inmediata nomás al sacarlos en 1 segundo se conectan solos. Muy recomendables por el precio.
5,Me encantó mi compra. Muy cómodos la batería le dura súper bien. Me gusta que puedo utilizar solo 1 y el otro lo guardo en su cajita. Volumen Perfecto cuando te los pones es como si tuvieras un tapón ¡no escuchas lo de afuera!  SI LO RECOMIENDO.
4,Buena calidad de audio en llamadas aceptables para escuchar música cómodos de transportar y buena duración de batería.
5,Muy ligeros y prácticos con unos buenos graves y medianamente en los agudos (obviamente dependiendo que se este escuchando) aíslan muy bien el sonido exterior una buena durabilidad de carga aunque un poco molestos después de un rato de usarlos (creo que eso depende de las gomas que se usen) fuera de eso están muy bien en mi uso diario.
1,Después de 1 mes la batería del audífono izquierdo duraba 30 minutos máximo. Al cabo de 3 meses ninguno de los dos audífonos funciona.Por todo lo demás bien por su precio podría ser buena compra si no le fallara la batería.
5,Se mantienen estables se escuchan fuerte la pila es aceptable por el precio y conectan rápido y no se distorsiona

3,Se escuchan muy bien pero no son muy cómodos para mi oído.
5,Bastante prácticos al momento de guardarlos en tu bolsillo del pantalón. Realmente la calidad es muy buena de la batería y de los mismos audífonos. Lo único malo es que el botón que viene en ellos es un poco molesto al momento de presionarlo fuera de eso todo en orden. :)
4,Por desgracia a los 6 meses de uso el audífono izquierdo se le descompuso la batería y no me hicieron válida la garantía.🙁🙁
4,This Skullcandy Dime earbuds are very compact and a decent pair of starter earbuds. The battery life isn’t that great as it lasts about 3.5 hours and this is reflected by the size of the earbuds. The Earbud case is very small and has a built in charger to charge up the earbuds on the go. Each earbud has a button to control playback instead of a touch sensor. The charging cable is Micro USB instead of USB C. There is noise isolation in these earbuds but I find they work ok not great. There are three different sizes of ear gels so you can use what is right for you. Sound quality is ok. I don’t feel that punch but for daily use this is good.
5,Buen precio excelente tamaño buena calidad de audio

3,This product is good and the sound quality is good but the range is terrible. The headphones start to cut uout badly at about ten feet away from your device.
3,It keeps coming out of my ear
3,Tengo una semana con los audífonos y noté que la duración de batería de cada uno es diferente cuando el izquierdo marca 10% el derecho tiene aun 60% después de 2 hrs de uso el sonido es bueno para el precio y son cómodos procederé a hacer cambio.

1,Not charging
3,This product is good and the sound quality is good but the range is terrible. The headphones start to cut uout badly at about ten feet away from your device.
3,They work well and sync up well. They do cut out time to time. They are not very comfortable and need to be pushed into my ears a lot otherwise they fall out.
5,Suenan bastante bien para el rango de precio en el que compiten son muy cómodos y prácticos por su tamaño.
1,I have had better experiences with wireless headphones from dime a dozen no-name manufacturers than these which is wild. While the audio quality seemed like it would be decent problems abound with these things.* The physical button on the buds makes absolutely no sense and is beyond useless when wearing them. You will not be able to reliably press it without either pushing them painfully into your ear canal or making them fall out.* They have constant connection issues with my iPhone 13* In my instance despite charging the case completely multiple times the buds would never auto power off or on - meaning the next time you go to use them they'll be dead. According to the manual they should do that on their own so my pair may be defective.No plans to buy Skullcandy products again after this experience.
4,Son bastante cómodos y buena calidad de audio
5,Se sienten bien para lo que se paga creo que es razonable el material y sonido. Único inconveniente es que no encontré algunas gomitas del tamaño de mi oído por lo que se me salen si hago ejercicio con ellos.
4,For the price the fit and sound quality are amazing. Battery life is average but will get you through the day with a full charge.The case though.... While small. It is mighty. In the sense that you CANNOT open it. Not only is it magnetic. But it latches as well with an unbelievable seal. You can't open this with one hand like any other case on the market. If that's what you want then by the gods bless your strength.
5,Just buy em great quality and sound good fit
3,These are great for listening to music podcasts audio books...but horrible for using when on the phone.

The battery life is pretty good and they charge fairly quickly.
5,Es super práctico de llevar  muy útiles  si eres una persona casual que los usa un par de horas son perfectos para ti  si eres de uso prolongado y por horas  no te los recomiendo mucho  pero suenan increíble por el precio.
5,Son buenos tienen buenos bajos y el sonido es muy limpio. En cuanto a llamadas todo esta perfecto aun usando cubrecamas y estando en la calle me escucharon muy bien.

5,excelente calidad del producto y de sonido muy comodos.
5,Excelente para usar con cascos
5,Una vez que los aprendes a usar son muy buenos
3,Tengo una semana con los audífonos y noté que la duración de batería de cada uno es diferente cuando el izquierdo marca 10% el derecho tiene aun 60% después de 2 hrs de uso el sonido es bueno para el precio y son cómodos procederé a hacer cambio.
5,Excelente producto
5,These are by far the best under $50 earbuds out there. They even beat my $100 anker headphones when it comes to sound quality.-Although they have no noise cancellation built in getting a snug fit in your ear does the job-One of the best sounding earbuds under $50 even beating some of the more expensive headphones-the battery life is pretty good too lasting about 8-10 hours on a full charge depending on volume and breaks.-They Get EVEN BETTER when mixed with Samsung's "Adapt Sound" app to tune the music to your ears.Overall a great buy! 10/10 good job Skullcandy!
5,Son muy cómodos les dura bastante la batería y tienen un buen sonido
4,If you rock the pack in 3.5mm headphones (remember when phones came with headphones) these don't disappoint.Uses:Yardwork - cancel out lawn mower no issueCycling -cancel out nature no issueShort battery life is true but none of these activities take me longer than the rating.I listen to all genres of music and these do a fantastic job with clarity.And they're $30 so you don't have to cry for a week when you can't recall where you left them
5,Llevo ya dos meses con ellos y son super cómodos la batería les dura todo el día cargando los obviamente
5,Muy cómodos y prácticos no incomodan aunque lo traigas puesto mucho tiempo
5,excelente calidad del producto y de sonido muy comodos.
5,Just buy em great quality and sound good fit
5,Buen producto compacto y potente.

1,Los recibi y solo escuche una canción los puse a cargar y no cargó los tuve que regresar
5,Buen producto compacto y potente.
5,Son pequeñitos y de buena calidad los acabo de comprar así que espero mucho :3
5,Excelente producto se escucha super bien tanto para música como llamadas lo recomiendo y me llego en buenas condiciones
5,Muy buenos excelente calidad de audio y portabilidad
4,El producto como tal es bueno y tiene una calidad aceptable para el precio que valen se ajustan bien a los oídos y no se caen los botones son físicos no táctil. Lo único malo fue el audio los conecte y a pesar de que tenia todo el volumen se escuchaba muy bajo y si le bajabas a la mitad de la barra de volumen el sonido era casi nulo.Así que si buscas unos audífonos con bastante audio estos no son los indicados al menos yo que pedí el modelo de color negro y esta fui me situación. Por lo que los devolví
5,Muy cómodos y prácticos no incomodan aunque lo traigas puesto mucho tiempo
5,Buen sonido y calidad de audio muy buena cancelación de ruido
5,Excelente calidad de sonido y precio y un estuche bastante practico. Ademas de que la duracion de la bateria ha sido excelente
5,Muy buenos por el precio buen volumen aunque hay a quien le gusta más volumen todavía pero en lo general todo muy bien el estuche si debe cargarse por lo menos una vez al día si se usan de manera continúa en llamadas si hay un poco de interferencia pero si se escucha y te escuchan bien en lugares cerrados.
4,Son bueno sacan el trabajo pero creo que la pila si les dura pocos soportan muy bien las caídas en si es un buen producto por el precio sobre todo pero si en realidad usas mucho audífonos necesitarás otros con mejor duración de batería. A mi usándolos desde que están al 100% de carga me duran máximo 3 hrs o menos y de ahí hay que recargarlos que al menos he podido recargarlos en el cuadrito donde se guardan unas 3 veces antes de requerir conectarlos a la corriente de nuevo.
5,Me gustó el tamaño y el sonido se escuchan mejor que los Indy xt en un tamaño más compacto.

Son cómodos aunque después de un tiempo prologado después de usarlos como cualquier audífono in ear comienza a molestar. Son mis favoritos!
4,Son muy buenos aunque algo incómodos para oídos pequeños.Valen completamente la pena
4,Son cómodos para una caminata pero no podría correr con estos puestos sin la molestia de sentir que se caerán
5,Muy buenos audifonos a un muy buen precio el sonido es excelente y la cancelación de ruido pasivo es muy buena aunque si tuviera que quejarme de algo sería de la batería que es algo corta llegan a durar 3 horas y en algunas ocasiones si se queda corto junto con la carga que es de un par de horas
4,J'ai acheté ces écouteurs pour les appels et la musique quand je suis au travail. Ils font parfaitement le job!La boite est petite et passe partout.Cependant les "commandes" pour raccrocher avancer augmenter le volume etc ne sont pas intuitives (seul point negatif)).
5,Realmente son unos buenos audífonos por el precio en el que los compré cumplen con su función son cómodos el estuche está bastante bien y se cargan cuando los guardas. Se prenden y se conectan con solo sacarlos del estuche.Aunque el audio no es el mejor es lo que se espera por este rango de precio. Viene con diferentes tamaños de gomas solo me bastó cambiarlas por otro tamaño y se ajustaron muy bien en mi oreja se ve bastante discreto.
3,For the price it is a good temporary option but for long term I suggest investing in a better pair. The build quality is not the best and neither is the sound but it does the job.
3,Buen sonido para su precio pero muy incomodos en los oídos lastiman bastante tenerlos puestos me decepcionaron un poco.
1,There is no noise cancelation and the Bluetooth is horrible. The connection is consistently interrupted and the battery life is almost non existent.
4,For what I wanted them for they're great! I have only used them to listen to music through my phone and it sounds very good to me. I had no problems pairing them to my phone's Bluetooth and the range covers my entire apartment (which is kind of small I admit lol). They come with a couple different sizes of rubber ear buds so you should be able to find one that fits your ears well. I do find they're a little uncomfortable if I wear them for more than an hour but I think that might be true of most ear buds. There is no noise cancellation per se but the buds fit snug in your ears so they kind of drown out some of the outside noise that way. The charging cable is only a couple inches long but that shouldn't really matter. Battery life seems decent enough and audible warnings are given when the ear buds are critically low on battery life. Overall I think these are a very good deal!
1,Junk will not charge properly and will not go into pairing mode. Not comfortable even if they work they are very awkward to use
2,Aveces se escucha un auricular y luego el otro y viceversa.
4,Buenos para un uso casual y actividades normales en casa o en el patio la duracion de bateria me parece adecuada para el uso casual aunque me parecieron muy incomodos nos se si sea porque sean mis primeros audifonos true-wireless pero la verdad que despues de 40 min sentia la incomodidad que nigun audifono wired in ear me habia dado para ser un poco mas descriptivo con respecto a la incomodidad es similar a cuando te recuestas de lado con los audifonos puestos
3,Keeps falling off my ear and it's very frustrating other than that it's very good. I like it
5,The sound quality is pretty good. I hope it will last. In terms of bluetooth connection the earbuds must be fully charged to start with.
5,Muy comodos
2,Se caen continuamente ya que no se acomodan al canal auditivo a pesar de que le pongas las almohadillas grandes por lo que creo que es recomendable comprar un sujetador. Las frecuencias de los bajos de plano no existen.La batería del audífono izquierdo dura menos a pesar de que los uso al mismo tiempo y los cargo por igual.Sí tienen buen volumen ya que los audífonos tienen su propio control y además lo ajustas en el reproductor.
5,Aunque mucho tiempo puestos pueden cansar como vienen con tapones de tamaños (CH M G) ayuda un buen y tienen buena calidad de sonido. La batería no dura tanto pero unos tres días de uso regular sí aguantan bien. Recomendados ✨
3,I wanted cheaper wireless buds for running so that if I lose one while out I won't be too upset. These have decent sound for the price stay in really well and connect seamlessly. Better than any other bluetooth I've had.I've had issues where one or both earbuds won't charge or only enough to get 30 mins out of them. Wiggling the prongs in the case seems to fix the issue most of the time but annoying at best. Play pause and skip has never worked for me I think it just requires too much pressure. I also don't love the way they angle in the ear but not a dealbreaker.Overall pretty good I'd buy them again.
5,La calidad de los materiales en mi opinión es buena más si los comparo con otros audífonos que he tenido en cuanto a la calidad de sonido  es un punto medio pero puede ser mejor si configuras el sonido en lo que respecta a comodidad al ser tan ligeros casi no se sienten y puedo pasar el tiempo que dure la batería con ellos un problema que tengo es que cuando no están los audífonos le entre suciedad al estuche haciendo que aveces uno no cargue porque esta sucio debido  a la tierra o al polvo
5,Muy buenos hasta ahora sin problemas ni inconvenientes
5,Precio y calidad (Recomendado)
5,Están muy prácticos lo q no me gusta es el botón físico.
5,Comodo si colocas la goma acorde al tamaño de tu oido ligero buena duración de batería los controles son algo confusos pero te habitas rápidamente a ellos.
5,Caminando no se caen falta probarlos haciendo ejercicio aunque están super cómodos y apenas los estoy usando falta un poco de mas tiempo pero de inició algo excelente y genial!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               El estuche de carga es muy pequeño fácil de usar y portar donde sea
5,Buen sonido y mejor calidad de la que esperaba
5,La calidad de los materiales en mi opinión es buena más si los comparo con otros audífonos que he tenido en cuanto a la calidad de sonido  es un punto medio pero puede ser mejor si configuras el sonido en lo que respecta a comodidad al ser tan ligeros casi no se sienten y puedo pasar el tiempo que dure la batería con ellos un problema que tengo es que cuando no están los audífonos le entre suciedad al estuche haciendo que aveces uno no cargue porque esta sucio debido  a la tierra o al polvo
5,Muy práctico
3,I wanted cheaper wireless buds for running so that if I lose one while out I won't be too upset. These have decent sound for the price stay in really well and connect seamlessly. Better than any other bluetooth I've had.I've had issues where one or both earbuds won't charge or only enough to get 30 mins out of them. Wiggling the prongs in the case seems to fix the issue most of the time but annoying at best. Play pause and skip has never worked for me I think it just requires too much pressure. I also don't love the way they angle in the ear but not a dealbreaker.Overall pretty good I'd buy them again.
5,Les écouteurs je l’es adore ses les écouteurs que j’aime le plus elle son petite elle passe partout le case aussi on a même une application si on les perd
5,Precio y calidad (Recomendado)
5,Están muy prácticos lo q no me gusta es el botón físico.
3,It’s good
1,Don't like that we have only had these for 2 months and they no longer work and can't do anything as we are past return window
3,Good quality on sound and when used for calls.My issue is the battery life. If you want something to have for a short time these are for you. Any length of time longer then 2 hrs you'll have to either switch the ear buds or have to put them to charge.
5,Great product at a very affordable price.  It's not the quality of a $400. Pair however same or better than many $150.00 range product.  Highly recommended.
3,The sound is good and all but I just don’t find that they are very comfortable on my ears
3,I must say that this review will be short and to the point... this model of Skull Candy earbuds are very "middle of the road" or "unremarkable". That being said I have a short list of likes and dislikes.** Like **- the casing is a very likeable and secure design that allows you to tether it to your clothing or other desired point. As with most casings it also serves as your charger for the earbuds.- the pods themselves are very comfortable to wear even for longer periods of time.- Bluetooth connections are very stable and I was easily able to get beyond 50ft from the source of signal without physical obstructions.- Ability to use either left or right bud as a solo unit. This helps with my biggest dislike of these buds and that is battery life. I tend to use them for extensive phone use and being able to use both as a solo unit one after the other might die is a flexible and welcome feature.** Disliked **- 3.5 hour battery life. I understand that the pods are quite small and that limits physical battery size but for me at work or at home 3.5 hrs is a non starter. The case provides another 9hrs worth of power but they still need time to sit in the case to charge. That equates to down time when you may not want it.Finally - sound quality is "ok". I say that because I found the sound to be a little too "flat" for my liking. EQs can help a bit but ultimately sound quality resides in the pods themselves and these ones are somewhat lacking in that area.My recommendation is to look at all options in this price range before making this decision. These aren't horrible but there are better options.2.5 stars.
3,I have mixed emotions about these earbuds. The price is about as good as it can get. Their Bluetooth connectivity is amazing (neither earbud cuts out regardless of whether my phone's in my pocket or the other room). The sound quality is good which is to be expected of Skullcandy. However the microphone's noise cancellation could be greatly improved. Almost everyone with whom I speak on the phone says they have trouble hearing me over background noise.I lost the charging case for my first pair which was my bad (they fell out of my pocket while on a walk). My biggest issue is that when I purchased a pair to replace them they appear to have been used upon arrival. The box was sealed and the earbuds had the right stickers on them. However the charging case is damaged and there was a hair inside of it. I don't know if this is a Skullcandy problem or an Amazon problem but it's disappointing to receive a "new" product and learn that it was previously used. That said I don't want to return them because of the hassel the fact that I'll be without earbuds for another 24 hours and because Amazon is likely going to chuck these into a garbage. Still it's a bit of a bummer.
5,Great product very good sound and batteryDefinitely a great and much cheaper alternative to AirPods
5,He leído comentarios que mencionaban un bajo volumen al momento de usarlos pero no he tenido ese problema en absoluto. Tiene muchas funciones como volumen contestar llamadas pausar música y cambiar canciones. El manual de usuario incluido es confuso pero con un QR puedes entrar a un manual digital donde explica las características con texto y video. (Aunque sólo viene en inglés). 100% recomendado.
3,Esperaba más del producto fueron un regalo para un niño y a él le gustaron y es enrendible que por el precio no tendrán un audio premium ni los mejores materiales pero la calidad del audio pudo ser mejor y la calidad del producto se siente frágil como si con cualquier caída se fuesen a romper.
1,Es muy problemático para presionar los botones y  poder conectarlos

5,I don't use headphones or ear buds a lot but I wanted a cheap pair to have on hand. The Dimes have amazing sound quality and good battery life for what I paid. The buds only have 3 hours of battery but that is more than enough for me and the case holds an additional 8 hours.The buds fit well in my ears and are quite comfortable. They are not built for sound canceling but that's not a feature I need.Skull Candy continues to provide quality items for low cost. I'm very impressed.

4,These work just fine and the sound quality is decent dinged one star because the colour is much more flat and pastel-y than in the picture.
3,Buen sonido para su precio pero muy incomodos en los oídos lastiman bastante tenerlos puestos me decepcionaron un poco.
5,Good earbuds battery lasts a long time. nice proper fit in my ears. And solid sound quality this is my second pair (first went through washing machine unfortunately) and very happy with them the good quality for good price 👏
1,Bought this item and asked for a replacement. Both times it charged only once and never recharged. I didn't know it was that difficult to charge an appliance 😅
4,Work great at everything only con for me is the bass not there

5,Comodo si colocas la goma acorde al tamaño de tu oido ligero buena duración de batería los controles son algo confusos pero te habitas rápidamente a ellos.
5,Working great
5,Caminando no se caen falta probarlos haciendo ejercicio aunque están super cómodos y apenas los estoy usando falta un poco de mas tiempo pero de inició algo excelente y genial!
5,Lo uso para clases en línea y oír música para ejercicio muy poco ya que siento no se acomoda bien en la oreja como para hacer movimientos.
5,Cuenta con buena autonomía y calidad de audio.Excelente relación costo beneficio.
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               No son tan cómodos y no escuchan bien

5,sirven para ejercitarse tiene una buena duracion de las baterias y son comodos 1000% recomendado
5,I was forced into getting wireless earbuds when my new phone didn't have a headphone jack. Was sure I'd hate them and lose them constantly but they've actually been fantastic. No wires getting tangled up in stuff when I'm out running errands they stay in my ears with no issues at all and I can easily adjust the music by touching the earbud instead of rummaging around in my purse to find my phone. Their only downside is they don't last more than 2-3 hours max but they do charge inside the case while you're out and about so that extends the battery life by a few more hours. Sound quality and noise cancellation are both great. Sometimes I wear them without anything playing just to block out annoying people ha!
5,Muy cómodos para ejercitarse y la calidad de audio es superior las llamadas ininterrumpidas y la conexión de muy buena calidad.Definitivamente recomendable por el precio y la marca.
5,Cuenta con buena autonomía y calidad de audio.Excelente relación costo beneficio.
5,hasta el momento no he tenido ningún inconveniente con los audífonos tienen una buena calidad y un mejor precio
5,Muy cómodo y excelente volumen
5,Para el precio la calidad es excelente
4,El producto funciona bien es mejor cargarlo con un cargador usb (no incluido) que a una entrada usb.No me gustó que el cable de carga es demasiado corto pero cumplo le su función.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Lastiman un poco en los oídos pero la pila dura bastante y el tamaño es ideal.
5,Feliz con este artículo buena calidad por un precio accesible.
1,These buds lasted all of 30 days. They were worn and used all under normal conditions. Now they sound like tin cans. Would not recommend
1,They're only good to listen to music orherwise no one can hear me. Not even at full volume. They're not made for phone calls.How do I get my money back?
1,A los pocos días se descompuso el audífono izquierdo
5,Yes the battery life is shorter than the average Bluetooth earbuds but for $40 this is hands down an amazing set of wireless earbuds. So compact to carry around comfortable and slim profile in the ear. Good sound as well! Highly recommended.
5,I really like these. At first I had a hard time figuring out charging them. The cable it came with didn't work. I used a different cable I already had at home and now I'm happy with them.
1,Solamente los usé 2 o 3 veces y el audifono derecho dejó de cargar y ya no prendió
3,Batteries Don't last on these....  other than that... they are ok...
2,Pros:- Buena cancelación de ruido (a un 90%)- Buen sonido los bajos están presentes pero podría mejorarContras:- Son muy incómodos o al menos para el estilo de oreja que tengo lastiman después de un rato- Es difícil realizar los comandos dado que son de botones y no de touch y el botón es duro y tiende a lastimar la oreja al presionar- Se tardan mucho en cargar por completo (Aprox 3/4 hrs)- El cable de carga es muy corto
3,Cumplen su función pero no son lo mejor de mercado. Recomiendo mejor los de xaomi.
5,El producto muy bueno en calidad precio buen sonido para ser de Bluetooth muy cómodos buenos materiales
5,A mi se me caen después de un rato como que se mueven con las actividades a pesar de que no pesan la batería muy bien y tienen buena calidad en sonido se empiezan a resbalar del oído y terminan por salirse de su posición
4,Los recomiendo
3,Good product for it’s price!
5,Es sonido se escucha muy bien vale el precio 100% recomendables.
4,Por el precio esperaba menos calidad de sonido valen la pena
5,Buen producto con buen diseño y calidad de audio muy prácticos para llevar en cualquier lado un poco incomodo por tener que picarle al botón que tiene  cada auricular pero te acostumbras a ellos.
4,
5,A mi se me caen después de un rato como que se mueven con las actividades a pesar de que no pesan la batería muy bien y tienen buena calidad en sonido se empiezan a resbalar del oído y terminan por salirse de su posición
4,Buen producto solo que los repuestos son muy grandes apezar de venir en tamaños

4,Creo que por el precio que tienen están bien aunque hay varios detalles por los cuales no se ganan las 5 estrellas.Tienen buen sonido y un tamaño excelente para transportar pero se salen con facilidad del oído si corres.Aún así creo que valen lo que cuestan.
4,Pairing is simple.
4,Compré 2 cajas de audífonos y uno llegó con la caja de carga mal solo por ese detalle que arruinó el producto pero en si probé los otros y suenan bastante bien
5,Son geniales la calidad de audio sino eres muy exigente es buena son cómodos y no se caerán ya que traen distintas medidas de goma para tus oidos en el apartado de batería si tengo mis quejas pues para cargarlos de 0 a 100 en estuche tarda unas 5 a 7 horas de ahí en fuera todo muy bien su conectividad es genial
3,No tiene buen volumen ademas que casi siempre tengo problemas al vinvular ya que cuando lo hace solo suena uno
5,Excelente audio tomando encuenta el precio los uso para salir a correr y aíslan bastante el sonido exterior.Es verdad que no es para todos los oídos vienen con tres gomitas intercambiables (S M y G) yo uso las pequeñas y me quedan justos. Mientras a mi hermana que quería unos no le ajustan correctamente ya que son muy grandes.
5,Son muy cómodos difícilmente caen y la calidad del audio es bastante aceptable
1,Son incomodos de usar se desconectan a cada rato al pausar la música o los videos al minuto de no recibir la señal se desconectan y es muy molesto porque tarda muchísimo tiempo en conectarse de nuevo.
4,Delivery was impeccable as usual. I love the design and ease of use. Out of the box I peeled off the battery protection stickers turned them ON and they paired immediately. Then I read the instructions out of curiosity only. Sound is good but it lacks low frequencies for complete wholesomeness and presence. The microphone seems good enough as no one complained of bad sound quality which often happens with units in that price range. Even when I insisted to get opinions people commented that I sounded good. So far so good. We'll see if the pleasure lasts. I will more than likely buy a couple more to distrube them in the family.
5,
1,The right earbud didn't work...that's why for the first rime I am giving one star.
3,Sonido muy claro pero le hace falta potencia de sonido.
3,No es lo que esperaba de una marca cómo está hay mejores opciones por un precio mucho menor
3,Se escuchan muy bien pero el material deja mucho q desear y tienden a lastimar después de un uso de más de 3 h
5,Value at reasonable price
5,Like the skull candy brand. Never disappointed. Have a Bluetooth speaker and now these little guys.
4,- Creo que el hecho de que sean baratos para la marca que son corresponde a un detalle importante: NO SON TOUCH la cala Érica del logo es un BOTÓN en ambos auriculares. Esto hace incomodo e incluso doloroso manejar sus funciones al usarlos.- La calidad del sonido es excelente.- Ajusta bien al oído como cualquier otro.- El diseño me gusto.- Diría que tienen una buena relación calidad-precio.

5,Llegó antes de tiempo y en excelentes condiciones yo lo utilizo en el transporte súper cómodo discreto y tiene muy buen sonido
5,El diseño y color fueron lo que llamó la atención la duración de la batería es buena se utilizan para deportes y otras actividades en donde estorba el cable. Solamente se resbalan un poco por los canales auditivos ignoro por qué. Por lo demás son recomendables buen precio buena calidad y sonido.
5,de lo mejor muy bonitos y buen precio/calidad
5,Para algo tranquilo esta bien y son comodos y casi no se salen.
5,La batería tiene una buena duración.
5,This is the first set of wireless Earbuds I've owned didn't want to spend huge money on the ones made big a Big Fruit These are excellent! Only complaint is the battery life not very long about 4 hours but the case gives them another 8 hours and price is very affordable. No regrets.
5,Por su costo y calidad de audio vale la. Pena el gasto además que usarlos es muy fácil lo unico es que por su forma al I terior de. La. Oreja en ocasiones puede incomodar pero sólo si se usa por períodos. Demasiado largos fuera e. Son nus favoritos hasta el día de hoy
2,terrible product save up your money for something better connection on this thing is absurdly poor cant even walk fast with these in they end up breaking and going static even sitting down they sometimes skip a few beats trash product
5,good
5,Son unos audífonos cómodos y de excelente calidad
5,Lo mejor es la calidad y el precio
5,Al principio un poco incómodo pero enseguida te acostumbras
3,No se adapta correctamente a pesar de las diferentes gomas que trae.Dura poco la pila y cuando se escucha música y está uno en movimiento se corta constante la música o es variante el volumen
3,Me gustó que se escuchan claros y la batería si rinde y se cargan muy rápido solo que depende la oreja pueden ser incómodos
5,For the low cost these earbuds are fricken great!
3,Buen sonido y duración de la pila para su precio quizá sea la forma de mi oído en el izquierdo lo siento súper incómodo me deja adolorida la oreja
5,El producto está muy bien cumple con su función de buenos audífonos inalámbricos la batería es duradera a mí me ah llegado a durar una semana la batería del estuche (usándolo de 1 a 2 horas diarias) y tienen buen sonido. Y el hecho de que el estuche también sea llavero es muy práctico a la hora de cargarlos a todos lados y que no se te pierdan tan fácilmente. Producto recomendado.
5,Los audífonos son increíbles el color el tamaño el sonido duración de batería muy buenos bajos y además se puede ecualizar el audio con alguna aplicación y sacar aún mejor sonido. El único detalle es que no son tan cómodos vienen gomas para poder ajustarlos mejor dependiendo el tamaño de tu oído pero aún así al tiempo llega a ser un poco incómodos.

5,Son unos audífonos cómodos y de excelente calidad
3,The Battery Life on these are really short and the charging case does not make up for that.The design is weird they make the button on the stems ridiculously small. In consequence of that it is very uncomfortable and difficult to press the button while it's in your ear. I find myself taking one of the earbuds out just so I can pause play or skip a song.Aside from that the sound quality is good. If the battery life or design choices don't concern you they're a good buy.
4,I didn’t want to buy big expensive ones because I wouldn’t use them enough so this price point worked perfectly for me. Sound is more than adequate. They are comfortable to wear and it was easy to sync to my iPad and iPhone (I read reviews complaining about this I am by no means ‘techy’ and managed just fine) I can walk around wearing them and still stay connected to listen. I have no problems recommending these!
5,Al principio un poco incómodo pero enseguida te acostumbras
5,Lo mejor es la calidad y el precio
4,Se escucha muy bien sin embargo la separación de instrumentos deja mucho que desear ya que se escucha todo amontonado
2,no llega ni a las 10 hr con la bateria del estuche y parece que es porque tardan en apagarse al meterlos al estuche lo que hace que tengas que apagarlos y prenderlos cada vez que lo uses si quieres maximizar el tiempo de bateria el audio esta meh muy cargado en los graves y y los medios casi no se oyen no los recmoniendo.ah y molestan mucho en el trago y la concha cuando te los pones
4,I keep loosing one of my ear buds when I buy these type of ear buds so I now only buy cheap ones. I find these to be decent for their price point. They dont noise cancel but honestly I dont what that in my ear buds as I cannot hear traffic when cycling if they do. They have decent sound and are relatively comfortable. I have had a worse pair which cost more. I also prefer the physical button in these as it is easy to press compared to other brands buttons (especially the utterly useless capacitive touch buttons of other ear buds)
5,These are good! The noise cancellation is great calls are a bit fuzzy and there is no volume control on the buds. These buds do not stop when you take them out of your ear you have to stop the music by clicking the button or on your device. The volume is good and music is clear. I would not take professional calls n them as the microphone picks up a lot of background noise.
2,Demasiado incómodos el canal auditivo debe encajar exageradamente a la perfección para que se escuche "decente" por que de lo contrario escuchas un audio enlatado lo unico destacable es el tamaño y diseño son bonitos y ya. Pero el audio que promete es demasiado malo.Cosas destacables transporte y duración ha durado bastante despues de varias horas de uso pero es muy incómodo y por ende los dejas de usar para pasar a cargarlo.Definitivamente tienen mejores audifonos de cable que estos.
1,terrible terrible battery life.. beyond disappointed..”” UPDATE!!
5,son excelentes para el día díaSe escuchan bastante bien los recomiendo mucho
4,Muy buenos audífonos llevo varias semanas con ellos y no noto ninguna falla. La batería les dura mucho y son muy cómodos. Los audífonos se escuchan bastante alto solo que sí tienes que subirle el volumen A LOS AUDIFONOS y no solo al celular o dispositivo al que los tengas conectados. Ya los use bajo la lluvia (ligera) y si resisten. Creo que lo único que no me gustó es que el sonido no tiene buen bajo y algunas canciones no se aprecian tan bien...
5,Muy prácticos para todo buen micrófono llega en tiempo corres y no se caen la duración de la batería es poca pero suficiente para lo que necesitas.
5,Son buenos no lo mejor de skullcandy. Pero son aceptables
5,son excelentes para el día díaSe escuchan bastante bien los recomiendo mucho
1,A los pocos días se descompuso el audífono izquierdo
3,Batteries Don't last on these....  other than that... they are ok...
1,Solamente los usé 2 o 3 veces y el audifono derecho dejó de cargar y ya no prendió
5,Works amazingly great sound quality and great portability
1,terrible terrible battery life.. beyond disappointed..”” UPDATE!!
5,Son muy cómodos y muy buena batería
4,I didn’t want to buy big expensive ones because I wouldn’t use them enough so this price point worked perfectly for me. Sound is more than adequate. They are comfortable to wear and it was easy to sync to my iPad and iPhone (I read reviews complaining about this I am by no means ‘techy’ and managed just fine) I can walk around wearing them and still stay connected to listen. I have no problems recommending these!
5,Son bastantes buenos en lo que se refiere a audio y duración de la pila. Me ha durado hasta 3 días sin cargar. En cuanto a comodidad no son lo mejor ya que al tenerlos mucho tiempo puede llegar a producir un pequeño dolor en la oreja fuera de es un buen producto.
2,Demasiado incómodos el canal auditivo debe encajar exageradamente a la perfección para que se escuche "decente" por que de lo contrario escuchas un audio enlatado lo unico destacable es el tamaño y diseño son bonitos y ya. Pero el audio que promete es demasiado malo.Cosas destacables transporte y duración ha durado bastante despues de varias horas de uso pero es muy incómodo y por ende los dejas de usar para pasar a cargarlo.Definitivamente tienen mejores audifonos de cable que estos.
4,Muy cómodos y de gran calidad precio a lo que me tiene acostumbrado ya la marca desde hace años. Lo único que no me agrada es que cuando estoy en movimiento y sudo un poco se me resbalan de los oídos y tengo que acomodarlos de nuevo. Con mi teléfono no alcanzaba buen volumen al máximo hasta que bajé una app para subir el volumen aún más
5,El sonido es bueno y la duración de la batería cumple con las expectativas
5,Me encantaron  los llevo al gimnasio y todo pefecto.
5,me gusto el sonido buen sonido para el precio que es si eres un usuario que no usa audífonos todo el día son perfectos para ti por la batería. Yo los uso para cuando voy a mi escuela y me van sobrados
3,Pros:  low price and not made in ChinaCons: doesn't fit well in my ears so you can't appreciate the decent sound quality. all other earbuds i've ever owned fit me well. sometimes the bluetooth cuts in and out.
5,Pequeños y fáciles de usar muy discretos.
5,Me gusta mucho para cuando voy al gym por que aislan muy bien el sonido
5,Es bastante cómodo y el sonido es muy bueno

5,Por su costo y calidad de audio vale la. Pena el gasto además que usarlos es muy fácil lo unico es que por su forma al I terior de. La. Oreja en ocasiones puede incomodar pero sólo si se usa por períodos. Demasiado largos fuera e. Son nus favoritos hasta el día de hoy
5,Al principio un poco incómodo pero enseguida te acostumbras
5,Lo mejor es la calidad y el precio
5,Son unos audífonos cómodos y de excelente calidad
3,The Battery Life on these are really short and the charging case does not make up for that.The design is weird they make the button on the stems ridiculously small. In consequence of that it is very uncomfortable and difficult to press the button while it's in your ear. I find myself taking one of the earbuds out just so I can pause play or skip a song.Aside from that the sound quality is good. If the battery life or design choices don't concern you they're a good buy.
5,This is the first set of wireless Earbuds I've owned didn't want to spend huge money on the ones made big a Big Fruit These are excellent! Only complaint is the battery life not very long about 4 hours but the case gives them another 8 hours and price is very affordable. No regrets.
4,Se escucha muy bien sin embargo la separación de instrumentos deja mucho que desear ya que se escucha todo amontonado
2,no llega ni a las 10 hr con la bateria del estuche y parece que es porque tardan en apagarse al meterlos al estuche lo que hace que tengas que apagarlos y prenderlos cada vez que lo uses si quieres maximizar el tiempo de bateria el audio esta meh muy cargado en los graves y y los medios casi no se oyen no los recmoniendo.ah y molestan mucho en el trago y la concha cuando te los pones
3,Mala calidad en llamadas
3,Tiene sonido excelente la calidad de audio para las llamadas se escucha clarísimo y sin interferencias. La música es inmejorable. Hay que acomodar los silicones del tamaño que necesitas para el oído porque coincido con algunos comentarios en qué se salen y se caen. Es muy práctico el estuche de carga tiene una pestaña para asegurar el cerrado del mismo. El precio es bastante attactivo.Sin embargo le puse 3 estrellas porque tuve la mala fortuna que un audífono no sirvió no retiene la carga de la batería y a los 5 segundos se escucha el aviso de "battery low" y al segundo siguiente se apaga. Los tuve que devolver :'( pero en definitiva los voy a volver a comprar.
1,Every 3-5 seconds they would skip. Sent them back
5,About 2 months in with them and still going strong. The quality is really good too. I like them
1,These are absolutely horrible battery life is about 10 minutes and they  disconnect randomly! Don't waste your money.
4,Excelente calidad duración de batería muy buena tamaño perfecto y diseño genial.Lo único es que para pausar cambiar canciones volumen etc. desde los audífonos es algo incómodo porque hay que presionar un botón que al final hay que apoyar sobre la oreja.
4,Objetivo de compra logrado la ergonómia es un punto a favor lo uso para correr y no se caen cuentan con gomas para el ajuste de tu oído el sonido es bueno y cumple con la finalidad para lo que los compre.
5,Ofrecen un audio bastante balanceado teniendo en cuenta lo que cuestan si buscan unos auriculares para el día a día de tamaño discreto con buena calidad de audio y a buen precio esta es la mejor opción.
3,Se escuchan bien pero pierden señal constantemente cuando vas caminando y traes el telefono en el pantalon entonces se escucha todo cortado de vez en cuando
3,Tienen buen sonido y buena duración de batería pero después de un rato son muy incómodos y a veces no se acomodan lo suficiente como para no caerse.
3,El volumen es algo que me causa demasiado conflicto suena demasiado bajo. Deberían hacer algo al respecto.
5,Están chicos el material si deja mucho que desear como plástico barato pero que esperaban por el precio el sonido está bien la batería como unas 4 horas aproximadamente el touch si está  muy mal de plano te lo tienes que quitar para poner pausa etc
3,La duración de las baterías es regular  y no se salen al ejercitarse pero no resultan tan cómodos como otros Skullcandy convencionales.
4,Pequeños y prácticos con gran alcance de Bluetooth pero bastante incómodos a pesar de las diferentes gomitas que trae no se aguantan por mucho tiempo.
4,Son buenos discretos (dependiendo el color) por el precio son buenos tiene un audio fiel algo amontonados los instrumentos pero son buenos
5,Son sencillos un botón de cada lado y un foco led la pila dura bastante en lo personal me gusta mucho su sencillez en los comandos
4,Excelente calidad duración de batería muy buena tamaño perfecto y diseño genial.Lo único es que para pausar cambiar canciones volumen etc. desde los audífonos es algo incómodo porque hay que presionar un botón que al final hay que apoyar sobre la oreja.
5,De primera impresión me gustó su diseño al usarlos note lo cómodo y ligeros que son al traerlos puestos muy buena conexión y su sonido si tuviera que calificarlo en calidad y potencia le daría un 7 de 10 los hay mejores si pero por este costo sin duda alguna son una excelente opción a la par o tal vez un poco mejores que los xiaomi.
4,Los audífonos tienen buen desempeño el micrófono se escucha bien en exteriores. Si no estás acostumbrado a los audífonos in-ear son un poco incómodos. Cumplen su función para trayectos cortos.
2,No cuentan con calidad de audio y no son cómodos.
1,They don’t stay in your ears they fall out constantly …
3,Battery life not so good
2,Llegan a ser incómodos para algunos tipos de orejas y los botones son duros. Pero si eso no es inconveniente son muy recomendados
5,Llevo como 4 meses con ellos y resulta que son unos audífonos geniales para los que no estamos listos para gastar mucho por unos audífonos de Bluetooth están perfectos buen sonido las llamadas no son las mejores la batería dura lo suficiente dura como 3 horas pero carga fácil y son de confiar.
4,Obviamente por el precio no puedes esperar una calidad super premiun uno de las cosas que no me gusto fue lo que tardan en cargar (es bastante lento) el boton es incomodo de precionar y aunque  el audio y los microfonos suenan bastante bien respecto a otros por el mismo precio en ciertas canciones se escucha muy amontonados los instrumentos con la voz del cantante pero buelbo a recalcar por su precio son de lo mejor que te puedes encontrar.
5,buen sonido de bajos  muy comodos y prácticos los recomiendo
4,Me sorprendieron bastante antes era fan de la marca pero siempre se descomponian les di una oportunidad porque no quería invertir mucho en audífonos para el gym y salieron bien siguen escuchándose bien llevo un mes con ellos no he tenido tema con la batería solo los he cargado 2 veces son pequeños y no se safan único detalle los botones de mando en el audífono no funcionan al tacto es un botón que debes apretar tal cual y es bastante duro pero nada que no pueda controlar desde el celular
4,La verdad es que estos audífonos son mas de lo que esperaba tienen buenos bajos y unos graves bien a secas. Son muy cómodos y tienen una cancelación de ruido activa bastante sorprendente. Los materiales son buenos.Los detalles que tiene es que al ser un modelo no tan reciente tienen carga micro y la latencia es algo a mejorar auque nada grave también cambiaria los botones ya que es muy incomodo el utilizarlos tanto que prefiero hacerlo desde mi celular.
4,Muy cómodos y muy buen sonido. Solo les falta más tiempo de duración de la batería
2,After wearing them for a week they're very uncomfortable. The way they're designed hits part of my ear and it hurts after wearing for more then 30 minutes. Don't even bother trying to use the buttons either the amount of pressure I need even while trying to be gentle really hurts my ears.Could be way better.
5,Son fáciles de transportar  cómodos en mis orejas pequeñas y la batería es de larga duración
1,Finding ear buds is a nightmare when you have those small little ear holes that no ear buds fit into....These headphones would be just fine if they fit (even using the smallest ear tips they provided) but instead I have to wear them in the opposite ears as this is the only way I can wear the earbuds without them falling out. Overall there is nothign wrong with them they just dont fit tiny ears!!
5,La mejor calidad de sonido materiales y practicidad en un precio bastante bueno.
3,Se escuchan bien pero pierden señal constantemente cuando vas caminando y traes el telefono en el pantalon entonces se escucha todo cortado de vez en cuando
4,Volumen bajo calidad de los materiales muy buenos pero la duración de la pila es mucho menor a lo esperado.
5,Ofrecen un audio bastante balanceado teniendo en cuenta lo que cuestan si buscan unos auriculares para el día a día de tamaño discreto con buena calidad de audio y a buen precio esta es la mejor opción.
4,personas amantes de la música de reggueton y rap con estos audífonos los bajos se escuchan excelente y de muy buena calidad para ser tan pequeños
5,Los ame los volvería a comprar
5,Hay bastantes comentarios diciendo que el volumen es muy bajo pero nooo!! Cuando los compré tenía miedo que el volumen no fuera el adecuado pero se escucha bastante alto con solo subir dos veces el volumen!! Y hablando de la calidad del audio es increíble te aisla del ruido exterior con una correcta posición del audífono!! Así que los recomiendo al 100% si los quieres comprar.
4,Buenos al tacto buena calidad de materiales aunque algo decepcionado con el volumen ya que es algo bajo en cuanto a conectividad y batería todo bien
4,Si estas buscando audífonos económicos con buen sonido estos son excelentes
2,Horrible mauvais fit la qualité audio très ordinaire le volume fluctue ce qui est une première pour moi je suis retourné a mes anciennes qui ne sont pas une marque connue.
3,Donde puedo hacer una aclaración? Me llegaron los audífonos pero venia sin los repuestos de los chupones y no traía cable de carga dónde puedo hacer la reclamación?
1,I picked these up because they appeared similar to my AirPod pros in size but cheaper so I felt better bringing them around. I was very excited but the earbuds fell out of my ears I tried every tip nothing the material is very slippery to the touch and does nothing to keep the bud in your ear. The only way one would stay in is if my ear was pointed at the ceiling just standing is too much for these to stay in
1,This product is absolutely awful. It has a terrible battery life which dies within minutes of usage. The ergonomics of this device isn't ideal and the product keeps falling out of my ears. I haven't been able to get more than 10 minutes of battery life out of this device before it dies.Unusable. Do not purchase.
5,compact case good sound for price
4,Está bien pero a secas nada más por qué no usan cables y se ve que se sujeta bien a la caja al cargarse pero si se tarda cinco horas en cargar cuando artículos unos pesos más caros y con casi el doble de batería tardan dos el volumen no es bajisimo pero si lo que quieres es unos audífonos dónde se escuche la música fuertísimo pues te aconsejo otro producto tengo unos de diadema que valen menos de la mitad que estos y son Bluetooth y suenan fuertísimo y unos de cable que igual los seguiré probando haber que actualización coloco y si lo de que nada más se puede usar uno y se emparejan rapidísimo al sacar el otro y la música no se corta es cierto
1,If this is not the last set of Bluetooth earbuds on earth get anything else. I found them very uncomfortable. They do not fit well in the ear so they will fall out repeatedly. I bought these because they were cheap and I thought Skullcandy was reputable. I have used enacfire anchor mpow and Boltune - all of those are way more comfortable.
5,I bought them as my wife is hard of hearing. She can hear pretty good.

4,This is very good for it price but the girl in the background scared the sh☆t out of me when my battery was low and it was at night time....I literally thought someone was near at the side of my ear since she said it one of the earbuds....It seem so real..
5,Excelente producto diseño precio funcionalidad.
4,Perfect earbuds for someone who uses them to listen to people speak on streaming platforms etc. I wouldn't suggest purchasing these if you're going to listen to music as the sound quality isn't up to par.
5,Me gustó que la pila le dura bastante y se escuchan muy bien muy buen precio para lo que ofrecen
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I bought 2 sets of skullcandy mini headphones 1 black and the other gray.  The gray box was open and no headphones inside.
4,Los compre en color gris oscuro los ocupo para el gimnasio y son cómodos no se salen de la oreja tienen buen sonido y volumen la batería si les dura no se específicamente cuanto por que los uso por ratos. Pero en general por el precio si valen la pena.
5,Sencillo de usar y recargar sin detalle he pasado 10 horas semanales con uso y sin necesidad de cargarlos de nuevo.Cancelan el ruido de una manera aceptable y son prácticos de cargar.De la misma marca había comprado unos SESH y no cargaban correectamente ytenían probleemas de desconexión y fallo en un audifono mucho mejor esta versión aunque estéticameente sea mejor el otro modelo.

4,Es pequeño y cómodo para llevar pero su batería deja mucho que desear; digo por el precio de este producto está muy bien.Si buscan audífonos con buen audio a buen precio ésta sería una excelente opción solo deben tener en cuenta que la batería de la caja que recarga los audífonos no les va a durar más de tres cargas
5,Son buenos.La batería no dura tanto como otras marcas más económicas. Es un producto promedio nada sobresaliente
5,The media could not be loaded.
5,La conexión automática aunque a veces se tienes q repetir el proceso de guardar y usar para q se reconecte pero es menor
5,Por el costo se me hacen buen producto aunque siento que no acomoda tan bien en el oído. Lo que me gusta es que cuando los sacas de la cajita automáticamente se encienden los dos.
5,Muy bonito el color
2,I bought these for my son.The charge doesn’t last 3 hours. They over heat.  The sound quality is muffled. I do not recommend these.
5,It’s good
2,Que decepción. El sonido está bueno pero el micrófono no tiene ningún filtro si hay un poco de ruido lo amplifica y la llamada es imposible. Y después ni 4 meses ya se murió un audífono. Que mal.
5,Muy buena calidad con respecto al precio superó mis expectativas 👌
5,Los compré para mi hijo de 12 años. Funcionan muy bien! Los recomiendo!
5,Son muy buenos
5,Muy buen producto buen sonido cómodos lo malo es que a mí se me caen al correr
4,Me molestan un poco en los oidos
1,Quede sumamente decepcionado solo sirve de forma excelente en un lugar cerrado como un cuarto me los he llevado al gym y hay mucha interferencia con otros dispositivos Bluetooth  se corta demasiado el audio Se sube solo el audio no cumple con la distancia que dice del dispositivo con el celular debes estar casi pegado a el para que no haya interferencia no volvería a comprar de esa marca nada
5,Me gusta el tamaño y son muy prácticos
5,Excelentes auriculares si tu presupuesto es reducido y buscas un artículo de marca reconocida buena duración excelente conectividad excelente audio probablemente la comodidad es dependiendo la ergonomía de la persona súper compactos un esencial del diario y a un muy buen precio
2,This would of been a great cheap pair of ear buds if it would stay in my ear. If I move my head they fall out. And when I ski with them on and use a hat to keep them put they hurt my ears to the point I have to take them off. Also when I wear my motorcycle helmet they come out of my ears just enough to not hear any bass and sound tingy.There are way better choices on amazon for ear buds
5,Son de buena calidad conforme al precio que tienen la entrega llego a tiempo en un mes de funcionamiento no hay quejas buen producto
5,Son buenos.La batería no dura tanto como otras marcas más económicas. Es un producto promedio nada sobresaliente
5,Me gustaron mucho de buena calidad por el precio al que estan
3,Esta marca siempre me gusto pero con estos últimos me decepciono difícil de parear y su sonido no muy bueno
5,Por el costo se me hacen buen producto aunque siento que no acomoda tan bien en el oído. Lo que me gusta es que cuando los sacas de la cajita automáticamente se encienden los dos.
5,The media could not be loaded.

5,Perfectos. Mucha comodidad y buen sonido.
5,Mucho mejor de lo que esperaba  excelente producti
5,Unos audífonos muy cómodos y ligeros. Llegaron una semana antes de la fecha estipulada pero la batería es muy poca a mi gusto. Pero en cuestión de audio se escuchan muy bien y tienen bloqueo de ruido lo que hacen que sea una experiencia diferente.
5,Bastante duración de la bateríaMuy recomendable
2,El paquete llegó super rápido y en perfecto estado y los audífonos sonaban genial. El problema es que el derecho siempre estaba drenando batería y mataba la que quedaba en el estuche de carga. Por más que intenté solucionarlo jamás pude hacerlo funcionar correctamente. Inicié el proceso de devolución.
5,Los recomiendo ampliamentemuy buenos audífonosexcelente calidad.
5,Son muy pequeños y cómodos suenan bastante bien y tiene potentes bajos para su tamaño... Hasta ahora todo bien con ellos me gustan!.
5,Son de buena calidad conforme al precio que tienen la entrega llego a tiempo en un mes de funcionamiento no hay quejas buen producto
5,Me gusta el tamaño y son muy prácticos
5,A mi me encantaronDesafortunadamente en mi cel se oyen bajosPero en otros modelos se oyen muy bienSe cargan muy rapido.
5,es un producto muy bueno tiene una bateria muy buena y con calidad de audio para el precio que este marca
5,El producto es mucho más de lo que esperaba son super cómodos y con un audio que supera las expectativas 👌
5,Tienen buen sonido para ser BT buena duración de la batería y el diseño no molesta en los oídos.
5,Lo compre para un regalo de Navidad y me llego super rapido. Se ve que son producto original
3,No se ajustan bien al oido intente con todas las gomas sin embargo ninguna se ajusta y no se puede explotar al maximo su excelente audio
4,Es una marcá que me gusta mucho y tiene una estética increíble pero este modelo de auriculares no me resulta tan cómodo cómo parece son para aquellos que literalmente no pronuncia casi palabra alguna ya que se desacomodan si tú hablas por muy poco que sea o en un caso más curioso si estás masticando chicle sientes mucha incomodidad en tus oídos si los llevas puestos además de sentir como se te mueven lo cual es una sensación muy incómoda
4,Me gustaron por cómodos son de muy buena calidad pero lo mejor de todo es que los pesqué en oferta 😁
4,These little buds are super cool for the price well engineered case and charging system. Pairing is very easy & 3 hrs of sound is more than enough for me. I approve.
5,So I own 2 pairs of these & both have been through my washing machine several times. There may have been a few runs through the dryer too -_-Not within the case but just individual ear buds. They still work fantastically! :D
1,Battery life is too short. I charged longer but it does not seem working
1,nope!
2,Unfortunately these bad boys were way too bulky to settle into the curve of my ear - they fit my BF's ears just fine. It's not the part the goes into my ear canal it's the part that is supposed to tuck into the outer ear. Bummer.
5,Suenan muy bien la batería dura todo el día son muy cómodos y a pesar e no tener cancelación de tuido ajustan muy bien como para no tener distracciones externas.
3,Por ser Skullcandy sinceramente esperaba mucho más el sonido es muy bajo dura mucho la batería y son muy fáciles de usar pero al menos en 3 equipos que los he usado el sonido se entrecorta mucho yo sinceramente no me encuentro contento por mi compra pero por el precio me conformo
3,Son útiles le dura bastante la batería o carga pero a veces en llamadas no se escucha claro. Si aguanta distancias largas alejados del dispositivo el sonido es bueno a medias.
5,En uso continuo las baterías me han durado alrededor de 4 horas. Y el estuche me ha alcanzado para 2-3 recargas. Para mí ésto es suficiente para todo el día.No los uso para ejercitarme pero sí para desplazarme al trabajo y no he tenido problemas.Comienzan a molestarme un poco después de 4 hora pero sólo un poco. Por la calidad de sonido (buena) es algo que paso por alto.
2,Pésimos la batería sólo les funcionó como dos meses
5,Great
5,It’s good

5,Quick pairing
5,Son comodos
5,Typically I order sports earbuds with hooks but I was having difficulty finding a proper pair.  I saw these at a good price and decided to give them a try.1. The size of the case is about as small as it gets and they are super portable.  It's about a 1/4 the size of the sports bud bulky case.2. The sound quality is great and perfect for my workouts3. This was a really pleasant surprise but they don't fall out of your ears.  I've worn them while lifting weights and running and that have not fallen out or moved in my ear.  This was my biggest fear with non-hook earbuds and it's really nice because they look much better and more sleek.4. I can't comment on the battery life yet but they do appear to have a shorter life than other earbuds.  This isn't an issue for me because I don't use them all day so they are perfect for working out/running then charging.I would buy again.
5,Good value for price

4,Honestly I bought these because I’m not paying for Apple air pods (over priced garbage). So with that said over all I’m quite happy with these so far. Will have to see how they hold up. Comfort and fitment is good sound quality is good and battery life we will have to wait and see.In terms of price these are great the controls on the pods themselves could be better but for $35 gym head phones I can’t complain.What brought me to purchase these over air pods or say Bose ear pods is the price. Realistically you have to think of these as a disposable item. You know the battery will do as batteries do and slowly degrade until they no longer hold a competent charge. And the batteries in these as well as other much more expensive versions are not meant to be replaced. So that said these are an item I purchased with a hopeful expectation of 2 years service. With that said they come in at an acceptable price point.
5,Para ejercitarxe muy bueno
5,Muy buen producto es tal cual en la descripción tienen buen sonido y dura bastante la pila 100% recomendado
5,El producto que quería la pila dura algo bien y se escucha perfecto es bueno para escuchar música y se acopla muy bien en tu oído lo recomiendo
5,Son súper cómodos y muy fáciles de llevar
5,Me gusta este tipo de audífonos por su practicidad y funcionamiento
5,Can hear everything going on around when listening to music. Not loud
4,Everything is great except battery life (I feel like it is not as long as advertised but may be because I forgot to charge?) and the earbuds will fall out of my ears from time to time if I didn't put it in the perfect position.
5,Just as described.  Arrived quickly

5,Nada espectacular son cómodos y se escuchan bien funciona para el día a día  muy buena relación calidad precio
3,Pensé que eran más pequeños y lastiman.
5,Son bastante buenos por el precio además de que se escuchan bastante bien
5,Son cómodos y suenan bien!Los recomiendo y llegaron rápido.
5,Realmente no esperaba un producto como el que recibí.Por el precio pensé que sería un producto "desechable".Me sorprendió que mantiene buena velocidad en la conexión y no presenta retraso de sonido como otros auriculares. Obviamente no son auriculares de alta gama pero me siento satisfecho con su desempeño.Volvería a comprar.Lo único malo es que los tips de silicona se desgastan muy rápido.En lo personal eso se puede solucionar comprando Tips de Espuma viscoelástica y se arregla todo.La batería es muy decente para uso en oficina y llamadas son buenos.No pesan y son cómodos.
4,Sounds quality is pretty good for $30 headphones and the small size of the case is great the only issue I have is that they are somewhat uncomfortable to wear due to differences in the size of my ears compared to the rubber earbud. I tried using a larger rubber earbud from another set of headphones but they just prevented the headphones from charging in the case. Overall they are good but I have to dock it for the comfort.
5,La verdad son mejor de lo que esperabatienen una larga duración en la batería los compre hace mas de 2 meses y los uso casi a diario en el trabajo pero solo por dos horas a lo muchoy la verdad los he cargado como 3 veces desde que los compre tienen mucha bateria y el sonido es muy buenohay que aprender a usar los botones solamente y minimiza bastante el sonido que hay al rededor son muy buenos para el precio y marca

5,Los audífonos cumplen su función tienen una duración de pila justa si buscas audífonos con duración de batería larga esta opción podría dejarte poco convencida/o.Tiene una calidad de bajos muy buena le da un toque muy particular a la música.El tamaño del estuche de carga es perfecto pues no ocupa nada de espacio puedes traerlos en la bolsa de los jeans o en la mochila y pasan desapercibidos.Para mi tienen 9 de 10 y el único inconveniente que les pongo es la duración de la pila aunque si los buscas para hacer ejercicio o actividades no tan largas son ideales.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Audífonos muy compactos tanto en su caja como en el auricular. Esperaba que por su precio sonarán apenas aceptables pero quede sorprendido tienen un sonido muy limpio un poco reforzado en sus graves con muy buen volúmen. El tamaño es muy bueno son discretos medianamente cómodos tienen largo alcance de Bluetooth y buena bateria apesar de ser pequeños. Lo único malo son sus botones ya que son malísimos soy muy duros e incómodos de usar. Por su precio y sus beneficios puedo pasar el tema de los botones y el puerto micro USB. Para el día a día están geniales fue una buena compra
4,Good value for the price.
3,Need to change ear buds as they fall out of my ears
1,El producto es bueno solo que me tocó mala suerte pues venía sellado
4,If you don't have them in properly they could fall out if you're running. The sound is alright. No real bass in them so some songs may sound less then awesome unfortunately. The touch controls are complicated to use. Tap 3x for this but tap 3x for something's else....
5,Es De buen calidad tiene una audio excelente se los recomiendo
2,After reading through countless reviews I was extremely excited to receive these headphones but - was disappointed very quickly. Firstly regardless of what size ear piece I use these will not stay in my ears for longer than a minute and a half tops. Want to smile while wearing these ear buds for that minute and a half? Forget about it! A smile or yawn will immediately knock these headphones out. The battery life of 3.5 hours is a joke - you’re lucky to get two. These headphones can barely cancel out my husbands nagging - let alone my kids fighting. Price was great but definitely a pass on these.
4,De lo mejor por unos 500 pesos mexicanos 😎
4,Buenos a secas tengo 5 meses con el pero la duración de la batería ya disminuyó
3,When I'm talking or running they fall out maybe I have small ears but I won't buy again.
5,I love their size and the way they fit! And the battery life is pretty decent tooSo far I've only used them on a laptop Maybe the laptop isn't an optimal test of quality but there really isn't very much bass coming out of them. It is acceptable but nothing "amazing" like some have described.Bottom line amazing great value for such a cheap price.
4,Really good value for these Skullcandy Dime True Wireless Earbuds.  At the time of this review the price is 29.99 and these wireless earbuds offer good value in this and a somewhat higher price range as well.Good sound and I find them comfy.
5,Bought this with high expectations for the sound quality but it’s not meet my expectation. Had issue with the first delivery; it kept on disconnecting & won’t charge the battery eventho it’s been charging for 2 days. Called customer service & received 2nd one in a couple of days works perfect. Sound has no bass so it sounds like cheap speaker. Yah. It is cheap. Works what it should be
1,Lamentablemente los míos salieron defectuosos me duraron solo dos días después de que se acabara la batería ya no volvieron a cargar es lamentable por que la verdad me agradaron mucho..
3,Tenia unos audifonos Redmi airdot y suenan mucho mejor que estos y son más economicos esperaba más por la marca pero se queda corto en bajos mala compra pero ya ni modos.
5,Había visto reseñas de que mencionaba que el micrófono no era bueno pero es muy funcional y nítido a la hora de hacer llamadas. un poco saturado en el bajo pero es común en audífonos de este precio. Estoy 100% conforme. los recomiendo al 100.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Los materiales no son los mejores pero están bien el sonido es 8 de 10 la caja es pequeñaLlego rápido estoy satisfecho con la compra
5,Great product will buy again
5,Me encantaron ya habia comprado unos el año pasado pero los regalé y me di la oportunidad de comprarlos de nuevo 100% recomendado 😍 cómodos y prácticos de usar.
1,No funciona bien a cada rato se desconecta quiero cambiarlo o que me reintegren mi dinero
5,It’s good
5,Quick pairing
5,Bought these for the office so I can listen to pod casts while I work. Very affordable and work really well for the price. I did not need a special USB adaptor or anything since it plugs right in to a regular USB charger.
5,Para ejercitarxe muy bueno
4,Honestly I bought these because I’m not paying for Apple air pods (over priced garbage). So with that said over all I’m quite happy with these so far. Will have to see how they hold up. Comfort and fitment is good sound quality is good and battery life we will have to wait and see.In terms of price these are great the controls on the pods themselves could be better but for $35 gym head phones I can’t complain.What brought me to purchase these over air pods or say Bose ear pods is the price. Realistically you have to think of these as a disposable item. You know the battery will do as batteries do and slowly degrade until they no longer hold a competent charge. And the batteries in these as well as other much more expensive versions are not meant to be replaced. So that said these are an item I purchased with a hopeful expectation of 2 years service. With that said they come in at an acceptable price point.
5,Buena durabilidad de batería cómodos y muy accesibles.
5,Son de lo mejor.
5,La relación precio calidad es muy buena los volvería a comprar
5,Great product will buy again
3,Al intentar configurarlo tengo un problema con el auricular derecho simplemente no da señal de vida ya he intentado de todo.La calidad del audio por lo que he escuchado del auricular izquierdo es muy buena se escucha muy claro y con gran potencia
5,Me encantaron ya habia comprado unos el año pasado pero los regalé y me di la oportunidad de comprarlos de nuevo 100% recomendado 😍 cómodos y prácticos de usar.
5,sus acabados no son premium pero el se escuchan increible

5,
5,Si quieres hacer ejercicio con ellos o realizar alguna actividad fisica ajustalos bien fuera de eso todo excelente 👌 la mejor compra que eh hecho.
4,El producto llegó antes de la fecha señalada son prácticos de buen material lo único es la fidelidad en el sonido que tienen.. Si le subes el volumen se distorsiona. de ahí en más todo bien.
4,Tienen buen sonidoDepende de del oído es la comodidad termine usando una medida de goma para izquierda y otra para derecha.Los botones que trae al no ser tactiles se complica usarlos pero como tengo Smart band  no es problema el control del reproductor.Lo que más me gustó fue la calidad de sonido.
5,buena calidad y sonido
1,Got this end of November and literally 1 week later the blue tooth connection cuts out alot with my phone right next to me. I can't even return it because I threw away the box and now stuck with them
3,E estado comprando concurrentemente este producto y los anteriores me han llegado muy bien la cuestión que esta última vez que pedí el producto me llego sin unos accesorios que son las gomitas no es muy relevante pero faltaron un par de gomitas
4,Buen tamaño y excelente sonido 👍
3,with full charge 2 and a half hours max! unfortunately not long enough :(
5,They are good so far
5,Everything is as mentioned or even more!If it stops connecting automatically just reset and it's fixed. I love skull candy
5,Très bon produit d'entré de gamme. je dirais même excellent
2,im just sitting and it slides out and eventually fall.
5,Muy bonitos y el Bluetooth tiene largo alcance. Me encantaron.
5,Excelente producto relación precio benéfico para hacer ejercicio están bien; para diario u oficina recomendaría unos más cómodos y por más precio más calidad en lo auditivo
5,Muy cómodos me gustaron muchoPd: foto de comparación de tamaño
4,These headphone pair up super fast and super easy so no issues there.The charge lasts a LONG time. I've only had to charge the case once so far.Sound quality is okay. I find them very quiet and I can hear environmental noise outside of the headphones so the noise cancellation could use some work and the quality could definitely be improved.The controls are useless since you have to smash the headphones into your ears to get the controls to work. I use my phone to control everything anyways but if you were wanting to be able to skip and volume adjust from the headphones you're out of luck.Ordering and shipping (for me at least) was an absolute nightmare. Pre-ordered in May for the July release of the Golden Orange version and they "ran out of stock" when they were released so the pre-order was completely pointless. I waited 2 months specifically for the Orange set and they somehow ran out of stock even though I pre-ordered them so I cancelled and opted for the Green/Grey pair. THAT order was cancelled for reasons that nobody apparently knew since I couldn't get an answer from anyone so I was without the headphones that I ordered for an additional month. I checked the Orange pair again a bit later on and they were back in stock so I ordered them again. These ones took 2 weeks to arrive despite my original pre-order the fact that I pay for Prime for next day shipping (let's face it Prime is NOT as shiny as it used to be) and the fact that they were ordered in may and not received until the end of July. So shipping and communication is a 0/5.If your order goes smoothly though the headphones are great inside headphones or great backups but I couldn't possibly give any aspect a full 5/5 because they're far from perfect
5,Excelentes en relación calidad - precioSon pequeños y prácticos su tamaño los hace ideales para llevarlos a todos lados su batería dura 3.5 hrs y el estuche les alarga 8.5 hrs más llevando a un total de 12 hrs de batería.El material es ideal por lo que pagasEn lo personal me resultan un poco incómodos pero por el precio no me resulta un punto en contra.Su sonido (lo utilizo con Deezer o Spotyfi) es muy superior a sus competidores sobre todo en el asunto de los graves 10/10!!!!Muy satisfecho con esta compra
4,El producto cumple pensé que al ser de una marca buena podría sobre pasar otras marcas de la competencia. Creo que está normalito el producto cumple sin embargo el audífono derecho ya no funciona igualz es decir perdió un poco de volumen.
3,Manque de basses fréquencesMais pour $30.00
2,Fitting issues
4,La verdad me decepciona mucho que no me permite mandar audios directamente de las aplicaciones solo si accedo desde el asistente accediendo desde los auriculares lo cual me molestó un poco.
3,The product seems good.  Easy to use and connect.Earbuds are supposed to be good for 3.5h but after 45 minutes they shut down.Recharges them and still not much more than 45 minutes on one side...Disapointing as they are having a good sound...
3,Se escuchan bien solo que no dura tanto la pila aún cargándolos al 100./.
4,La verdad me decepciona mucho que no me permite mandar audios directamente de las aplicaciones solo si accedo desde el asistente accediendo desde los auriculares lo cual me molestó un poco.
5,Audífonos con calidad y asequibles  bien sonido sin distorsión
5,These are buds connect quickly and have decent sound. Love the charging case but would like a little warning (flashing red light or something) to show the ear buds are running low on charge.
5,La batería dura lo que promete y en ningún momento he tenido problemas con su emparejamiento (puedes usar uno y después conectar el otro sin ningún problema )
5,
4,La batería les dura unas 2-3 horas de uso continuo
5,CVomoos y muy buenos relacion señal ruido.
3,El case no carga los audífonos y por lo tanto no encienden los audífonos no se conectan directamente a menos que los prenda manuelmente. Alguna solución o es problema de fabrica
5,Excelente producto relación precio benéfico para hacer ejercicio están bien; para diario u oficina recomendaría unos más cómodos y por más precio más calidad en lo auditivo
2,im just sitting and it slides out and eventually fall.
4,Tengo 4 meses con ellos y la verdad que no me han decepcionado. Funcionan perfectamente y puedes traerlos en tu bolsillo sin ningún tipo de problema por su tamaño tan pequeño. La batería dura 3.5 horas aprox. El sonido es bueno y con un nivel de volumen suficiente. No tiene cancelación de ruido pero al momento de ponerlos si existe una disminución del entorno. Los recomiendo ampliamente para todo tipo de actividad.
5,Muy bonitos y el Bluetooth tiene largo alcance. Me encantaron.

5,Quizá no son los mejores del mercado si consideramos la calidad del audio. Pero son ampliamente recomendables además el precio se ajusta muy bien.  Son de uso rudo y resistentes al agua.
2,Too big uncomfortable in the ear. Noise cancellation non existant talk time just about 1.5 hour per bud.
4,Suenan bien son cómodos se conectan fácil todo super bien pero bueno van 3 días de uso veamos al mes como llegan
4,La batería solo dura al rededor de 4 horas consecutivas
2,El touch no funcionaba y eran un poco incomodos al pasar el tiempo no se si haya sido defecto de fábrica o así sean todos. Se devolvieron.
5,Llegaron en el tiempo estimado en perfecto estado buena calidadde audio materiales resistente pero no premium la duración de batería es suficiente para uso ocasional.Si buscas mucho rendimiento en batería puede que estos nos sean los mejores.En general buen producto!
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I always loved SkullCandy ear plugs but these one are not great. The connection goes on and off while in a meeting. Sometimes they work fine and suddenly one earplug gets disconnected. So you ended up listening only from one ear. The battery life is not even close what they mentioned. Mine didn’t last more than 2 meetings of approximately 3 hours time. They are very hard to turn on and off to raise volume or simply to stay connected to my laptop. You can see from my picture one earplug is on and the other one is off. If you push the button for 4 seconds should go off but it doesn’t work all the times. People also told me that my voice doesn’t sound clear either. I would return it if I could and I do not recommend this product.
4,Work well
3,Me gustó la calidad de audio por el precio. Bueno para usar en casa u oficina pero para hacer ejercicio no se me caían cada 2 min o menos y un audífono dejo de escucharse apenas llegué a cargar dos veces el estuche.
4,Funcionan muy bien pero usarlos mucho tiempo resulta un poco incomodo. Buena relación entre la calidad y el precio y el diseño es excelente.

5,Son cómodos  suenan súper bien  buenos graves  la duración de la batería para una sesión de ejercicio de 2 horas que es lo que los he usado  duran sin problema . Y lo mejor es que se asustan muy bien y no se me han caído .
5,Los recomiendo muchísimo fueron un regalo para mi hermano la verdad por el precio lo vale el escucha muchísimo música y siempre trae manos libres hemos hecho la prueba de sonido al hablar por teléfono y wow supera las expectativas se escucha súper claro y no entra ruido de la calle. La música se escucha decente  los volvería a comprar definitivamente y llegaron antes :)
4,Funcionan muy bien pero usarlos mucho tiempo resulta un poco incomodo. Buena relación entre la calidad y el precio y el diseño es excelente.
4,Son bastante cómodos pero para mí gusto les falta un poco más de volumen aún así se sienten de buena calidad y les aguanta bien la batería.
4,Tienen buen audio son cómodos y prácticos pero la batería si dura muy poco
5,Es un excelente artículo para hacer deporte aunque al inicio es incómodo cuando uno no está acostumbrado a usar ese tipo de producto la batería te alcanza perfectamente para una rutina normal de no más de tres horas buena fidelidad en el audio y aislamiento de ruido externo.
4,Son buenos se escuchan bien aunque ocasionalmente pierden señal brevemente. En general me parece que fue una muy buena compra por un costo accesible
3,Me gustó la calidad de audio por el precio. Bueno para usar en casa u oficina pero para hacer ejercicio no se me caían cada 2 min o menos y un audífono dejo de escucharse apenas llegué a cargar dos veces el estuche.
5,Son audífonos de muy buena calidad el sonido que tienen y la cancelación de ruido son muy precisas la duración de la batería puede variar de acuerdo al uso que uno le de lo único negativo podría ser el botón que integra el audífono puede ser un poco rígido para poder pausar música o responder llamadas fuera de eso son muy buenos.
5,These are so affordable you'd have to be crazy to not be impressed. I keep them on my Keychain. They're comfortable and the battery lasts ages. The sound quality is awesome for the price point. You can't go wrong
4,Las baterías no son tan duraderas pero por el precio no es tan grave.
3,esta pasable...por el precio lo que no me gusta es que dura poco la bateria
3,Los Audifonos están bien en presentación pero tienen poco volumen... Si estas al lado de personas hablando o haciendo ruido vas a escuchar su conversación aunque tengas la música al máximo volumen.
2,Fitting issues

5,Un excelente producto no esperaba menos de skullcandy!! (Me he dado cuenta que con esta marca en mucho de sus productos leo comentarios muy malos pero con las cosas que he comprado de la marca siempre ma va bien)Antes de adquirirlos leí comentarios de gente que mencionaban problemas con el volumen diciendo que aún estando al máximo es muy bajo en mi caso siempre los tengo por debajo de la mitad y se escuchan muy bien!!La pila no dura mucho unas 3 horas poco más poco menos esto ya se menciona en la información del producto así que no lo tomo como algo negativo.La calidad de audio no es mala pero tampoco llega a ser muy buena es lo que se puede esperar por el precio a pagar.Yo siempre he preferido audífonos que no tenga esa "gomita" que solo se metan pero estos no están mal al principio no los aguantaba mucho pero una ves que te acostumbras ya ni los notas.Sin duda por el rango de precio en el que están son una buena opción!

4,La duración de la batería es de 3.5 h a volumen máximo aíslan perfecto el ruido sin poder escuchar el exterior lo que puede representar un riesgo si vas caminando por la calle. El sonido es de buena calidad y los bajos destacan bastante. Las llamadas se escuchan claras y el estuche es muy compacto en comparación con la mayoría.
5,I have not found anything that I dislike yet.  The sound quality is excellent but I would expect no less from Skullcandy. I only use them for 2 to 3 hours at a time and have had no issues with the charge lasting. I like the fact that I can leave my device downstairs and work all over the house without any interruption to the music I am listening to.
4,Excelente producto 👌 en relación calidad/precio.
5,Llegaron exelente y son tal como la descripciónPero tuve un accidente con el derecho ahora está aplastado saben si me lo pueden vender o necesito pedir unos nuevos? Si compraré los grises pero no quiero dejar uno huérfano

3,The sound quality it quite good but the battery life is poor. Not very useful for the amount and duration I plan on using them for.
5,I am using wireless headphones every day to listen to audiobooks. I have been using many inexpensive headphones and I can say this is the best headphone at a reasonable price.
1,Skull candy used to be the top headphone brand in the 2000s and now they sell cheap junk. Me and my buddy both bought a pair of these and the left ear bud cuts out of connection every 5 seconds so you’re listening to your music in a slideshow pretty much. Terrible. And then to get in contact with the company themselves you have to fill out an essay of information just to get a refund. TERRIBLE DO NOT BUY
5,I love Skull Candy. They seem to always do a great job of balancing quality and price. I hardly have to charge these. They sound great and reduce noise and the mic on them isn't terrible for the person on the other end of the call. Overall I was pleasantly surprised.
5,Son excelentes  muy buena relación calidad-precio

5,La calidad de los audífonos es bastante buena un diseño bastante discreto y una buena calidad de sonido.Considero al producto excelente en calidad-precio
1,Left earbud not working. Right earbud turns on and starts pairing in the case but wont connect when out of case. Tried the resetting instructions by holding the buttons but no lights flashing. Waste of money
3,essily drop off. Can’t use independently.
5,The best noise cancellation!! Sound is so good and bass is 9/10. If you have small ears don’t get them because they sit in ur ear and it’ll rub and hurt.
4,La batería solo dura al rededor de 4 horas consecutivas
4,Con tiempo la carga ya no dura como menciona la descripción un punto abajo en mi opinión.
4,Battery life could be better.
5,Simplemente buenos
5,se escuchan muy bien los bajos muy potentes son mejor de lo que esperaba lo malo es que la batería dura muy poco a un volumen alto.
5,Excelentes un sonido impecable y además de ser económicos vs las marcas de Samsung y Apple  la verdad los recomiendo muchísimo
5,Excelente producto
4,Suenan bien son cómodos se conectan fácil todo super bien pero bueno van 3 días de uso veamos al mes como llegan
5,cumplió mis expectativas completamente recomendamos 100%
3,Batería buena
5,Para el precio están increíbles buena calidad de audio y micrófono son un poco difíciles de ajustar al principio
5,Me gustó mucho la calidad del sonido la fidelidad la duración en general un buen producto
5,No son tan ergonómicos pero el tamaño es bueno y la calidad del sonido es excelente
5,Muy recomendables los audífonos Se escuchan bien todas las frecuencias. Se carga rápido y dura bastante la pila
4,Suenan bien son cómodos se conectan fácil todo super bien pero bueno van 3 días de uso veamos al mes como llegan

5,Excelente producto
5,He tenido la oportunidad de usarlo un par de veces el sonido está bien sin embargo; en mi caso me lástima el auricular de la oreja derecha pero creo que es solo a mi.
5,Por el pecio en el que están son muy buenos perfectamente podrían cobrar más por ellos pero así son más accesibles para todo consumidor.
5,Tienen muy buen sonido con relación al precio sirven muy bien para ejercitarse pero la comodidad si queda a deber llega un punto donde te cansa el tenerlos en el oído.
5,Tienen muy buen sonido con relación al precio sirven muy bien para ejercitarse pero la comodidad si queda a deber llega un punto donde te cansa el tenerlos en el oído.
5,Los compre por que en los comentarios decían que tenían un buen sonido los audífonos tienen volumen propio valen lo que dice
4,Sound is little low
5,El producto es muy bueno no se siente de materiales tan baratosLa autonomia es muy limitada pero eso se pierde por el tamaño que ofrece el producto
5,He tenido la oportunidad de usarlo un par de veces el sonido está bien sin embargo; en mi caso me lástima el auricular de la oreja derecha pero creo que es solo a mi.
1,Hurts my ears when I put them in and the audio sounds like it’s a 5$ pair of convenience store headphones. Battery life is non existent
5,I accidentally washed & dried these headphonesTWICE & they work!Well worth the $$ spent
1,No emparejan y uno se escucha pero es muy terrible el sonido a mí no me sirven y no fue lo que esperaba. Esta terrible.
5,This product overall is pretty good. Bought as a gift for someone in my home and the couple times I have used them the fit very comfortably and I don't usually like this style of ear bud.
5,Bought these for my nine year old daughter. I like skull candy and have pretty good success with their products in the past.  They were super easy to pair with devices and the sound quality is definitely worth the price you pay. If you are looking for headphones that are well priced and looking pretty sharp ( I bought her red) then these are worth a look.
4,I like the colours they fit well easy to use and I like the case. So easy to pair to devices. I have only charged them once but after an hour use it said it was at 50% battery. Not sure how true that is but hopefully the battery lasts longer. Overa
4,for the price these are very good
5,Good quality great fit and great sound!!  I would buy these again!!
1,La calidad de audio es mala y son incómodos
3,Son cómodos y se enlazan fácilmente. El inconveniente es que tienen poco volumen.
1,It stop working in a weekno goodwhen I put them into my friends case they chargingand the original case they not charging even when I put the case on charge and the contact points are clean
5,Súper cómodos a mi se me caen en veces pero y tengo mis orejas bien chicas pero en general es buen producto le dura bastante la batería se escuchan bien de buena calidad buen producto
4,Su tiempo de batería y la falta de volumen para disfrutar de más la música
4,No son los audífonos más cómodos pero la calidad de los materiales y el sonido son muy buenos los recomiendo
1,Muy incómodo el manejo de los comandos de los audífonos
2,Pierden sonido con el tiempo
4,Están muy bien los audífonos son pequeños lo cual los hace perfectos para transportarlos por el tamaño compacto tienen buena calidad de audio pero el detalle que les resta puntos es que la batería dura a penas 2:30 horas lo cual implica estarlo cargando con el estuche si es que vas a salir mientras que en la descripción dice que dura 12 horas pero eso es 12 horas en total cargándolo.
4,Cumplen con la descripción
5,El producto es muy bueno son mis primeros auriculares inalámbricos y ma verdad es que estoy maravillada con ellos son súper prácticos y cute muy fácil de transportar (aunque también de perder jajs. El sonido está muy bien los controles todavía no me puedo acostumbrar a ellos pero espero pueda jaja. La batería aunque no es mucha (3.5 hrs) la verdad es que para andar en transporte está súper bien sin embargo si tienes que estar en clases en línea y ocupas unos pues la batería sería un limitante.Muy buenos y recomendados 100/10 🤙🏻
2,Le pongo esta calificación ya que los audífonos no cumplen con lo que se leía en comentarios.Bajo volumen mala fidelidad nulos graves.Los tendré guardados y tendré que adquirir otros de mejor calidad.Antes había comprado unos xiaomi por el mismo precio y por probar me salió mal la decisión.
2,Todo funciona de maravilla a excepción del micrófono a la hora de realizar llamadas no pueden escucharme absolutamente NADA yo escucho perfecto lo que me dicen pero yo hablo y hablo y no me escuchan pero nada de nada la verdad estaba muy satisfecho con todo lo demás pero por este ENORME detalle voy a tener que pedir mi reembolso.
5,Pensé mucho en comprarlos por el detalle de la batería que dura 3.5 hrs aprox pero me decidí y en el tiempo que los llevo usando no le han decepcionado la batería dura mucho ya que no los tengo las 3.5 hrs en uso y cada que los metí al estuche se vuelven a cargar
4,Working good not pure 100% but ok.
5,Estaba buscando algo muy compacto y de bajo perfil.Estos son perfectos para eso obviamente la batería no es una brutalidad pero por 3 horas si es muy divertido mas que suficiente para un viaje
1,Los compré pensando que me durarían más que el modelo SESH pero no ni dos días me duraron cuando a pesar de seguir las instrucciones de primer uso dejaron de funcionar al tercer uso el dia de hoy ni siquiera prenden. En serio no los compren busquen otras opciones
5,
5,Son muy cómodos y el precio está muy bien tambien
5,Muy cómodo al usarse  buena duración de batería muy contento con el producto
5,Me fascina la marca siempre cumplen con un excelente sonido.
5,4.5/5 batteries could be better but you get what you pay for and we get a lot for a little. Highly recommended.
2,No sé vinculan entre ellos hay que hacerlo manual y cuando se guardan y vuelven a sacar hay que volverlos a emparejar.
3,Me gustó el diseño pero el sonido se queda muy corto
2,Solo sirvieron 3 meses un día los saqué del estuche y ya dejaron de conectarse…. Los conecte a la corriente pensando que ya no tenían batería y si carga el estuche pero ya los audífonos no cargan… ya no enciende el led que encendía cuando cargaban los audífonos
5,Son perfectos funcionales y duraderos.
5,I am a melomaniac therefore I use them a lot. Sound quality is great battery lasts long charging is fast even a 10 minutes charge helps. For music or calls work fine. I completely recommend them.
1,No hay un instructivo de cómo reconocer el dispositivo en tu equipo no se sabe si es con todo y el estuche o no.Una vez difícilmente reconocido por tu equipo y al conectarlo para una conferencia tú escuchas muy bien pero nadie puede escucharte.No duran las baterías mas de 2 hrs
3,Me gustó el diseño pero el sonido se queda muy corto
2,No sé vinculan entre ellos hay que hacerlo manual y cuando se guardan y vuelven a sacar hay que volverlos a emparejar.
5,Muy cómodo al usarse  buena duración de batería muy contento con el producto
2,No puedes hacer ejercicio se te caen a cada instante no aíslan nada de ruido el audio es demasiado bajo solo sirven si estas en trabajo sedentario.
5,Muy buen producto cómodos y a muy buen precioLlegaron muy rápido.Exelente servicio

1,Inconsistent product. The one I bought wont charger no matter what adapter I use. Plus they dig into your ear with sharp uncomfortable plastic.Sound quality is just ok.I'd you're looking for cheap budget ear buds you could definitely do better then theses.
5,Bought these for my nine year old daughter. I like skull candy and have pretty good success with their products in the past.  They were super easy to pair with devices and the sound quality is definitely worth the price you pay. If you are looking for headphones that are well priced and looking pretty sharp ( I bought her red) then these are worth a look.
4,Es algo incómodo después de mucho tiempo pero son prácticos y tiene buena batería
5,Veo que muchos dicen que no tiene un gran sonido ya que por defecto los audífonos vienen con el. Volumen individual bajo tienes que subirlo desde el mismo audífono para que estén al 100 y ya controlarlo con tu dispositivo.Me gustó mucho la calidad de los audífonos.
4,Son bastante buenos y fáciles de trasportar para uso cotidiano quedan muy bien 🔥
3,Battery life is great they fit well sound quality isn’t wonderful but they work ok for what you pay for them.
5,Me sorprendió los buenos que son por el precio quizá sea un poquito difícil recordar el tiempo qué hay que presionar los audífonos para ciertas funciones o cuantas veces se deba presionar y en cuál de los dos audífonos para llevarlas a cabo pero aún así eso me gusto mucho porque todo se puede hacer desde los mismos audífonos al principio creí que sonaban un poco bajo pero con que te los coloques de manera correcta siento que tienen un volumen adecuado y no suena bajo el volumen incluso llegan a aislar el ruido exterior un poco no soy un experto en describir el sonido pero suenan bastante bien los bajos me gustan como suenan por el precio el audio es más que decente con la cajita si dura mucho tiempo la batería y lo mejor es que mientras tenga carga la cajita puedes poner al cargar los audífonos automáticamente se desconectan de tu cel para ponerse a cargar y cuando los sacas automáticamente se conectan a tu celular.
2,La manufactura y el empaque de carga están perfectos y muy prácticos pero es un problema que el volumen sea el muy bajo si vas en la calle aunque las siliconas sellan El ruido de la calle es muy pobre el volumen Lee subido a todo y apenas logró escuchar una canción en cuanto al manos libres el micrófono Es bueno logra filtrar los sonidos de la calle pero seguimos con el problema de que casi no logras escuchar a quién te habla.
5,Realmente los audífonos cumplen en varios aspectos no soy una persona muy exigente por lo cual los quise probar. Pará empezar el sonido es bajo dependiendo del celular y la aplicación que usemos así que va a ver algo de inconveniente con Huawei o Xiaomi. La carga es lenta pero al tener el estuche mejora un poco. La carga es usb tradicional por lo cual es necesario que dejarlos cargar un tiempo más largo. En las ventajas realmente los bajos son muy buenos las voces y el poco delay entre audio y el celular es casi nulo.En sí yo los recomiendo pero si hay otras opciones pues a discreción de cada persona.
4,I was surprised when the battery charged as quick as it does just charging from dead for 15 minutes gives me about 1- 1&1/2 hours of playtime on the earbuds. Very small and comfortable. My only complaint is that the button controls only work when both of the dimes are on so if you're using one and have the other one in the case you will only be able to pause/play.
1,Llegaron  defectuoso
1,No emparejan y uno se escucha pero es muy terrible el sonido a mí no me sirven y no fue lo que esperaba. Esta terrible.
5,This product overall is pretty good. Bought as a gift for someone in my home and the couple times I have used them the fit very comfortably and I don't usually like this style of ear bud.
5,At first these hurt my ears with long hours of wear time. Biggest tip that worked like magic for me orient the buds arm straight up. This provides a better seal more comfortable wear and snug fit. Also makes button access much easier.With that tip these are amazing!Happy tunes!
4,I like the colours they fit well easy to use and I like the case. So easy to pair to devices. I have only charged them once but after an hour use it said it was at 50% battery. Not sure how true that is but hopefully the battery lasts longer. Overa
3,not bad headphones. sound quality not that great. you get what you pay for i guess.
4,for the price these are very good
5,Good quality great fit and great sound!!  I would buy these again!!
5,Conforme en todos los aspectos perfecta relación entre precio y calidad recomendados al 100% llegaron antes de lo estipulado y en perfecto estado.
1,Los adquirí y justo antes de terminar el mes de garantía el audífono izquierdo dejó de escucharse pensé en comprar otros diferentes pero decidí volver a probarlos. Han pasado menos de tres meses desde que los adquirí por segunda vez y de nuevo el audífono izquierdo dejó de escucharse si quieren arriesgarse es bajo su propio riesgo.
5,Excelente producto
5,Me gustaron mucho los audífonos! Son cómodos y el sonido es bueno.
5,Muy buen producto
2,My review is definitely pretty specific to me since I have pretty small ears. I had watched a couple reviews saying these were really small and would "probably" work well with small ears unfortunately they hurt my ears really bad - also the battery life is horrendous but of course they are so cheap that it is to be expected I just didn't think it would be THAT BAD.Wanted those as a second option for going on walks and such didn't meet my expectations.
1,It stop working in a weekno goodwhen I put them into my friends case they chargingand the original case they not charging even when I put the case on charge and the contact points are clean
5,Muy buen precio y muy buenos audifonos pero tardaron mas de lo normal pero todo bien llegaron exactamente la publicacion una cosa importante es que tienen menos volumen a lo que estoy acostumbrado pero los bajos compensan volvere a comprar despues
5,Tenía mis dudas pero me sorprendió;Son cómodos discretos y se escuchan bien.La batería dura al rededor de 2 horas el centro de carga por prueba carga de 2-3 cargas completas se cargan muy rápidoResisten a caídas (comprobadas jaja)Conclusión:Valen totalmente la pena
4,Working good not pure 100% but ok.
4,Se me caen y eso que trae varias gomitas para cambiarlas de acordé a tu oído también no sé cómo la batería se acaba rápido y si dejo el estuche cargado este se descarga solo
1,Los compré pensando que me durarían más que el modelo SESH pero no ni dos días me duraron cuando a pesar de seguir las instrucciones de primer uso dejaron de funcionar al tercer uso el dia de hoy ni siquiera prenden. En serio no los compren busquen otras opciones
5,Son un poco incomodos si se utilizan más de dos horas seguidas los botones integrados bien pudieron ser touch pero aún así cumplen con la función que indican. No son tan llamativos pero al final cumplen su funciona para escuchar música y contestar llamadas.
5,Puedo usarlos un día en periodos intermitentes y sin problemas me dura dos días la batería. Súper buena la conexión con mi celular ya que en cuanto los saco del estuche se enlazan con mi teléfono
5,Good quality great fit and great sound!!  I would buy these again!!
4,for the price these are very good
2,No puedes hacer ejercicio se te caen a cada instante no aíslan nada de ruido el audio es demasiado bajo solo sirven si estas en trabajo sedentario.
5,Está muy bien. Para hacer ejercicio o escuchar música por cortos lapsos de tiempo exelente
5,Muy buen producto cómodos y a muy buen precioLlegaron muy rápido.Exelente servicio
5,Son muy buenos y duraderos los ocupo para todo y en el entrenamiento son muy cómodos y no se caen. Además de que tienen buen sonido.
5,Se lo compré a mi hijo porque se los vi a un compañero de la oficina y le han funcionado de manera excelente se escucha y el audio es muy bueno
5,Practíco votar el balón en mí cuarto y pensé en ponerlos para la música me gustaron tanto porque se escucha bien(por el precio) tiene resistencia al agua y también se quedan muy bien acoplados en el oído. Me enamoré de ellos lástima que a la semana perdí el audífono izquierdo. Punto negativo es no tener TIPO C no contar con controles táctiles y el que tenga que cerrar doble vez en la caja(tampoco molesta tanto que digamos). La verdad es que los pienso volver a comprar en cuanto tenga dinero los amé
3,Doesn't doesn't last 1hr
5,LOS COMPRE PARA REGALO A MI ESPOSA Y LE ENCANTARON POR SU PEQUEÑES Y SU BUEN SONIDO. YO LOS USE ALGUNOS DIAS Y EN EFECTO SON COMODOS SE AJUSTAN BIEN A MIS OIDOS Y TIENEN BUEN RANGO DE VOLUMEN EN RELACION PRECIO BENEFICIO LOS VEO MUY ADECUADOS.
5,Buena calidad de audio. Un poco incómodos para mi oreja en particular. El tono de color anaranjado no es tan intenso como lo esperaba pero aun así son muy bonitos. No esperaba mucho de ellos y me han sorprendido al punto de atesorarlos mucho. Recomendables :).
1,Nunca sirvieron estos audífonos que chafa. No gasten su dinero ..
5,Muy buen producto cómodos y a muy buen precioLlegaron muy rápido.Exelente servicio

5,muy contento con la compra excelentes para el precio cumple por mucho mis expectativas
5,muy comodos y hermoso color azul con gris :)
1,Dont buy these things. I wanted 40 minutes trying to pair then with my device and they would not work.
5,Cumplió con mis expectativas y su propósito
5,Excelente 👌

5,Esta chiquito pero es muy práctico y cómodo además suena muy bien. La batería dura casi 2 días
5,Para escuchar música me gustó mucho
4,Después de 10 meses de uso comenzaron a fallar perdio nitidez el audio
4,Son buenos y traen buena cancelación de sonidolo malo es que su batería dura muy poco.
5,Me gusta que son pequeños ya que yo tengo también los JIB TRUE pero siento que están demasiado grandes para hacer ejercicio y por eso compre estos son más pequeños tengo orejas pequeñas y me quedan perfectos. La  batería le dura sin problemas las 3 y media horas seguidas más las 8 y media en el estuche. Estoy bastante satisfecha!
5,Great value.
1,Volume won’t go up on my blue tooth smart tv so not impressed
5,No han fallado son excelentes y la calidad de sonido es buena los recomiendo.
2,La calidad del audio me gustó me parece que tiene buena nitidez y un ajuste auditivo muy adecuado hasta parece que no los traes puestos.Sin embargo después de conectarlos a los 5 o 10 minutos resulta que el audífono del lado izquierdo se le va el audio y hay que estar volviendo a intentarlo y eso sí es frustrante.
5,La calidad del sonido es buena. Son comodos de hecho no se siente que los tengas puestos
3,Tienen buen costo pero en lo personal algo incómodo para hacer ejercicio. Uno siempre se sale o desacomoda. La batería es buena en cuanto a sonido es bueno para el precio de menos de $400
4,Muy prácticos para hacer ejercicio a un buen precio y con calidad en los materiales. La batería en realidad tiene poco rendimiento pero con ese tamaño algo se tenía que limitar.
3,buen sonido solo que despues de un mes empezo a escucharse ruido en el auricular derecho
1,El auricular derecho  se escucha mal el audio
4,Nothing  to dislike.
5,Me encantaron solo que tienes que buscar las gomitas para tus orejas sonido excelente buen volumen color muy padre y por el precio muy buena opción bajos buenosTengo casi 2 meces con ellos y el Bluetooth ya falla se corta los traigo en mi bolsa (crosbody) y se cortan feo el Bluetooth
4,Para menos de 500 pesos son un muy buen producto pequeños y faciles de guardar en el bolsillo aunque sus botones son algo inadecuados y sus funciones un poco confusas pero por el precio la verdad nada mal
5,Amazing
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Me considero una persona bastante buena con tecnología pero supongo que estos audífonos me demostraron lo contrario. Al momento de recibirlos hice absolutamente todo lo que indicaba la caja de empaque y manual. Puse la cajita a cargar con los audífonos adentro hasta que la luz LED de la caja se tornada de rojo a verde. Dejé los audífonos un buen rato en la caja cargándose hasta la noche cuando decidí que los quería probar.Al momento de abrir la caja note que el audífono derecho ya no tenía la luz roja prendida. De acuerdo al manual esto indica que el audífono ya cargó al 100. Sin embargo el izquierdo aún tenía la luz roja. Cuando los saqué el derecho empezó a parpadear azul y rojo pero el izquierdo no y por ende no se vinculaban.Hice mis intentos de investigar leer y ver tutoriales tanto desde la página de Skullcandy como en algunos vídeos de YouTube sin encontrar resolución. Los deje toda la noche cargando en la caja conectada al enchufe de la pared y nada. Al parecer no soy la única persona que tiene este problema pero igual no fui la única en no encontrar alguna resolución más que regresarlos.Espero que sí se animan a comprarlos no pasen por está situación y puedan disfrutar de la gran calidad de audio que tiene Skullcandy. Por mi parte le dejo 1 estrella porque a mi parecer no debe de ser tan difícil vincular tus audífonos especialmente en el 2022.
5,rapport qualité-prix excellent
4,Son muy cómodos prácticos y muy ligeros aunque el cable que viene es absurdamente corto
3,Tienen buen costo pero en lo personal algo incómodo para hacer ejercicio. Uno siempre se sale o desacomoda. La batería es buena en cuanto a sonido es bueno para el precio de menos de $400
5,La calidad del sonido es buena. Son comodos de hecho no se siente que los tengas puestos
4,Los audífonos se ve hermosos son muy compactos y no hacen nada de bulto. De hecho si quieres tenerlos en tu llavero es mejor. Porque si se llegan a olvidar. Los bajos son bueno el sonido es algo suave respecto a ecualización de fabrica. El problema: aún con las gomitas son algo difíciles de poner. Y aunque sientes que son cómodos si se sienten que los tienes puestos pero tampoco penetra tu oreja. El noise cancel que tiene (físico) no es tan bueno pues la oreja no la abarca completamente. Y como les digo no penetra mucho la oreja. Aunque son buenos para usar de vez en cuando como un extra si tienes más audífonos. La verdad no me dan un mal sabor de boca solo respecto a comodidad. A veces siento que se me van a salir. Pero de ahí en fuera no es mala compra.
3,La calidad de sonido es buena pero no suena muy fuerte
4,Tienen buen audio y la batería funciona muy bien pero después de un par de horas empiezan a doler un poco las orejas

4,Si los vas a usar para hacer ejercicio se te van a caer buen producto por el precio pero no es funcional si estarás en mucho movimiento o hablando.
1,This seller is selling defunct earphones. They work in the beginning and then two weeks later one headphone stops working. Purchase from somewhere other than amazon.
4,I think they are good value for the money.  Sounds great.  I ordered more for my grandkids

3,Traigo mi celular en el bolsillo de mis jeans tengo mis audífonos conectados al cel y estoy en llamada Andando en bici yo escucho bien pero mi interlocutor no me escucha me escucha distorsionado por momentos me pierde tengo que bajarme de la bici caminar y andar con el celular en la mano para que pueda funcionar en llamada por todo lo demás esta bien tiene buen sonido me aguanta una reunión online de 2 hrs sin problemas funcional para escuchar musica
5,Producto altamente recomendable.
4,Se escuchan bien la batería dura bastante y funcionan perfecto si estás sentado sin moverte pues se salen no puedo hacer actividades con ellos ni siquiera caminar y en videoconferencias el micrófono casi no se escucha y termino quitándomelos.
5,Estoy muy feliz con mi compra cómodos sirven para hacer ejercicio ocupan muy poco espacio pero la duración de la batería no es tan buena  recomendados
1,un auricular (izquierdo) no funciona
5,En lo personal a mi se me caen los audífonos al ejercitarme estos y todos los audifonos al andar caminando todo bien pero somos personas diferentes y puede que se pueda utilizar para ejercitarse puesto que son chicos el material del estuche no es tan bueno pero cumple con sus expectativas el material de los audífonos son muy buenos buen color el azul con verde son hermosos muy buena duración de batería lo que promete Son muy buenos los audífonos en lo personal los recomiendo!!!
5,rapport qualité-prix excellent
4,I have small ears so after a bit it starts to hurt. I wish I was slightly smaller. Other then that they have been great!
5,Muy buen sonido el único detalle es que si varían de color en color los accesorios
5,Muy buen sonido el único detalle es que si varían de color en color los accesorios
2,Battery life on this is around 3 hours so not nearly long enough. Sound is good but I still wouldn't recommend.
2,For they money they are okay
5,Me gusto se escucha muy bien
5,Funcionan muy bien
3,Buttons on earpiece are too small and cannot be pressed easily.
5,Best earbuds Have used airpods pro and its as good as those and kind of price we are paying makes them best in industry. I wish i can give more then 5 stars
3,They worked pretty good out of the box and I would have gone with 4/5 stars except the right side earbud now only lasts 5-10 minutes before "low battery" warning and power off. The left side is great and regularly exceeds its expected battery life.
5,Los audífonos son muy buenos el material se siente bien al tacto en cuanto a duración de la batería es buena eh utilizado un audífono hasta por 1:45 hrs la carga del estuche es bastante normal se escuchan bien tienen una cancelación de ruido muy buena (lo logras con las gomas de repuesto) el botón que traen para acceder a los comandos esta muy bien sientes cada vez que lo oprimes (eh tenido audífonos que no sabes cuantas veces lo has oprimido y realizan otra acción diferente a la que quieres) el estuche es compacto y nada estorboso los audífonos entran perfectamente en el estuche los imanes del estuche cierran a la perfección el color está muy bonito.
1,Right ear bud does not hold charge at all ive charged took the left one out works perfectly but the right one doesn’t even turn on but it lights up when it’s charging..
5,Desempeño congruente con la publicidad. Para ejercicio de alto impacto no los recomiendo se resbalan con la agitación y el sudor. Fáciles de limpiar buen sonido para el costo bajos apreciables. Después de usarlos por un largo tiempo comienzan a doler. En general valen la pena 👌🏻
4,Me parece que son suficientemente buenos considerando lo que se paga por ellos.En cuestión de sonido --calidad y volumen-- estoy muy satisfecha. Los controles para pausar retroceder o avanzar las canciones también son perfectamente eficientes. Quizá el que me ha costado un poco de trabajo operar es el volumen pero quizá soy yo que presiono un segundo de más.No son lo más ergonómicos digamos que tienen una forma estándar pero se ajustan suficientemente bien y ayuda mucho que traen 3 medidas de gomas para que empatar la cavidad auricular.Recomendables sobre todo si NO los quieres para actividad deportiva intensa.
4,Son buenos a medias tengo unos Xiaomi y se escuchan mucho mejor
5,Prometen tres horas de duración y cumple con ello. Los ocupo para ir a correr y no he tenido problemas a causa del sudor. Algunos comentarios hablan de que el sonido llega a ser muy bajo yo no he tenido ese problema además el inhibidor de ruido es excelente.
5,Tienen un sonido muy bonito y una cancelación de sonido moderada son extremadamente compactos son del tamaño de un llavero y eso los hace más portátiles sin embargo por esto mismo la batería no dura mucho.
1,Al tercer día de usarlos uno de los audífonos dejó de funcionar. No se mojó ni se golpeo ni le di mal uso. Solo dejó de cargar y ya no funcionó.
5,Llegaron antes de lo esperado bien empacados venían con gomas extras que se ajustan muy bien al oído no son tan grandes y se escuchan muy bien excelente compra calidad/precio y me gustaron mucho
5,Ya sea que los uses para sesiones de entrenamiento la rutina diaria de transporte o alguna que otra reunión por reunión en videollamada. Estos auriculares serán una buena opción son cómodos discretos y de buena calidad. Recuerda que son para uso corto a mediano (aprox. 3 horas)
5,Lo que decía la especificación de la batería no es cierto no dura mucho. Casi siempre uso skull candy y ahora si me quedo a deber mucho la marca.Saludos.
4,Muy buen producto cumplió con mis espectatuvas

5,I buy these 4 days passes perfect headphones everything good.On one casual afternoon i was walking on the sidewalk i dropped one of these on the road and a GMC Denali passes crushing it. I picked it up cleaned it and try listening from it. Works fine.Structurally also intact.Wonderful product.

4,Sound quality is better than I expected.  Nice and loud clear and crisp.I have it seems large ear canals with super soft cartilage and I cant get a secure hold with these regardless of the tip I use.  I tried twisting them in to get them to seat deeper but this is quite painfull to do for the rest of my ear since the buds are designed to fit a specific way in the ear.If the part where the silicone tip is was just a touch longer or they had a memory foam tips these wouls be great and I would love them.Probably going to buy another pair.  I was considering the Indy Evo range but because of this fit issue I'm tempted to try another brand.
5,excedió mis expectativas

3,So. Noise cancellation is great. I experience sensory overload service help me tune out everyday noises.These are almost too good at noise cancellation indoors(parents beware you will not hear your children at all unless the volume is low lol) but outdoors you can still hear some noises around you.Generally I only use one outdoors anyways so I can fill hear traffic unless I'm on the bus or at the gym.The sound keeps...changing?Like. Mid song. At times the bass was nice and the sound was warm and then this tinny quality pops in.Had zero issues pairing. The box is weird though as is this tiny charger chord. I'm still confused as to whether the box itself really does charge them independently. We shall see as I've had the box charging for 3 hours and the light is still red.My biggest gripe is the physical design. Who. In the hell. Designed this shape expecting it to fit in peoples ears.So weird. My ears are not THAT small. The smaller nubs work fine but its the roundness of the earned body that is extremely awkward and keeps forcing them out of my ears unless I literally shove them into my ear holes.To make it even worse these buttons are barely functional. Most true wireless earbuds I've dealt with have touch controls which arguably can be hit or miss depending on touch control sensitivity(black web is fairly good for this) but this button is literally useless. You will still rely on taking out your phone to control the music or answer calls. And like...this defeats half the point of having this product.You have to push it in til it clicks which means you are pressing it further into your ear you have to press in so hard it is honestly seems so silly.I have them in now and I'm noticing again the sound quality changing a bit some crackling.Buy the $25 black web true wireless earbuds from Wal-Mart if you want a decent pair of cheapies though beware those ones cause ear fatigue because of the hard body even that being said I'd still buy those again over these.P.s. one pair of the nubs had dried EAR WAX ON THEM. Luckily I had my own from other buds. Foul. This is not the fault of the company I blame AMAZON WHAREHOUSE DEALS. Never again. Will update with a picture.

5,Muy prácticos en tamaño y funciones la duración de batería me parece buena personalmente al principio me lastimaban en general muy bueno
3,Los mismo
4,Pros: Son discretos  y puedes cargar el estuche a todos lados porque es bastante pequeño y muy liviano. Por el precio se escuchan decente.Contras: tienen poca reducción de ruido ambiental incluso con las gomas más pequeñas me lastimaron el oído la batería le dura unas 3.5 horas de uso continuo el botón de encendido no es muy practico y casi no se escuchan los bajos.
4,Por el precio de estos audifonos creo que superan mis expectativas. El sonido obvio no es el de mejor calidad pero creo que es muy bueno. Los materias los buenos y resistentes faciles de enlazar con un telefono (Tengo un Xiaomi) el volumen de los audifonos es aceptable. Las instrucciones para el uso de los audifonos creo que no son tan claras pero con la practica aprendez a usarlos. Definitivamente no son audifonos para hacer ejercicio ya que con el movimiento se saldrian facilmente pero para casa y/o oficina son muy buenos y comodos no lastiman el oido como otros que son mas rigidos ademas de que cuentas con gomas de varios tamaños para que se adapten mejor a tu oido. La carga de la caja es de aproximadamente 2 horas que creo que es un buen tiempo.
5,Muy barato y buena calidad de audio lo único que no me gustó es que al colocarlos es incòmodo y el vacío llega a molestar esto comparando con los airpods pro.
