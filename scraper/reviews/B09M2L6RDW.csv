4,This was initially a gift but the person it was intended for did not want it so I kept it.  Then tablet came with a keyboard and a mouse.  Review time:  1. The mouse is wireless and comes with a USB 2 receiver/dongle.  The tablet does not have a USB 2 port.  The setup did come with a USB3/USB C adaptor but not compatible with the mouse receiver.  2. The keyboard is wireless and does not pair with the tablet.  3. The WiFi will only stay connected for about 10 minutes.  The tablet is about 20 feet from our WiFi router and we shut off nearly all other WiFi devices to no avail.  4. I cannot return the device because it does not meet the return criteria for a "PC".  At this time I am still working with it but If I cannot fix the WiFi problem then the tablet will be useless.  Last but not least the package did come with an instruction book for the tablet but nothing about the mouse or the keyboard.  If I can get it working I will update my review but for now it gets a 1 star.  8/26/22:  I was able to get the mouse and keyboard to work.  There is an issue with the WiFi connection.  odd as it sounds but Spotify will disconnect after 1 hour.  I can stream fine on YouTube as well as TuneIn.  I moved it from a 1 star to a 4 star.  No support available and not enough instructions about the mouse or keyboard.
4,Have enjoyed the tablet and connecting with everything so well. Have enough memory to really do somethings and don't have to pick and choose to keep or don't keep on my phone anymore. Very nice set. Keyboard intergrates nicely with tablet. Disappointed that the case wasn't designed to allow keyboard and other components to be carried and utilized all together instead of individually. Could have included a nicer constructed mouse and pointer pen or stylus with the package as well. And another charging cord with a daul charging block so both the keyboard and the tablet could be charged simultaneously if necessary. Something to think for the future I guess. To bad you built a quality tablet and keyboard but decided to go cheap with everything else. Even the charging block and cord are on the cheap side. For a variety of activities.
4,I received my tablet and set it up with no problems.  It connected to my home wifi with no problem.  However when I tried to connect to the internet while traveling a few days later the tablet had problems with the the hotel wifi.  The tablet connected to the hotel's network but I got the "internet not available" message.  I knew it wasn't a net work problem because my phone and my husband's tablet connected to the internet with no problem.  I contacted Amazon and tried a few things with them with no success.  Finally they supplied me with a link to contact the manufacturer.  When I had the same problem a second day in a different hotel chain/different state I sent a message to the manufacturer.  Instead of waiting a couple of days to hear back I used my phone and searched the web.  One problem I noticed was that I could not set the date/time properly on my new tablet.  I tried resetting the time zone several times but the time was several hours off and would not correct.  I finally performed a factory reset on the tablet and it worked!  The time registered properly and the tablet connected to the internet perfectly.  Now that everything is working well I am very happy with my tablet.  One other thing I just noticed that could be a potential problem for some is that this tablet is 2.4Ghz only.UPDATE:  The tablet performed fine for two nights in hotels where the wifi did not require a password.  However the hotel I am on tonight does require a wifi password and J am having the same problem with the tablet conndcting to the network but then showing no internet.  The step where I sm prompted to enter a password never comes up.  At this point I am very disatisfied.  I can't spend hours each night doing a factory reset and downloading everything iver and over.ANOTHER UPDATE:  The seller is very responsive and seems to work well with customers to solve any problems.  Unfortunately I am still having WiFi problems.  I connect to my broadband thru WiFi and usually have a strong signal.  However I find that the tablet drops the signal whenever it tries to download anything.  If I just let the tablet try to reacquire the signal I get the "connected but with no internet problem".  So I have to get out of what I'm doing and go into Settings to reset the internet.  I also have a hard time trying to watch any kind of video on this tablet.  I always get the old buffering circle for several minutes.  Don't know if these problems are caused by the tablet being just 2.4 ghz or not.  Other than the WiFi problem ( which unfortunately accounts for most of the things I need a tablet for) I think this a nice tablet.  Just wish they could solve the WiFi problems.
4,Not compatible
4,2 thumbs up!!!
4,Good product for the money. Will recommend
4,The keyboard is easy to use and the battery lasts a lot longer than the tablets does. The mouse however is for a usb port that the tablet doesnt have.
5,The tablet is android 11 cellular capable and has capability for a micro SD card for extra storage.It synced incredibly easy with my android phone and laptop.The manual has very little directions for getting everything up and running. The graphics on Amazon were the most helpful.  Would recommend this android tablet.
5,So far so good still setting up the phablet. I haven't had any problems so far. Will leave another review soon. Love it already. Updating and downloading apps and games are a breeze I use my phone's sim card to update it. You have to have strong internet to use for tablet. Will not connect to hotspot wifi only the Bluetooth Internet.Great Product I haven't set it up fully got as a Birthday Gift. So far so good. Wish battery life was longer. You have to have strong internet to use it. And of course a sim card and compatible sd card.
5,I really like this tablet. I purchased this tablet for my 85+ yr old mother to watch shows on via the Peacock app after we were hit by tornadoes that destroyed our area and caused damage to our house.I set it up on a dresser near her bed open Peacock select the show and she is good to go.I check her email and I make calls to her people via TextNow.When I need to do research for her the screen size allows her to see the necessary info.Great tablet!!!
5,This tablet is fantastic. It's fast. It has a lot of storage. And surprisingly it's not as heavy as I thought it would be. I would highly recommend it to anyone.
5,Me lleg√≥ lo que yo ped√≠ muy satisfecho con el producto
5,I use it for reading and it does what a tablet can do perfectly.
4,While I purchased this primarily to surf the web while traveling as it is lighter than a full-blown laptop it is not a Windows machine and is slightly different. The differences are subtle but do exist. Overall I found it convenient and easy to use.
4,Battery runs out quick when streaming
4,Handy travel machine. Clear screen for anything.
5,I love it üíñüòç
4,Everything works well for what I use it for.  The only thing I would like to see a longer than 4 hour battery life. I have to put it on the charger to finish what I am doing.
5,Love it and the visual effects üëå
5,Finally a tablet that works straight out of the Box 1st time!
5,Would recommend this tablet highly due to economical pricing and quality of the tablet bundle
5,Very happy with product  price is excellent for everything you get
5,Easy to use.  Great touch.
4,The good thing about this setup is it made my son feel like he got a brand new computer.  In reality it's pretty cheap.  Battery life is short and the screen can't be seen while the sun is shining on it.  I wish I would have gotten better but I give it 4 stars because my son still loves it.
5,I got this tablet after my old iPad couldn't be updated any further. This tablet has a wonderful picture and is very fast. Sound is what you would expect from tablet speakers but once it was paired to a sound bar it is incredible. Worth the money.
5,Very carefully clipped my T-Mobile (Mint Mobile) nano SIM card into one of the two white plastic adapters that came in a small zip-lock bag oriented them as per the diagram in the little manual wangled the adapter into the SIM 1 slot installed an SD card in it's slot clipped the plastic cover back on turned on the phablet got some goofy messages seeming to indicate it was not reading the SIM card. I finished the setup and Bob's your uncle in the upper right corner of the display in tiny little letters it said 4G-T-Mobile. Ta da.  I have not noticed it being slow and I am no longer at the mercy of the cellphone outfits charging me out the yin-yang for using my phone as a hotspot! I can surf the net make calls and if I really wanted to I could put a second SIM card in the other slot.  I bought  a 16GB USB 2.0 SanDisk flash drive at WalMart plugged it in to the adapter and with the help of 'Cx File Explorer' I can read and write data from this phablet to the SD card and the flash drive. I can also get my USB mouse to work as well with the adapter and the Bluetooth keyboard works great too. 'New Pipe' allows me to download YouTube videos it is free and open source. This K118 phablet (identified as a Zonko in the Settings) also came with a nice cover/case. I'm a happy camper with this setup and for the price it cannot be beat. The screen works just fine for watching videos and the speakers are allright by me. This is really a remarkable piece of gear.
5,I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this tablet considering the bargain price that I paid for it.  It's well packaged durably constructed and operates comparably to the more well-known brands.  I have just begun using it but so far I am very pleased with my purchase.
5,Great product for the money.  Haven't added a sim card yet but I am very pleased with this product.
5,I actually returned a different one that was 4 GB ram and 64 gig memory 10.5 inch that was almost the same price and figured I'd give this one a try. Total with tax it was $161.61 and so far worth every penny. Apps went on no problem. I dunno if it is because it is android 11 and the other was ten or if it is because this holds sim cards so its basically a big phone. For what I paid I am extremely happy. If anything goes wrong I will update this. I don't often leave reviews there is one thing the paper instructions say only a 128 gig micro sd expandab online says 256.. rekon ill check check the questions and ask if no one else has yet. I'll edit after I find that out as well.
5,To replace the tablet that is not functioning
5,Great substitute for the higher priced brand names! Does everything I need it to & more. Very happy with this purchase!
3,I tried this and other reviews said that it worked with Mint Mobile (uses t-mobile network) and I had zero luck. Sent it back. I wish it would have worked. Otherwise seemed decent for the price.
2,I bought this specifically because I needed a tablet that I could add an internet plan to. Turns out this tablet runs off of a 3G/4G signal and AT&T has already phased out the 3G towers and said if other carriers haven‚Äôt already they will be soon which renders this tablet useless for an added on internet SIM card.This is mainly my fault that I didn‚Äôt check earlier but at this point I‚Äôve had it too long to send back and that makes it the second useless tablet I‚Äôll be stuck with at home.I‚Äôm only leaving this review so that anyone else needing a tablet for the same use I did you likely won‚Äôt be able to.As far as the tablet itself could be good. I‚Äôve only turned it on long enough to try adding the SIM card earlier.It came with a lot of extras which was nice.Again my review is only based on the fact I bought it for a specific purpose and I don‚Äôt want anyone else to have the same experience.Go find a tablet with 4G or higher capabilities!
3,Unable to get key board to connect
5,I really like it. Disappointed that it didn‚Äôt come with SIM card. I may have to buy one.The customer service is trying to help me. Thank you!
3,Slow issus with storage
4,I love it. The wireless pad mouse makes it very versatile and very user friendly especially for us seniors.  Not a popular brand but an excellent piece of equipment.
3,If you are looking for a tablet fr writing taking notes this is not your tablet if you are looking for a tablet for reading scholar material or not watching videos and so on this is your tablet
3,Most features work well. A few issues though:* The screen is okay -- it doesn't feel like it flows as well as some name-brand tablets (e.g. the Galaxy line) but it's perfectly usable. Touch accuracy isn't great though; not for drawing.* The tablet itself is slower than its specs give the expectation for but it's plenty performant overall.* The battery is not what it says on the package. It's decent but not near the super long runtime advertised.* BIG ISSUE: the GPS is very inaccurate and laggy and *the tablet is missing a magnetometer*. This means that navigation and accurate positioning is very poor to impossible. NOT FOR USES INVOLVING GPS.I am keeping it since it's a decent value (especially since it comes with a slipcover keyboard and mouse) but for my intended purpose I needed to buy a Samsung Galaxy S7 Lite instead. Pity.
4,This seems to be a great tablet. The set up was easy and straight forward. I am using wifi only and can't comment on the phone capabilities. My one complaint is that the wireless mouse does not connect with the tablet. It comes with a usb reciever adapter but the tablet has no usb ports. Sort of a bummer as my daughter really wanted a mouse for some functions. Overall a great buy.
5,I haven't had the tablet for long but from what I'm seeing with it it seems like a really good tablet.
3,There is a Step 2 but no Step 13 or any other. There are 3 extra pieces that are not in the instructions and there is no clue what they do. There are no instructions for the keyboard or mouse. The mouse lit up when I put batteries in it but now it won't turn on. The ad makes it seem like there is an SD card included but there isn't. It tells you to remove the cover to insert a SIM card but doesn't say how to open horizontally or vertically. It took a sharp knife and a lot of effort to get the cover open. One more problem and I'm sending it back.
5,Very easy to set up and use.Nice size and weightLove this tablet especially being unlocked for sim cardsso I don't have to pay a fortune for service
5,First tablet for a student with an Android phone.Features operate as expected.
5,Worth the amount. Great for school/ Hulu and work
2,When I first got these two tablets they where 100% charged. Both worked well and the setup was easy. However it's super duper hard to charge these tablets. I'm not sure what components it's using for it's type-c connection to charge but lets be clear these tablets do not charge! I don't know if it's a faulty batter but I got two tablets and both experience the same thing I'm buying a super charging type-c plug and cable from amazon here. If that cable and charger do not work with this tablets I'm returning them.Watch out!!! The 5 star reviews on here seem to not mention the battery issues!
5,This tablet is worth every penny. It is quick and easy to use. It has great performance for the cost! The accessories come ready to use except for 2 AAA batteries for the mouse. I had an issue with the headphone jack but I was issued a replacement on the spot and had my inquiries answered in a most timely way! You won't be displeased with this device! The screen quality is exceptional and it has great sound. My Bluetooth headset syncs in a jiffy! Do yourself a favor and purchase this device!!! ü§ì
5,Uso diario
5,The tablet is great and comes with a lot of usable accessories.. customer service team are great and work to address situations. Would definitely recommend.. use can even get a sim card and use it as phone..and has memory storage
3,Battery life sucks!  Yes I drained the initial charge and fully recharged it when I first got it.Poorly made case.  On the side where the buttons are (volume on/off) the case causes the buttons to be recessed.As for value a tablet keyboard mouse and case the price is good.
4,It was a great buy everything about it is good the only thing about it that bothers me is that the battery does not last as long as my previous tablets but otherwise I love it.
3,When using Google sheets I cannot use the drop- down in the sheets name. All of the functions in the drop-down are absolutely necessary in order to use Google sheets. I am sure that this is a software problem that can be fixed. Please keep me apprised.
2,I got this as a glorified Remote Desktop client and that's about all it's really capable of.  I can only get about 30 megabits over WiFi it has trouble connecting to my router.  I put a 5G SIM card into this and it only connects to edge networks.  It's always dead unless I make sure to shut down the OS.  It won't update past Android 11.  If you're looking for something cheap this is the tablet for you!  If you want something useful and reliable find another tablet.
5,I really like this tablet however it came with a wireless mouse but no way to connect it.Update....I finally figured out how the mouse connects. YayI have been very satisfied with this tablet it took me awhile to figure out how to use the wireless mouse but I eventually got there. I like that it came with everything I needed.
5,Excellent Investment!! Didn't expect it to be such a good purchase. Quick and hassle free delivery and service! Would highly recommend to anyone who appreciates value
2,Looked nice and felt cleanly built... Well packaged.. Arrived in record time...Went thru all the setting up and all looked good THEN I went to my intended carrier for the phone service.. SHOCK.. not compatible... tried another carrier... not Verizon not T-Mobile not Cricket not Spectrum...  How can this be....  the IMEI number for each SIM card slot was rejected by each one whether CDMA or GSM type systems...So disappointed....  Returning it..  super price too bad.. even the Amazon HELP service was quick to deal with setup questions..  Just packing it up and thinking how could this be..
5,Bought this for the wife she likes it and would definitely buy again
5,This tablet is awesome. Any problem I had the product team reached out and it was clear that their main aim or principle is to satisfy us as customers. Communication was easy and well appreciated. There was no delay in shipping it reached me in just two days. Awesome combination for the price. Bluetooth keyboard mouse adapters etc.There is also attached for those of you who are not aware: a free 2-year warranty or refund replacement promo. You cannot lose to this deal. Support this seller I would buy again.
5,This was a great valued purchase with all the amenities that are included you can not buy a compact laptop for this value. I bought it as a backup and I‚Äôm using it more than my laptop up to date programming and slick and compact for traveling. Well with the money spent.
4,No instructions provided. Probably would have been difficult to set up for someone not having a tablet previously.
4,works well.  KB and case are bonus.
5,Excellent value and performance. I couldn‚Äôt ask for more.
2,Not a usable quality camera.  Performed MUCH lower than expexted..That was what I bought it for so it was a total waste.
5,I contacted the company customer service for the problems with cards. They walked me through how to solve my problem. Excellent and patience was what solved my problem. I am now enjoying the performance of the unit. Well done customer service.
2,The tab works good for only streamingThe camera is very badBattery is not bad but not the bestKeyboard works I have not try the mouseCase is goodBut I don't know what tempered glass will work on it
4,Easy to figure out being a sr
5,Great product but unfortunately couldn't run my extremely intense graphics game.  Will buy from them in the future.
5,I love this one better than the first one I got from Amazon . it is faster and I can see what I'm doing on screen.
5,Received exactly as promised.  Works great.  So happy I bought it.  This is not a paid or incentivized review.
5,This tablet package is the best deal out there for the buck. I am especially impressed with the accessories. The keyboard seems to be more durable than expected. The mouse is a sleek design that fits comfortably in the hand and both work well. I would definitely recommend to others.
3,Verizon Sim card not compatible. No instructions given for keyboard or mouse setup or use
4,Really liked the graphics!
2,Bought this item because of its WiFi  and Cellular capability but after I received it found that it was not compatible with any of the US networks. Other features appear to be fine but not useful for what I needed.
5,Nice tablet and accessories for the money
3,Whenever I tried to open the app store it would load for hours literally but other than that it is a great device for its price
5,Excellente  mejor de lo que esperaba muy buena compra.
5,This product arrived fast and was priced great.
5,I bought this for a friend.  He loves it!  It is compact fast and does everything he wants.  A great buy!
5,I love this more then my laptop! It's great cheap and works perfect!
5,I disliked that I couldn't add this to my Verizon account for data purposes.
1,Battery life ergonomics wireless keyboard wifi all works perfect out of the box. Very nice tablet.Now try to insert a sim card... Catastrophe:1. The holders for nano sim card are flimsy and do not hold it2. Once inserted you need tweezers to remove it3. Sim card cover is tough to open4. Tried Verizon and TMobile in Phoenix AZ: nothing works sim card are detected but won't connectToo bad really
1,It‚Äôs way to slow and if you‚Äôre lucky you can watch a video in 480 in cellular mode. Don‚Äôt waste your money if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for. On T-mobile sim. No way on 1080 like manufacturers told someone. And the system isn‚Äôt easy to use. Maybe I‚Äôm spoiled from Galaxyand Apple?  Maybe expected to much for 100 dollars? Should have just gotten a Samsung or Apple. This isn‚Äôt even close
5,Nice tablet. Works with a cellular sim card that is using the T-Mobile phone towers. Can make calls and also receive calls. Thank you
5,Easy to use. No problems connecting to wifi. Or with my bring your own sim.updated android software a plus as well üòä
5,Excellent tablet. Super fast and screen very sharp. Very Very happy with purchase. Great product and above excellent service.
2,It‚Äôs not in English having trouble making it work I can‚Äôt translate it
1,This was a problem right out of the box. The stand they show doesn't really work. The keyboard isn't as easy to use as most add on keyboards. The cover is very cheap. I started up the tablet as directed downloaded some simple programs like Google Google Docs. It deleted much of what I started. Would not save a document or a spreadsheet. I used a program I've used on many other tablets it deleted it. This looks good but it doesn't work as it says. Don't spend your money. Thank heaven for Amazon's easy returns. But keep all your shipping boxes it didn't qualify for easy drop off and they pack it like many other items that need to be returned. Good luck if you take a chance on this.
5,
5,I really enjoy my new tablet. It's sleek and easy to use.
5,Very fast and runs great.
2,Can't get it to read the sim card very unsatisfactory and especially since I bought it for its cellular ability
1,I have brand new tablet and locked out. Followed instructions in sm manuel trying to reset will not do anything. Sent message to amazon they passed it on to SZHaishang. If anyone reading this could help me I would like to know how to unlock . Even followed directions on utube. Afraid to send back bc of being charged for not resetting to Factory reset.
5,Great gift its Amazing I love it perfect
5,I like everything so easy to use and pair with other devices
5,It's quality
1,The wifi programming is terrible. It wouldn't connect to wifi if it had a portal you had to go through in order to connect.  And now it wont even charge.  Unfortunately for me I was traveling and missed the window to return it. Waste of money.  Buy something with some credibility
5,
5,
5,great
2,La bater√≠a no dura nada..lo cargo al 100% y a los 5 min de usarlo ya consumi√≥ un 15% de la bater√≠a
1,I purchased this item in April and stopped working after a couple months with minimal use.  The Screen froze tried dealing with the seller and they responded by telling me to restart reboot reset factory settings all of which did not work even after I told them that all was tried and still failed to get this thing going.
1,Would not power on.  Charged it several times.  Charging light did not work.  Would power on for only a few seconds.  Very disappointed.
1,Si lo vas a ocupar con un sim card no la compres no sirve con ninguna compa√±√≠a cellular en USA y no existe una ayuda al cliente
1,Despite being advertised as 4g compatible neither Verizon nor ATT were able to connect them to their networks after repeated attempts.Very time consuming and disappointing!
1,First product I bought from Amazon that spoil within 4 months. It's a waste.
1,Terrible!! It started having major battery issues after 3 days. It would die while charging or take forever to charge.
1,Just after the thirty day return policy it fell apart I bought insurance and quests what all they did was give the run around I will never do this again.I might as well thru 180 dollars in the trash very disappointed
1,Used for a back up but freezes a lot could not find a SIM card for it which I knew was gonna be problem not a very good brand
1,Slow response on a powerful wi-fi and poor scarred resolution.. highly exaggerated price  doesn‚Äôt worth the price
1,At first it was nice but then it works occasionally. Not happy with the money spent. Dissatisfied and disappointed.
1,NOT CAPATABLE with 4G as labled. Could not hook up to cell service. I want my money back !
1,It's very glitchy and ghost clicks randomly and gets stuck ghost clicking ! Sadly it looks nice but doesn't work and not worth the money üòï
1,Do not buy
5,Recieved item it was exactly as advertised. Love it!!!
5,i love this tablaet (: tanks abbut the greetis vary big scerrn and vary good workall abut acssories and the all satf and saftower in tablat is vary greet (:
5,SO far it's working and happy with the purchase.
2,The specs say this tablet has a 2.4GhZ octacore processor but it's not true. The processor is 1.6GhZ.
1,Lousy Device. Seller evasive and untruthful. Does NOT work as cell phone. Seller said only way to determine compatibility is to check each carrier.  AT&T-NO! Verizon-NO! Consumer Cellular- NO! Finally took device to T-Mobile who said they could insert SIM card but it would provide data only.  No phone. No text.  Wasted so much of my time. Seller deliberately misleads buyers.
5,Overall it's works great
3,I dont have to put no video with it. you cant make a person give a photo.
5,The Tablet works well. After about 5 months half the touch screen stopped working. I contacted the seller they were very helpful and ended up sending me a new one.
5,It was exactly what it shows on the picture. Very happy with the purchase.
5,There was nothing I didn't like about this tablet. Great product for a great price.
5,It works great better then expected. The graphics on it are absolutely amazing. I would totally recommend my family and friends to getting one as well.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†I have already received the tablet.  I bought it for my daughter.  My daughter started using it and said she likes it.  The tablet works well.
5,Loved it!
5,Recomiendo este producto
5,Para estudiar online es fant√°stica r√°pida
4,Apparently not compatible with AT&T services.
5,I had a very old tablet that wouldn't update anymore and so this one fit the need.
5,Great quality product. With all the accesories. Mouse needs 2 AAA batteries. Not included. N the charger box you share with the device and the keyboard. But its not bad for the $. Love it.
