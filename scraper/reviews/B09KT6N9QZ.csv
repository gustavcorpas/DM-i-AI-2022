5,I've been buying this brand for years never failed me.
5,You would never know that you're not using an original brother toner cartridge. The print quality is great! I'm very happy with this product.  I'm a Mobile Notary that prints a lot of loan doc pkgs. This toner is my go to.
5,So far the print quality is excellent. I have used Linkyo in the past and it has worked well for me. The current toner is being used with a Linkyo imageing drum. The oem imaging drum went bad at 16k prints. I'm not sure why so I've changed out the non Linkyo cartridge I had for a Linkyo toner cartridge. I didn't want to risk the new imageing drum going bad in the event that the toner cartridge I was using had anything to do with it going bad. I will update this review if the yeild is not as expected. The cartridge is rated at 8k pages. The value is not as good as it used to ie prices have gone up since last I purchased toner. I blame covid and supply chain disruptions. I expect this will correct as things normalize.
5,I have been purchasing these toners for years. I run a SIgning Agent Company and print thousands of documents a month. The print is just as good as the Brother cartridges but so much more cost-effective! I have had some issues with the cartridges from time to time but this company always makes it right which I appreciate. I have tried other brands just to compare but these are the best!!! Don't hesitate to purchase them!
5,I’ve had problems with many other brands when I order because I know it’s a hit or miss..but so far this is my 2nd time ordering with LINKYO and it works great for me! Will continue to order. I am using the original Brother Drum Unit along with this toner. Thanks!
1,I purchased two of these laser replacement cartridges for my Brother MFC-5850DW Lasre AIO printer they simply don't print. I followed instructions to the "T" as per the packaging and still nothing prints. Buyer beware you get what you pay for. You pay for peanuts you get monkeys.
5,Best substitute for Brother toner!!
1,So annoyed. This does not fit in my machine (MFC-L5900DW) which requires a TN850 cartridge. The return window has closed. The item description is inaccurate.
1,After using the first one for around 2 weeks the ink/powder just spread out on the paper. Then I changed to the second one in the set after similar time window similar situation happened! Really disappointed!
1,Does not provide good quality printing
1,I have had this toner for over a year sitting on my shelf waiting to run out of my current cartridge to run out. Well today it did but when I put this cartridge in the printer states there is NO toner present.
1,I just had to replace one cartridge that came far short of one-half a ream.  Which comes as a surprise because I've always had good results with the brand.  Both cartridges having been purchased in October have the return window closed.  For the second one I will be checking the exact count from the status printout.
