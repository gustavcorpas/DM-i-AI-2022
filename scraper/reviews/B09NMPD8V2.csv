5,Para juegos da mejor rendimiento que los procesadores Ryzen 5000 actuales y sale más económica armar un PC intel con generación 12 que un PC con ryzen generación 5000. Y te lo resumo así un placa madre decente  lga 1700 como la B660m cuesta uno $109. Y si quieres comprar una placa AM4 para ryzen 5000 que sea PCIex 4.0 debes gastar mínimo más de $120.
5,My go to processor for a standard office computer build. Inexpensive reliable and has great performance for the price. I have built dozens of computers using the i5-12400 processor Crucial P3 NVME SSD Crucial Ballistix DDR4 and all my clients are thrilled with the performance.
5,This cpu is a price to performance king for intel comparable with LGA1700 socket types and supports both DDR4 and DDR5. I meant to get this as a budget cpu for my girlfriends first build but it’s cheaper and on par for performance with my i710700k. Very satisfied
5,Good
5,I purchased this for use in a general use PC for a non-power user.  This CPU may have been overkill for a basic PC but I suspect it will be workable for at least a decade or more.  This CPU under a Noctua CPU cooler has been stable and reliable.
5,This bargain chip outperforms older gen chips that draw more power and cost a ton more. I was looking for a bargain chip for a living room itx build. Had to be inexpensive and low tdp. Only complaint is the stock intel cooler is loud! If I had a different case that wasn’t so open it might have worked. It cooled this chip just fine but was too loud for my taste so I went with a cheap 240aio. Running it at low rpms it’s virtually silent. Temps don’t go above 55c.
5,Es una excelente Cpu sin embargo si es recomendable buscar una solución termina diferente a la que se incluye; ya que durante cargas pesadas de trabajo aunque el ventilador mantienes unas temperaturas óptimas este hace mucho ruido y puede llegar a ser algo molesto.
5,More than enough for gaming and university work.
5,Un procesador excelente costo-beneficio muy bueno para tareas exigente y excelente para juegos
5,I used this in a PC build. The fan was perfect the CPU runs at 35 C. Benchmarks were very fast. Not used for gaming so didn't add graphics card. Perfect for my needs.
5,Upgraded a 2600K pc with this CPU B660 board and 32GB of 3600mhz ram.  It feels incredibly snappy now.  With GPUs now costing your firstborn child it's nice that this upgrade boosted an aging gtx970 FPS by 5-15%.  (@2560x1080)  Gaming is also much smoother as low-FPS spikes are effectively non-existent now.The included heatsink and fan is actually not as terrible as I was anticipating.  It doesn't get all that loud and it looks halfway decent.  It seems to keep the temps down to the mid 80s under stress testing (70 ambient) and mid 60s during actual gaming.  I will replace it eventually but I'm not that concerned as it works fine.  I did wipe off the pre-pasted thermal grease and added some MX-4 instead.The internal HD 730 is nice to have as a backup.  Anyone who doesn't need that should seek out the "12400F" model as it's the exact same chip with no internal GPU and it should be $15-$25 cheaper.As of this posting it's hard to beat the value of this CPU (12400F/12400) for gaming.
5,Perfectly working
5,Compré este procesador en aproximadamente $590.000 COP y ha sido muy bueno en general el rendimiento es acorde por lo que pagas; me fui por la versión con GPU integrada ya que la diferencia de precio era muy poca a comparación del I5 12400F. El disipador de stock es suficiente en la mayoria de casos esteticamente más atractivo en comparación a generaciones anteriores sin embargo recomendaría cambiarlo por otro disipador (se encuentran buenas opciones desde 25USD a 30USD) para evitar altos picos de temperatura.
5,Great 6 core chip for just about everything. Very good gaming performance. Will not bottleneck your GPU. Even if you have a 3080\3070 Ti or a 6800\ 6800XT this CPU will deliver great performance. I have bought 2 so far and I even paired them with a budget ASRock B660 motherboard and still performed at highest speeds with  135W PL2. This CPU will definitely last a good 5 years since it has great IPC performance and is compatible with DDR5 RAM. All this for approx $180-220 is a bargain. If you don't need to overclock or don't want to spend a great deal of money this is the CPU for you. Will provide much better performance per dollar on a long term basis than the 12100-12300 4 cores CPUs.
5,Sin embargo.. siento que como el de menor gama en su familia se queda y algunas veces pega tirones  sobre todo cuando estas iniciando el juego.
5,I upgraded my sons old computer from a 4670k to this. Everything runs better and the computer is no longer a hair dryer. Exceed expectations
5,Llegó el producto rápido a Perú 🇵🇪🇵🇪En menos de una semana sin ningún inconvenientePerfecto 👌
5,Good temperatures i was surprised by stock thermal paste good performance and quiet
5,Amazing processor fast and reliable. It is my first time building a pc and the result was amazing. The processor is more than enough for what I usually do with my computer. Don't expect much from the internal graphics although
5,Es muy estable y además solvente para todo tipo de juego en conjunta con una gpu dedicada.
