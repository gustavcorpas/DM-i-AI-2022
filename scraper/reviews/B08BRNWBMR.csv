4,It’s not the most stable on my road bike but it definitely made my 25 mile ride easier to keep up with messages music and mileage.
4,I must have a short stem. I can’t remember. But the stem mount is too long for my bike. I can attach it with some difficulty and once it’s on it works well enough but I don’t think I’m going to be able to use it for any kind of ride without worrying. I tried mounting it to my bars but I must have small width bars or something. It attaches there a little bit bit better but it completely blocks the ability to use the upright position on my bars. I suppose if I had a bike with bigger geometry it would be a better fit but it doesn’t fit a 49cm Bianchi frame with a short stem.I can think of another application for the mount though (yard work attached to a post) so I’ll probably keep it. It just doesn’t fit my bike.
4,Holds my phone tight no fear of it coming off. The only slight negative is over bumpy roads it will twist on the stem and you’ll have to rotate your phone back upright. Otherwise it’s great way better than an arm strap on a ride
5,I had an early generation of a bike phone mount from the same company and had purchased an iPhone 13 pro so needed something for a larger phone.  This product delivers as advertised from ability to used face ID to quality.  It is perfect for use and is 100% secure even trail riding.
5,Got it for my road bike. Love it. Easy to use sturdy holds the phone well.
5,I’ve been using this for a few months. I can switch it easily between different bikes. At first I thought it wasn’t going to hold the phone well while riding but so far no mishaps. I’d recommend purchasing
5,I use this on shared bikes in NYC (Citi Bike) and it works great! It takes seconds to attach to the handlebar without struggling or need of any strength. When cycling it doesn’t slide wobble rattle or move around. Only minor complaint I have is that I wish the hook that holds everything together was a tad bit longer for ease of mind. So far its been fine but a little longer wouldn’t hurt. Would definitely curb my anxiety about some cheap silicone keeping such an expensive device safe. All in all I highly recommend this product.
4,bit wobbly but otherwise good
5,Very satisfied. Works as designed and holds the phone tightly.
5,My husband and I were looking for a  bike cell phone holder that holds a phone firmly in place but allows for removing your phone quickly for access.  This does the trick.  Have ridden on roads and some quite bumpy mountain bike terrain and have not had any issues.  I do like this latest design because it has extra cushioning.
