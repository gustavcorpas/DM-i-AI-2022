5,This projector is very literally a plug and play projector. It is so extremely easy to operate with the smart features and the phone mirroring. I was very impressed that I didn’t even have to plug in a TV stick and all of the streaming features were functional.The picture adjustment was very simple to operate. I was able to adjust the size and customize the brightness according to the movie that we were watching. we used a portable projector screen with us and had such a great image quality even without the room being pitch dark.This projector has a built-in speaker. I was pretty impressed with the quality of the speaker and for the size room that we were using this in did not feel the need to go through the trouble of hooking up additional speakers.I love the small footprint of this projector. If it’s on a much smaller base than my older projector and is extremely easy to handle and very Portable.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 this HD projector runs off your Bluetooth and had no issues linking up with mine on my android device.  It can be used on IOS devices as well. We have tried this on both so far with no problems. This projector is 4K enabled and compatible with a TV stick or PC as well. It's overall appearance is minimal in design and will not eat up alot of space. The images display very nicely and the colors are sharp and vivid.  The fun part is customizing the display with the "image mode" and "color temp" to create the display exactly how you want it. This would of course depend on the movies or sports you watch or even gaming for that matter. The speaker itself provides some quality sound and can even be used on its own as just a speaker for music. The size of your display can even be adjustable without diminishing any of the picture quality. This home theater projector is also very easy to travel with as it has a handle and will play just about anywhere as long as your Bluetooth is connected.

This projector is small enough to be easily stored away when not in use and the best thing is that a large screen isn't needed. It can certainly be paired with one yes but my kid has it working and displaying really nicely on a blank wall. She can view full movies and shows just like you would on a big screen TV and the image quality is really nice. The keystone dial is a very nice feature at getting the proper focus according to your preferences.  The sound quality is actually really good in the space she uses it in. I was rather impressed and seriously considering getting one for man cave downstairs. The initial set up went along rather smooth and the instructions provided were very helpful. Works best with a fire stick or HDMI. Overall a solid offering from the maker of this projector and a positive experience during its usage.
4,My only issue is the brightness you literally need to black out room to see decently
5,Works great in bedroom! Highly Recommend!! The sound is VERY good. Have not tried outdoors. For iPhone I suggest going ahead and buying a lightening cable to HDMI converter. Or you can just use a fire stick like we use. Very easy set up!

This was the fraction of the cost compared to a television and works great for them. I can even hook it up to roku so they can watch shows movies Netflix and YouTube.  The screen image goes from 32”-170” projection size and I can project right on their wall. It is 1080 full HD resolution and 10000:1 contrast with 10000 Lumens brightness .I'm even finding the dual built in speakers loud enough! My kids can hook this up to their gaming system or it is equipped with multiple ports: HD USB TF VGA and AV. It’s compatible well with TV Boxes/Sticks laptops PC TV USB DVD players etc.very nice and good value !Comes with:1 * mini projector1 * HDMI cable1 * 3 in 1 AV line1 * power cord1* tripod1*drawstring backpack1 * remote control ( battery not included)1 * user manual.
5,This mini projector 1080p full HD makes it perfect for us. It is so portable and easy to use set up and has all the stuff a larger projector would have. We do not need it that often and it makes sense for the quality and use we need it for to have this size.Packs a punch with the 10000 lux. led projector for home movies supporting 1080p full hd & stereo sound.  With bright and clear projection images the dual built-in stereo speakers feature an srs sound system it provides a great auditory sense experience in your movies.This portable video projector is equipped with multiple ports including HD USB tf VGA and av interfaces so basically everything you may need and is compatible with tv boxes smartphones laptops pc etc. streaming videos like Netflix Hulu YouTube and HBO must be mirroring displayed by connecting with an HDMI adapter but works great
5,* A Mini portable projector with HD quality projection.* A quick and easy setup.* Wotk from around 4ft to 15ft distance. Adjust focus with the knob to get clear projection.* With a tripod stand it's easy to put on the floor and project on any wall.* Need a streaming device like Firestick/Chromecast/Android TVs /Smartphones etc to play anything.* It has an HDMI port to connect a streaming device. (A HDMI cable comes in the box.* Sound is OK for small rooms or for kids to watch.
5,Very nice picture quality very easy to connect to my computer so now while we are camping we can watch movies it is the perfect size very easy to use if your looking for a very nice quality projector you will not be disappointed I have been very pleased with it
5,This did not take long to set up. It has a great video quality to it and I just use the HDMI on my TV. The remote is definitely helpful and you can use this without having to buy a green screen as long as you have a wall that’s big enough. I used my back blank white wall to test this bad boy out. It was a great buy because it left me and my family with a great gift to use when we all want to have a party or date night! For the price you get what you pay for and it comes with a cute carry bag
5,This is a nice projector - I love the finish and design.  It’s got a cool pattern with it as well.It has multiple different ports which are great to plug in hdmi usb etc.  i like that a lot.It’s easy to adjust the focus as well and control overall is very standard (I’ve got a few projectors lately).This is an ice unit overall.  Will be fun for outside movie nights !
1,HDMI cable had loose connections on both ends and was never able to display any picture. I consider myself moderately tech-savvy and I couldn’t get beyond a blue screen. It is not a complicated device. You should be able to plug the HDMI into the projector and the other end into the lightning HDMI adapter then into the phone. Then select “HDMI” on the projector. Poof you should see something but it was a big nothingburger!It’s cheap Chinese garbage. Save your time and money. I sent it back to Bezos.
5,Initially I was unsure of what to expect from a projector with a price point below three digits... But it seems that I was pleasantly surprised by what I received.It's an adorable little white cube that measures 6x8x3 inches and weighs approximately 35.7oz.The input side will handle both 120 and 240vac at both 50 and 60hz line frequencies... This could be useful for those traveling abroad with it.Also it draws approximately 75 watts when running. It's quite power efficient.On to the fun stuff:It includes a little carrying bag a basic manual A tiny tripod remote A/V (composite) HDMI and power cable.It also includes a little lens cover but I'm not sure precisely why they included it since the cover is the same diameter as the lens... therefore it doesn't fit. This is not an issue though as you'll likely never use the lens cover anyway.It has both HDMI and VGA inputs as well as a traditional composite input.It also features a line output for connecting to other audio sources.One of the interesting things about this projector is that appears to have its own [proprietary] operating system. It has a UI which is likely going to be used for accessing data on a microSD card.It has a manual coarse focus control as well as a manual keystone control. The keystone control can be tricky to get perfectly leveled but it can be done with a bit of fiddling.Also it might be worth noting that this as most other projectors do become quite hot internally. Be sure not to block or cover the exhaust for the lamp's cooling system. Temperatures can reach as high as 140 degrees (Fahrenheit). Possibly slightly more if you're in a warmer climate.Temperatures were taken from an 80 degree ambient room temperature for reference.About image quality... To be fair I'm using one of my high end projectors as a control comparison.For the price point the image quality is quite crisp. There is no fine focal adjustment so you have to rely on coarse focus to tweak the image into focus properly. There again this really isn't an issue. It just takes some time to familiarize yourself with the projector to tweak it in more quickly.There is something slightly odd about the pixels being projected though. It could be some minor upscaling despite it claiming to output 1920x1080 natively. Once again though for the price point... It's a nonissue.Color reproduction is impressive though the internal lamp doesn't quite have the power to project perfectly in a bright room. There again for the price point this is to be expected. It's not going to be theater quality which is perfectly fine.Also I forgot to mention... The projector has a little threaded foot on the bottom for tilting it up. This can be handy in some situations.It also has a control panel on top with all of the buttons necessary to navigate without the need to use the remote though the remote is a nice added convenience.The buttons on both the projector and the remote are crisp and decently tactile.In summary I don't believe you'll find many projectors at this price point that perform this well.Small nitpicks like the manual keystone control aside this little projector does seem to do impressively well for what it is.I would definitely recommend this if you need something small yet capable... Especially at a price point that won't fry your wallet. I can guarantee that you won't be disappointed.
4,The picture looks decent with some fiddling and with a proper screen.The interface is fairly easy to navigate but may trip some up.It doesn't seem to get too hot which is a big plus.The sound is just plain awful.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This is a very cool mini projector. It works very well and I didn't have any issues getting it all hooked up and running. I tested it via HDMI and USB through an adapter on my MacBook. I experienced no delay or connectivity issues at all. It's a fairly lightweight and low noise projector with great image quality. I do wish it had a bluetooth connection setting but it's helpful that it comes with the cables needed to use it. All but an adapter if you plan to use a device without the necessary ports to stream from. Sound quality is decent not excellent. I do appreciate the stand that comes with it! It's sturdy and elevates the projector from a surface. The soft case is super handy to transport it around. Overall a good projector.
4,I really like this projector for my backyard.  It was VERY easy to set up (I coupled it with a ROKU stick) and even comes with a lens cover which is highly appreciated.The downsides so far:  After about 6 minutes it shut off unexpectedly.  I made sure everything was plugged in and turned it back on and it seemed fine but I'll keep an eye out for it shutting off again.Second: The audio is not great...at all.  It is very low and when you try to turn it up it won't go any higher.  It shows on screen that it's ticking up but the actual volume stays the same.One pro that I found with this projector above others is the quality of the picture.  I was using HDMI for my ROKU and the picture didn't seem grainy or blurry.  In fact it was pretty nice.I will recommend this projector and will adjust my rating if it continues to either shut down or doesn't.
4,I have used this a couple of times. It is very easy to set up and use because the instructions laid out very clearly. Everything that you need is included in this. The picture quality can be better but for now it is really good quality. It is small and compact and it is easy to transport to any place that you might need to use this. The brightness is very good and you can see it in very dark areas. I would highly recommend this product. Anytime you have friends over you can set this up outside and do a very good movie night.
4,So please don’t laugh at my set up this is the only way that I could get it to properly be aligned I’m getting a stand for it soon. I wanted to change my aesthetic and not get a overprice TV and this product did that for me. I did have trouble connecting my phone and Wi-Fi with the projector but when I finally got it all together it did work. There’s features to mirror your iPhone or android connect with Bluetooth to play music change wallpapers and watch your shows etc. The only problem and why I gave it four stars is because whenever I go to watch a show the connection with my Wi-Fi is just not there it buffers forever. I’ll see if I can get it to work properly this time and see why my videos are not loading to watch my movies and change the rating in the future but as of right now it definitely has four stars for me.
4,Overall it's a good projector at an affordable price. 8k lumin is pretty good for the price range and the ability to tilt the lense is a nice feature. The sound is average and the lack of wireless support for Bluetooth or wifi is a bummer. It's easy to use though and fairly compact. For under 100 dollars it definitely hits the important marks being bright and 1080p.
4,If you need something for an occasional use then it could work. The quality of picture is good it works right away. Initially minimal setup. But the sound is pretty disappointing. We have tried to get it connected to our speakers but it did not work with the common cord.
4,As long as you connect this projector to a media stick (Firestick or Roku) or use the included HDMI cable to link it to your PC or laptop everything should be fine.The sound is clear but not very loud. This could be problematic if there are a lot of people in the room. Would need to attach to a secondary speaker.The focus works and the keystone correction works and you can definitely watch a movie on this and enjoy it with you and a partner... But once again especially because it only has one HDMI port the speaker thing might be a pain in the butt.This is why it's important for every projector to have two HDMI slots or already have 5.0 Bluetooth. Should be Wifi compatible as a device everytime you buy it as well.My favorite feature is about this projector is that it comes with a bag to carry your stuff in and it comes with a little portable tripod which screws into the bottom of the projector and adds some definite utility and some aesthetic value.You can definitely use this projector without much difficulty however the sound as I said will not be very loud.The instructions could be a little bit more clear as they tend to be with more expensive models. I didn't even need instructions but that's just because I know a lot about projectors.I would call this item "great" but I would hesitate to use a descriptor like "excellent."It is a "good" buy because the price is set pretty low but it isn't something a projector expert would recommend to anyone other than beginners.I would recommend this company adds a second HDMI slot or upgrade to Bluetooth 5.0 with some powerful WiFi capabilities.A projector doesn't have to come with pre-installed apps but that can be helpful as well.Like I said this is still a decent choice for a bachelor or bachelorette.
5,Easy to set up and stand it came with works great.Picture shown is at about 15ft from the wall. Have to still turn off some lights but not bad at all.Could not figure out keystone but for what we need it to do it is perfect.
5,Hello We were looking for a simple non-complicated projector to use on our backyard nights out or possibly camping and didn't want anything with a ton of wires or just simply over-complicated. This fits the bill quite well.The size is not that bad it's about 9.5x6x3.25 in inches. The built-in handle is nice. The fact that it has wifi is also nice The claimed 17000 lumen seems to project well even if the area is not pitch black. Obviously the darker normally the better.  The image was not stunning but it was not bad to be honest. It has stereo speakers built in as well.Overall for a quick family grab we were pleased with our order. I don't think it's a bad value.
5,Product is great
5,Great Smart Projector. The speaker quality was much better than I expected and most apps used were smooth. I met some problems with adjusting the project angle but I went through the manual and I fixed it myself It's easy to use you just got to take some time to read the manual if you're new to projectors. good image quality 100% recommended.
5,If you are looking for a projector with amazing picture quality this one isn't for you. I use it to watch movies with my boys and for that it's great.  I still haven't figured out how to hook my phone up to it yet but so far it has been a nice little addition to the household.
5,I have never owned a projector system so this is coming from inexperienced eyes in the world of projection equipment.See included images for reference.I have had the projector for about 2 weeks. I have used the Android Mirroring and connected a Roku Ultra via HDMI. I have not had a chance to use the Bluetooth connection feature haven't found a need to.Purchased a projector screen for about $20 here on Amazon.The product box is simple with very basic information printed on the outside no technical info. The projector is well protected with sturdy foam and corner crush protectors. The kit includes the projector owners manual the remote (minus batteries)  power cable HDMI cable and the lens protector.The projector stands 10-1/4 in tall the lens centers about 6-3/4 in from the base. Depth is 6-5/8 width is about 5-7/8 in. The unit is surprisingly light and easy to carry this also makes it easy to knock over if placed on something elevated with a small footprint. I have this projector strapped to a narrow podium in case someone bumps against it.The remote is 5-1/4 in long 1-7/8 in wide and only 5/8 in at the thickest section. It takes 2 AAA batteries which are Not included.I would show images of different movies and shows but I'm not informed on what's allowed from the different holding entities. So I used the main projector menus as an example.The projected image I posted is in a dark room well after sundown. The projection diagonal measurement is about 95" with the projector front 115" from the screen.The main menu lets you choose how to connect depending on the media you want to play. You have a choice of Mirroring options from computer tablet or phone. There is a Signal Source tab to choose USB or HDMI.Then there are the other tabs including Wallpaper-lets you choose a different background image Help- just shows an email in case of problems a WiFi image- takes you to the WiFi settings and then the Settings tab- which lets you adjust the projection network bluetooth and additional settings and themes.When I turn this projector on it takes about 18 seconds to fully boot and is ready to go. I have this one set to boot up directly to HDMI to I can watch whatever on the Roku. Make sure you set your media device to produce no higher than the recommended 1080p at 60Hz or you'll be left staring at a blank white screen. I had problems with a few shows until I made this adjustment.The image it produces reminds me of the earlier projection screen TVs before flat-screen came around. The image quality is good but not with the intensity and clarity of a current LED TV at the same settings. For the price I really didn't expect super sharp imagery with intense colors as you would find in projectors costing a few thousand more. The screen or wall texture and material makes a bag difference I could probably squeeze a bit more image quality out by spending a hundred or 2 more but this is a budget setup. There are a ton or screen products and paints to help give you the best possible image quality. Just depends on your setup and how much you are willing to spend.For a 95" projection with good imagery why complain. Remember most TVs and video devices now produce imagery at 120Hz or higher so at 60Hz there will be more slight choppiness and blurring as things move in the projection. Your eyes and mind will adjust once you watch anything for a few minutes.The projector lets you choose what position the projection will come from in conjunction to the screen.The settings will flip and invert the image as needed. They can be as follows: projection from the front on a stand or angled up from the ground hanging upside down from the ceiling; or behind the screen on stand or ground hanging upside down from the ceiling. The needed program adjustments are fast and easy to set.Whatever you do Do Not Block The Air Vents on the front or back of the projector. The unit does produce a decent amount of heat there is a section of the menu that shows current temperature in case problems arise. The one I use sits about 4 inches from the wall with an ambient room temp of about 75°F. I live in the desert so using this outside in 108°F night weather probably wouldn't be an option.You can make some minor adjustments to the projectors use of color levels and intensities but can not adjust sharpness on any axis.The lenses surround has deep plastic grips to help adjust the clarity of the projected image.The settings can help adjust the angle of the image to appear perfectly squared in case you can not place the projector perfectly in front/behind of the screen or wall.The sound from the projector is good enough to hear whats being played the sound intensity jumps significately from lets say 4 to 5 on the volume measure. The high tones are easy replicated by the projector and you can adjust for a more 3D sound effect if you want. The low tones are not reproduced well from the built-in speakers again I wasnt expecting much. I hooked up a set of computer speakers through the 3.5mm port on the projector which have made the sound produced about 8 times better. The bluetooth feature would help expand your choice of sound system or headset you want to use.I've had the projector. Running nearly a full day with no issues. Only glitch was when I changed a setting and started the movie I was watching back up the sound played from the projector instead of the speakers. I just unplugged and plugged the headphone jack connector and it was fine the rest of the time. If I stumble upon any other issues in the future I will post an update. So far its been nice watching my programs at nearly twice the scale Im used to watching them in. Kind of my own mini theater room.
3,I got this projector for a very small room that I have. The picture quality and sound is clear. I really don't have any complaints.
5,It can also be viewed during the day. I tried 1080p and it was clear. Recommended!The machine has low noise can be adjusted manually and has a beautiful appearance. I like it very much. It can be used in living room and bedroom.Looking forward to upgrading to a rechargeable built-in power supply for easy use outside it will be more perfect.
5,Other reviewers have mentioned the built-in speakers as problematic. I don't yet have speakers to try but there is a plug for stereo headphones. Same jack (1/8-inch?) as the AV input port whatever that is right next to the earphone output. I don't know what kind of speakers that might support. Volume control is only through the remote.  Some tinkering with the menu was required to get audio. Not quite plug and play but less than an hour out of the box I was watching a move and mirroring my laptop. Apparently there is no audio when playing through Udisk or a TF card. Again knowledge beyond my ken. I was hoping that my laptop speakers would work at the same time as the projector's but no such luck.I connected with my laptop using the provided HD line but 6 feet was only adequate for a proof of function setup. I didn't have a longer USB cable to try. There was no need to import a driver. It seems that they are just there waiting to spring into service. That was a relief. Remote will require two AAA batteries.Definitely better than hunching over my laptop trying to get the best viewing angle when watching a movie. Way better if anyone else wants to watch at the same time.
5,My wife needed a portable affordable projector for work so I bought her this model. She now gives many presentations at work after getting promoted. It is compatible with a wide range of devices thanks to the following post HD USB TF VGA and AV slots. Although it does not support wifi you can mirror your phone on it or connect a computer via a cord to it. The speakers for being built-in perform well and the picture quality is good. Turning the knob at the top will easily control the Keystone and Zoom functions.As you can see from the pictures it is quite portable because it is relatively compact. Although it comes with a remote and a drawstring backpack no security is offered with the bag but it does make it easier to transport. It also comes with a tripod.
5,Volume could be a little more louder but other than that it's great
5,Works great and I am using it to watch movies on my living room wall
5,The package came with its HDMI cable its power cord tripod and the remote. There is pretty much ports to connect anything on this projector. Set up and installation took me about 25min. Easily adjust the focus with the knob on top. The video quality and sound is pretty good for the price. You need to connect a streaming device to watch netflix hulu etc...
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             This small bright and user-friendly device projects a clear 1080p movie on my walls. The 8000 Lux Ysametp Mini Portable Projector In light to dark environments The Brightness offers an excellent video viewing experience. The projector's most recent chip technology may provide you with an image that is both bright and clear. The projector also supports 1080P has a contrast ratio of 10000:1 and emits 8000 lumens of light all of which increase how much fun it is for the whole family to enjoy movies together.For this I bought an Amazon 1080p stick that just plugs in. When you switch to HDMI mode the Amazon will immediately pick up and begin to function. The projection sizes which range from 32" to 170" and the heights which range from 3.2' to 15.8' are the nicest part.The construction is straightforward and beautiful. The music will easily fill the space but don't anticipate BASS. We adore this projector since it gives everyone in the room a better viewing experience overall.
3,The image quality of this projector is quite good! However it does not actually have built in audio or if it does the speakers do not work. We fiddled with it for a while trying to get the audio to work and it never did. We also could not figure out how it’s supposed to connect to a cell phone.luckily we had our fire stick handy and using that with the projector was really easy and straightforward.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I’m using this projector in place of my tv. It’s also perfect for traveling. I like that it comes with a bag to carry/keep it safe in. I had to play around with the settings to get the sound to an audible level. The picture quality is great! I feel like I’m at my own personal drive in. The picture can be large or small depending on needs. Either way it focuses really well.
5,The projector is much smaller than my expectation because I was expecting a projector with over 8000 lumens should be as least in a shoe box size. Although small it is equipped with all mainstream portals like HDMI VGA USB and even an SD card slot. With the carrier bag and mini tripod it is very portable and easy to set up in any location. I've used it for customer demo onsite and everyone was impressed with I pull it out from my backpack and set it right up projecting on the wall. The brightness is high not reduced by its size. Overall I' m very satisfied.

The Ysametp Mini Portable Projector with 8000 Lux. The Brightness provides a great video viewing experience in medium to dark rooms. The most modern chip technology in the projector can give you an image that is both bright and clear. Additionally the projector supports 1080P has a 10000:1 contrast ratio and emits 8000 lumens of light all of which add to the pleasure for the whole family to watch during movie nights.I purchased an amazon 1080p stick for this it's simple plug and play.  You'll change to HDMI mode and the amazon will pick up instantly and start working. The best part is viewing screen size; the projection size ranges from 32" to 170" and its height ranges from 3.2' to 15.8'.The build quality is simple and nice.  The sound will fill the area without issue but don't expect BASS.  Overall we love this projector because it provides a better viewing experience for everyone in the room.

Thats what i was saying to myself after this 5 minute install. I love this projector! The sound quality makes ne feel like im in surround sound the quality is amazing as good as any tv and lets not talk about the space and room you have now! Perfect product! Perfect pricing! #str8factzapproved
5,For a entry level projector I found this to be impressive. The picture is surprisingly bright and crisp and clear. On entry level projectors the screen makes all the difference ( although I recommend a good screen for every projector). Get the best screen you can afford and you will not regret it.For the price this is hard to beat. 5 STARS
5,The tripod on this portable projector makes spending a few extra dollars worth it.We’ve had other projectors and were never able to get a great picture because it was virtually impossible to angle them.  This projector made all our previous issues completely disappear.This projector is so easy to set up!  The small tripod is EVERYTHING.  Using the tripod made setting it up a cinch.  The picture quality is fantastic in addition to the sound.  Easily add a roku or fire stick and you’re ready to go!

Don’t get me wrong the instruction manual is complete and lets you know you know how to work all the bells and whistles. I just think the user interface is so nice you won’t need it.The focus is the classic turn knob around the lens where you have to twirl it left or right to bring it in and out of clarity. So nothing unusual there. We love the little prop stand that comes with it it’s a three leg tripod. The unit itself is light and small enough to be considered portable.
5,Great picture quality. Internal speaker isn’t that great but I just used my portable speaker . my kids love it. Every night is movie night.
5,This is a great & functional projector and I recommend you use it with a media stick in the HDMI slot.Get an Amazon Firestick or a Roku HD Stick.It is priced fairly and delivers a great experience.Good job
5,Speaker could be louder and still looking for a way to connect a speaker. Great picture quality
5,I really love projectors and they have become my go to gift.  I'm really showing my age here but they remind me of elementary school and watching little videos in class.  I chose this one for my bestie because she has a very extensive prime video library.  I paired it with a firestick so now she has instant access to all of her movies.  It is very user friendly and would be a great idea for someone who might not be as tech savvy as some.  I really like that it comes with its own tripod.  If you are using it outside  it can be difficult to find a completely flat level surface to put it on.  With the tripod you can adjust it until the picture is perfectly straight.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 We set up ours to our chromecast easily and the picture quality was surprisingly amazing my husband was highly impressed with the option to connect to your Bluetooth speakers so definitely a big plus our kids are gonna love it for movie nights
2,I want to love this projector but I can't. So here's the pros before we discuss the cons. Comes with a nice carrying/storage bag remote hdmi cable audio cable tripod instruction booklet and projector plug. Picture is quite clear easy to set up firestick and decent size screen.Now for the cons which I feel is a deal breaker... tripod is not adjustable so you can't angle the projector to use on the ceiling ( goal to use in bedroom to save on space). Set up is confusing (still figuring that out) volume sucks to say the least. In order to use your phone you need a adapter (I have an android so a hdmi to usd-c type needed). Does get very hot and it's actually a bigger projector than expected. Again wanted to love this projector but it was not to be.
1,Instructions said I could stream Netflix and Hulu if I connected my phone using a lightning to hdmi adapter (which I had to purchase).  It didn’t work.  I was able to project YouTube and my phone screen but not the movie streaming services as I wanted.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I bought the mini projector to watch movies at home I am enjoying using it. The package has all the items required the video quality is good. Great one.
5,It has quality sound and video. children liked it.  IT is a very good product.
5,My son plays his game with it and he uses it every day we've had no issues for over a month sound and picture quality clear easy assembly
5,Using few days and works well. Kid happy that now can watch cartoons in a big screen.One note! This is not for professionals and please do not expect more than this can bring to you.
5,This projector was very nice when using it in a light-controlled room that has blackout shades. The projector was a blast for gaming and I found the colors looked fairly sharp when playing cartoony games like Fall Guys  but wasn't quite as nice as using a normal TV when I was trying to watch a grittier TV show on it. I'm very happy with this as a casual projector.
4,Perfect entertainment piece to have for the oudoor summer viewing. The unit is a solid build lightweight enough to make transporting around easy and comes with a carry case for storage. The illumination is very good and the connectivity is straight forward and easy to operate. Very pleased with the great value added with this unit to our family fun.
4,This mini projector isn't really a replacement for a genuine home theater projector. It's low resolution doesn't get very bright and lacks any sort of advanced video processing. But if it's just some kids watching a movie or creating a big screen outside at night after hanging a white sheet on the wall it's totally perfect for that. Or even if you're not much of a videophile and care about size over all other picture quality aspects you might be fine using this as a regular movie and tv watching display (in a darkened room of course you can't use this in a daylight filled room).The best use case for this is hooking up a laptop or a firestick/roku/chromecast/etc. up to the HDMI port. While the projector itself is not full 1080p resolution it does accept a 1080p signal over HDMI. In a dark room or outdoors at night picture quality is relatively clear with pretty decent contrast. As I said it's not high resolution but it's also not competing with projectors that cost 5-10x as much.Sound quality is poor. It might be loud enough indoors but outdoors you may want to hook up an external speaker to this or something. Any speaker with an aux input (headphone jack) will work.Screen size of 32 to 200 inches is supported but the larger you go the dimmer the overall picture will get. Something close to 100 inches would be the sweet spot. There is no zoom on the lens so you have to physically move the projector to get the desired screen size (a 100 inch screen will be somewhere around 8-10 feet away from it). There is a keystone adjustment which is helpful if you mount the projector to a ceiling or put it on a low table.Overall it's a good starter projector a projector for the kids room or perhaps one you would occasionally use for outdoor movie nights. I would recommend spending more if you want a dedicated home theater projector.
4,this projector is a great value for the price. depending on what you need it for that is. If you plan to use this for modern gaming... keep looking. But if you plan to use this for a workstation or movie nights or old school gaming you cant go wrong with this one. The brightness is not the best so you gotta make sure youre in a decently dark room. The quality of picture is decent up to 50inch but when you get passed that youll start to notice pixels in lettering on screen. its bareable if youre just navigating to a movie but typing or reading becomes an issue.Its got all the connections on the back that you need. You can plug in anything from an N64 to modern PC.the speaker is horrendous so make sure you add a soundbar for best experience.the internal fan seems a little loud for how hot it still gets. make sure you dont place this on fabric material as it could worsen the heat and block intake.Overall I am happy with this as a spare its definitely nice to have and the price is bang on. 8/10
5,I’m enjoying this mini projector so far… it’s easy to use and the quality is great for the price range.It was easy to get set up and it works well if you know what you’re getting. I’m using a soundbar plugged into this as t has better audio than the actual projector itself the audio from the projector is decent in its own though but down expect anything special. No Bluetooth available and the projector itself isn’t portable at all it always has to be plugged in.The video quality is great from what I’m seeing it’s clear with bright vibrant colours. The focus knob is easy to use to get the clearest picture quality along with the keystone wheel which works ok but it could better.Overall a good projector that works well while being affordable… I’m happy with it.
5,As I type this projector is priced at $116.99 which seems inexpensive when compared to similar projectors I have seen but do you get what you pay for? Honestly I have no idea. This is my first experience with any kind of projector (outside of a classroom) so I cannot make any comparisons. All I can say is it seems pretty decent to me. I need/want to get a projector screen so we can use this in our yard- my dream is to be able to watch movies while we are seated around our fire pit- but I have tried it out against a plain white wall in our home and it worked well enough. I hooked our dvd player up to it and dug out an old movie to try and voila! It was kinda like being at a drive-in. I am not sure yet but I may get a pair of speakers too depending on how the units sound quality is outside. Again it seemed pretty decent to me indoors but I want to hear what it sounds like when competeing with the ambient noise in our yard. For now though I have no complaints about this product. I am the farthest thing from a "techie" and I had no problem getting this thing set up and running despite the included barely-of-any-use instruction booklet. Really if I can figure it out then anyone can.
5,This projector is awesome picture quality is superb. Turn your home into a theater and enjoy your favorite movies on the whole wall. Easy set up and operation at a reasonable cost. Great value!
5,What an amazing little projector.We have it projecting about a screen size of 140 inch and its very clear bright and works well.Cant beat the price.It totally compares to one we bought three years ago for 300$ besides the fact that it isnt wifi.  Great buy!!
4,Le projecteur en t’en que tel est super mais le son n’est pas fameux j’ai du acheter des speaker
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 As per my subject be aware no wifi/bluetooth so do not get if you need it. If you understand what you’re getting then this is a good projector. The quality of picture is quite good. I have tried a video on a USB drive and it played perfectly fine. The audio on the device could be better though but you can’t expect too much from it. I did have a problem with an Amazon FireTV stick. It would not play any audio. I tried a YouTube video but there was no audio. I couldn’t figure out why.
3,Arrived in an unsealed all-dented box (see attached pictures) but the content looked ok.This is a small mini projector measuring about 6” by 8” by 3”. It comes with an HDMI cable an AV cable and a mini tripod.The remote control requires 2 AAA batteries not included.The user manual is not fully in English part of it in Chinese and the only part about this projector resolution is on the last page where it says “supports up to 1080P” which is not the same as saying “native 1080P resolution”.The videos in Youtube and my Blue-ray player can play at 1080P. The picture and color look quite good.But text looks blurry. I can’t get it to focus either in Youtube or in Windows 10.Also it claims to be a “Smart Projector” see attached picture. But this projector doesn’t support any smart feature no WIFI no Bluetooth no casting or mirroring.@116.99 it is expensive compared to native 1080p projectors some of them are in this price range and some even includes a 120” projection screen. There are better choices than this one; I fact I just recently got 2 different models at $119.99 with smart functions 1 with 120” screen. So shop around.
4,This low-budget low resolution projector fulfilled its intended purpose which for us was to enjoy summmer night backyard movie watching. Its portability and easy setup makes this a perfect add on for entertaining. While the more epic movie watching will be left to our main home theatre as a fun experience outdoors without worrying abot any expensive piece being at risk I am happy with the delivery on this unit. Good value.
5,J'ai acheté ce projecteur pour les soirées au cinéma les soirs en famille. Je suis vraiment impressionné par la qualité du produit. Ce projecteur est un appareil haut gamme il a de très bonnes fonctionnalités. Je n'ai même plus besoin d'avoir une télé a la maison car elle fait tout ce donc une télé peut faire et mieux encore.J'aime déjà le fait qu'il n'est pas très lourd comme appareil malgré sa grosseur ce qui permet de pouvoir le déplacé sans aucune difficulté.J'aime aussi le fait que son manuel d'utilisation est bien décrit ce qui permet une configuration directe sans trop de problèmes ; pas besoin d'être un expert pour pouvoir configurer cet appareil.Le projecteur a aussi un haut-parleur de qualité intégré pas besoin d'un haut-parleur additionnel pour les projections à l'intérieur. Cependant pour les projections externes il y a toujours possibilité de brancher un haut-parleur externe plus puissant par la prise audio si on le désire.J'aime aussi le fait qu'elle peut lire directement les cartes SD sans appareil additionnel.En plus elle a la projection sans fil (Wireless casting) qui marche très bien et qui est une grosse option pour un projecteur de ce calibre.La qualité de l'image est exceptionnelle presque comme l'image d'une télévision. La connexion Wifi est stable et on réussi à avoir le signal même à l'arrière de la cour.Je recommande ce produit pour son rapport qualité performance.
5,This little mini projector is fantastic. The picture quality is impressive for the size and price of the unit. It really makes a big difference being in a very dark room i find the picture quality greatly improved. Overall the software is very user freindly.  I connected mine with a sound bar and its like my own home theater system very happy with the projector.
4,This machine works (note: in photo this is on the ceiling as I didn't have an empty wall in the hotel I was testing this in).  It works for portable projection work like consulting.  I appreciated the fact that it comes with all the necessary cabling to hook up (see slots in photos).There were two things that were slightly problematic.  First the stand is just a tripod with little way to adjust it.  I found I needed to prop up one side with some papers to get it level.  Second I got a piece of fuzz behind the lens which was a bit frustrating to find and remove.There are speakers on it but they aren't great so I recommend bringing an additional set to plug into.  I did this and it worked great.  Also I found that the fan was a bit noisy not a problem if you are in a larger room but in a room smaller than 12x12' and you will probably notice it.It is well packaged which makes carrying it around good.  The picture quality is fine.  The machine is intuitive to use.  All you have to do is hook it up to your laptop and then go to laptop settings and adjust the display setting and presto it works.Given the price I would recommend for portable presentations.
5,I was not expecting this to show up so clearly!It connected to my phone so easily when I was trying to cast things. Honestly all set up with it has been particularly breezy!Especially when I tried combining it with my fire stick. Wow it was the best of all worlds. All the accessibility  to all the streaming networks I pay for on the big screen on my wall in my bedroom. This is truly a level up !
1,Facile à installer facile à utiliser j'étais bien ravie de l'avoir installer toute seule mais quand je l'ai démarrer j'ai été déçue par le son que le petit ventilateur fait.... Tellement bruyant 😟Je vais le retourner a cause de cette raison malheureusement
5,This mini projector has really good video quality and good sound quality.  It doesn’t have wifi or Bluetooth capabilities but you can easily watch a movie from your USB flash drive or connect a Firestick or laptop to it. The projector is small and lightweight.  Setting up the projector was easy.  The focus ring was easy to use to adjust the video sharpness.  The keystone was easy to adjust and comes in handy if the projector is off angle a little.  The projector came with a remote HDMI cable AV cable a tripod and a carrying bag.  The carrying bag is nice so you can take your projector with you without damaging it.
5,For such a small projector I am really amazed as to how clear the picture is.  The instructions tell you what to do if the picture looks funny which is handy.  After using the projector for 4 hours it doesn't even feel hot. I'm guessing the heat dissipation is really good on this projector then.The inputs are HDMI and VGA. There is a cable for you to plug in composite cables (yellow for video; red/white for audio).  There is a 3.5mm audio out for you to plug in headphones or I guess some speakers.The projector has a USB port for you to power a Chromecast or plug in a USB flash drive.  Some movies will play from the USB flash drive but there were some movies that had no audio.  I'm unsure which codec that it's not able to play.  I'm guessing it's AC3.  I would suggest to plug in an Android box or something if you want to play some movie files.The bottom of the projector has a threaded hole where you can attach a camera tripod to the projector.  I was using my SLR tripod to prop up the projector.  The projector is so light you don't even need a heavy duty tripod (for an SLR; just need a lightweight tripod for point and shoot cameras).The volume can only be controlled using the remote which uses 2xAAA batteries.I can definitely recommend this projector.
2,I didn't like the quality of its image. Second I didn't like that it doesn't connect with bluetooth.
5,This is perfect for work when I need to do a presentation to clients I just have to bring this small projector that is also very light. I add a situation when the projector where I was doing a presentation was not working so this will be a backup plan in those situations. I have used it inside and outside and the quality of the picture is surprisingly good for the low price. It as all the connection I could ever need but no wireless not important for the use I plan with the projector. Only thing I don’t like is the noise level but that is to be expected at this price point.
4,Good deal for that price. A little noisy though.
5,I got this little projector to use mostly in my bedroom. I gotta say it's amazing! I could not believe just how easy setup was. I plugged in my firestick plugged the power cord in and BAM! T.V. on the ceiling. My photos don't give it justice. The image quality is great. The on board speaker is not the best but you can hookup your own speakers and your movie experience will be top notch. I would strongly recommend this projector to anyone in the market for a projector. Currently using it with additional sound and having no issues. Extremely happy with this projector can I give it 10 stars...
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This is another one of those cheap projectors with absurdly and insanely overinflated lumens; oh wait this one doesn't even advertise lumens (they're getting smarter) and instead it advertises lux which is completely meaningless without associated distance/area. It might as well say 300 horse power because it's meaningless.However the real lumens based on my 9 point (averaged) measurements is around (and no more than) 90-100 lm. For home theater projectors with minimal ambient light a min of 1500 lumens is needed. Likewise a minimum of roughly 2500 lm is desirable for a classroom or room with windows in general.After playing it around and using it for a few minutes (to get the distance size focus and keystone settings right etc) I quickly realize that this is NOT the product I thought it is; suffice to say I'm rather disappointed at [some of] the most important aspects of being a decent projector; its [true] brightness and crispness of imagines (and/or text).It is generally in line with most others that I've seen on Amazon that are under $150 or so with a native resolution of 720p or less. Most notably it has above average maximum supported (claimed but not tested) screen size of 200" at a distance of 5 meters; however the image is so dim at around 2m I don't even wanna think about what the image would be like at that distance.Note that they intentionally omit NEARLY ALL specs (nothing is found in the manual either) including native resolution and speaker wattage and so I can only assume this might not even be native 720p at all.≡ NoteIn order to calculate the correct illuminance (i.e. luminous flux per unit area) the area of the surface on which the light illuminates must be known;::: 1 lux (lx) is equal to 1 lumen (lm) per square meter.Typically the brightness of projectors is measured in lumens so that a 1000 lm projector would have a light output of 1000 lx over a screen size of 1 square meter or 500 lx over a 2 square meter screen (because the same amount of light must now spread over larger area; thus the 'intensity' must be 'diluted' and divided by the same amount which is half in this case).While any screen size would work (as long as it's known) I decided to use 1 square meter to simplify the calculation even though it slightly complicated the initial setup. To that end the projector (from the lens) was placed about 2 meters away (irrelevant to our calculations but included here for completeness) from the screen which resulted in a projected screen of an area of 0.99 m² which for all intents and purposes was good enough for what I wanted to do.The screen was 127 cm (~ 50 inch) diagonally. If I were to place the projector/lens 270 cm away from the screen it would've produced a screen of 90" (229 cm) in size. Note that these figures are for 16:9 screens only. With the projector and everything in place I then take multiple (10) measurements at the highest brightness (vivid mode) and the results averaged out to produce the final figures.Most importantly though these clearly showed that the maximum (white) light output is about 93 lumens (per square meter) and it was ABSOLUTELY dimmer much dimmer than one of my existing 200 lm mini projector. The advertised 9000 lx is meaningless because it doesn't include the distance at which it would produce 9000 lx; however based on what I could measure the distance required to get 9000 lx is no more than 20 cm so if you were to place the projector 20cm or so away from the wall it will have 9000lx. Does it make sense to you? Nope not to me.Ideally multiple measurements should be made each of which at different locations in order to have better 'averaged' results (i.e. 12 measurements per level) over the entire area but that's too time consuming so I took only one measurement from the brightness spot near the center which would give us the 'best case' scenario in most cases. Speaking of lumens in addition to white light output we must also consider lumens of color output which are usually lower than white output. As such the real brightness is likely much lower.Most projectors would at least advertise the wattage of the speaker but NOT this projector and I know why; the speaker for this particular projector is MUCH weaker than most others projectors that I've come across. My estimate would be it's a 2W speaker which is just sad to have in 2022.With respect to other features - aside from the completely meaningless and extremely dimmed projection and lower than expected speaker wattage the projector itself appears to be well-constructed and the remote is comfortable to hold and the sound is still acceptable  in terms of quality (nothing to be excited about but it's enough for small room).  Video quality appears to be fine when the screen size is less than 50-55" (max 60-ish); however the picture quality around the top and bottom are REALLY blurry if the keystone has been adjusted. Speaking of keystone it's one of the worse I've seen in combination with picture quality; 15° is just inadequate.The video quality degraded dramatically (e.g. grainy blurry and lack of contrast probably due to the fact that it's not bright enough) when it went beyond 60-65". It has ONLY VERTICAL keystone setting which means it has to be in the center of the screen (instead on the sides). The fan was moderately loud which wasn't uncomfortably for me anyway. It was nice to be able to use USB as an input source but then again all of these inputs are pretty much standard nowadays and they are nothing to write home about.In short specs are not everything when it comes to visual representations because they are highly subjective; therefore I've also included a short video so you can be the judge yourself (however difficult because the room was nearly completely dark in order to achieve this and its size is about 50"). It is the BEST possible highest quality video that I can produce so what you see is most likely the best you'd ever get.Having said that the complete lack of spec is NOT something to be taken lightly and it's beyond reasonable doubt to me that this is NOT intentional in order to hide what this projector is NOT capable of which is quite unfortunate. As such this is a completely waste of your hard earned money at a price of $100 if you are looking for home theatre type of setup.I also probably wouldn't have this for kids because the resolution and picture is so bad that I worry it might affect their eyesight in the long run. There are plenty of better options out there on Amazon even though most of them suffer from the same issues described here because we continue to allow them to behave like this. Your mileage might vary.
5,Just the USB port I don't know what it's for.
5,This Ysametp Mini Projector has dual built in speakers with lots of ports to support different media options. It's compatible with TV Fire Sticks smart phones laptops etc. Compact lightweight and very portable. We hung a white sheet on the side of the shed for a movie screen and it worked well. It was set up using a USB stick. The horror movie for the teenagers was much better outside in the dark with bush all around at the cottage. Picture and sound was decent quality. Great for camping too.Also included is an HDMI cable 3 in 1 AV line power cord tripod remote (3 X AAA batteries not included) a drawstring fabric bag and a manual. Currently reasonably priced at $116.99.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I bought this projector to replace an older one I had. This one is brighter and has a much better image quality (letters are actually legible). My old projector was on a ceiling mount. So I replaced it with this one. I guess nobody else has their projector mounted this way based on the reviews. But the moment you flip the image upside down the image scrambles (see pictures and video).So I ordered a second one same issue. I contacted the seller and he sent me a firmware update file. I upgraded the firmware and (wait for it) same problem. The seller sent me a replacement projector and guess what? (Drumroll) Same issue! So I guess all of the projectors have the same issue? Check yours and let me know because for me it was three out of three.I can watch it by using the Zoom 1 setting instead of 16:9 but this crops the image all around. I could also use a tripod to avoid flipping the image but that will have to go on the centre of my coffee table. So all in all instead of upgrading I had to deal with this faulty projector and the headaches that came with trying to solve the problem. I’ll just return it and look for something else.
4,This is affordable and works as it should. The picture is good not excellent. You do require an additional adapter to use your smart phone which was easy enough. My kids do use this often and it still works as it should from the first use. This would be a great gift for teens!
5,I originally thought it was a smartphone projector but it is not! Fortunately I have a HDMI cable and was able to use my macbook screen. This projector is the bomb! An amazing cheaper alternative to a large screen tv! The dimensions are customable from a small 10in to over 100in (with a pour resolution though). No tv stand needed! Zero headache installation. You simply need a wall and a dark room to make a good use of this projector.
4,Well I like this projector because of its light weight compact size easy setup and functions. I’m using it to beam presentations to my trainees and it is doing this task. I don’t expect from this small size and economic price projector to beam high resolution movies like cinemas or real home theatres simply you get what you are paying for. In summary it is a good projector.
5,I love this product so much I like how this is small like my room.Pros:-It has dual equipped fan cooling system. I don't need to worry about the noisy sounds.-Unlike TVs image diffusing technology protects your eyes from direct light.-I can use HDMI/USB adapter to connect my smartphone freely. If the phone is Android system then there is a micro USB/ Type c adapter to connect it.-It's so small and lightweight that I can carry it around anywhere.-The quality is very nice.Cons:-The heat that comes out is very hot.-I hope it supports wifi or Bluetooth too just like other projectors nowadays.Overall I can recommend it to anyone.
5,Quick Review:So this is a pretty decent projector given the low cost. (88.49 at time of review)It's perfect for movie night out at my trailer.Space is always at a premium in a trailer so I appreciate the small footprint that it takes up.Video quality is quite good and it comes with everything needed to get started including a cool little tripod.*Note that you will need a lightning cable if you wish to connect your phone.Also note that it does not support Bluetooth or WiFi directly.I'd recommend connecting some speakers as the built ins aren't overly good.While it certainly won't compete with a high end projector it's perfect for camping day cares presentations etc.Given the low cost it's hard not to recommend the unit.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I was hesitant to get this "Ysametp mini projector" but I decided to give it a shot and it was worth it right out of the box you get this really small and nice projector with a bunch of accessories as a tripod different cables a remote control and a drawstring backpack once you power this projector it takes like 2 seconds to start enjoying a big screen that could go from 32" to 170" depending on the distance you place the projector from the wall the image quality is surprisingly good and the brightness is very good as well on settings you are able to adjust contrast brightness and even color for a better image quality quality sound for the built-in speakers it's not the greatest cause they're too small so I'd suggest to connect to better system audio other than that my five years old daughter loves it from now on we'll have movie nights. Totally recommended
5,update: the seller reached out to correct my misunderstanding turns out the product description specifically said"2. Smartphone ConnectionWhen connecting with an iOS/Android phone you need a Micro USB or Lighting to HDMI adapter(not included)."so it was my mistake to assume this had bluetooth/wifi functionality to begin with now that i got an adaptor to use with my smart phone it works perfectly the 1080p resolution has a crystal clear image and its bright enough to use on a white wall with no issues. altho i still wished it had at least bluetooth but i guess at this price point its not a very realistic expectation.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------original review: this is not a smart projector it has no wifi or even bluetooth capabilities it does not work with a smartphone at all. it MUST use a cable to be hooked to a source like a laptop/computer or chrome cast or something.
4,Why oh why do they need to hide and overinflate specs on these projectors. Not nearly as bright as stated and I know it says 1080p supported  but the actual display resolution is impossible to find and not even listed in the manual. I’m guessing it’s around 720p but could be less. Doesn’t play the files it said it would own the manual… only accepted like half my video files on my test usb stick. MP4 wasn’t even supported. Picture looks alright at less than 50 inches but I won’t go much bigger given the less than stellar resolution. Very basic UI  but it works. Overall this is a run of the mill cheap projector and probably not with your time
5,J'ai acheté ce projecteur pour les soirées au cinéma les soirs en famille. Je suis vraiment impressionné par la qualité du produit. Ce projecteur est un appareil haut gamme il a de très bonnes fonctionnalités. Je n'ai même plus besoin d'avoir une télé a la maison car elle fait tout ce donc une télé peut faire et mieux encore.J'aime déjà le fait qu'il n'est pas très lourd comme appareil malgré sa grosseur ce qui permet de pouvoir le déplacé sans aucune difficulté.J'aime aussi le fait que son manuel d'utilisation est bien décrit ce qui permet une configuration directe sans trop de problèmes ; pas besoin d'être un expert pour pouvoir configurer cet appareil.Le projecteur a aussi un haut-parleur de qualité intégré pas besoin d'un haut-parleur additionnel pour les projections à l'intérieur. Cependant pour les projections externes il y a toujours possibilité de brancher un haut-parleur externe plus puissant par la prise audio si on le désire.J'aime aussi le fait qu'elle peut lire directement les cartes SD sans appareil additionnel.En plus elle a la projection sans fil (Wireless casting) qui marche très bien et qui est une grosse option pour un projecteur de ce calibre.La qualité de l'image est exceptionnelle presque comme l'image d'une télévision. La connexion Wifi est stable et on réussi à avoir le signal même à l'arrière de la cour.Je recommande ce produit pour son rapport qualité performance.
5,Used to hook up to our Xbox and it works perfectly! Wicked image quality and colors. Suggest connecting better speakers as the built in one obviously aren't the bestCame with everything we needed. Remote has great signal and the projector itself can be used in daylight settings without straining your eyes!Highly suggested and well worth the price! Great unit!

5,I was looking for compact projector for home and camping. Cane across this one. Very impressive. Compact yet provide awsome quality. With this reasonable price could not be more happier.highly recommended.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The thing I like the most about this mini projector is its size and weight that make it easy to transport or store away when not in use. The image quality is pretty good and the ports are enough for my needs to connect my computer or other devices to it. Come with a remote and small tripod a bag for carrying HDMI cable power cable 3 in 1 AV line. No Bluetooth or wifi but I was not expecting that for that price. The only thing I dislike is the loud fan noise it is not whisper quiet. I know projectors have fan noise but this would be too loud for my taste using it for watching TV or movies. If you listen to your movie with the volume loud enough then it would be OK. It as built-in speakers that are OK and good luminosity at 10000 Lux. Good quality for the price.
5,Does exactly what it needs to do turns on very fast and saves your previous input selection which is very nice. I would definitely use an external speaker but I’m using it for home cinema and it’s perfect.
3,- The projector is ok as it doesn’t offer some features that I like over similar projector that’s selling here on amazon. First is that while it’s small and the package also includes a mini table-top tripod it doesn’t come with a storage bag but rather a plastic “backpack”. It’s super thin and I don’t think it’s a good idea to go around with the projector and accessories in a plastic backpack. The projector doesn’t offer wifi but more importantly bluetooth connection. For my other projectors of the same price range and design it also has a bluetooth connection that allows me to pair my speakers to this projector and so it’s a much more convenient and better audio experience when paired via bluetooth. For this projector I have to get an audio cable and depending on how far from your speakers it’s going to be very long. Another option you can do is to get a bluetooth transmitter but that means you have to spend extras. The projector works well. The picture is good and nothing much to complain about. Overall a good unit but a bit expensive as I have other projectors that cost less than $100 and also have wifi and bluetooth.

5,So tried this out in my dining room which obviously isn't where we would do most of our viewing but I was looking for a bare wall to try it on and easy access to outlets so this was the spot. I have never used a projector before and technology is not always my friend. This claims plug and play.... Thank God it really is cause I'd be lost if it wasn't. The instructions tell you absolutely nothing but what each button is for so I was scared. But I took an absolute guess on which cord would fit both my laptop and the projector plugged everything in and put on a show. It's pretty straight forward in terms of focus and does well both small screen and large. We've had fun playing around with it and now can't wait for our first family movie night... thinking of trying it outside on the back of the house or maybe on the wood fence. The speaker isn't incredibly loud but does fill a room with sound. Outside I'll try and connect with speakers  I'll update when we do that and let you know how that turns out. The stand isn't very sturdy in my opinion. It does hold the machine but one bumb and it's going down. Overall I'm impressed and definitely reccomend this little machine for pumping up movie nights.
1,Unless you are going to use this in a windowless room with no ambient light or 2½ feet from your screen don't waste your money. You get what you pay for with this projector. What a disappointment.
4,Simply it's a great value for money. I've seen reviews for other projectors with higher prices but they didn't look much good. But the image quality and everything in this projector is awesome.A couple of things I wish was a little betterIt's a little bit noisy. So unless you are wearing a headphone you will be hearing a lot of fan noise.The Keystone feature is not as good as it should be. But for that money it is acceptable.The speaker is not very good. But I believe most people can figure out a way to play better audio.Overall this projector is amazing just because of the price I got it for. I'm extremely happy with it and it's very reliable so far.

5,I have tried this projector for both home use and work use and I’m satisfied with the results. The slides/photos/video projection is very decent colours are perfect and resolutions are high.I'm also happy with the compact design mobility and the variety of inputs this projector has ( HDMI USB MSD……)In summary it is a good projector for a reasonable price.
4,This projector exceeded my expectations. I attached it to my laptop and aimed it at the living room wall and I was pleasantly surprised with the output. I really love it ehile it's great on the wall an actual projector screen would work better to enhance the picture quality which I must say was already pretty good. You can't go wrong especially at this price.
5,For such a small projector I am really amazed as to how clear the picture is.  The instructions tell you what to do if the picture looks funny which is handy.  After using the projector for 4 hours it doesn't even feel hot.  I'm guessing the heat dissipation is really good on this projector then.The inputs are HDMI and VGA.  There is a cable for you to plug in composite cables (yellow for video; red/white for audio).  There is a 3.5mm audio out for you to plug in headphones or I guess some speakers.  You could probably connect a bluetooth dongle to the 3.5mm port and connect it to a bluetooth speaker.The projector has a USB port for you to power a Chromecast or plug in a USB flash drive.  Some movies will play from the USB flash drive but there were some movies that had no audio.  I'm unsure which codec that it's not able to play.  I'm thinking it's AC3 but I forgot to check.  I would suggest to plug in an Android box or something if you want to play some movie files.I was even streaming game 7 of the Leafs vs Lightning.  That was fun to watch a hockey game on my wall (not fun if you're a Leafs fan though).The bottom of the projector has a thread part where you can attach a camera tripod to the projector.  I was using my SLR tripod to prop up the projector.  The projector is so light you don't even need a heavy duty tripod.The volume can only be controlled using the remote which uses 2xAAA batteries.  The volume is OK.  It's definitely not super loud which makes it the weakest thing of the projector.I can definitely recommend this projector if you're looking for something to use once in a while.  If you're looking for something to use all the time I'm unsure how this projector stacks up against the $500+ projectors.  I'm guessing it doesn't though.
5,Love it for easy of use and good picture quality. Set up was easy and I’m happy with my purchase.
5,I like the mini size it is very productive.Great for home use.The price is excellent for what it does.Compact size makes it easy to setup or take anywhere.It is very powerful and bright.Remote control works well.The motor is a little loud but its okay.Vey bright.
5,obviously this doesnt compare to BenQ or anything but for the price you pay... its REALLY good quality.bright enough to see during the day. the screen is viable for over 100 inches if you wish.(the only thing lacking at that size and up is the text quality)its not loud at all wouldnt notice over a house fan if youre runnin that too.it comes with a tripod stand and has keystone so you can adjust the picture perfectly to your screen.the speakers are lacking but thats to be expected. and it doesnt have bluetooth which is a shame.overall 9.5/10... if it had bluetooth it would be a 10.
5,PROS:- good build quality- decent brightness for darker rooms but functions in naturally lit rooms- focus and keystone adjustment- multiple connection options- can mount on a tripod (included) or stand- built in speakers- long lasting bulb- carry sack to keep everything together when not in use or for portabilityCONS:- noneThis is a nice projector for it's size.  The projector is well built and provides multiple options for connectivity.  The lens is adjustable to allow up to 200" virtual screen and even has a single axis keystone adjustment.  Power plug is included and speakers are built in for instant sound (aux port included for external speaker option).Once everything was connected / set up I found this projector quite good in dark rooms.  If you are using it in a naturally lit room it tends to wash out and if you put on artificial lights it really washes out.  However during ideal situations this projector is bright enough to achieve a 120" projection with good clarity.  Once I pulled the projector back for a larger view the brightness diminishes.The picture quality is very good allowing 1080p resolution (depending on your input).  The included tripod is a nice bonus but is far better off on a flat stable surface.  Overall a great projector!
5,I just had a fun movie marathon weekend and I love this projector.It’s been a while since I’ve been to the movie theaters because of Covid and this projector helps fill that void.The image projected was fairly large and looked similar to the theaters. The sound emanating from the projector was good and the fan noise was not so loud to drone everything out.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The projector is small. And quite versatile to wear. Bring even a case to transport it. A fairly basic and non-adjustable tripod to place it on any flat surface. Plus your remote and cables.Its installation is very simple and well. It has HDMI VGA and USB ports. Bring to sharpen the image and to adjust the image so that it is not rhomboid.As for the image well it can be said that it can reach a 55-inch television more than that it becomes distorted. So for presentations on large sites it will not work. But for small classrooms or rooms yes.What I like the most about the projector is that it is portable. I didn't see any flaws in it so I have nothing against the projector.When turned on it is quite fast to project the image. That surprised me a lot
4,If you want to have a neat outdoor setup and want something portable maybe a cool garage setup to watch youtube  or something this is a nice little unit.  The picture quality is decent and as long as you're not expecting the quality of a big expensive unit you won't be disappointed.I wouldn't however rely on this unit for presentations where you're trying to display text to an audience.  The picture while okay for a tv show probably won't hold up if you're trying to project too much text.But for the price this is a neat little unit!  Much more compact than a TV and in the right setting it shines.
4,The "Mini Projector 1080P Full HD Supported Portable Video Projector 10000 Lux. LED Movie Projector for Home Theater Work with TV Stick Android/ iPhone HDMI VGA  Backpack Included(Milky)" works well and the projector is quite versatile. However we didn't like that the power cable attaches on the opposite side to the rest of the cables. Very inconvenient and you end up having cords going everywhere.  Just not well-thought out.
4,This Mini Projector has good brightness colours and sharpness is excellent especially for under $80. In terms of features it is pretty barebones with no wireless support and no casting support. However I don't mind the simplicity of this projector as I've used other mini projectors with wireless Bluetooth and Miracast support but they just didn't work well or work at all. The projector is compact and one of the few mini projectors with keystone correction which is adjusted with knob behind the focus wheel. The build quality is okay but the housing does flex a bit when pressure applied.I do like that this projector uses an internal power supply so no bulky power brick making this projector suitable for travel. When powered on the fans are definitely noticeable but expected from a projector. The brightness was pretty good and better than I had expected. The projector supports a 32-170 inch image. When projecting on a beige wall the image was bright with good colours. The resolution was surprisingly good with sharp text and good clarity. The specs aren't specified in the manual but the projector does support a 1080p input. If I had to guess I would say the output resolution is 720p which is better than other mini projectors in this price range which only has an output resolution of 600p. This projector works great for watching movies and playing games.In terms of inputs there is a HDMI port and VGA port. I tried both a PS3 and Switch on the HDMI port and the image looked great. The projector does have built in speakers but they don't sound great and difficult to hear over the fan. However they are useable if just setting up to play some multiplayer Mario Kart. However if playing  a movie connecting to your home stereo or better speakers is the better option. My kids really loved the whole experience of using this projector. Something magical about playing multi-player games projecting onto a wall when we could easily play on a large LCD TV.
5,This is a decent projector for when you don't need advanced keystone control on image and for when fan noise doesn't matter too much. It offers a decent bang-for-buck quality and features for its price. Since the price is so low some compromises had to be made:The tripod it comes with is not very good but luckily it mounts onto any regular camera tripod.Another negative is that the focus will change when you put the lens cap on since the lens rotates to set the focus.Aside from those downsides I found it to be rather nice. Input options are excellent with support for HDMI and VGA. It would be perfect for setting up custom Halloween decorations or for using to trace large format art pieces. For a movie setup that you prefer to not be dominated by excessive fan noise I would suggest going one tier higher and getting something better. There are projectors for around $230 dollars right now that are significantly better than this. It's true that it costs twice as much but it's still a great value.This projector is good if you are looking for a bare-minimum project and this fits your budget. I would recommend it if that sounds like you. Otherwise I would go one tier higher and get something that has better picture quality and a quieter fan.
4,It occupies a large portion of my wall and the picture and sound quality are excellent. Unquestionably want to purchase another one that is ideal for my basement suite. I would advise anyone looking to use it because it currently runs Disney Plus without any problems and was very simple to set up.
5,it’s easy to use and the quality is great for the price range. Excellent picture.
4,The "Mini Portable Projector with 9000L Brightness 1080P Supported Movie Projector 170inch Display Compatible with TV Stick HDMI USB VGA AV PC DVD Smartphone" isn't super bright but works well enough in a darker room. The projector has the ability to connect to your phone or through a variety of other connections. It is a very economical choice for projecting.
3,FIRST IMPRESSION/CONTENTS:The 1080P Mini Projector from Ysametp arrived with tripod remote (batteries not included)  HDMI cable audio/video breakout cable power cable protective lens cap carrying satchel and instruction manual.This projector is quite compact which is surprising as the power supply is built-in instead of external and the overall build is quite good for the price range.  While this projector does not have the same optics as a $1000 project it still manages to pull off a decent picture.  Colours were reasonable as was brightness.  Of course brightness depends on how far away you place the projector from the screen and what you use for a screen.  With respect to display size setting the projector back approximately 9 feet from the screen resulted in an approximately 7' display (left to right not diagonal).  Although the picture is good it's important to keep in mind the brighter the room the worse the picture.  There's a reason movie theaters are dark.  This is best enjoyed in a dark room (as opposed to a living room).The menu system is both intuitive and minimalist and the projector supports VGA HDMI USB and SD Card input.  It also comes with a protective lens cap which is something many more expensive cameras lack.  Both focus and keystone can be adjusted manually and all features of the menu can be  navigated with the included remote or by using the built-in buttons on the top of the projector.  IR receivers are located at both the front and back of the projector.As noted previously the picture is indeed decent. In fact it's better than several other projectors I've recently reviewed.  That said not everything went to plan however.  I like to connect an Amazon Firestick for testing.  I was able to get it up and running but for some reason the projector would not play any audio when streaming on the Firestick.  It *would* play the Firestick start up sounds initially but whenever I attempted to watch any show or navigate afterwards no audio.  I tried every audio setting this has to offer (surround auto volume max volume etc.) no luck.  To rule out a defective Firestick I connected the Firestick to a different projector and all audio worked perfectly which means there's an issue with this projector.  So while the picture was spot-on the audio is clearly lacking.  I suspect it's something that could be easily corrected with a firmware update so I'll likely reach out to the seller/manufacturer to see if there's an update available.  Aside from the audio issue I'm not a fan of using the "tripod" as it limits the surface area you can place this on and well it's just begging to be tipped over.  Outside of these issues this would have been a 5 star budget projector.  The size and picture quality make it excellent to take out on the deck for a  neighbourhood movie/video game night.  Until the audio issues are resolved I'm only comfortable with a 3 rating.I hope you found this review helpful to your decision making.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The mini projector is equipped with 10000 Lux. LED light source and supports up to 1080P full HD resolution it offers bright and clear projection images. The dual built-in stereo speakers feature an SRS sound system it provides a great auditory sense experience in movies and music. Amazing projector for gathering and camping! This portable video projector is equipped with multiple ports including HD USB TF VGA and AV interfaces. The projector is compatible well with TV Boxes smartphones laptops PC etc. Streaming videos like Netflix Hulu Youtube and HBO must be mirroring displayed by connecting with an HDMI adapter Miracast dongle or TV stick such as Roku Fire TV Stick. Super cool for family fun!Plus: Plug and Play!
5,I used this on a recent camping trip to watch a few movies at night and it was an excellent viewing experience. I also have plans for using this as a 3dfx projector for the upcoming halloween display and it will do perfectly. Its no high end projector but for the price its an excellent choice with clear visuals and pretty good colours.  The sound is surprisingly good not much bass but definitely decent enough. Would be great for a kids setup!Overall its a good basic projector can be used for all sorts of presentations as well as its small and portable!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Love this projector for movie nights at home! The picture quality is great and it's super easy to focus and make adjustments to the picture to your liking.I found that it projects much better onto my builder beige walls over a dark curtain.  For some reason I thought a dark curtain as a back drop would be better but I was wrong the beige wall gives us a great picture.The projector can be propped up onto any flat surface and comes with leg extension to raise it if necessary.  We've been streaming Amazon videos and YouTube from our laptop with the HDMI attachment that is included. There are some other attachments so you can link to DVD player etc. You can also hook up to external speakers or headphones which is handy. The sound quality from the projector is good though but hooking up some sick high quality speakers would make the movies more like a theater experience.The projector is easy to use even for a non-tech savvy person like me. Plug it into the wall and your laptop point at the wall and go. The remote control works great and is very sensitive I don't even have to aim it at the projector and it works.Note that the further away the projector is from the wall the bigger the picture becomes. So you can make the picture the size that you prefer then use the dial on the projector to focus. It's so easy and had made movie night at home so much fun!
