5,Love it
5,The only improvement I would like is the ability to customize the top row buttons.
5,The remote works fine. We only purchased the tv six months ago though so I think the whole tv must be questionable.
4,Work perfect.
5,The replacement worked exactly like it should. No issues so far as long as my puppy doesn't chew this one up too!
5,Fantastic replacement for a remote that no longer worked. Set up was super simple and it comes with directions. Worked out of the box with batteries in less than 5 minutes. Added the warranty for extra assurance. More than other options but if it keeps working that easily it’s worth the extra money
5,The remote worked immediately out of the shipping bag. Only needed to add my batteries.
3,Not compatible with Vizio smartcast tv. Would be great with compatible tv.
3,Remote works well but I can’t get the voice option to work
5,Worked like it came with the TV. No programming!!
