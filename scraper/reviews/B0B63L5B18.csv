5,They arrived in perfect condition.The headphones connect well to any device like my cell phone and my ipad.The noise cancellation works perfectly and the features included in the headphones are practical and easy to use.
5,A present for my husband who owns a cleaning company and often needs to answer calls. We love this product he is able to clean and work while taking to clients or family. This earbuds are so comfortable that he literally keeps them all day long. Thanks
4,It’s not quite what I expected but I’m just now checking them out if I do I will let you know.Thx
5,Does exactly what I need it to and doesn't fall out of my ear like a lot of headphones do.
5,Great earphones if you’re on a budget. It lasts more than 4 hours without charging the earphones! Only problem I had was that the bass was weak.

5,Works as should
5,Wanted a wireless earbuds without compromising a lot of money. This work great and the battery last a lot
2,Again I have been taken in by false advertising. Again I have been lured by a too good to be true description. The only way these headphones can provide noise cancellation is if I turn up the volume so loud I can’t here anything but music.  Don’t get me wrong. They play music and they connect to my iPhone just fine. But noise canceling.  There is none. I’ll count this as bad purchase number 5. You got to be careful when ordering online.  I wonder these days if I can trust anything I purchase thru Amazon.
1,The item was not what I expected could not heart
1,Sound 5/10  volumen 1/10  Bluetooth 1/10 .
5,I am more than pleased with the quality of these headphones.  Saw a comment about the weak bass and I can absolutely tell you that the individual likely needed to adjust the placement of the headphones in their ear because these headphones have "booming bass".I've used them for Zoom and Skype calls at work. A warning however I was told that the mic is apparently super sensitive because it was picking up quite a bit of background noise.
5,First off I loved the sound I was not expecting the sound to be as good as it is. This is my first pair of buds with a charging caseboy let me tell you what I am never going back to plug and charge type buds.To be honest about it I did have a bit of trouble with pairing to my phone but I won. Its all good now.
5,Ear buds never stay in place for me so I wanted a pair that had the hook over the ear. These are so comfortable and honestly they fit so well in my ear I think I’d be fine without it. The sound quality is great. I use them everyday and am very pleased with this purchase.
5,I love the way it sounds it's very natural the only bad thing about it was when they delivered it they put it on my car hood and left that was very weird.The ear fits are great even my wife used it and she said it works very well.The other thing is the battery so far the battery last long for over 5 hours it's amazing
5,Love these earbuds all others fall off but these stay put soon as you put them on.
5,Loving this affordable set of headphones. Great over-ear fit and love the bonus of the digital charging display so I know how much charge is left in the case.
5,These ear buds are amazing. Great sound the battery is long lasting. Just a wonderful product.
5,Bass is good as described on the website....Fits just right on my ears....Overall good for the price of these ear buds....
5,These ear buds are very comfortable and feel very secure on your ear when exercising. Shipping was quick and the details of product were accurate.
5,The earphones were purchased for me but when my husband listened to them and said “they were the best earphones he had listened to” I gifted them to him.  Thank you they’re Great!
5,I'm happy with this purchase. I got a discount coupon which made it even sweeter! The charger/case is nice and compact. The ear buds are small and secure. Seems to be well made so far. Very good base. I use the largest size ear adaptor thingies for the best sound quality. Easy-to-use Bluetooth hook-up. I would buy them again.
5,They are the only ones that actually stay on my ears. The sound quality isn't great at all.
5,Very compact easy to connect to my iPhone. Works great!
5,Fits in my ears. Comfortable fit. Great sound quality.
5,way better than expected sound and microphone work great people have ko problem hearing me
5,Super comfortable excellent sound great price!!!
5,Headphones are easy to use and good sound quality.
5,These earbuds are so comfortable and have a good quality sound. I'm not afraid of loosing them because they hang into your ears securely.
5,It is very stick on my ear feels never fall
5,These earbuds work great and fit nicely securely in my ear.
2,They do sound good  but more then a couple feet away or simply bend over (weird) and they cut out. I’ve switched around the ear bud pads a dozen times and can’t get a good fit in my ears  and the right bud keeps saying low battery when it’s at 100% and I know it’s not low. I have to put it on the charger for a minute to get it to shut up.Going to figure out how to return them.
5,Great product for the price
5,I bought these for my son. He loves that they go over his ear and stay on. Easy to connect to his phone.
5,Product is awesome good quality sound.
5,My first use after charging was on a 2-hour flight where I kept it at max volume it lasted the whole flight and still had more juice.For the low price the sound quality is pretty good.The earhooks are smaller in diameter and lighter compared to other hooks which made it more comfortable to wear.I like that it has a type-c charging port instead of micro USB.Overall I would recommend it for the low price and good performance.
5,Purchased these as they had good reviews and I only wanted to spend £20. They arrived next day as to be expected. Opened the box and the earphone storage charger box was already charged to 80%. The build quality of the charger/ storage box was surprisingly good in my opinion. Opened and removed the  already charged ear  phones. The looked so small but again looked to be a quality build. Being a bloke I bypassed the instructions and proceeded to connect via blutooth to my phone. Success ensued on my first attempt. Put them in my hairy lugholes and they fitted perfectly we're very comfortable and so light. They also come with 3 different size silicon buds to fit all ear sizes. Bunged on a bit of Pink Floyd and I was in heaven. Read the instruction whilst chilling n having a smoke. I was so stoned that it still only took a minute to read the simple instructions. The sound quality was good. Good bass and sensible max volume.  After Pink Floydd finished  I decided to watch a bit of porn hub. The Wifelet was in the same room as me and I was praying for good blutooth connection or she would heard through my phones external speakers. The ear buds done me proud. I went to the kitchen to get a beer whilst leaving my phone in the lounge and still heard everything with perfect quality. Thank god the wife let was to engrossed in her phone to spot my phone sat there on my arm chair. The noise cancelling was good but just couldnt cope with the nagging wifelet and her whinging. Turned off the phone after a while and totally forgot I left the earbuds in my ears. I use the earbuds lots and often n after 8 hours still going strong with plenty of power left in the batteries. I use them for ....ahem.....working out and they make the whole experience very satisfying. They fit so well that they wont fall off into the toilet with vigerous motion.All in all for the price of a cheeky handshake from the local brothel these are well worth the money. What can you buy for 20 scuffs nowadays.A couple of days ago I purchased another pair for my nephew.
5,When I buy a pair of headphones for £20 I know I'm not getting the cutting edge and flawless sound however I was pleasantly surprised by this nifty and very usable set from i21.I tend to use my headphones when I am out running and need some pounding motivational music and for longer business trips when a good audiobook is required. The i21 fits the bill for both admirably. While it might lack the top treble and deepest bass of some it's easily better than others I have tried at a similar price point. I could get some decent bass with disturbance the noise-canceling helps with that and the spoken word of audio books was clear and precise.After using these at least 4 or 5 times a week over the last three weeks I have noticed the comfort of wearing them and the snug fit straight out of the box of course this will vary for others and additional earpieces are included. I never once felt that I might lose them even when using the touch control. Speaking of which there is a large touch surface on each very useful and running or exercising and the easy interface quickly became second nature to use.Battery life was right up there with what was promised they lasted a full coach trip down to London and back a twelve-hour round trip but I did take a few breaks so the battery claims of up to eight hours seem to hold up. The noise canceling was very good too very useful on a crowded coach.Recharging over usb-c is quick too and the one-hour charge in ten minutes claim is also spot on.Answering calls is a simple one-touch matter and worked well no matter what I was doing.The case is compact and lightweight and can easily be slipped into a pocket or bag.
5,Sorry about the pics - my iPhone is still playing up.As for the buds these are my second purchase of the i21 - although the last were the i21L (the ones with alien eyes on them). I was really impressed with those ‘buds. The quality was excellent and the case has a low profile that means it’s really comfortable in the pocket. While the charge is lower than some - 40 hours- I wear mine one at a time which extends the life beyond the advertised duration.The sound quality is great as well. They are so comfortable the hook is barely noticeable over the ear and the buds are nice and light in the ear. The little voice is of the type that is slightly muffled but once you play music or audiobooks these are perfect. Crisp clear audio of a good range of treble and bass both. Audible narration is a delight and if you are into ASMR these are good for such use - as long as you sit or else lie on your back!I heartily recommend these buds - a great price! My youngest has my i21L’s and I wanted a pair for myself that’s how much I liked these earbuds!Oh and yet again I have received a delivery within 24 hours all the way to the Shetland islands!! This seller is excellent. Friendly helpful GREAT comms and now tried and trusted.Go for it. £20-odd quid? You’d spend more than that in ten minutes down the pub! Get yourself a great dependable affordable comfortable and crisp clear pair of Bluetooth earbuds. Superb!!Once again a solid ten stars on EVERY level.
5,Good quality material - strong/durable.Light and not heavy (do not fall out of ear due to shape).connects straightaway - out of the boxClear display of charging status on charging case - given as percentage (for each bud). Good battery charge hold - was used several times and in standby in cradle/case (has been several days since first charge and it is still  at 94%)3 pairs ear tips - good quality.Once connected gives notification saying connecting/connected when placed in ear which is quite useful when the buds are in the ear and cannot see the led lights.snug fit in ears - Used them while running and do not fall out due to ear loops. No seeping of outside sounds when buds in ear.Ear loops themselves are very comfortable not rigid plastic very comfortable even after long use.Music quality - very clear great sound. quite loud in full sound mode (if required).Bass quality is also good.Call quality - sound very clear and can be loud if required.Cuts out outside noises due to good fit in ear.Does not fall out of ear both because of good fit in ear as well as very comfortable  ear loops.could be used in single ear bud and double mode.Single tap pauses music/videos/answer call/drop call.Voice assistant feature with three taps very useful.Quick switch between phone and laptop. Works well.  Very useful for music/videos/calls on laptop as well.Would definitely recommend.
5,These arrived pretty quickly earlier than it said it would.  The earphones had a bit of plastic over the contacts so they wouldn't charge in transit but the box was nearly full at 97%. I then charged the earphones and it only took 5 or 10 minutes so they were mostly charged already.  Pairing with my PC and phone was easy just long press on both earphones before startup to enter pairing mode then just use your device to connect to them they are called i21.  I was impressed by the audio quality it seems to have a good amount of bass and midrange my previous earphones (cheaper than these) had too much bass which I didn't think was possible!  My other earphones didn't have enough bass - the Anker Soundcore Life P2.  These feel pretty comfortable and don't fall out due to the sports band.  I don't do any running with earphones but they always come out a bit and you have to push them in but I haven't needed to do that with these yet.  The charging box looks smart with a display on the front the rest is matt black which I prefer.  The lid is magnetised so it stays shut the hinge could use a bit more resistance but it's nitpicking really.  The female announcer speaks in English with a Chinese accent but just says power on power off connected pairing it's nothing major and it's not as bad as some accents but I have heard some earphones use British English announcers before.  Oddly it also says TWS connected in a British accent.  It comes with the usual USB C charging cable and different size ear inserts.  All in all a great purchase for the price.
5,👍 estos auriculares tienen muy buena calidad de sonido.👍 En las especificaciones dice que cuenta con bluetooth 5.3 lo cual le da mucha mejor calidad de audio y más distancia de alcance para utilizarlos aparte la latencia no se percibe el sonido de un video o de un juego llega de inmediato al auricular.👍 Poseen ganchos para las orejas con una sujeción completa y perfecta muy cómodos.👍 Cada auricular posee dos micrófonos entre los dos auriculares serían cuatro micrófono lo cual nos da muy buena calidad para las llamadas y el ruido ambiental no le molesta a la persona con la cual mantenemos una conversación.👍 Son táctiles con todas las funciones de un auricular táctil para contestar y rechazar llamadas adelantar y retroceder canciones subir y bajar volumen y dando tres toques seguidos se puede invocar el asistente de voz bien para hacer una llamada para preguntar la temperatura o para enviar un mensaje de texto etcétera.👍 La caja de carga de esos auriculares poseen una pequeña pantalla frontal en donde nos indica cuánta batería nos queda para recargar los auriculares dice que alcanza para unas cinco cargas completas.👀 Yo utilizo estos auriculares para ver contenido audiovisual vídeos películas y hablar por teléfono al mismo tiempo y funcionan muy bien no hay distorsión de sonido no se entrecorta ni la llamada ni el audio del vídeo para mí tienen muy buena calidadlos utilizo también cuando voy por la calle a veces me pongo uno para escuchar noticias o a veces me pongo los dos para escuchar música también los utilizo cuando voy a trotar o monto en bicicleta para dar un paseo y todo correcto sin temor o peligro de que se me vayan a caer y los vaya a perder pues su gancho da muy buena sujeción a la oreja puedo decir que me gustan estos tipos de auriculares pues los suelo comprar muy a menudo y me gusta coleccionarlos.💯 Recomendables espero les haya podido ayudar con la decisión de comprarlos 🤗
5,I have tried these headphones every day for almost 1 month now and I am very happy with them.The headphones sit comfortably in the ear even when worn for a long time and falling out is prevented thanks to the temples.The fit is very good so even when jogging the Earbuds sit firmly and do not cause pain.Pairing worked flawlessly fast connection to the phone and runs even if the phone is in another room.Battery life is top had to charge it so far only onceWhat has excited me however was the sound quality which is very good.For the price is such a good quality!Very recommendable!!
5,I own few pairs of closed-back headphones with amazing quality but I needed a pair of buds because they feel lighter when running. Unfortunately for me the regular buds (like the Iphone or Samsung ones for example) always fall off of my years because of their strange shape :D So this type of headphones does the job for me and my strange shaped ears.1. Build and sound quality - the case and the headphones feel like a more expensive brand. If you expect the same sound quality as a 600 euro headpones - dont. I would rate it 8/10. Its still so much better than I expected2. Connectivity - it really stays connected to your phone even if you are 15 meters away from it3. Ease of use - there is a slight learning curve but you need an hour to get used to the touch controls and remember exactly what each tap does4.Comfort - the buds are so light that I forgot I have them on after a whileIts not the perfect set of headphones but its perfect to me. I would buy them again for me or as a gift for a friend
5,I purchased these headphones for the intention of listening to whilst walking and running. These blutooth budget headphones do exactly as intended thanks to the hook around sections that prohibit them falling off  and out of your ears.Blutooth connectivity to my mp3 player is simple as you just hold your finger on the left one to power on. you can skip tracks with just a quick tap on either the left or right ear bud and double tap to increase volume up and down. A female voice speaks to indicate if pairing and powering on and off. These work flawlessly with my mp3 radio player.I did try the buds with my smart tv and whilst watching a film there seems to be a slight lag and the sound does not match up to the lips of the actors although this could be because my tv is blutooth 5 and the buds are 5.3.They come inside a nice flip lid case that also acts as the charger along with three sets of ear inserts small medium large and the usb charging cable and instructions.Battery life is excellent.All in all for the money I have no complaints with these.
5,This gadget works as good as the other branded products out in the market. The packaging is very good and instruction manual comes in a printout rather than asking you to go online which is very handy. The case is nice and easy to fit in your pocket though slightly bigger than the regular ones and I suppose this is down to the sports band. They fit in very well to ears and the added advantage of coming with sports bad makes it secure not to fall accidentally. Pairing is very easy with long press and it appears on your phone to pair. The sound quality is very good and the drivers give good vivid sound. I have been using this over a week now and the charging is very good with one single charge lasting to 3 days with 5 hours minimum each day. Touch controls are very responsive and works as per the instructions on the manual. Early days but I think it is worth for what I have paid.
5,Excellent Bluetooth Earbuds and great value for money. I bought this type specifically for the extra security of the over-ear silicon earhooks feature along with the convenience of wireless connection.Using them mostly when out and about on my bicycle I find one Earbud suffices for the voice guidance of my bike Navigation App plus this leaves me more aurally alert of surrounding traffic conditions which just has to be better for safety in general. Also when cycling together with my wife who also has a pair of these Earbuds we can communicate via BT on our mobile phones (even when using just voice control) this feature we find is also a lot more convenient than might first seem apparent.Finally with regard to the musical capabilities of the earbuds they do offer very respectable sound quality when listening to my mobile's 'onboard' music library especially after having customised the EQ to my personal taste through my App of choice Poweramp.A definite Five Star product at this price in all areas.
5,I like these wireless earbuds very much. They fit comfortably and the sound is clear whether one is listening to music or an audiobook. I have used the earbuds with a PC a tablet and a mp3 player and it paired up with  each device smoothly. The flip case they came in is also an excellent charger. The earbuds fit my ears perfectly and stay put while I am walking my rather energetic dog or running.I have lost or damaged so many ear/head phones over the last couple years that I needed something that is robust comfortable has great sound quality and is good value for money. I have to say that these earbuds deliver on every level. And I think they will last more that a couple of months.
5,These are really good quality for the price. I've been having some problems with my Bose Soundsport bluetooth headphones so bought these to keep me going and I'm pretty impressed.I was out for around 2 hours and battery had only gone down around 25%The hooks keep these securely on your ears and the choice of buds is helpful depending on how much noise you want to let in. I have these for road running so I like to be able to hear some external noises but you can fit these tight in you ear so you don't get anything getting in.I've also found that the earbuds can fit on the same memory foam buds you can get for the Jaybird X3 headphones if you find them comfortable (which I do)Highly recommended
4,Je suis ravie de mon achat même s'il n'a pas pour vocation à m'accompagner durant une séance de sport. En revanche j'apprécie d'utiliser mes écouteurs sans fil dans mon lit lorsque je me repose en écoutant de la musique classique ou pour une séance de relaxation. Attention à être soigneux avec ce type d'écouteurs car les attaches qui viennent s'ajuster derrière les oreilles sont fragiles car très fines.
5,Ich habe mir diese Kopfhörer geholt damit ich beim Fahrrad fahren ein wenig Musik hören kann. Ich nutze es täglich wenn ich auf Arbeit fahre etwa 40 Minuten gesamt. Nach knapp einem Monat Nutzung muss es geladen werden. Ich denke das ist vollkommen okay. Von der Tonqualität her  habe ich nichts zu meckern. Vom Sitz lassen sie sich auch angenehm tragen man merkt sie kaum.Bisher bin ich sehr zufrieden und kann sie durchaus weiter empfehlen.
5,Love the comfort of these ear buds. I struggle with ear buds because I have small ear canal and most just fall out. These fit snug around the ear and stay put whilst running. The sound quality is very good was surprise for the price.Charge quickly it’s the case that charges them. I was going out the other day found they were dead popped them into the case and they were charged within a short time.The carry case isn’t too bulky so easy to carry around even on a run.I’ve not tried them in the rain yet but the say they are waterproof. Time will tellI’m very happy with them and the price is very reasonable for the quality you get. 👍🏻
5,Meine bisher genutzten „Ohrstöpsel“ waren technisch gut aber ich konnte nie sicher sein dass sie auch wirklich im Ohr bleiben. Schon sehr oft sind sie bei schnellen Bewegungen herausgefallen.Deshalb die Suche nach Alternativen die dieses Problem nicht haben.Diese Kopfhörer haben zusätzlich einen Bügel der über den Ohr sitzt und ein Herausfallen verhindert.Die Kopfhörer sind auch bei längerem Tragen noch bequem. Im Lieferumfang sind verschieden Gummiringe enthalten mit denen der Durchmesser entsprechend angepasst werden kann.Ich musste auch auf einen kleineren Durchmesser wechseln erst dann ist der Kopfhörer „richtig“ gesessen.Kopplung mit dem Smartphone war kein Problem. Mit der Reichweite war ich auch zufrieden.Der Klang ist gut wobei ich jetzt bei solchen Kopfhörern kein Konzertsaalerlebnis erwarte.Für den alltäglichen Gebrauch kann ich diese Marke empfehlen.
5,Quando sono arrivati la scatola in cui erano contenuti elencava le specifiche sul retro e ho subito capito che il tempo di riproduzione (come indicato nella descrizione di questo prodotto) è di 8 ore - molto più lungo dei miei vecchi auricolari! Quando ho aperto la scatola e disimballato la custodia in cui sono stati inseriti gli auricolari sono rimasta piacevolmente sorpresa dalla qualità della custodia rispetto a quasi tutti gli auricolari che ho posseduto; i contorni le luci che mostrano quando sono in carica la facilità con cui è possibile aprirla e chiuderla e alcuni altri piccoli dettagli che fanno capire bene la cura e l’attenzione posta a far si che questo sia un ottimo prodotto. Anche gli auricolari sono di alta qualità ben sagomati ed esteticamente gradevoli e l'icona dell'impronta digitale su ogni auricolare indica dove toccare per attivare le funzioni che sono ben spiegate nel manuale di istruzioni fornito nella confezione anche in questo caso la diffusione del suono è immacolata e l'accoppiamento del dispositivo è facile non ci vuole molto perché il dispositivo venga visualizzato sullo schermo e accoppiato. Il tempo di ricarica supera gli standard considerati ottimali e nel complesso questi auricolari sono una meraviglia e li consiglio vivamente.
5,I spent money 3x with different headphones to use at gym and running outside. For the first time I could find one that achieves what I need: good sound quality perfect fit in the ears (does not fall) and high level of battery life. It is a high standard headphone for a medium price. My evaluation is that is value for money and good purchasing. Easy to connect with mobile (I use Andtroid) and was very quick. It charges very quickly with the USB C and microphone for phone call works nicely no issues. I also liked the spare rubbers so I can choose in accordance with my size.
4,l’audio non è come nelle cuffie da centinaia d’euro ma per averle pagate 26€ grazie ad uno sconto fanno il loro sporco lavoro hanno lo schermetto che indica la percentuale di carica che fa figo una volta messe mentre fai qualsiasi movimento non cascheranno potranno essere tolte solo con le mani si sentono i bassi e a volume alto non si sente più i rumori esterni. consiglio l’acquisto.
5,J ai acheté ces écouteurs dans le but de pouvoir les utiliser lorsque je pars en running et il remplisse parfaitement leur rôle les écouteurs ne bougent pas une fois mis en place. Ils s apparaillent très facilement au téléphone. Le son est bon. Il n y a pas de parasite lorsque l on écoute de la musique ou que l on regarde un film.
5,I'm a London commuterand regularly work out at the gym. These earbuds are fantastic for my active lifestylebe that sprinting for my train oron the treadmill. They are amazingly comfatable due to the soft silicone materialthat wraps around the ears.The sound qualityon my phone is superb (Samsung a32 5g)alsothe noise cancelling performance in my opinionoutways some of the more expensive brands.Battery life IMO is goodbut this will depend on the individuals usage.I use the earbuds daily for 2 hours max at an estimateand power up every 48 hours as an estimate.
5,I am really impressed with the sound quality. As in all things if you pay more is it going to be better and having looked at other buds I decided to take a chance so glad I did.The ear piece is comfortable and comes with replacements.Easy to connect to WiFiOnly problem is I sing loud but can't hear myself takes me back to when you could listen to records in stores in a booth with headphones (Boots) before purchasing.Battery life I can't comment as not had to charge again not used every day.
5,Bought for my son who works out daily  he's used ear buds headphones but they either fall of or out and get covered in sweat he has now used these for two weeks straight and has not had a single problem he loves them the noise cancelling  is so good that when he's working with others he only wears one as he wouldn't hear what they were saying comfortable on the ears  highly recommended
4,Good battery life sits in/on ear perfectly...no popping out. Sometimes it seems like it disconnects but for like a split second. Sound quality is good but could be better. All in all I use mostly for to and from work and going to pick my child up. Some running is needed during these times and do the job.
5,Devo dire che sono sorpreso della qualità di queste cuffie. Hanno un ottimo suono e durante lo sport non cadono. Il tutto è gestito da brevi tocchi con un dito sulla parte esterna per rispondere alle chiamate o per regolare il volume ecc..Ho aspettato un po' prima di scrivere questa recensione per verificare la durata della batteria e anche in questo caso non mi hanno deluso.La confezione contiene anche due coppie di gommini auricolari di misura diversa.Le consiglio.
5,Ich benutze diese Kopfhörer für Videokonferenzen Filme zu sehen und Musik zu hören. Was soll ich sagen ich bin rundum zufrieden. Sowohl die Kapazität des Akkus als auch die Tonqualität haben mich positiv überrascht.
5,Cuffie perfette per la palestra  in quando si adattano perfettamente all'orecchio e quindi nessun pericolo di caduta . La qualità del suono è eccellente non delle migliori come quelle delle jbl  ma se si vuole un prodotto buono ed economico è perfetto . La batteria dura tanto non so di preciso ma sono più di due sett. Che vado in palestra e ancora non si è scaricata.
5,Excellent appareil. Les écouteurs tiennent parfaitement bien même en courant ou en sautant. Ils ne blessent pas les oreilles mais plaquent juste comme il faut. Même dans une pièce où la télé fonctionne j'entends ma musique quand je fais ma gym. L'utilisation est très facile pour stopper le son ou pour changer de piste en avançant ou en reculant ou bien pour augmenter ou baisser le son: une pression variable sur l'oreillette droite ou gauche en fonction de qu'on souhaite et c'est fait! La batterie tient longtemps! Je recommande!
5,J'utilise ces écouteurs à la maison pour la musique ou regarder une série sans déranger mais surtout quand je fais du sport en salle notamment de la course sur tapis. La connexion est rapide avec les machines du club et les écouteurs tiennent bien alors que je suis en mouvement
5,I was looking for quality Earbuds and finally decided to go for this store . I was amazed by the quality of sound while speaking or hearing. Even I tried it from almost 50  sq feet and it was working perfectly. I choose black colour and it arrived in one day. The price was also reasonable as i got some discount too . I like the product and will buy again for my friends and family
5,Compré los auriculares porque me gustaban estéticamente y buscaba que fueran deportivos. Tras aproximadamente una semama de uso y 5 sesiones de entrenamiento os dejo mis impresiones. La sujeción del auricular es buena no he tenido que usar ninguno de los adaptadores que incluye con el que venía se adapta a mi oído. La cancelación de ruido funciona parecido a ponerse unos tapones para los oídos oyes el fondo pero bastante amortiguado si pausas la música aún te cuesta hablar con la gente porque les oyes bajito. Esto me parece estupendo porque puedo oír mis podcast sin subir demasiado el volumen y apenas escucho la horrible música que ponen en mi gimnasio. El sonido diría que es aceptable los uso para podcast los matices no me son tan relevantes. Como pega el manejo táctil más allá del pause/reproducción que van bien no llego a controlarlo bien. También puede ser que sea torpe nunca he tenido unos cascos con interfaz táctil. Espero que os sea útil. ¡Saludos!
5,Très bons écouteurs sportifs très stables aux oreilles. La qualité du son est au top. Enfin le produit a un très bon rapport qualité prix je ne regrette pas mon achat et je ne peux que vous les conseiller.
5,Die Kopfhörer passen gut und drücken nicht hinterm Ohr.Der Klang ist für den Preis sehr gut.Das Aufbewahrungsetui zeigt den Akkustand an was sehr hilfreich ist.Ich kann dieses Produkt nur empfehlen
5,Ich habe mir die Kopfhörer letzte Woche gekauft und meine Erwartungen wurden bisher erfüllt.-Koppelung funktioniert gut/einfach.- Kopfhörer sitzen bequem im Ohr bzw. können bei Bedarf individuell angepasst werden.- Touchfunktion ist sehr praktisch.- Akkulaufzeit für alltäglichen Gebrauch absolut ausreichend.- Tonqualität ist bei dem Preis ebenfalls ganz passabel.Wer also auf der Suche nach günstigen Kopfhörern mit einer soliden Qualität für alltäglichen Gebrauch ist ist hier richtig…
5,Die Bluetooth Kopfhörer sind überraschend gut. Die Tonqualität ist top. Die Reichweite ist super.Der trage Komfort ist sehr angenehm. Und sie halten auch sehr gut beim Arbeiten.Ich bin begeistert 👍😊
5,Great headphones. Bought 2 pairs 1 for my wife and me. Sound quality is really good connects to our phones easily and has a decent range. Comes with 3 ear inserts so can choose the right fit feel really comfortable and don't feel like they will fall out due to the over ear design. Case is small and charges the headphones easily they sit in well and click into place with a satisfying snap from the magnetics.
5,Was soll man sagen...Kopfhörer werden im Etui immer direkt geladen wenn man sie nicht nutzt ubd man hat somit immer geladene Kopfhörer dabei. Das Display zeigt den Ladezustand an.Klang ist für den Preis finde ich ordentlich für den normalen Gebrauch.Durch die Bügel auch beim Sport zu verwenden ohne das sie aus dem Ohr fallen.
5,Bought these to go on holiday as I didn't want to be tangled up in wires on the plane!Really happy with the physical quality and especially the sound quality. They're noise cancelling and really comfortable to wear. They hold the charge really well I've used them for a while now and don't think they've dropped below 50% battery.
5,Sono rimasta sorpresa dal fatto che x essere cuffie di fascia economiche il suono si così limpido e profondo allo stesso tempo. Si collegano immediatamente e anche il suono durante le chiamate non è mai disturbato. Ho lasciato il telefono dall'altro lato della casa (circa 12 metri lineari) e prende bene lo stesso. La batteria sembra buona ma ancora non ho testato la massima durata. Molto soddisfatta
5,I bought this as a replacement for my old gym headset. Didn't expected too much but Ithey are good. Decent sound with above average but bass  boost ia nor very good.

È ergonomico e leggero e si adatta bene a tutti i tipi di padiglioni dato che le usa anche mia moglie...facilmente configurabile hai sempre sott'occhio la carica del singolo auricolare grazie alla lettura sul display di essa. Il cofanetto è abbastanza robusto e relativamente piccolino così da tenerlo con se anche in una pochette. Ottimo prodotto
4,Pour faire mon ménage du son correct au vue du prix j'en suis contente.
5,Mentre mia moglie guarda i suoi programmi TV uso gli auricolari per vedere video YouTube  sono comodi  estremamente funzionali con ottimo volume e qualità di riproduzione  ce ne saranno sicuramente di migliori però qui si tratta di rapporto qualità prezzo ed io ne sono molto soddisfatto......
5,Very good for listening to tunes whilst working out. Brilliant noice cancellation and has never fallen out of my ears. The sound quality is also superb and the battery lasts a very long time. Great product.
5,salve ho acquistato queste cuffie con una certa curiosità  soprattutto per il loro formato( non ho mai avuto cuffie con supporti per l'orecchio pensando che mi potevano dare fastidio).Ma devo assolutamente ricredermi le cuffie si adattano molto bene al mio padiglione  hanno una qualità del veramente buona  la musica viene riprodotta con un audio eccellente con un solo tocco puoi fermare la riproduzione della musica mentre fai attività fisica. insomma chi cerca cuffie bluetooth per sia ascoltare musica solo per svago che per ascoltare musica facendo attività fisica queste sono perfette.
5,Ich bin sehr zufrieden mit diesem Kopfhörer. Die Bluetooth-Verbindung ist einfach. Besonders der Akku ich habe ihn auf dem Flug nach Thailand die ganze Zeit benutzt über 10 Stunden aber er hat nur weniger als 50% des Akkus verbraucht. Sehr zu empfehlen!
5,Best quality you can get for this price. Touch operation is very handy and intuitive. Would buy it again!
5,Ich bin sehr begeistert von den Kopfhörern.Bestellt hatte ich sie mir vorrangig um beim Sport nebenbei Musik hören zu können.Dort erfüllen sie ihren Zweck voll und ganz. Die Passform ist sehr gut so dass auch bei Bewegung die Earbuds fest sitzen und keine Schmerzen verursachen.Das Pairen per Bluetooth ging sehr einfach.Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis finde ich bei diesem Produkt hervorragend. Die Earbuds stehen teuereren Produkten in kaum einem Punkt nach.Die Klangqualität ist sehr zufriedenstellend.Von mir daher 5 Sterne!
5,Ottimo prodotto! Leggero e pratico! Consigliato per chi fa sport e/o passeggia tanto. Suoni perfetti comode da usare isolano bene dal mondo esterno e sono molto facili da utilizzare! Comode anche per chi indossa occhiali da sole o da vista! Batteria duratura molto facili da ricaricare e dotate di un cavo carica USB pratico e facile da utilizzare. Inoltre nella confezione sono presenti adattatori per orecchie di diverse dimensioni.Consiglio vivamente l’acquisto di questo prodotto! Compatibile con android iPhone e tutte le tipologie di dispositivo. Io lo utilizzo con iPhone e sono rimasta davvero molto soddisfatta!
5,Ton ist top besser als meine Vorgänger. Sitzen gut beim Sport und verrutschen nicht. Bin sehr zufrieden auch was die Akkulaufzeit betrifft.
5,C'est mon 2e achat pour mes enfants  les 2 pour faire du sportIls sont ravis excellent rapport qualité prixLe son est parfait
5,No need to buy expensive equivalents. Easy to set up. Really good sound quality.Connects fine to my Mii2 phone and my Dell laptop.One very minor note: occasional (very brief) loss of audio in one ear when walking around outdoors using phone. But no audio is missed.Haven't really needed to test battery life but haven't noticed anything of concern.Really good value.
5,I bought these headphones to replace a pair i had purchased recently as they didn't have great sound quality. Sound quality on these earphones is so much better also they are exceptionally comfortable to wear. Very pleased with this purchase foe the price I paid!
5,Fit well. Recent purchase so cannot comment on how long they last. Up to now very pleased with them. I don't run but enjoy listening to audio books whilst out walking
5,I loved the comfortable fit the sound is good.  I have noticed the connection can glitch occasionally when I walk on the beach I’m not sure why (Which is why it loses a star on its rating) but other than that it’s ticking all my boxes.Takes a bit of getting used to the sensitive touch controls but would recommend them to anyone
5,Der Kopfhörer fühlen sich sehr angenehmen beim Tragen. Die Qualität der Musik ist auch sehr gut für den Preis des Kopfhörers. Was mir besonders gut gefallen ist ist die Akku die für lange Zeit hält. Die Bluetooth-Verbindung bricht nicht ab obwohl man 10m weg geht. Case des Köpfhörers ist sehr kompakt und leicht zu öffnen.
5,Habe mir die Kopfhörer fürs Joggen und im Fitnessstudio gekauft. Unter meinen vorherigen Over-Ear Kopfhörern war es unangenehm wegen des Schweißes.Der Klang geht in der Preisklasse absolut klar. Der Akku hält was er verspricht und der Tragekomfort ist gegeben. Auch bei ruckartigen Bewegungen sorgen die Bügel für guten Halt der Kopfhörer. Im Paket enthalten sind 3 verschiedene Größen der Gummilaschen für kleinere bzw. größere Ohren. Ein Aufladekabel ist natürlich auch dabei. Bin insgesamt zufrieden.
5,Endlich wirklich In-Ear die halten was sie versprechen.Kann ich uneingeschränkt weiter empfehlen.Bin super happy mit diesen Kopfhörern Danke.
4,Impossible de passer d'une chanson à l'autre...
5,Was looking around for a pair to replace some old headphones I'd been using for years. I must admit I was a little sceptical in regards to the "price to quality". I was pleasantly suprised. Will grab a spare pair soon!
5,Écouteurs de très bonne qualité. Tiennent bien dans l'oreille. Charge rapide et longue durée de la batterie. Je recommande à 100%
5,Commandés pour écouter de la musique en faisant de la course à pied. Les écouteurs tiennent bien en place le son est bon pas de problème de connexion.
5,These ear buds arrived quickly and on time. I really struggle to keep buds in and find them uncomfortable. The over ear clip is comfortable and discreet and do not fall out while running. The sound is good for the price. Charge easily and last a long time. I would recommend for anyone who is looking for a cheap set doing activities.
5,Delivered as expected on time very comfortable to wear headphones with an outside the ear retaining clip. The touch functions on the earpieces are convenient and work well. I would have preferred slightly more bass in the sound (this will likely improve as the earpieces bed-in after some hours of use). Overall the sound quality is very good and clear. Highly recommended.
5,L'articolo rispetta la descrizione e le alternative. È ergonomico e leggero e si adatta bene a tutti i tipi di padiglioni dato che le usa anche mia moglie...facilmente configurabile hai sempre sott'occhio la carica del singolo auricolare grazie alla lettura sul display di essa. Il cofanetto è abbastanza robusto e relativamente piccolino così da tenerlo con se anche in una pochette. Ottimo prodotto

4,Buona qualità del suono.Buon rapporto qualitá prezzo.Batterie scarse
5,Bought these for myself and as gifts for family members not too long ago! They are easy to use the sound is really good and they were not too pricy! Very happy with my purchase so far!

5,Ich liebe diese Kopfhörer.  Sie sind sehr nützlich.  Sie können in dieser Zeit telefonieren und arbeiten.  Der Klang ist klar sie halten gut an den Ohren.
5,Comprati per sostituire un altro che avevo che si sono rotti dopo 6 mesi non sentendosi più ad un lato.Questi mi hanno colpito rispetto ai atri per un suono pulito  mentre quell'altro era cupo.Per ora ok.
5,Great sound quality and long battery. Plays for about 10 hours and recharges really quickly.The earphones have loops to go over your ears and these give a great secure and comfortable fit (see picture).
4,Je les utilise pour le sport je trouve les touches un peu trop sensible quand je repositionne les oreillettes
4,Llevo pocos días usándolosY todo muy bien sonido comodidad incluso cuando me tengo que poner las gafasSin sonido parece que ni los llevas puestosPor el precio que tienen no se puede pedir másA ver lo que duran en éste estadoNo le doy cinco estrellas por la cajaAl adaptar la goma a tus orejas cuando los metes en ella no llega a cerrar del todo bien y esto puede hacer que no se carguen correctamenteSolución un pequeña goma elástica y perfecto
5,Cuffie auricolari bluetooth wireless con comodo archetto per una ottimale indossabilità dei dispositivi in molteplici contesti che siano sportivi di relax al lavoro ecc. Il suono è pulito sia negli alti che nei bassi. Molto comodo il cofanetto per ricaricare le cuffie indispensabile il display che indica la percentuale di batteria questo ultimo non presente in dispositivi più blasonati. La spedizione con Prime è rapidissima il venditore serio e professionale rapporto qualità - prezzo ottimo.
4,Sono fissati bene alle orecchie e quindi difficile perderli.
5,Preis/Leistung passt. Was nicht so schön ist sind die Ton Aussetzer.
5,Très agréable. J'avais beaucoup de mal à supporter d'autres écouteurs et ceux-ci sont top.
5,Super gut. Bin sehr zufrieden!
5,Easy to set up does what they are supposed to do. Use for listening to music andaking and receiving calls.
5,Le ho acquistate come regalo per mia mamma che aveva rotto le sue e si sta trovando benissimo e quasi una settimana che le usa ed è molto soddisfatta. Hanno una durata di carica elevata grazie anche alla custodia che le ricarica di volta in volta quando le posa poi hanno un buon suono e un ottimo collegamento che copre anche spazi distanti ad esempio mia mamma le usa a lavoro e nell'andare in stanza diverse non perde la connessione. Quindi considerando anche il prezzo devo dire che è stato un buon acquisto
5,Funktionieren ausgezeichnet schnelle Verbindung und top Tonqualität. Bin sehr zufrieden und kann diese Kopfhörer nur weiter empfehlen..
5,Ich habe mir die Kopfhörer geholt  weil ich vorher andere hatte und diese vom Sound und der Akku Laufzeit nicht so gut waren.Diese Kopfhörer haben für den Preis einen guten Sound  mit guten Bass. Bei anderen Kopfhörer in der Preis Kategorie war der Sound nicht so gut. Die Akku Laufzeit passt auch mit der angegebenen Zeit. Ich kann Kopfhörer für den Preis echt empfehlen. Denke das ich für  meinen Sohn die gleichen noch einmal hole.
5,Arrivate nei tempi previsti. Design gradevole e accattivante. Ottima resa del suono e durata della batteria nella norma. Ottimi per chi desidera un prodotto di buona qualità senza troppe pretese. PRO: Resa audio e Bluetooth 5.3 CONTRO: Per ora nessuno
5,Habe die Kopfhörer für meinen Neffen gekauft und es findet sie Klasse.
5,I like the the sound evnn though the ear hold is not entirely comfortable but doesn't take fom the rating in my opinion. It's overall very cool.
5,Love these headphones... they fit perfectly so are really comfortable to wearthey're easy to use and the battery life is great. I love the fact they charge when int he case. I can hear very clearly what's coming through the headphones even with workshop noise around me..
4,Idéal pour un cadeau il a bien plu bonne qualité de son Bon maintien se connecte facilement.  Prix attractif. Je recommande.
5,I was pretty skeptical buying these as they were cheaper than what I normally go for but honestly don’t let that put you off. They’re so comfy around the ear it’s like they’re hardly even there and the sound quality definitely beats my old Samsung Buds. Would highly recommend these headphones for anyone who works out too as they’ve not fallen out or off once at the gym.10/10
5,Très bon son discret idéal pour le sport et ne fait pas mal à l'oreille je recommande
5,Buona qualità del suono per audio normali come può essere uno streaming YouTube o un classico MP3 durata della batteria in linea con altri prodotti mi ha sorpreso la velocità di ricarica della singola cuffietta
5,Premettendo che sono abbastanza difficile da accontentare con gli earpods perché colpa della conformazione del mio orecchio mi si tolgono al primo movimento ho voluto provare questi auricolari che hanno il gancetto per aderire al padiglione. Ebbene finalmente ho trovato un prodotto adatto alle mie esigenze. Restano in posizione anche se si fanno movimenti la qualità del suono ed il volume sono buoni e l'avvio è a prova di bambino. Anche la durata della batteria sembra per ora accettabile.
5,Tonqualität ist gut Übersetzung geht so für den Preis zu empfehlen
5,Die Kopfhöhrer sind absolut Klasse. Sie werden in einer kleinen handlichen Box mitgeliefert. Die Box wiederum zeigt den Akkustand an.  Ich benutze Sie um beim Laufen auf dem Laufband mit meiner Lieblingsmusik in Stimmung zu kommen. Dabei liefern sie ordentlich  Basseinen guten Klang und auch Höhen sind vernehmbar. Für ein kleines Geöd bekommt man hier wirklich sehr gute Sport Kopfhöhrer die absolut zu empfehlen sind.Ich würde sie jederzeit wiederkaufen und habe auch schon meiner Freundin ein Paar dieser Kopfhöhrer geschenkt.AAbsolute Kaufempfehlung!
5,I am amazed at the quality of these headphones. look amazing a great case great price such great sounds and easy to control. Love love love them
5,Ho aspettato un po a fare la recensione perché prima volevo provarli... Ottimo acquisto si sentono benissimo la batteria non si scarica facilmente qe aderiscono bene all'orecchio. Pienamente soddisfatta!!!
5,I am satisfied!
5,excellent article très bon rapport qualité prix vraîment dans l'attente de mes espèrances à bientôt !
5,Wife really likes them and has been on many workouts with them. They fit securely and the sound quality is top notch. Battery life is more than she ever needs as she charges them each night. Would highly recommend.
5,Los auriculares son de buena calidad con silicona haciendo con ello que sean muy confortables para los oidos y además los ganchos que van a las orejas hacen que no se puedan caer estés haciendo lo que sea.El emparejamiento con el telefono es instantaneo. Pero lo más importante es el sonido  teniendo buena combinación de graves y agudas al igual que las voces muy claras.<en la parte frontal lleva una pantalla LED que nos muestra el estado de carga de la caja de los auriculares como la carga de loa uriculares.la batería es myt potente en duración y son muy cómodos de llevar la caja de carga en cualquier bolsillo.
5,Cuffie piccole e comode. Si sentono benissimo e sono già sette giorni che le uso e ancora non ho dovuto ricaricarle. Touch molto efficace e con buona sensibilità. Nel complesso buone cuffie. Ottimo anche il display che ti dice quanta carica residua c’è ancora nella box di ricarica.Qualità prezzo ottima.
5,I've actually had no luck with earbuds etc. Just wouldn't stay in or found uncomfortable. My Son suggested these and I couldn't be happier. Perfect for me great price and excellent quality.
5,globalement un bon produit par sa qualité de son au par sont temps d'utilisation

5,Buena calidad se escuchan con muy sonido. La verdad que me han sorprendido gratamente. Voy a pedir unos mas para mi pareja despues de haberlos probado. Son muy comodos para hacer deportes ya que se adaptan estupendamente y no tienes que preocuparte de que se caigan gracias a su sujeccion por detras de la oreja. Viene en su caja muy bien empaquetado e incluye diferentes gomas para segun el tamaño de tu oido y tambien incluye cable tipo c para cargarlos. El pedido llegó en la fecha estimada. Buen producto

5,Bon produit RAS je recommande pas chère confortable excellent son foncé sans hésitez !!
5,Heel erg goede oortjes.Levering was zeer snel en het pakketje was goed verpakt dus het kwam niet beschadigd aan of iets.De oortjes blijven goed in je oor zitten het is een heel mooi design voor tijdens het sporten of werken.

5,Satisfaite de ces écouteurs son excellent connection facile et agréable à mettre.

5,These earbuds are excellent. Taken them out of the box they paired instantly to my iPhone and the sound quality is great. They are very comfortable on the ears. I also find the case high quality and useful to check the battery level. So good that my wife now said she would like a pair as well!
5,I had well known brands before buying these. Am what a powerful punch they pull music sounds so good and the bass is incredible. Very comfortable around the ears. Perfect for all my needs.
5,Great sound...Great comfort. Wore these on a 6 hour bike ride and felt like I didn't have them on. Calls came in noise cancelling worked its magic
5,Einfache Bedienung funktioniert wirklich gut super komfort  . Die Kopfhörer sitzen fest und haben eine gute Tonqualität . Ich bin sehr zufrieden.
5,Queste cuffie si prestano molto bene quando ci si vuole isolare dall'ambiente circostante data la loro capacità di insonorizzazione. Consiglio l'acquisto principalmente a chi ascolta musica house o techno o comunque con molti bassi in modo da poterle sfruttare a pieno poiché con altri tipi di musica performano comunque bene ma non allo stesso modo. Molto comodo il display che indica la carica di entrambe le cuffiette e la custodia esteticamente a me è piaciuta molto. Packaging molto curato
4,Llevo sólo 1 día con ellos. Los compré pq los otros no tenían el adaptador para la oreja y se me caían mucho. En ese sentido son geniales xq obviamente no se caen pero me daba miedo q tal vwz fuera incomodo o hiciera daño... Para nada ni noto lo q los tengo puestos. En cuanto al sonido no son los mejores pero cumplen su función.*** Actualizo la reseña ***Los he tenido que devolver pq aunq no se oía muy bien podría pasar. Pero no me oían a mí. Me oían con mucho ruido.
5,Migliori delle aspettative queste cuffie sport wireless sono state un regalo molto gradito dal mio compagno che aveva bisogno di cuffie per fare sport. Design nero opaco molto accattivante nelle foto dell'articolo si vede che l'archetto è molto sottile pensavo potesse essere un inconveniente ma mi sono ricreduta l'archetto è sottile e abbastanza piccolo il che rende le cuffie sia comode che molto stabili rispetto anche ad altre cuffie avute in precedenza queste cuffie non sono soggette a spostamenti durante l'allenamento. Il touch funziona bene audio buono. Un'altra nota positiva è il case delle cuffie che è anche la sua powerbank è rettangolare e sottile il che lo rende veramente comodo anche per chi lo vuole trasportare in tasca oppure in un piccolo marsupio. Rapporto qualità/prezzo veramente positivo. Se vi è stata utile questa recensione cliccate qui in basso :)
5,Benutze sie beim Sport und bin super Zufrieden
5,Parfait pour l’utilisation sport en salle. Je recommande ce produit
5,Great. Comfortable fit. Lasts almost 3 days without charging and each use lasts at least 10 hours before putting back into the case to recharge. Great and would definitely recommend.

5,These are the best wireless headphones great for the gym and only charged them twice since I brought two weeks ago. Very clear sound and great connectivity.
5,Ottime. Ottimo suono. Si collegano facilmente e con la pioggia non danno problemi. Unico dubbio: nonostante le cariche e gli utilizzi anche dopo due settimane la % di carica sul display frontale non si sposta dal 79 ( esattamente la condizione trovata quando è arrivato il prodotto imballato. Qualcuno sa cortesemente darmi spiegazioni? Ringrazio anticipatamente
5,Super Qualität toller Sound und einfach zu bedienen kann ich nur weiterempfehlen bin sehr zufrieden

5,Me han encantado estos auriculares inalámbricos se adaptan a la perfección y no se caen ando con ellos a paso ligero y no se mueven puedes escuchar música o recibir una llamada y la claridad es inmejorable me han sorprendido gratamente pues tenía otros y no me funcionaban muy bien pero a éstos no le he encontrado ninguna pega tiene una pantalla donde te pone la batería que te queda y se conectan automáticamente en cuanto lo sacas de su estuche no como otros que tardas un montón en poder conectarlos simplemente los sacas de la caja y listo.

5,Me han sorprendido gratamente es la primera vez que uso auriculares Bluetooth y la verdad es que no esperaba gran cosa pero debo decir que me ha sorprendido lo bien que se escuchan para su precio obviamente no esperes sonido de estudio pero está más que bien para el uso que yo quería darles que era el gimnasio y este punto para mi era imprescindible y es que fueran cómodos y se sujetasen bien durante el ejercicio muy contento con la compra.

5,Avevo già un paio di cuffie bluetooth ho acquistato queste perché si agganciano in modo migliore all'orecchio e hanno uno standard bluetooth più recente mi sono trovato bene durante la corsaha i comandi touch direttamente sulla parte superiore la pratica scatola dove caricare le cuffie è comoda da portare in giro e dura per diverse ricariche ve le consiglio se come me avete bisogno di cuffiette da utilizzare durante lo sport

5,Per averle pagate il loro costo queste cuffie sono perfette. Quando vado ad allenarmi o a correre non ho mai incontrato nessuna difficoltà ad usarle e non hanno mai avuto nessun problema. Hanno dei buoni bassi e il suono si sente molto bene e sono MOLTO comode anche la batteria ha una lunga durata e poi con il loro case(contenitore) si ricaricano più volte.CONSIGLIATE VIVAMENTE.

5,Ya llevo una semana con ellos mi unico objetivo era usarlos para salir a correr ahora que ha bajado la temperatura. Necesitaba unos cascos que agarraran bien y comodos. Eso lo consigue llevo 5 dias con ellos y no se me han caido al salir a correr.El audio se escucha muy bien e incluso he contestado llamadas mientras hacia deporte y genial! Estoy bastante contento con ellos.Sobre la conexion y la instalacion es super rapido y facil. Recomiendo los cascos.

3,When they are working they are fine sound quality is really good for the spec and price only thing is when you walk along in the street the sound drops out and back in when you turn your head. Have kept my phone on the left hand side like it states but it happens. Will give them a chance but if it doesn't stop back they will go. They are comfortable I haven't had them long so battery life I can't comment on.
5,Son muy comodos de usar y la bateria dura mucho aún no he tenido que cargarlos
5,Great value for money
5,He comprado dos unidades y estoy encantada
5,Ottimi
5,Es un productazo. Tenía antes unos similares pero se me caían de vez en cuando. En cambio estos al tener la goma negra que te envuelve la oreja son bastante fiables en cuanto al movimiento.Tienen muy buen sonido y es una de las mejores compras que he hecho en cuanto a auriculares. Recomendables
5,Compré estos auriculares para sustituir unos que usaba en el gimnasio. Perfecta compra. Son muy cómodos (más pequeños que los usados anteriormente pero se ajustan a la perfección a la oreja) con muy buena calidad de sonido y la batería dura bastante (llevo 3 días usándolos unas 8 horas en total y tienen aún batería de sobra).
5,su sonido es  bueno..
5,De los mejores cascos que he comprado
5,Écouteurs qui tiennent bien en place pendant la course. Le son est bon également. Le petit plus la boîte est relativement petite et plus pratique que les précédents.
5,Se escuchan genial! La batería dura mucho y son muy cómodos

5,Bonne tenue  très bonne autonomie
5,Hera para un regalo la persona que los ha recibido dice estar muy satisfecha con su uso.
5,All good
5,Muy cómodos en el gimnasio. Buen aislamiento de ruido exterior. Conectan muy bien con iPhone (incluso marca la batería). Pequeños cómodos de llevar.
5,Calidad de sonido espectacular para el precio que tiene y tan cómodo que no parece no que los lleves puestos
5,Buena calidad de sonido y muy comodos. El estuche es mucho mas pequeño y comodo de transportar que otros que he tenido.
2,I was happy with the sound quality of my existing ear buds which  I bought from Amazon two years ago. They had good bass and clarity of sound in the mid/high frequency. However I go regularly to the gym and when active the ear buds often lose its snug fit and hence a deterioration in sound quality. So I decided to purchase this pair with ear hooks and thought the problem would be solved.Unfortunately the overall design of this new pair did not secure the ear bud snugly into my ear especially the left ear and hence a huge loss in bass unless I held it in place with my finger. In addition I felt the sound quality in the mid/high frequency was not good – lack of clarity and a bit ‘dead’. With these two deficiencies I felt that I couldn’t really live with them and returned them for a refund.
5,Era lo que me esperaba
5,Sonido perfecto lo compre para llevarlos como bluetooth y cumplen su función a la perfección recomendable 100%
5,Se escuchan muy bien y con mucha potencia. Son muy cómodos. Tienen batería externa y dura mucho!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Super für die Preis
5,Se escuchan adecuadamente son algo incómodos cuando los llevas un rato puestos pero de sonido están bién.
3,The product is comfortable and sound clear but lacks bass.
3,Tienen buen sonido y de batería duran bastante. Se emparejan facilmente aunque a veces pierden ambos la señal aún llevando cerca el móvil.El sistema digital es complicado para subir o bajar volumen yo no lo he conseguido...Las llamadas se oyen y te escuchan bien.Se sujetan perfectamente al oído y es importante elegir bien el tamaño de las almohadillas para sujeción y calidad de sonido.Con las más grandes tiene problemas de carga al no encajar bien con los conectores y quedar la tapa un poco abierta.
3,Ho trovato che gli anelli che vanno dietro le orecchie siano un poco piccoli però sono morbidi il suono è un poco ovattato (non ascolto musica ma podcast vocali) trovo anche che il touch sugli auricolari sia troppo sensibile basta uno sfioramento involontario e cambia brano personalmente preferisco il classico pulsante utile il monitor della ricarica
3,Para hacer ejercicio no son especialmente cómodos se descolocan sin llegar a salirse. El sonido es regular con potencia justa cuando los pones en pausa se pecan o deja de sonar uno de ellos o directamente uno suena más alto que otro
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Ottimo acquisto funzionno benissimo e sono intuitive
3,Devo essere sincera ad esser belli lo erano non so se e capitato a me ma andava a volte a intermittenza  wuindi audio cera poi andava  sicuramente  per il prezzo che ho pagato non e la gamma dei top  unatra cosa che non mi e piuaciuto  che non isolava i rumori esterni   conclusione anche no
3,Aigus métalliquesAbsence de plans sonoresBasses étouffées
2,They were comfortable to wear but often when I moved my head from side to side the left earbud would cut out intermittently making it very difficult to listen to anything in a pleasant manner.  I tried resetting  the buds. It it kept occurring. Returned the earbuds.
3,Aceptable relación calidad precio
3,El sonido un poco escaso
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Pour mon téléphone
2,Had to take them off and use my actual phone they're pretty low in volume. If u accidentally touch them the whole thing disconnects. Better off spending the extra
1,Io non so che cultura musicale e sonora hanno coloro che dicono che ste cuffiette suonano bene per quanto mi riguarda ci ho sentito tre minuti di canzone (Ariana Grande concerto alla Casa Bianca I have nothing) e devo dire che il suono è ORRIBILE. Solo medie frequenze bassi inesistenti alti strusciati. Gli acuti di Ariana mi trapanavano i timpani e l'orchestra spariva non si sentivano gli strumenti. Provato con due telefoni diversi e con il PC. Reimpacchettato il tutto e chieso il reso. La cosa che mi lascia piu sconcertato è che da oggi non posso nemmeno piu fidarmi dei commenti utente. Questa è la seconda coppia di cuffie che compro e poi restituisco perchè suonano male nonostante i commenti dicano il contrario. Potrei essere io ad avere problemi di udito perchè no ma come mai le mie Sennheiser HD202 col filo comunque economiche suonano da paura?
2,Personne qui fait du sport  on entend les bruits de fond n’a pas beaucoup d’autonomie je vraiment déçu par ce produit le 1 acheté ce n’était pas le même était beaucoup mieux
2,El plástico que agarra la oreja es muy molesto y al cabo de un rato te duelen las orejas el sonido no está mal pero los he visto mejores por el mismo precio
2,Cuffie utilizzate durante le uscite di running. Per ascoltare la musica ok ma con le chiamate non funzionano... Parte infatti un ronzio (sembra quasi un'interferenza) che rende impossibile l'utilizzo delle cuffie. Questo dopo una sola settimana di utilizzo... Pessime
2,Manque de basses.. son un peut trop type transistor.
1,Moi aussi je ne comprends la proportion de commentaires élogieux sur ce produit ! C'est cheap d'une fragilité incroyable ça tient assez mal aux oreilles le son est proprement dégueulasse. le coffret peu pratique. On sent que c'est fait pour durer quelques semaines ou quelques mois. Du jetable tout simplement ! Je me référais souvent aux notes et commentaires pour faire mes choix je ferai attention pour mes prochains achats.
2,Sono deluso perché oltre a sentire male le telefonate a volte funziona solo un dispositivo e non esiste l'annullamento del disturbo.
1,I bought this on the strength of the reviews BUT they pay for reviews after purchase - via a post card in the post. ( which doesn't work and shows a dead email address ) they seem ok bit must say am annoyed by this.
2,C'è un notevole ritardo audio con la TV che non riesco a normalizzare.Suggerimenti?
1,(Edit: Nach kurzer Zeit wackelkontakt und wackler am Ohr)Uns hat das Produkt echt überzeugt obwohl es sehr günstig ist. Die Qualität ist super. Die Verarbeitung und das Optische ist besser als erwartet. Passt perfekt in mein Ohr ohne zu wackeln. Es sitzt fest und die Klangqualität ist genau für jede Musik passend geregelt.
2,Bassi e volume per nulla buoni! Qualità del suono scarsa! Tanto costano così valgono!Deluso...
1,These are rubbish...sounds like the music is in a tin...bass what bass...I am very disappointed in these...over priced even with the discount...just buy a decent brand.. don't waste your money....
1,No bass whatsoever never mind "deep".  I used to trust the "Amazon's Choice" sticker but these buds are terrible.  Waste of money... Avoid
1,Pas pratique du tout au niveau du tactile. La notice en français est de piètre qualité. Produit bas de gamme made in china.
1,Flickers between playing and not playing on right side quite disorientating. Very disappointed as I was excited for this product!! Would not recommend
1,Only one bud works despite charging up and pairing.  Instructions are a bad translation and parts make very little sense
1,Don't know if the particular item was defective but the sound out of both buds was extremely poor. Returned immediately.
1,Over all there are much better buds out there for the money.
1,The sound is really muddy ok for podcasts etc  but horrible for listening to music
1,Not bad for the price £20
1,Prodotto non provato perché il cofanetto carica batteria non funzionavaHo messo una sola stellina nell’impossibilità di provarlo.Ho fatto un reso e aspetto il rimborso (un po’ lungo per gli standard Amazon) per acquistare una cuffia a trasmissione ossea.Speriamo in bene.
1,Son cómodos buen sonido estéreo pero para jugar no sirven porque tienen un retardo importante para el ejercicio deve ser en un espacio abierto ya que si hay paredes por medio como en casa se entrecorta la música al realizar cualquier movimiento  no los recomiendo.
1,No se aguanta bien he comprado en los chinos auriculares que ciñen mucho mejor a la oreja no se oye lo tengas conectado con lo que lo conectes el sonido es ridículamente bajo se caen de la oreja ante cualquier gesto brusco por leve que sea.
1,Prodotto non corrispondente assolutamente alle aspettative suono metallico scarsa ricezione.
1,sehr schlechte Tonqualität
1,Muy poco volumen en la calle no se oía absolutamente nada y a mí me duelen los oídos con ellos los he tenido que devolver. No recomiendo
1,No se escucha bien  son muy bonitos pero la calidad del audio es orible !
1,Se apagan solos.
2,Grundlegend sind die Hörer schon gut dem Bass geb ich auch die Note 1-2 (hab mehrere Probe gehört und er überzeugt für das Geld )Meine alten Power Q20 Pro haben aber gegenüber den I21 einen füllenderen Bass.Die i27 haben sogut wie keinen Bass und meine Neuen Soundcore Sport x10 haben mich am Ende überzeugt auch wenn se vom Preis her weit aus teurer sind.
4,Very comfy to wear have no issues with them when working out. Very ideal that you can switch one earphone off to switch to mono when needed. Good audio quality too. Very impressed for its price tag.
5,Suono eccellente.. consiglio
5,He comprado estos auriculares y la verdad que son muy cómodos tienen varios tamaños para cambiar y la batería es lo que más dura. Estoy encantadísima.
5,Franchement excellent produit je recommande sans problème qualité de son top
