4,title says it all .... card does not always get recognized.  pull it out / reinsert.  sometimes takes a few times.  my other cards all work flawless so it isn't the connection.  it's the card.
4,came right on time and I bought it not knowing too much about sd card. But It's been working well so far.
4,Sometimes these SD cards come corrupt as new cards. So don’t use it for professional shoot straight away. I had some issues with this card and I don’t trust it completely but most of the time it works great and I trust it enough to use for secondary cameras or backup cameras. As far as durability goes very strong and premium feeling. This thing will not break and I like that about it.
5,I’ve had a phenomenal experience with my Card. Definitely plan to get another. I use it for videography. Content creation is made so much easier with this card.
4,Should have known I would get the one affected the known corruption issue - the second time this has happened with Sony cards on Amazon! Now I have to go through the hassle of RMAing the stupid thing and waiting for that whole process to complete. Out of all the things I've ordered lately this is the single item that arrived on-time so thanks for getting this defective item out so quickly!* * *9/14/2020 Update...Now that the card has been replaced I can comment on its actual performance (incidentally dealing with Sony on the return is pretty straightforward and took about 11 days to complete the bulk of the time being lost while the package sat around at a FedEx facility for 5 days with no movement whatsoever).The card itself performs as advertised and works very reliably on a GH5 recording in 400/MB/s All-I format even if the fit in the card slot is ever so slightly tight. The card itself does feel quite stout almost as if the shell is like a metallized plastic or ceramic material feels heavier and sounds different than a regular plastic SD card if dropped on a table (weird thing to notice I know but there it is). I have a an assortment of these Sony UHS-II cards some of which have supposedly been affected by the file corruption issue but none of which ever failed in actual use and all of which have since been replaced out of an abundance of caution. Except for the hassle of having return those effected by the recall I think these UHS-II cards by Sony are worth the cost given the price.The question is though do you really need a ruggedized SD card that's 18x stronger than other cards that's also IP68 rated? Probably not but for those shooting in harsh conditions or who constantly fumble their SD cards into the ocean or your aunt's famous piping hot lasagna this might well be the card for you. For anyone else however the regular version at the same speed rating may work just as well (and the 120MB/s and 100MB/s cards from Sony do equally well in a GH5 recording All-I just so you know).To be completely honest even though I needed a large SD card I purchased this particular one mainly out of curiosity. The way I figure if I happen to be filming during a flight that crashes into the ocean the FAA can probably recover the card from the depths to help determine what went wrong so it could be money well spent!
4,It is a standard good quality Sony sdxc card. Works well with my Blackmagic Monitor video assist 12G. Also good on my Sony FX3 and 7C.  Reliable product! Cheapest I can buy at all places locally in Hong Kong.
5,Good product . Recommend
4,Seems like good quality. Feels a little thicker than a standard SD card in that I can feel friction going into and out of my camera.
5,Started using the tough cards and are loving them  they are the only card that my R5c don't give me warning about unsuitable SD card when shooting compressed 8K.. perfect.  and quicker workflow than CFexpress cards.in two minds my last batch was delivered in sticky packaging LOL. but considered the card is waterproof ish - should be fine.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             4/5 RatingI was excited to get this card as it's a much needed upgrade to my Sony A7R3.  I first started out with SandDisk then moved up to Sony M. It's said this is miles better than that.  I purchased card a few weeks ago and have not experimented fully with this.  So far so good.  I will say it will now fit very snug into your camera as these cards are known for their thickness and durability.The speed of these cards are noticeable I haven't witnessed a lightning increase but I have seen an increase.Overall I'm happy. I will continue to test and update my review.ProsGood read / write speedsUHS IIDurable and thickerConsWill now fit snug into your cameraA little pricey
5,Execelente durabilidad se me ha caído en agua y sobre tierra sigue como si nada funciona perfecto no he tenido problema alguno.
5,This SD card is my backup. Always good to have one on hand in case you fill the card in your camera.
5,I use this in a Panasonic GH5s and Panasonic S5. I have never had any problems with lost or corrupted clips and the write speed is fast enough for the 400mb setting on the GH5s. (Some cards claim to be fast enough but end up corrupting files). Would def recommend especially for run and gun shooters.
5,Now the camera works well. Better quality SD card did help.
5,This is Sony's latest version of SD cards not affected by their current recall. If you have any of the cards listed in the following please send them back to Sony for a free replacement:"Regarding SD memory cards of SF-M series SF-M series TOUGH specification and SF-G series TOUGH specification recorded data on the card may be damaged or data may not be recorded correctly when shooting video on a camera* in video speed class mode.* The camera compatible with video speed class V60/V90 etc. as recommended recording media.We are offering free replacements for affected SD memory cards from June 11 2020 through Mar. 31 2022 subject to the limited warranty that accompanied the SD memory card. Please see below to determine if you have an affected SD memory card and call us at 239-768-7669 to arrange for your card replacement."To add to this they mention in other articles that the affected sd cards dont have an asterisk next to the serial number beginning with TV. In other words if you have a faint asterisk to the left of the code beginning with "TV" then your cards are among those that need replacing.Anyway these cards are an incredible value for the money. Sure they aren't the fastest (far from the slowest) but being tough as nails and only a few dollars more expensive than regular cards I find them hard to beat!
5,Working great fast
5,Sony tough is fast and reliable SO FAR. Only had it a short time so won’t know about durability for some time.
5,It really is the best. You can choose faster one from this product line or one with more gigabites or both. It's robust and substantial. I used to work with sandisc until it broke the slot of my Sony A7rII SD card slot. Keep away from that company's SD cards. They are made of such a thin and fragile plastic that you can easily break them however the most horrible thing happenes when it breakes in the camera' slot. We have about 20 broken sandisc 'extreme' cards! It probably is named so because you break them extremely easily often damaging your equipment. Nothing like that has ever happen with my Sony cards. So I  highly recommend them!
5,This review isn't about the Sony Tough SD card I have 3 of them...they're great! I thought that I was getting a good deal by buy this one through Amazon Warehouse Deals. When it arrived I failed to inspect it and just tossed it in with the group of SD cards I use for photography. When I went to use it for the first time it failed to read in my camera and after inspecting it it was obviously a fake card. Too much time had elapsed by the time i discovered this and Amazon won't refund or allow a return of the card. It's my fault....a lesson to all inspect your purchase and beware of buying something that has been previously returned.I'm still giving this 5 stars because Sony produces great products and this is no exception.
5,Bought this card for UHD video shooting. Ran some tests right after I received it. I was impressed. The writing speed can keep constant at 170MB/s. Get this card although it is a bit pricey. Most likely worthy it in the long run.
5,Better than SanDisk & Lexar equivalents In my OMD cameras. The Sony SD cards read & wrote significantly faster per my tests.
4,I'm hoping this is a one-off incident but just in case check your new cards.  Got one of these cards and was excited to use it in my admittedly rough environment. If I don't have some sand in the grooves of my camera/lens after a day of shooting I'm surprised. Got the card and immediately plugged it in hoping it didn't stick like other reviews I've read only to see "write protection is on." Pulled the card out and tried it in a reader no issues. Plugged a different card into my camera only to be met with the same warning. So I pulled that card out and looked in the SD slot to see a tiny piece of plastic (what I assume was flash from molding) stuck in the write protect checker pin. Got a blower and dislodged it problem solved. BUT I'm certainly going to visually inspect whatever I put in my holes from now on.
5,Nothing bad to say great product
5,So I have been using this for about 2months now it is a legit card no issues so far
5,Used in my sony A7RIV. Readout is fast. Worth it.
5,Great memory cards
5,Use this in my Sony A7iii. I am not a professional not even an amature. Just a dude who takes random photos when he travels. I can take more photos continuously as it saves faster. and when uploading to my computer with an SD card reader make sure your card reader has fast speeds or it won't matter how fast the card is! No issues with card failing have taken on a plane many times thru the x-ray machine and no issues! I wish the 256 card was a bit cheaper!
5,I’m writing this review after a month of use.At first I was wary about spending so much on a memory card however I shoot motorsports photography and I found that even shooting a conservative amount of shots my buffer would fill with a slower card. This card is fast enough that I don’t have to worry about that and it makes my upload time MUCH faster when adding RAW files to my computer so much that I’ve bought 3 total to make sure I rarely ever have to use a slower card. I haven’t dropped or submerged the card so I can’t speak to it’s toughness other than the fact that it does feel sturdier than my other cards.
5,Using it on my Canon R5 I have not had any errors or corruptions from this card. Fast enough to record up to 4K 60p and 1080 120p up to 30 min with no issues. Easily records the 20 frames per second in photo mode. Just make sure you buy from a reputable dealer as there are many counterfeit SD cards out there. Highly recommend.
4,It works well.  I found it to be as easy to insert as other non-tough cards.  Time will tell on durability only in-use for 2 weeks.
4,I have a Sony A7R-II and I was looking for a speedier card for continuous shooting (42mp stills not video). I figured the card being from the same company that made the camera it helps me to organize and identify which cameras it came from.
2,Compared to my other Sony SD Card with the same rating I'm getting half the write speeds and 1/8 the. read speeds. Maybe this one is defective which doesn't speak well for QC. Returning
4,I bought it for my Sony A7R-IV and worked well. When shooting continuously like doing wild animal photography it is noticeably better than my other UHS-I card (V30).However this card has compatibility issues with my other camera Lecia M10. After upgrading to the latest firmware M10 fails to write to the card.
5,Need a durable high capacity card for 4k video shooting and respectable offload times? This is it.
5,Just as fast as it states (sometimes faster!) works great in my Fujifilm. Just make sure you use a SDXC2 card reader and use a USB 2.0 or newer port on your computer when transferring otherwise you will not see the speed. I think any bad reviews on speed of this are user error and not using the proper hardware or using / dont have the proper USB ports on their computer. It does get warm when transferring and is on the thick side but no issues thus far. Feels like its made from ceramic very solid feeling SD card! Love it.
5,I love Sony SD cards! I have used the Sony G and M cards after failures with other big brands. This card is really the sweet spot of price/speed/reliability for me as a wedding photographer and videographer on sony A7III and A7RIII cameras. The G cards IMO are more for sports and extending the burst capabilities of the A9/A9II.I like the Tough cards because they finally do away with the pointless and easily breakable dividers between the contacts. They also provide peace of mind that if you have full cards in your pocket and get caught in the rain you don't have to worry about damaging them.  Will never go back to the regular M or G cards.
5,It's a really well made card. I wasn't sure about the "tough" part until I acutally held it in my hand. It's actually an interesting design. It's made of some type of allow. It's rock solid when you drop it on a table it sounds like it's a coin or something. Meaning it's a very solid piece. I'm bought two for my a7iii it works in any type of SD but if you have UHS-II its more worth it. Since its designed for that high performance speed.
5,I' m a fan of the molded waterproof body and the lack of a write protect slider.  You will need an adapter to use on a USB 3.0 port if you want to take advantage of the higher speeds with this memory card.
5,I have four of them soon I'll have 8 of them.  Records hours of 10bit 4:2:0 60P.  I do simul record on an FX3 and SIII.  You rarely need V90 and I have two if it's an emergency.
5,I own a Sony A7R4 and shoot raw. Each photo file is 120 MB and when I shoot wildlife the burst shuter creates several Gigabyte files in a few seconds. Write speed of the SD card is very important for me. This Tough card offers 150 MB/s write speed which I tested solid. It is much more faster than my Sandisk Extreme Pro card (write speed is 90MB/s).Great deal at Black Friday Sale.
4,Card is hard to get in and out of the camera. Spring releases the card but it hangs on the exit rails on my Nikon Z5. I have to use an unusual amount of finger pull to force it out completely.  Doesn't seem just right?
1,Unfortunately I did not use this card until the return period passed. When I insert it into the card reader it automatically ejects itself. It is not possible to import any images from it. Not only did I lose money by purchasing this defective unit but I lost many photos and videos stored on it.
4,So far so good
5,Works good. I have been using them for quite some time no problems.
5,256 GB of storage with Read speeds of approximately 277 Megabytes per second and Write speeds of approximately 150 Megabytes per second.Those information already tells me that I can shoot photos in the highest megapixel resolution in market and save that shot within 1 second or less. Is that not enough R/W capabilites?
5,Bought this product to pair up with camera that's weather sealed and used in various weather conditions.
5,I've used this memory cards for over 3 months on my Sony Alpha 7R III and I'm impressed. I've had issues with sandisk memory cards (breaking/not working after a couple of uses) but not with this TOUGH card. It basically has no moving parts so breaking is out of the question. I will only be using these Sony cards from now on.
5,Certainly is built very well not plyable like standard SD cards. Very hard no moving parts no seams. It has management software that is supposed to alert you before the card exceeds its read/write cycles.
5,Works fine for my needs! Though I haven’t confirmed speeds I’ve recorded 4K footage from my Sony A7III @ 30p 100m. The camera auto shut-off (15 min?) due to heat before the SD card needed buffer time at all (haven’t run into that yet).
5,Best cards for high megapixel photos and 4K videos
5,I have tried 4 SD cards for my a7iii. (tough G tough M Sand disk extreme pro extreme plus.) After I test them all. I think tough M is the best SD card for your A7iii slot 1. And it's not too expensive. I highly recommend.
5,I have switched all my cards to Tough because one of my ordinary thin cards broke apart inside of my Sony camera and jammed it I like to never got it out of there. These are really nice I don't have to worry about it.
5,I was skeptical to dump so much $$ on a memory card. I'm sure it's tough and durable (its build quality inspires confidence) but I bought it for speed. Perfect match in slot 1 of my Sony A7iii.
5,I like this memory card in that it is sealed from dust and the occasional run thru the washing machine when I leave it in my jeans. I take pictures of horse competition in indoor Arenas and it gets very dusty. I recommend this M card and the G cards as well.
4,Fast and tough but it is a very tight fit in my camera.
5,I got a pair of these for my Sony a7R IV and I'm super happy with them.PS Amazon asked me to rate the "warmth" and "thickness" of this item - I guess they think its a blanket LOL
4,I bought this card because of its advertised durability and data transfer rate.
5,Nothing bad about these extremely fast durable cards but just announced a recall on these to make sure you do some research to see if yours is affected. Newer models have a star on the back
5,Una se me lavó en la lavadora porque se me quedó en un pantalón. Funciona como si nada
5,bought them for sony a7s mark 3.very good cardsread speed 150 MB\sbuy the MRW-S1 card reader for maximum speed read
5,I can't speak on how well this card performs for video but it's GREAT for photography. I've never noticed a lag even when shooting multiple pictures in one go. This works great for my Canon EOS R body.
5,Perfect! Very well build quality! I am happy I went with this for my Olympus EM5 mark III. I almost got a stuck-memory card with the old Sandisk Extreme Pro so this Sony would help avoid that from happening again.
1,Less than a year after purchasing this the write protect slider broke so I couldn't edit the photos on it.  I called Sony they said they would replace it. They sent a shipping label I mailed it out with proof of purchase and their paper work which said "Outcome: Replacement". A week later I received a package which contained my old broken card not replaced. I spent another half hour on the phone with Sony and was told I had to go through the process again.  I'm currently waiting for the email with the shipping label which was supposed to arrive 'within minutes.'I will not be buying another SONY tough card given the poor quality of the first.
5,Seems very tough like it’s name and I was waiting for one for long time although the price is a bit of the off factor but I’m sure it’s worth it
5,I now only buy TOUGH versions.  I've had too too many prior cards become "read only" because of the sliding clip becoming broken.  Worth the extra.  Seriously.
5,Shoot a lot actually needed the 256. Perfect so far.
5,A bit more expensive than your knock off brands but you pay a premium for reliability and fit to purpose. If you are a DSLR videographer this is the memory card for you.
5,Work fine with my Fujifilm X-T4 and GFX50R. I swap to Sony from Sandisk as the quality much better.
5,With these newest Sony a series mirrorless you definitely need fast.  These things scream.  Just pony up you'll be glad that you did especially if you need that once in a lifetime shot to be right.
1,This card is worthless. A waste of every penny I spent on it. There is a known issue about it not recording video (wish I had known before I bought it). Called Sony and they said call Amazon. Amazon took some work but finally got a supervisor to credit back the card.This card is useless. Nobody wants to stand behind it and I’m out $60. Do not buy Sony products. They just make excuses for their faulty products.
5,Using this card in my A7III. Works flawlessly.
5,When you hold it you will impressed with the quality and durability speed also same as advertised and very stable.
5,These are the bad boys you want in your cameras. Best quality I've seen in a card like these. These won't choke running bursts or capturing 4K videos. At such a sweet price point. Sony at it again...
5,Works well with the A7c no issues but i mainly shoot stills.
5,Best uhs2 card you can buy
3,The first one I bought was working excellent but the 2nd card that I got did not function well.  I was getting the dreaded iMac rolling ball on it and then wipes out everything.  I reformatted the card several times but still same result.  I am glad I bought this in amazon and returned without any hassle.
5,This card is amazing. Also not much more than a regular card.
3,The read/write speeds are good. The card is rugged. I wish there were a data lock switch.
5,Works for what I need it for!
4,thx
5,In my Sony camera taking a lot of low-light pictures
5,I bought this version instead of the 300mb/sec speed because I wasn’t sure how much of a difference it would make.So far it works well with my Sony A7rIII
5,Excellent memory card with fast read & write speeds.  Using it with Sony A7RII. Seems well constructed.
5,Works well
3,I wish it was advertised with the number of Gb you can really use not what it has before formatting and even though my Sd card analyser shows 123Gb  and not 128Gb  :(
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Bought 2 of these for my Sony A7III. The copies I got are very slow; it takes 7 seconds to write on them (See video). Slot1 for RAW and Slot2 for jpeg. Also made my camera behave slow and buggy. Once I put some other SD cards in my camera all problems where resolved.
5,Works great in the R6 kept up with the fast shutter speeds also.
5,Llego rapido bien empacado y funciono perfecto.
5,It has so far worked great.
5,Fast
5,Great price for a UHS-II SDXC. After more than 2 weeks of more or less continuous shooting no problems. Look forward to adding several more.
5,These have the asterisk so they are the updated cards. Keep eye out for recalled ones.
5,If you have lots of SD cards and want durability then get these cards.
5,Amazing speeds and quality of this SD Card!
5,Quick service. Would use again.
5,Very FAST GREAT QUALITY I WILL BE USING THIS IN THE FUTURE
5,Using with a Panasonic Gh5 atm. A half a dozen shoots at 400Mb All-I 4k 24p.
5,no words.
5,Product works great. Sony creating their own type of memory for their camera is just a money grab.
2,This is actually my second Sony TOUGH SD card. I use it with my Sony a7iii. I just sent it back to Sony because the card failed and lost photos that I took of a sunset in Yosemite. Sony IS replacing it. But I don’t know how much I trust it…
1,card fails in multiple cameras. freezes constantly. not worth a penny. been using sandisk and going back..
5,Cheaper shipping options came first...
1,In 2020 Sony issued a "Notice of Replacement" for various Sony-branded SD cards. This variant model of the SF-M128T is listed but it doesn't carry a printed serial # on the back. I purchase a Sony a7IV camera and discovered the card WON'T work with that newer camera. I contacted Sony and they won't replace the card. Keep that in mind if you own a newer Sony camera.
5,Exceeded my expectations
5,Tough it is
5,I want to use this in outside.Because this is soo tough.
5,gd product
5,Sd card is very good
5,Perfect works with my a9
5,Excelente producto llegó en menos tiempo de lo esperado
5,Very good product and quality I’m happy
1,The design of the product is metal. So where it meets at the contacts its much thinner than standard. So when I was trying to get them to seat in the camera they would jam and I would have to do a lot of jiggling to get them to seat. Then they wouldn't format. Then I tried in one of my card readers and the card slid under the contacts in one of my card readers and ruined it. I've hade too many friends tell me the horror stories of these cards.
5,Super fast saving for 4k video
1,I researched the best memory cards for my new camera for quite a while. I had no reason to think I would have any type of problem with this card. The buffer that accompanies the memory card writing is insanely long. Absolutely insanely long. I have never experienced this with any other card. I cannot use this card for work at all. It causes me to miss very important shots because it is so slow. I am especially disappointed with this product and even more because I feel like I fully wasted my money on this. I would not recommend. Maybe I have a faulty one not really sure but for the price the risk is not worth it.
2,the sd card are too thick they get stock inside the camera and one of them was corrupted. even though they look though i think are not well design to fit in most cameras.
2,Bought this and test it in a Wedding in my A7iii and when Shooting I realized the buffer was full waiting to write in the SD I tested on the Computer same results too slow I have another Sony SD and is way faster than this one. Avoid buy them on Amazon. Go to Adorama or BH.
2,Just got the card and speed tested it.  It maxed out at 90 MB/s although advertised at 150 MB/s. Returned them. On the same set up a Lexar card topped out at 200 MB/s so the reader and connection was fast enough. On a side note the card was well built and tough. Just wished it was fast.
5,A camera itself often limits an SD card's actual write speed to quite less than the card's labeled write speed.  In July 2022 I compared in my   Sony α9 II camera         three SD cards specified for a UHS-II bus which theoretically allows write speed up to 312 MB/s [1].Two of these cards labeled   260 MB/s write         and   299 MB/s write         ranked the fastest writing some 185 MB/s among all SD cards tested in α9 series by others who report on selfpublished websites [2].  Yet they omit this SD card labeled 150 MB/s write included in my test [3]:SANDISK series Extreme Pro 300 MB/s read 260 MB/s write 128 GB [4]- compressed raw: 153 files 32 seconds- uncompressed raw: 123 files 38 secondsSONY series SF-G or Tough G 300 MB/s read 299 MB/s write 32 GB- compressed raw: 153 files 32 seconds- uncompressed raw: 122 files 33 secondsSONY series SF-M or Tough M 277 MB/s read 150 MB/s write 128 GB- compressed raw: 156 files 33 seconds- uncompressed raw: 125 files 39 secondsMy results pose two paradoxes.  Although some half the MB per file compressed raw wrote at quite fewer MB/s than did uncompressed raw [5].  Either way this present SD card labeled 150 MB/s write was basically as fast as the other two despite their being reported elsewhere to write some 185 MB/s in α9 series.I also tested   Ritz Camera shop's rebrand of an SDexpress card 7.0        —820 MB/s read 500 MB/s write—a protocol new in 2019 for a PCIe bus still on only computers [16].  SDexpress is reputed compatible back to UHS-I at the lesser speed why I thought it may write fast UHS-II.  But finding this card slow I learned SDexpress cards omit UHS-II [7]:RITZ GEAR series Golden Eagle either SDexpress 7.0 or UHS-I 256 GB- compressed raw: 151 files 1 minute & 35 seconds- uncompressed raw: 109 files 2 minutes & 10 seconds [8]—1) Gordon Ung "SD Express will support PCIe 4.0 but don't hold your breath" PCWorld 22 May 20202) Viewed webpages include "Fastest SD cards for the Sony A9" CameraMemorySpeed 20 Jun 2017 and "Best memory cards Sony A9 II" AlikGriffin undated.  Operationally the roughly 185 MB/s write is an uncompressed raw burst's MB sum divided by the burst's write time.  Compression is a prior processing that itself slows data flow to the card.3) Artificial light only exposure value very low yet in realistic range each frame nearly identical wrote as only one file to only card slot #1.  Drive mode was High.  Lens was Sigma brand invoking Sony's firmware cap to 15 frames per second not α9 II's native up to 20 fps.  Compressed raw did 15 fps.  Uncompressed raw seemed capped at 12 fps.-) As I stopped my timer only once the last frame had just written each test arm's burst an idealized 10 seconds is tacitly included in the write time.  Any burst time tacit may be up to some 1/4 sec inaccurate affecting only frame count.  Any write time stated may be up to some 1/2 sec inaccurate via stoppage mistiming plus numerical rounding.4) Sandisk's series Extreme Pro also includes SD cards for a UHS-I bus.   Extreme Pro's old UHS-I version 170 MB/s read 90 MB/s write         heeds conventional limit on UHS-I write speed 104 MB/s.  Exceeding this is   Extreme Pro's new UHS-I version 200 MB/s read 140 MB/s write        .5) Although write time is faster for compressed its being barely faster apparently owes slightly to higher file count for compressed—via 15 fps versus 12 fps—yet mostly to the camera's processor expending more resources to compress before writing.6) Jaron Schneider "Adata launches SD Express cards a format no camera supports" PetaPixel 12 Oct 20217) SDexpress protocols and UHS protocols in fact cannot share a bus [16].  SDexpress cards merely have a row of UHS-I pins while the second row not UHS-II gaining PCIe is solely PCIe [16].  Indeed the Ritz Gear card's label says "I" where a UHS-II card would say "II" instead.  Orthodox write potential is 104 MB/s for UHS-I [1].8) Of course 109 files in 10 seconds averages 10.9 fps.  Was this a steady 11 fps?  Or was it 12 fps until the camera's memory—namely the buffer—filled up causing the frame rate to fall below 11 fps?-) I sensed no slowing of the electronic shutter's imitation mechanical sound turned on.  And α9 II's buffer is rated up to 239 frames raw which simplistically halved for uncompressed is 120 frames.-) As 11 fps was in only the test arm whose write time over 2 minutes was far longest I figure the α9 II promptly sensed slow writing and to defer a full buffer staked 11 fps sparing frame rate a maiming.
1,Used it two times. 1st time took about 700 pictures and then erased them. 2nd time took 3 pictures and it said card had an error. It could not be used. I had to put on the old OLD card. It's working great. Practically payed for the 128gb for a one time use.  Feels it's more of a disposable one. Like them disposable cameras back then.
1,I know these things happen in 15 years of digital photography this was the first time a memory card has ever failed for me. The card had only been used a few times and this batch of images (140) could not be read by Lightroom or even by the camera in playback.  Good thing it wasn't a wedding!
1,Do not buy. Card failed before reaching 50% capacity. Luckily I was shooting with dual cards when this one failed. Does not seem to be up to Sony standards. Is it authentic? Won't purchase again.
1,Those cards are corrupted and are being recalled by sony. Sony refuses to help replacing them if you bought from amazon. Their support is horrible! Avoid these cards at all cost! You will have corrupted files and will lose video and photo data!!!!!
1,I though that since the discovery of this problem was a few months ago Amazon would be selling the good ones now i have to go through all of that trouble of working with sony to get it replaced.
1,It is not compatible with varying USB Card Readers like Amplim UHS-II SD Card 64GB SDXC.  In addition it is a very tight fit with my Canon R Camera.
1,I don't blame Sony itself because this version of Sony SD card is perfect but the way amazon.com shipping these items  was horrible.
1,I received a card that was from an identified defective lot. So I have to ask Sony for a replacement.
5,Love the tough design because there are no more ribs or write lock switch to break off. I have used both the Tough-G card and the regular M cards by Sony and all are fast and reliable. Got these because I don’t need to full speed of the Tough-G cards but wanted the durability and at only a few dollars more than the regular M cards it seemed like a no brainer to me.I use these in the A7III and A7RIII and haven’t had one fail unlike my Sandisk cards which I’ll never use again.
2,I cannot get this card to upload to my computer faster than 39Mb/s 150 is no where near reachable as far as I can tell. I've used several card readers with no real change. Wish it worked better🤷
5,Using in my A7iii and it’s been flawless so far. Definitely a good choice!
5,Perfect Fit for Sony A7r4
5,Works great
5,Love the fact that this card feels like one molded piece and not cheap plastic glued together.  Also a huge benefit to not have the sliding right protection switch on the side as I never use that and they always seem to be the first thing to break.
5,These are really well built SD cards and are certainly a step above Sandisk or Kingston in quality.  You can tell from just holding them.  V60 write/read times are nice and quick.  They cost more than other brands but I think the Sony Tough M is worth the money.
5,Perfecto lo que esperaba
5,I needed to find a sd card that can records 400Mbps video from my gh5 and apparently allot of v60 cards from other brands dont work with the gh5's 400Mbps and some people have said you buy 4 cards maybe 2 will work(from other brands) so that kinda worried me i really dont have the money to buy a v90 cards i took the risk with the 256GB card since this brand seemed to have overall good reviews.... and luckily it works with the 400Mbps flawlessly so ill be buying another.
5,They’re working perfectly!
5,A sweetspot for a V60 speed card for the storage and price. Quite a jump up if you need a faster card for professional use but cheaper than the V90 for less storage. 256GB is a good balance for 10bit 4K recording and having enough space to shoot without offloading or maxing out quickly.The price looking back is a good compromise with reliable specs that hit the advertised read and write speeds. It makes a big jump for burst and higher bitrate shooting than typical V30 cheaper cards. I chose the Sony over other V60 brands that are slightly cheaper because of the tough range as I had a few physically break off after some use. The tough is ticket and more robust that constant handling won't with me and makes the whole package worth it.
5,Ich hab mir gleich 2 dieser Karten geholt nachdem ich im Internet ein wenig Recherche betrieben habe. Die Schreib- und Lesegeschwindigkeit ist für meine Zwecke voll ausreichend. Am Ende muss aber jeder für sich entscheiden welche Anforderungen er an eine SD-Karte stellt. Bei mir sind beide in der EOS R7 im Einsatz und ich bin vollends zufrieden damit.
5,Dans la cadre de mon travail j'avais besoin d'urgence de prendre des Cartes SD V60.Ayant vu une promotion sur les Sony Tough M V60 128Go j'en ai commandé 4 à 50€/pièce.J'étais bien sûr au courant qu'à sa sortie (en 2019 de mémoire) cette gamme avait fait l'objet d'un rappel et remplacement par Sony car elles avaient des problèmes de conception: Corruptions de fichiers systématique.Nous sommes donc en Juin 2022 lorsque je passe commande de 4 exemplaires identiques "Sony SFM128T/T1 UHS-II U3 V60 SDHXC 128 Go".Dès réception j'ai vérifié à l'arrière de chaque carte si elle possédait une petite astérisque qui signifie que la carte "n'est pas affectée" par ces problèmes de corruption de fichiers.Elles ont toutes cette astérisque je donc suis tranquille. Pas besoin de les renvoyer à Amazon ou bien de faire appel au programme de changement de Sony (actif jusqu'en 2023) qui m'aurait privé de carte SD pendant deux semaines.Je ne sais pas si elles restent encore des stocks de cartes corrompues chez les revendeur peut-être suis-je chanceux mais j'ai bien reçu 4 cartes identiques et fonctionnelles.Sinon les cartes sont plus épaisses que les cartes SD standards.Elles n'entrent pas avec aisance dans les slots d'un A7IV en revanche aucun souci pour les faire ressortir.
5,pour ma camera fx 700 c est parfait et suffisant en gigas
4,Quite snug fit in Sony A7 III  compared to SanDisk etc. Does fit but it's tight especially removal
5,Purchased a 128GB card on Prime Day 2020. The card came with a label saying it was made in August of 2020. Looks like from this point onward all new cards are not affected by the Sony recall anymore. This was a concern I had when I made the purchase. Hopefully this will be useful information to those who are still on the fence.
5,Siny Tough SD cards are just that. Tough.They fit in my Canon mirrorless bodies very snugly. They feel more solid than the competition. Not the cheapest but quality never is.
5,Veloce
5,Prodotto incredibile alte prestazioni a buon prezzo
4,Sometimes on Sony A7Rm3 has 2 times lost of data.
4,Write speed isn't something to write home about. I paired this up with a A7R4 and it's not any faster than my old Lexar 1000x; however it's a lot cheaper than the G series and hopefully just as durable.Fit - Yes fit it's a weird thing to review on a memory card but it IS a tight fit and gets stuck in my A7R4...both Sony.I hope it's worth it in the long run but I am sure I'll never crush it with a car or whatever so I don't think I will find out how durable it really is.  I just hope the memory part doesn't get corrupt.
4,PC接続での書き込み速度は平均195MB/sec出ました。諸元以上の性能でした。容量も規格まで利用できました。(重複クラスタも発生していません。)
2,Amazon first put it as 128 GB on the picture (although it did indicate the correct version on the description). It first seemed working well until a few days ago I found out from the internet that it may corrupt video files. Took a lot of effort to find out from Sony what can be done. Drove over 10 km to a Purolator office to drop it off on prepaid label to Sony. Just checked and was delivered. On Sony website it was more confusing than anything. One line says "open case" next says "closed" still next says "cancelled" (misspelled as canceled). No mentioned of receiving no future actions mention. I hope that they don't just keep my copy and done for the day.Learned something new and that is for SD card always buy Sandusky.
5,While I can't comment on longevity - some are a couple years old but most are new to me - they one-piece construction and the lack of a flimsy lock slider make these my preferred cards.
5,It’s a great SD card I got the 64gb card it’s fast and I haven’t had any issues with it. It can keep up with my camera when shooting high burst rates and doesn’t lag when trying to view the photos. I haven’t had any (card is busy) messages pop up after taking a bunch a photos or videos. Get this card if you’ve been thinking about it.
5,Cartes mémoires d'excellente facture et solides. Sont un petit peu plus épaisses que les autres et peuvent suivant l'appareil utilisé être un peu difficile à extraire. Ne jamais ajouter une étiquette !Ces cartes sont un peu chères mais de grande qualité.
5,Sooo expensive.  But they are a beast !!  You need that for 4k movie shooting
5,Perfect for GH5 on 400mbps 10bit All-i. I had been using SanDisk but they cannot handle the data. These cards are faultless with GH5's most intensive codec and I can now film again without the stress.
1,Once you ship your card to them they never update anymore.Never Ever Buy SONY.
5,Not the Fastest UHS-II as it's only around 80-87 Megabits per second on the A7III but very durable for the price.
5,amazing product fast one great transfer speed trust it with your eyes closed
5,Ottimo prodotto un po’ difficile da inserire dovuto al suo design più robusto
5,The body is very solid hard case. very protective!
5,Just like the title says this is a beast
5,Works well and fast delivery
5,Value for money and on time delivery
5,great product
3,La calidad a primera vista se ve muy buena lo que no veo muchos comentarios sobre el espesor de la tarjeta es mas gruesa que cualquier otra de cualquier maca por lo que en una Sony a7IV entra bien en la ranura destinada a la Cfexpress que se pueden utilizar tanto unas como las otras pero en la ranura que solo admite SD probe un poco y desisti porque entra muy apretada y seguro que me cuesta de sacar por lo que si la uso sera en la ranura doble es curioso que Camara Sony y tarjeta Sony y pase esto si alguien la tiene que montar en la ranura solo SD no se la recomiendo para nada.
4,Bon un peu chère mais je vais en racheter sûrement deux 128g V90
1,After one year of very light use this "tough" card is toast.Corrupted and will no longer work in my EOS R6I've been disappointed by Sony products before this will be the last time.
1,I've had this card for 4 months and it already died on me....... pc and camera won't recognize it to bad it happened in the middle of a big shoot and I lost everything.... won't be trusting this card again.
1,My card actually snapped!!! While putting in my card case. Unreal!! My other cheaper cards haven't snapped. Can't believe I spent so much on it.
5,Die Berste SSD Karte die es zur Zeit gibt
5,Migliori di queste soltanto la serie G
4,Die SD Karte macht einen sehr robusten Eindruck. Fühlt sich auch wertig. Habe mich für diese Karte entschieden weil die Kontakte eingelassen sind und dadurch keine Plastikrillen an den Kontakten notwendig sind. Bei günstigeren Karten brechen diese Rillen ganz gerne und dann wird das einstecken in Lesegeräte mühsam und fehleranfällig. Schreib und Leseraten sind wie versprochen ist halt ne V60 klassifizierte Karte. Nicht mehr oder weniger daher habe ich bekommen was mir versprochen wurde. 4k Videos können bis 200 Mbps problemlos durchgehend aufgenommen werden. Kaufempfehlung!
2,It’s 277mbs yet doesn’t work on my camera that requires 250mbs. Probably my fault for not checking compatibility but for the price I pay I expect it to work.
5,Thanks
5,Works okay with my Hasselblad 907x and Leica SL2- S.
5,Wer die Wahl hat... habe mich für diese Karten entschieden um sie in der Panasonic Lumix DC-G9 einzusetzen.Die Karte unterstützt UHS ii 4K Videoaufnahmen mit V60 und wird mit einer Schreibrate von 150 MB/s angegeben. Das ganze zu einem wie ich finde vernünftigen Preis- Leistungsverhältnis im Vergleich zu anderen Mitbewerbern die diese Art der Stabilität nicht anbieten. Bereits die Haptik der Karte ist beeindruckend.Ein weiterer positiver Aspekt sind die eingelassenen nicht durch Stege getrennte Kontakte das rillenlose Design.Auf Grund der soliden Konstruktion entschied ich mich für die Sony Karte und nicht für die etwas schnellere der ebenso attraktiven Transcend 64 GB SDXC/SDHC 700S ( TS64GSDC700S ) die mit einer Schreibrate von 180 MB/s und mit V90 deklariert ist.Noch schnellere Karten machen bei der Nutzung im Zusammenhang mit der G9 wohl eher keinen Sinn da der Interne Controller der Kamera bzgl. Schreibgeschwindigkeit seine Grenzen hat. Preislich spielen sie zudem in einer nicht unerheblich höheren Liga.Auf Andere Marken von Speicherkartenherstellern möchte ich nicht näher eingehen als das entweder die Schreibrate nicht direkt angegeben wird oder die Haltbarkeit bezüglich Schreibzyklen sowie Haptik auf mich nicht all zu vertrauenserweckend wirkt.Beachten sollte man allerdings 2 Karten des selben Typs einzusetzen. Bei zwei unterschiedlichen Karten richtet  sich der in der Kamera verbaute Controller von seiner Verarbeitungsgeschwindigkeit immer nach der langsameren / schwächeren Karte.Anmerkung: im Juni 2020 wurde durch Amazon die bereits Fehlerfreie Version der Speicherkarte versendet. Weitere Infos zur Rückrufaktion seitens Sony und wie man betroffene Karten erkennt sind auf der Sony Homepage beschrieben.
5,Veramente spettacolari queste sd acquistate un paio per la mia a7iii proveniente da san disk extreme pro uhs 1 queste sono su un altro pianeta velocità pazzesca in lettura e scrittura (un buffer di 30 raw non compressi lo polverizza in meno di 11 secondi) e penso durabilità perfetta.Ottimo il fatto che non ci sia un blocco fisico sulla sd così perfette una volta attaccata al pc di non cancellare inavvertitamente files importanti (mi è capitato parecchie volte con le sandisk)
3,Die Verarbeitungsqualität diese SD-Karte is absolute Spitzenklasse! Auch ohne den direkten Vergleich zu einer "normalen" SD-Karte merkt man dass die SONY TOUGH einfach wertiger ist. Sobald man sie in die Hand nimmt merkt man den Unterschied. Die Sony Karte ist etwas schwerer lässt sich nicht verbiegen und an den Anschlüssen sind keine filigranen Plastiklamellen. Man merkt sofort dass diese SD-Karte physisch einiges aushält. Sie ist auch ausreichend schnell.Ich kann bisher nur zur Lebensdauer noch nichts sagen da ich sie noch nicht lange besitze. Allerdings hat sie schon mehrere Foto-Ausflüge mitgemacht und mich bisher kein einziges Mal im Stich gelassen (eine 6 Monate alte "normale" Sony SD-Karte 32GB hat meine Kamera derweil schonmal zum Absturz gebracht und war nicht mehr lesbar bis ich sie formatierte). Ich schreibe hier ein Update sobald diese SD-Karte den Geist aufgibt.Die Verpackung ist auch sehr wertig und unterscheidet sich deutlich von den billigen Verpackungen anderer SD-Karten. Insgesamt ist das ein super Preis- Leistungsverhältnis und endlich eine vernünftige Weiterentwicklung der SD-Karte.Update am 03.08.2020:Während meines letzten Urlaubs habe ich mehr Fotos geschossen als üblich. Nachdem die Karte mit etwa 20GB belegt war (Fotos und 4K Videos) bemerkte ich eine auffällige Verlangsamung im Schreibvorgang. Das ist jetzt zwar eine subjektive Beobachtung und keine genaue Messung aber die langsamere Schreibgeschwindigkeit fiel mir sehr deutlich auf. Es kann unter Umständen sein dass es irgendwie an meiner a6400 Kamera liegen könnte allerdings fällt mir keine technische Erklärung dazu ein. Dass die SD-Karte bereits nach 20GB langsamer wird (im Schreibvorgang) hat mich etwas enttäuscht. Daher Herabstufung auf 4 von 5 Sternen.Update am 06.09.2020:Die Verlangsamung im Schreibvorgang hat mir nun bereits wertvolle Aufnahmen versaut. Die Karte war wieder mit etwa 20GB gefüllt (von 64GB). Ich sah ein Eichhörnchen auf einem Baum und machte schnell ein paar Schnappschüsse hintereinander. Dann wollte ich sofort zum Videomodus wechseln und das Hörnchen noch etwas zu filmen. Dabei verweigerte mir die Kamera den Wechsel in den Videomodus weil die Bilder noch auf die SD-Karte geschrieben wurden. Es mussten noch etwa 18 Fotos geschrieben werden. Dies geschah so dermaßen langsam dass ich buchstäblich über 60 Sekunden warten musste. Erst dann gab die Kamera den Modus frei und bis dahin war das Eichhörnchen schon LÄNGST über alle Berge. Nachdem ich die SD-Karte formatiert hatte speichert die Kamera die Fotos wieder mit der gewohnten alten Geschwindigkeit. Enttäuschend. Ich kann bei meinem 64GB Exemplar daher maximal 20GB schreiben und dann ist Schluss. Daher herabstufung auf 3 von 5 Sternen. Ich hätte genauso gut auch eine 32GB Karte kaufen können. Die TOUGH-Spezifikation bezieht sich offenbar nur auf die äußere Verarbeitungsqualität und nicht zwangsläufig auf die Verwendung hochwertiger Speicherchips.
5,No sé para vidro pr para foto con Sony A7iii va perfecta y guarda rápido
5,This is the best ever card in my life this is solid one piece in the other cards there is an inner part and outer shall which is very flimsy ofter broken easily reading writing speed looks good 100% recommended future proof card works well for 4K recording and less heat compared to the other card manufacturer.
3,Ich habe Probleme mit Sony a7C bei 4K 25p 100 Mb Einstellungen!  Gleiche Leistung wie Sandisk extreme pro v30 170mb/s (30€) in Bezug auf die Videoschreibgeschwindigkeit!!!  Also überteuert!
5,Rien à dire de particulier. Fait très bien le job.
5,Diese Karte arbeitet in meiner Kamera (EOS R) schnell und zuverlässig. Ich habe die Karte nicht mit einer Benchmark durchgemessen da sich die Karten in den Kameras anders verhalten können als an einem Kartenleser. Im Vergleich zu meiner Lexar Professional 1000x R150/ V60 ist diese Karte um einiges schneller ich konnten rund 14 RAWs mehr mit der Sony aufnehmen bei 8Bilder/s also 56 anstatt 42 außerdem wurde der Zwischenspeicher erheblich schneller entleert ca. in der Hälfte der Zeit von der Lexar.Ja die Karte ist Teuer aber sie lohnt sich für Kameras mit UHS-II Schnittstelle.Wer sich eine moderne Systemkamera kauft braucht nicht mit den billigen (128GB 15€) Karten anfangen die bremsen die Kamera nur aus und die hohen Auflösungen zum Filmen (4K30 4K60...) laufen nicht.
4,Schnelle Karte - nutze sie in BM Hyperdeck Studio Mini - bisher keine Probleme
5,Costa un po' (ho sborsato quasi 56 € per il taglio da 64 GB luglio 2020) ma l'ho scelta lo stesso perché è una delle poche SD a dichiarare entrambe le velocità (spesso pubblicizzano solo quella di lettura che è sempre la più alta) e per via della presunta maggior robustezza.C'è poco da dire: almeno di fatto di velocità mantiene sicuramente le promesse!Testata subito con adattatore SanDisk SDDR-409 (comprato apposta per questa scheda) ha dimostrato capacità eccezionali: lettura a 277 MB/s e scrittura a 150 MB/s. Completamente soddisfatto!Riguardo alla robustezza potrò verificarla solo col tempo. Comunque noto già con piacere l'assenza del micro interruttore per bloccare la scrittura. A detta del produttore quel piccolo switch - per me inutile - può rompersi facilmente causando quindi problemi alla SD ecco perché è stato rimosso da questo prodotto rugged.In definitiva sono contentissimo del mio acquisto!
5,Ich verwende die Karte in einer Kamera und habe bisher keine Probleme. Regelmäßiges Backup sollte man aber trotzdem nicht vergessen.
5,Con las tarjetas Sony no hay buscar los datos de escritura. Esta tarjeta M de Sony son mas rápida que otras de misma características en cuanto a la escritura. Para camaras con archivos RAW sin comprimir (ARW 61Mpx o NEF 45Mpx) es mas recomendable las Sony G frente a la Sandisk ExtremePro desconozco otras las de otras marcas.
5,On the other brand cards  pieces of the plastic are breaking off them this one is reliable and still in one piece.
5,Die Karten sind sehr stabil gebaut. Wie man auf English sagt: "buy it nice or buy it twice".Hier merkt man das sofort dass die Qualität eine Niveau höher ist als alle anderen SD Karten (ich habe einige von SanDisk Prograde Lexar)
5,Works well with Sony a7riii
5,A simple vista (o tacto) ya se nota que no es una tarjeta SD normal....se nota mucho su construccion metalica DURA y RESISTENTE!la he probado y va realmente perfecta pero de momento prefiero no porobar si es sumergible o resistente al fuego....Esta claro que son el futuro de las tarjetas sobretodo para los que viajamos y trabajamos en zonas un poco "compliacadas"
5,MATERILI OTTIMI COSTRUZIONE ECCELLENTE RESISTENZA PURA VELOCITA' COME DA DESCRIZIONE.CONSIGLIATO
5,READ THIS BEFORE BUYING. Many of these Tough SDXC cards had a reading issue till last year. Many of them are still on the shelves. The replacements by Sony have an asterisk * printed behind the card but no trace of it from the packaging so you have to open it to check. I chatted with the Amazon Customer Service and told me they cannot guarantee the ones from this ad are the new replacements. Sony has a replacement program for different countries: check on their site if you get a faulty card.
5,I use it for shooting stills and video on my Panasonic G9. I shoot at 150mbs and have had no issues after using the cards for two months now. Burst photographs also work well. I have not tested the actual read/write numbers but they are quick enough for me not to doubt that I am getting the speed that is claimed. Time will tell if the cards are reliable but so far my experience with them has been positive without any fuss.
5,Una tarjeta de calidad con unas velocidades de lectura y escritura acorde a lo anunciado.La gama "tough" de Sony es duda la mejor tarjeta sd de gama pro que se puede comprar actualmente por cumplir con todo lo que promete y ser de una calidad constructiva sin parangón con ninguna otra marca.
4,Magnífica tarjeta para tu cámara rápida tanto en escritura como en lectura la utilizo con mi Sony A7 RIII y va muy bien merece la pena invertir en una buena tarjeta
5,Great v60 card.. slightly over priced.
4,No le doy 5 estrellas porque es muy cara pero va super bien en mi Olimpus OMD E-M1 mark II
3,I bought the Sony tough card because well they're tough and built to withstand stresses a bit better than a standard SD card. Which is great but as a resul they're thicker and would not fit my Canon R5 or R6 cameras.Write speed for 50mb 100 x Raw file tranfers was a consistent 125mb/s.
4,Habe die karte heute das erste mal genommen. war alles ok auch sehr schnellmehr kann ich leider noch nicht sagen  mein Sohn arbeitet schon länger damitfast täglich und ist top zufrieden .
4,A great SD card but the capacity is nowhere near 256GB it's actually closer to 245 GB which is almost 11 whole GBs less than it's supposed to have which is just crazy
5,Bought for high resolution stills camera to speed up its buffer clearance time. Your camera needs to have UHS II card slots to get the speed gains - otherwise save your money and get UHS I cards. This card is not Sony’s fastest but it keeps up with my camera’s write speed and is much cheaper than the 300mbs cards. I have never broken an SD card so the claimed toughness is an unknown but can’t hurt. My only gripe is that it’s thicker and just a bit harder to grip when getting it out of the camera.
2,I bought this card for my Leica M10-R but after around 20 images I noticed the writing speed were extremely slow compared to my other SD cards. Eventually the camera showed "SD Card Error" and stopped working.I tried to read the photos I took using my iMac 2019 unfortunately it was only able to see the directories but no photos. The photos were only visible to the camera.I tested the card with my SONY A7R3 it worked and also seems the speed was fine. I formatted the card using the SONY camera and took more photos then took to the iMac to read again no images.I think there might be a major compatibility issue with non UHS-II readers as both my iMac 2019 and Leica M10-R are not UHS-II capable.
5,Schede di memoria resistenti e professionali!
5,Tutto OK.
5,Después de tener varias tarjetas de igual capacidad pero de velocidades de escritura más lentas adquirí 2 de estas para grabación de vídeo en 4k. Debo decir que van estupendamente y cumplen todos y cada uno de los requisitos de mi cámara. A parte de esto las tarjetas son robustas y denotan una calidad por encima de la media.
5,Répond parfaitement à mes attentes de photographe amateur : rapidité robustesses et capacité. Une alternative aux cartes XQD et CFExpress certes plus rapides en lecture et écriture mais beaucoup plus onéreuses
5,Uso: videocamera professionale in risoluzione 4K/8KHa una buonissima velocità di scrittura fino a 256Mb al secondo quindi ottima per risoluzioni UHD non ho mai avuto problemi di lettura anche in uso intenso.Consiglio perché Sony è sempre una garanzia mi sono sempre trovato molto bene.Consiglio: controllare sempre la compatibilità sul proprio dispositivo prima dell’acquisto.
5,Zwei dieser Karten (128 GB UHS-II V60) habe ich für meine Fuji XT-3 (für 4K Videoaufnahmen) gekauft.Selbst bei 4K 60 fps mit 400Mbps keinerlei Probleme.Ich bin absolut zufrieden mit den Sony SF-M128T Karten.
5,Duradera  fiable y muy rápida. Importante para eventos sociales
5,Great card but check it's not under the current recall. I got this a year ago but this one was under Sony's recall and replacement scheme. If in doubt look at the back of the card and it should have a * Infront of the seriel number. If not it may have to be recalled.
5,Habe die SD Karte seit mehreren Wochen in meiner Sony A7 III im Einsatz war schon auf mehreren Hochzeiten. Alles wie beschrieben fühlt sich hochwertig an man spürt einen deutlichen Unterschied (in der Stabilität) zu herkömmlichen SD Karten! Werde wahrscheinlich komplett umstellen auf Tough Karten von Sony!
5,Una scheda sd-xc eccelsa veloce e sembrerebbe anche molto resistente (anche se solo il tempo potrà dirlo). Nelle raffiche è più veloce rispetto ad altre che possiedo nel liberare il buffer nella scrittura e anche nella lettura. Il costo è elevato rispetto ad altre ma ho preferito scegliere una scheda progettata per durare!
3,it's a good fast card but it only shows as 247gb. Also it should be made clearer that these cards work in regular card readers a special sony card reader is not needed.
5,Ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo è affidabilità
5,He abierto el producto pero no lo he usado todavía. Pero la entrega y el paquete son acordes a lo esperado.
2,I bought two of them for a Sony a7S III and with my surprise both cards got stuck into the corresponding slot. To take them out I have to use a tweezers. I had a SanDisk before and I didn't have this type of issue.I noticed though that this card is a slightly thicker than others could it be the issue?Anyone else had the same experience?Not sure if it's a camera issue or a card issue. I believe it'a a card dimension issue.I'm on the phone with Sony to figure it out.I will keep you posted.At the present time 2 stars sorry!
5,Die Karte habe ich für meine Panasonic G91 gekauft um 4K Videos ohne Probleme aufnehmen zu können.Das schafft diese Karte ohne merklich an ihre Grenzen zu stoßen. Auch Serienbilder mit 10 Fotos/sek kann ich scheinbar unendlich lange machen.Bin sehr zufrieden 😀
5,Die Karte hält was sie verspricht. In meiner A7r4 macht sie eine gute Figur 😉
5,Lectura muy rapida y muy buena velocidad de escritura.(He medido la velocidad real de escritura alrededor de 150 MB/s  )
4,Card did data failure for this money its should has no issues
5,Funziona molto bene. Nessun problema
2,Die SD Karte machte einen äußerlich stabilen Eindruck klemmte aber beim Einführen in den SD Kartenschacht. Sie schien ordnungsgemäß zu funktionieren. Durch Zufall habe ich dann aber über YouTube von fehlerhaften Karten und einem Austauschprogramm von Sony gehört.  Also auch wenn sie scheinbar ordnungsgemäß läuft kann der Fehler auftreten und die Daten sind futsch.Auf der offiziellen Serviceseite von Sony zum Produkt war vom Fehler und dem Austauschprogramm dazu nichts zu finden. Ich musste über Google die richtige Ansprechadresse finden. Ich musste Vorder- und Rückseite fotografieren und Sony zur Prüfung zuschicken. Nach der Prüfung erhält man dann von UPS einen Versendecode - wohl dem der eine Ups Station in seiner Nähe hat...Der Austauschvorgang dauert nun schon 2 Wochen. Ersatz ist nicht in Sicht. Ich bin gespannt wann der Ersatz kommt. Pech wenn man die Karte dringend benötigt dann darf man sich kurzfristig eine neue kaufen. Ganz schlechter Service für eine teure Karte von Sony.
5,Las mejores SD del mercado. Construidas en una sola pieza. No como las de otras marcas que se parten a la que te descuides.
2,come spesso capita con tutte le marche di schede può capitare la scheda che ad un certo punto della memoria corrompe i file. niente da aggiungere a me è andata così. sottolineo ho corso il rischio acquistandola a 120€ da Amazon werehouse quindi poteva succedere
5,Alles bestens !!!
1,Absolute rubbish SDXC card. Whether it's actually genuine Sony is debatable. Used once lost 75% of images due to corrupt memory. Stay clear if you value your captures and do not want to lose treasured memories.
4,Sembrano ottimi sicuramente non sono veloci come le G ma fanno il loro lavoro egregiamente.
5,Una memoria veramente indistruttibile diversa dalle altre fatta con materiale veramente buono .Prestazioni ottime ad un prezzo veramente accettabile.++++
5,I bought two of these to use in my Sony A7 R4 camera. No issues at all. Works very well in camera. Write  and read speed is very good to go with the very high resolution images produced by the camera. Very pleased with the purchase.
5,Forma particolare. Il corpo "dati" è un piccolo monoblocco la parte dei contatti sottile quasi strana a vederla un filo più precisa nell'essere inserita per il suo volume corpo molto rigido. Non ha il classico selettore laterale. La consiglio almeno una se avete due slot sulla macchina almeno quella di backup. Molto soddisfatto.
5,Thought I had camera problems until I read around and realised I needed a UHS II card for my Panasonic G9.These are very expensive cards and I invested in two of these BUT camera works fine now for 4k recording
5,Es una gran tarjeta super resistente y muy rápida no tanto como su hermana mayor pero ya le sobra relaciones calidad precio magnifica. La utilizo con la Sony a7rIII y el resultado magnifico.
5,Produit d’une excellente qualité. Ultra résistante et très rapide.
5,Diese Karte ist als schnelles Backup in einer DSLR wohl aktuell der beste Kompromiss aus Geschwindigkeit und Preis denn die superschnellen SD-Karten werden aktuell von den wenigsten DSLRs auch mit der vollen Geschwindigkeit beschrieben.
5,Stabil schnell professionell. So soll es sein.Klare Kaufempfehlung wenn man eine langlebige Karte möchte.
5,Muy buena tarjeta fiable pero cara
5,una memoria visibilmente più compatta stagna e robusta rispetto la normala velocità di scrittura e lettura è conforme alla specifica.
1,Bought this to use with my Sony A9ii. Slow to write to and much worse to read from in camera. Not compatible with my Windows 10 laptop. Overall very disappointed. Will try to get replacement from Sony who have recognised that there are problems with some of the Tough cards since 2020. If not successful will return to Amazon and have it replaced with a standard Sony UHS-II.
5,E ellent
4,SONY α9で使用 ダンス系ライブの写真撮影が多く2〜3時間で5000〜7000枚のRAW撮影が頻繁に有るので購入 以前は同じタフの128の300を使っていましたが、たまにカードの差し替えが必要でした 少しスピードが落ちるので不安な部分も有りましたがダンス系ライブなら充分カバーできているので満足しています αRⅲで動き物の撮影にも良さそうなので検討中です
5,La carte est rapide. Solide elle inspire confiance avec sont bloc plastique en un seul tenant.
1,Nachdem etwa 100 RAW-Fotos auf der Karte waren wurde der Import immer schleppender. Jetzt mit knapp 500 Fotos (ca. 225 GB von 64 GB sind belegt) lassen sich die neuen Fotos nicht mehr von der Sony-Kamera auf den Computer importieren. In Lightroom werden nur noch die ersten 10 bis 20 Bilder angezeigt für alle anderen Bilder heißt es: "Vorschau ist nicht verfügbar". Die Bildanzeige ist auch nicht im Windows Explorer möglich. Versucht man es trotzdem verschwindet die Karte aus dem Explorer.
5,Fait parfaitement le travail qu'on lui demande a voir sur le long terme évidement c'est sur ce point que l'on note ce genre de produit.
1,Sony Tough cards have made a name for themselves as being the best amongst the professionals. As a wedding photographer I bought two to start using in my Canon EOS R - stored photos fine on first use but I also took video files - most of which were corrupt. The camera couldn’t read the files and Sony’s repair/recover software failed miserable to save the footage (in fact if you have a Mac don’t hold out any hope that the software will finish its repair without crashing!). Never had any issues with Sandisk cards so not very pleased on the Sony’s first outing that this happened. Still storing photos fine just not tried again with video files since.
5,Carte rapide d'un prix correct
5,J'ai choisi cette carte pour sa rapidité à charger les fichiers en RAW + JPEG FINE. Pour l'instant j'en suis satisfait. Un seul problème: le prix beaucoup trop élevé
5,Ideal para las nuevas cámaras fotográficas qué requieren tarjetas rápidas.
5,Future proof for video shooting as well even though I'm not doing it right now.
5,Thanks working great!
5,O.k
5,Ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo
5,Ottima scheda SD
5,Good built quality and speed but the retail price is cheaper than on amazon.
1,LeiderLeider Für Sony A7R IV nicht zu Empfehlen!
5,Si scopre L acqua calda ! Perfetta
5,Perfetto Ottimo Qualità
5,気に入った。
5,Tutto ok .. alla grande .. consigliato .
1,This sd card didn't work properly with my GH5. I don't see anywhere mentioning compatibility issues but I 'd purchased 2 of them and both had issues with my Lumix. In result I lost footage because it was corrupted my camera was freezed and I had to take the battery out.Would not recommend!Even though I tried it on a Canon DSLR and it was working alright but still with some long loading times for photos.Instead I'm using Sandisk slower cards and they are working properly even for 4k.
5,Perfetta
2,La scheda non performa meglio di una comune micro Sandisk extreme pro nera non vale i soldi che costa. Restituita. velocità 60 in scrittura e 90 in lettura
5,Schnelle und zuverlässige Karte habe keine Probleme damit
5,Molto valida
1,My card keeps on having issues importing images onto my computer sometimes images don't import on the 1st or 2nd attempt and when they do it takes longer than my "slower" cards. I'll be sticking to Sandisk in the future.
5,Ottimo prodotto. Consigliato
5,Ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo veloce per le fotocamere moderne e ha una buona capienza
1,Salió una remesa de targetas defectuosas. Lamentablemente la mia es una de ellas. Sony tiene un servicio para cambiarla pero de momento está siendo una gimkana que no sé si va a salir bien (todo apunta a que no)
5,Ottima sd veloce e ben fatta vale i soldi spesi
1,Ich hatte in meiner neuen Sony Alpha 7C enorme Performance Probleme mit der Sony SD Speicherkarte. Nach mehrmaligen formatieren gab es leider keine Besserung. Meine deutlich preiswertere SanDisk SD Kart macht hingegen keinerlei Probleme und funktioniert tadellos!
2,この上のR300、W299を使っていたので、W150では明らかに遅くなってしまい、次に買いづらいです。それを比較しなければ、とても良い品物と思います。結局、値段次第で速くなるということですかね。
5,Velocissima e dall'aspetto estremamente solido. Consigliata.
1,Manche dieser Karten arbeiten nicht sachgemäß (Datenverlust) und fallen daher unter das SD-Karten-Austauschprogramm von Sony. Meine gehörte leider auch dazu.
1,Arrivata con una settimana di ritardo.Restituita dato che nel frattempo ne ho dovuta acquistare un’altra in negozio per poter andare a fare foto senA dover attendere i tempi di consegna che non erano nemmeno stati dichiarati dopo il messaggio di ritardo.
1,Karten fehlerhaft schlechter Sony Service.Kingston ist da etwas preiswerter und der Kartenleser ist auch dabei.
1,invece delle schede ho ricevuto un cartello "non disturbare" per la porta.di Dr. Troll fra l'altro...pazzesco
3,Fits in the camera and card reader slots too tightly grinding as it goes in. Worried it will damage the camera.
5,H2testw results:Write - 150Mbyte/sRead - 225MByte/sDelivery was fast for international shipping during pandemic.
4,I received this item on June 10th and it was shipped and packaged well.Then I opened and the packaging of the product had indentation and some tape（like selling detail）.  When I opened the package the product inside was like pics—used and also had a clear color tape inside.   This is not related to item sales information.  I need a damaged product and what I received is a second-hand symbol with a damaged package.I didn't test card yet but I may find somebody‘s data，funny！Thats not what I wantBecareful abour warehouse dealThey lie to customer
5,Estaba nervioso de comprar esta SD por comentarios de que en un tiempo tenían una falla y que la Sony tubo que reponer varias (pueden reponer la tarjeta pero no tu información) pero sabiendo que ya lo habían solucionado me arriesgué ha funcionado muy bien para mi la he llenado completamente con video 4k a 100Mb/s y sin problema la descarga a mi Mac ha sido extremadamente rápida con un lector de tarjetas UHS-II externo en menos de 10 min subo los 128GB en el ordenador (lo que con otras tarjetas y en el lector tradicional tardaba mas de 2 horas). La garantía de 5 años y la compleción robusta y dura da confianza es verdad que en algunas cámaras tiende a trabarse porque es levemente más gruesa pero en mis cámaras Sony no han tenido ese problema. Así que hasta ahora estoy muy contento con mi compra y por eso le doy 5 estrellas.
5,Sony’s TOUGH SDXC cards are the way to go if you want little to no buffer and a reliable storage device.
5,Good value if on deal feels solid.
1,It doesn't work after couple of times use.
5,great for 12fps raw - buffer clears quickly
5,Product as describe. Having a fast card is definitely a game changer. The fact it’s built to resist tough environnement is a real +. Especially when doing outdoor photography in Canada weather :)
5,Same as described
5,Very good and reliable best cards
5,Quel carte rapide solide (trés trés) on se sent ressuré de l'utilisé aucun défaut. Le service de sony à aussi bine assuré lorsqu'il y à eu une mauvaise série cela s'est réglé en 2 semaines. Top.
5,one of the most reliable sd card on the market
4,Works well as expected
