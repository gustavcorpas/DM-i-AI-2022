5,Over the last few years I've used many mice ranging from cheap but solid stuff like Redragon's lineup to Corsair's mid-range to SteelSeries' signature Rival 710. All have been usable but to differing degrees of my personal preference and comfort.No mouse I've touched has fit my hand like this one. I really wanted more than just 2 side buttons and this obviously delivers there as well being an ambidextrous mouse. I typically like heavier mice (such as the Rival 710) but this one isn't too light for my comfort despite not being a heavy mouse by any means. It's light but big enough that the light weight doesn't make the maneuverability feel shaky for my taste.This is also the first mouse I've used that supports 8KHz polling (although I probably won't be using anything over 1k) and though I can't comment on how practically useful it is having the feature without a premium is of course a massive win. This mouse doesn't sacrifice anything. It has all the utility you could want (unless you're someone who uses your mouse for all your macros in an MMORPG I suppose). It also features very solid and configurable RGB lighting in 3 different places across the mouse. It has a dual sensor setup and this is where the mouse I paid $15 for completely eradicates the $100 Rival 710. This mouse feels 100x more accurate between lifting movements. I don't have to lift very often but a quick test between the 2 mice will easily favor this one as the Rival 710 often continues tracking while the mouse is lifted a decent bit which is a disgusting feeling in my opinion.Overall this mouse has everything I was looking for in a mouse a little more and ultimately fits my tastes better than any other I've used.The Corsair Harpoon RGB Wireless (while having admittedly amazing wireless capability) is simply too small for my hand and grip preference and is also too light for my taste. It would be a solid general pick though granted the $20 wired variant feels better for what you get price-wise.The Rival 710 has a ton of "premium" features that honestly end up being a waste of time and money (like the OLED screen. There's a ton you can do with it but I never found myself actually caring to look at it and I quickly disabled the Discord integration as I'd rather see my custom GIF anyways). The third side button is a handy plus but definitely does not constitute the price. I also personally think that SteelSeries' GG software & SteelSeries Engine are clunky ugly (when going between the GG software and the Engine which feels like a separate program forced inside a new one) and obnoxious. I know iCUE is a heavy beast but honestly it does a way better job of focusing on what it's meant for. SteelSeries insists on trying to fit 5 completely different functionalities into a single piece of software. Why do I need my config software for my KB & mouse recording my gameplay when it just ends up being inferior to most other methods anyways? Finally the vibration is the coolest feature in concept except that only games that support SteelSeries' API support it (an underwhelming and mixed bag of games overall). It could've been a killer feature if there was some way to have the mouse receive xinput vibration...Slamming other mice aside (I know I didn't mention Redragon and that's because there isn't much to say; if you want a reliable mouse with most of what you need for an insanely cheap price they're a good buy) this mouse is my personal favorite and for $15 there is nothing that will compare in any sense. The weight and the texture feel a bit cheap but from a functional standpoint I would've absolutely paid the original listing price for this mouse.
5,Wired mice are different than they used to be. Years ago I switched to a Bluetooth mouse for my desktop PC because the wired mouse I had was cumbersome. Recently the Bluetooth mouse I had broke and after two attempts at finding an affordable reliable replacement failed I thought I would give the X12 (@ $14.99) a try because it was available at a price range I want to pay for a mouse.So far I am very happy I did. This mouse is great! The cord is so light I don't even know it's there. The mouse glides so smoothly that it feels like it is on ice. The buttons are quiet and the software lets me dim the lighting to a level more suitable for me.  If I had only known about these new lightweight cord types I would have made the switch to a wired mouse sooner. It feels and performs so much better than the old wireless one I had.For the price I paid I highly recommend the X12 for those with a desktop PC (productivity/ web surfing/ some RPG gaming). I would say any PC computer but it has a 6' USB cord which may be too long for those wanting a portable solution.
4,I’m left-handed and I also use my left hand for gaming. The side effect is that I tend to buy just about every name-brand symmetrical gaming mouse I can get my southpaw on. My daily drivers are usually a Logitech G903 Lightspeed and a Razer Lancehead.I wasn’t expecting to like the EVGA X12 the review I had read was favorable but it raised some doubts. Plus it wasn’t wireless. My initial reaction is that the braided cable seems a little loose more shoelace than paracord. The main buttons seem marginally sloppier than the old Lancehead but do the job quite well. Then I noticed how light it is and how it glided across the mouse pad with less friction than anything else I own and the tracking was stable and fast without being twitchy. Also the software makes it easy to switch the buttons to a left-handed mouse unlike G Hub.Next thing I know I’m plugging it into the laptop to use instead of the Lancehead just because it glides so well and then switching it back to the desktop as well. The G903 is dusty and probably needs a charge. So naturally I had to buy the X12 in white.Make it wireless and I’ll own another 2.
5,I’ve been using this mouse for about a month. In the last year I bought a went from a hyperx pulse fire raid to a razer basilisk v2 to a Logitech g303 shroud. I also briefly tried the razer viper mini and the steelseries rival 5.  I really liked the feel and weight of the g303 but the pinky side seems to be angled slightly too aggressively causing me to get underneath the mouse a bit too much sometimes accidentally lifting the mouse when in a heated gunfight. I mostly got the x12 because I wanted to try an 8000hz polling mouse (the viper mini had an unusable LOD in my opinion) but also thought the mouse looked like a good compromise on the side angles and is similar weight to g303. I want to be able to get my fingers underneath the mouse sides a bit but not so much so that I end up holding it in my hand more than pressing into mat. It is exactly what I was hoping for in this regard. The only thing that I’m unsure of is the finger rest in the pinky side. The way it is positioned I end up grabbing the very front edge of it with my pinky. In a way I think it helps my grip feel more locked in but it does feel a bit awkward at first. One thing I absolutely love about this mouse is the convex and higher primary (left right click) button height. I use a fingertip grip find that the higher angle suits the natural arc of my fingertips better than lower concave primary buttons allowing me more comfortably grip and click those buttons while manipulating the mouse. The buttons have a great solid click weight and don’t feel so light that I’m going to accidentally press them just by resting my fingers on them. While it did not affect performance I thought the body felt a tad slick with dry fingers so I added some lizard skins to the sides to feel more locked in. As far as the performance of the sensor I notice no difference in the quality of the tracking compared to any of the mice I used for extended periods of time. I primarily play apex and used 8000hz but seemed to occasionally have some kind of freezing stuttering issue so I reduced to 4000hz and haven’t had an issue. Eventually games should supposedly have better optimization for higher polling rates. My pc is all newest architectures for components so don’t think the stuttering would be hardware related on my end. I would most likely not have tried this mouse if it was not 30 dollars but I’m glad that I did.
4,The extra buttons are annoying. Everything about the mouse is great. The ability to program your buttons to do what ever you want is amazing. But depending on want you want those buttons to do can cause problems.I've programmed the extra side buttons to open programs that I use often.My only issues is some of the buttons are to far back on the mouse where it's near the inner parts of my ring finger and the way I hold my mouse I can some times jerk my hand and grip the mouse with my fingers and accidently press one of these program buttons and open a program.This happens often when I have to right click. Annoying...I wish the buttons were a little further forward. But I don't think that's possible because they designed the mouse to work with both Left and Right handed users and the thumb side buttons are just in the right place. Even though I accidently press those buttons too from time to time. But not as much as my index finger side.
4,The mouse is zippy responsive and feels pretty good in the hand. It's a little light and could be a touch bigger but that could be me. My biggest gripe is I can't turn off the glowing lights from the mouse itself (holding down the profile button or something would be great). Instead I have to download software... which I'm not allowed to install on my work computer. So while I'm liking the mouse I'm stuck forever watching the glow.
4,I got this x12 mouse and the Evga z12 keyboard.Using them on Win11. I update both firmware. I have a problem. I cannot put Windows into sleep mode as it immediately wakes up now. I don't know if it's the mouse or keyboard causing the problem. Sometimes I restart Windows and the keyboard does light up but I cannot type my password to log into Windows. I have to fully shutdown pc and then the keyboard works.The mouse has a lot of customization on it once you download the Evga software for it.
5,Dont know why this has so many bad reviews! the only problem ive had is the cable not being fully braided the braid just covers what feels like a fairly thin sleeving other than that works great i use it for Overwatch WoW Dead by Daylight and others and its great
5,Fits my XL hand well has a long flexible fabric encased cord.  Super smooth on surface clicks and scrolls are accurate and pleasant.  8000 DPI is crazy fast.  LED RGB are cool but control software is only for Windows 7-11.  That being said it is working great on my Mac Mini M1 but no control over the RGB so it just cycles.  Not used for gaming.  I like this better than my $50 Microsoft Win10 mouse.
4,The brand name and sale price are the main draw for this item but it is surprisingly comfortable in the hand despite the much lighter weight than I'm used to.There are only two extra buttons (I guess four if you count the mirrored pair).The cord seems to be woven fiber which is new for me but I like it.It is plug and play but without the software you cannot control the lights which are so bright they are distracting and at least from my arm angle shine right back into my face.
5,Pretty decent mouse light enough to move around quickly heavy enough to not make you over aim. comfy to use for long.
5,It’s really smooth and the handle is amazing. Really love how you can customize the colours  <3
5,Great mouse. Use on a secondary gaming PC and it works well even for someone with large hands like me. Better than those cheaper mice that only seem to last for a few months.
5,It does exactly what I need it to do.
5,Compré éste mouse para el niño y le gustó muchoes el que actualmente está usando para sus juegos.
5,My Wife loved the new mouse and was happy about the high dpi. The rgb lights were definitely a plus. Very nice product and a plug and play success. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a decent price mouse with high end expectations.
5,So I did purchase this mouse as a present for a co-worker but she changed her mind regarding the color she was looking for.  This led to me returning this mouse unopened.  Having said that I replaced it with the same exact model in white which I did gift to my co-worker.  She loves the mouse and says it's great.  I'm sure this one would have been and is just as great since the only difference is the color.  Based on that I feel like I can recommend this one as well if you are looking for an affordable gaming mouse in black instead of white.
5,I got this as a birthday gift and I love it! It takes me some getting used to with the side buttons but over all it is great! The app was easy to download and more easy to operate it.
5,just what i  was looking for
5,It's a good mouse and it doesn't go crazy with wacky buttons all over it
3,I tried to like it. The physical profile is a little smaller than what I am used to. I have pretty big hands and while this does feel comfortable for day to day use I find it slightly smaller than I'd like for good accurate control. The left side thumb buttons are in a good spot. The right side would most likely be in a good spot too if I were left handed. I'm not though. So anytime I try and use the right side thumb buttons I completely miss button 4 and hit 5 instead. Also the way my hand wraps around it I'm finding myself accidentally keying right side button 5 more often than I should be. It's definitely a 1st world problem and the fact that I only paid $12 definitely helps mitigate the annoyance factor. All in all decent intro mouse for gaming. Just don't get too serious for FPS or if you have giant meat hooks like I do.
3,It's not terrible but if certainly feels very cheap. I would never pay $30 for this and feels like a $10 mouse. It's very light and cheap feeling. If you are planning on gaming look for another style.
5,Bought it on sale...great premium product.
3,I really did not like the mouse as a gaming mouse. For my office job it is just fine. Wouldn't recommend it if you like to play. I keep it as my travel/ back up mouse.
5,Yeah
3,Pretty good ergonomically. I also appreciate the fact that I can use it with my left hand.What really annoys me is the lightning. I like to sit in a dark room and use dark mode on the monitors. But the glowing mice just ruin my focus. I really need a way to turn the lights off. I do not understand what kind of person with damaged peripheral vision would enjoy these lights.
3,This mouse looks very good works well but it is not comfortable maybe I'll get use to it but for now overall its getting a 3 star.
5,Mouse muy economico para las excelentes caracteristicas que posee muy buen funcionamiento el cable se nota que es de calidad rapida respuesta y facil configuracion.
5,A good bit lighter than my old Alienware mouse side buttons work great. Been very nice for casual gaming so far!
1,This is a terrible mouse I absolutely hate it. The extra buttons on BOTH SIDES of the mouse lead to so many unintentional clicks and holds with the only real option being to disable them except that disables the left side and right side buttons at the same time as they correspond. They don't function properly with Xmouse and while I was excited at the seemingly few obnoxious LEDs compared to other gaming mice these LEDs are somehow brighter than my former mouse. It's big and uncomfortable it doesn't perform well it isn't compatible with my software - a waste of $16.
5,Works great
1,Not even worth 15 bucks. right side buttons get pressed sometimes when I'm just moving the mouse around. And the main left button will do double or even triple clicks from just one press. Constantly annoying me.
1,Pretty much exactly after one month the wheel stopped working properly.  It stutters when wheeling and sometimes goes backwards when wheeling forward or it doesn't work at all.  The shortest lasting mouse I have ever had in my 30 years in the computer industry.
1,A mouse i bought at goodwill lasted me for 3 years. This "new" mouse costed 5x more and the scroll wheel does not operate how it should.
5,Si necesitas botones adicionales en un ambiente shooter competitivo lo ideal en mi opinión son los de la derecha; que muchos mouses para diestros no tienen. El click con el dedo anular resulta natural y casi no hay que moverlo para clickear. En cambio los del lado izquierdo necesitan curvar tu pulgar lo que cansa el dedo y la articulación.
5,Switched from a razer death adder v2 to the x12 and I love it. Feels more comfortable than the razer has equal or better build quality and is just as light. However the best part is the onboard memory stores your lighting settings.
5,it arrived way earlier than i expected. it is a bit bigger and somewhat heavier than most mice i've used. quite responsive and features are easy to use. i played my online game with it and was surprised how well it made the game flow. i recommend  this for gaming and general PC use.
5,I was hoping that this would be better than the X17 and it did not fail. They got every thing correct with this one.
5,Buenos materiales pero un poco incomodo por los botones de la derecha pero no me quejo por el precio.
5,Es un mouse preciso y muy ligero. La ergonomía es cómoda para manos grandes. Tiene un excelente sensor y el cable es muy cómodo. La calidad de construcción es buena. Tiene como características notables el rango de DPI y la frecuencia de muestreo. Lo uso principalmente para FPS y productividad. La experiencia de uso ha sido grata. Me gustó tanto que compré otros dos en promoción y con precio bajo.
