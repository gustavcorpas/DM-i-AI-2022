5,I purchased both the Wolfbox G900 and hardware kit through Amazon.  Having the camera at the back of my long Suburban greatly improves visibility when backing out of a parking space and makes hitching up my trailer very easy.  I chose the G900 after watching and reading many reviews.  For me the following were important considerations.  1) No battery in the unit they use a super capacitor. (I live in hot environment)  2) The mirror must be usable when the camera is off. 3) Must have reverse lines. 4) Vendor needs to have good overall reviews.The G900 meets all of my requirements. It has a great picture and gives me a large field of view.  Although I wanted the reverse lines I am not sure they are really required after using it for a few weeks.  The mirror is dark but usable when the camera is off.  Also I do wish I could change the magnification/zoom on the rear camera.  I find that objects in the display are much closer than they appear to be.  I'd like to magnify them so they appear closer to reality.  I tend to use the side mirrors to double check distances. I think I will get used to this over time.WolfBox's customer service is amazing.  They responded to several emails I sent them and even offered up and sent me a a few accessories to improve my installation. They even followed up afterwards to see if I needed any other assistance.  As you may be able to tell  I am impressed.
4,ACC might be tagged/labeled as BATT+ and BATT+ might be tagged/labeled as ACC which will make you crazy trying to figure out the problem and how to fix. Mine were caused me to have to return the hardwire kit and the camera.  Figured it out because it seems that this same product is sold as a kit for a different camera (the camera I got) and after having the same weird problem I determined that the tags were wrong.  Total PITA.  If you just reverse the labels the thing seems to work fine for its intended purpose.
5,aesthetics 10x better than cigarette lighter plug
5,Product works as described I only wish it provided more then one type of fuse.
5,El toma corriente todo perfecto
5,Great product for the price
5,Had to buy separately
5,Great camera for night time driving.  Looks fantastic no blinding lights from rear
2,Make sure you check your fuse type. This will not fit micro2 fuses. Had to buy the proper fuse taps and cut and replace the fuse taps included on this hardwire kit. Also ignore the instructions that say 15-25A and under 30A the included fuse taps are rated for 15A max each.
1,I installed this kit where the fuse box is located under hood. Even after drilling a 1/2 hole that I didn't like to do the fixed fuses won't fit so I had to cut the wires so I could fish them through the hole. Rubber gromets would be nice to include. I used silicone and hope it doesn't cut the tiny wires over time. Others have it so they plug in to the other end of the wire and the fuses can be replaced if need be. Not these. The wires are tiny splicing them together was a nightmare! After 2.5 hrs it's in and working now. I wanted it this way so if someone hits my car when I'm not there and not use the cigarette lighter plug-in. I am very mechanical incline. This should have only taken 20 minutes. Not if the fuse box is under the hood....
5,This hardwire kit is nice and would have worked had the camera I bought it for worked as it was supposed to.
4,Night vision could have been better specifically  light reflection and reading the number plate is pretty hard at night time. I hope this will be improved.  I also want to know how to do software update for this product.
5,Happy with the kit it worked fine but I sent the camera back and didnâ€™t need this fixing kit.
1,Save your money! This is the worst purchase I've made. I purchased this hardwire kit to power an android phone because it claims "Type-C port  5V/2A steady output voltage". That's a sufficient specification but the item FAILED to provide enough power to prevent battery drain as though there was no power output. Not impressed!
5,easy hardwire setup shame about the mirror tho.
