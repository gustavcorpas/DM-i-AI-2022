5,Got this for my son and he loves it. The price was great and the item came in great condition and was better than I could imagine!!
5,I found myself needing a new laptop and wasn't sure what to buy. I was a little hesitant about getting one smaller than what I had. This laptop fits the bill exactly and I much enjoy the smaller profile and screen size is not an issue.
4,Es un computador muy completo y cuenta con muchas configuraciones que me han facilitado el trabajo
3,I bought this HP Stream because my 2012 Mac is dead and I really don't use a computer anymore. My iPhone 12 Pro works just fine for everyday use and I just can't afford to buy a new Mac right now. So I just needed an inexpensive little computer to connect to the internet to do personal business and take online classes. I do not intend to store anything on this computer but rather continue to use my iCloud for storage and Google Apps if necessary.You can download the necessary cloud apps such as iCloud Google Drive and shortcuts to Google Docs Sheets or whatever you like. Once I got the computer set up I went in and uninstalled Microsoft Office. I don't care that it's free for a year. Google Suite works just fine.I've used this computer quite a bit and this is what I think about it...Contrary to the negative reviews this computer doesn't suck. You just can't have high expectations of a $350 laptop. You will be setting yourself up for a bitter disappointment. With that said....The mouse and keyboard are horrible and uncomfortable to use for my taste. Granted I don't intend to use it away from home very often but I did a couple of times and it really doesn't function like I'm used to. Also I can't really say for certain that the wi-fi connections were all that great. It could've been the networks I was connected to. For some reason it wouldn't let me connect to my iPhone hotspot. I don't know if there is a setting that I have to adjust but it shouldn't have been that difficult to connect.However it works FANTASTIC when I switch out my work laptop and connect it to my desk set up where it's hardwired to the internet and connected to a USB keyboard and mouse.  I am able to do personal business that requires me to use a computer rather than my iPhone. This computer IS NOT built to have sophisticated software installed such as Office FilemakerPro Quickbooks Photoshop etc. It is also not meant to store large files or photos. It is PERFECT to use cloud based software and storage.I recommend this laptop as an internet terminal and NOTHING MORE! I cannot express this enough....do not expect it to perform in any other way. It's a perfect light use laptop to connect to social media (if that's your thing) or even school  or access websites that you really can't on your smartphone. It's an affordable option as a transitional workstation.Some people complained about not being able to update Windows due to lack of disk space. I suggest that you make sure you purge temporary files internet cache and downloads often. Also uninstall applications that you do not use or are unnecessary. This will free up a bunch of disk space. If you are using Office360 this will take up a ridiculous amount of disk space. I know it's free for the first year...but is that really worth your low disk space frustration? While you could get a Chromebook I'm not keen to them. In a Windows OS you can set up Google Suite. It's cloud based free and doesn't have a trial period. You won't have to pay a subscription to keep and all your documents photos etc. They will be gone if you don't move them out of OneDrive and to another cloud storage at the end of the trial period. Why bother? Just set up Google account which comes with free storage use their version of Word Excel Powerpoint etc and you don't have to install it on your computer. WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER!
5,Arrived like new and prior to expected date. Love this laptop.
4,I purchased this laptop with the sole purpose of installing Linux. I didn't want to mess with my better computers Secure Boot to try to dual boot it. I  had read on one website that this particular model and this processor worked well with Linux.I'm happy to report that Manjaro XFCE Linux installed and booted flawlessly. The only thing I had to do was change the display resolution - very easy to do with the graphical tools included. The only problem was a setting the proper time. I had to do that through the terminal but was extremely simple and has maintained the proper time ever since.The display quality doesn't match my more expensive laptop but is more than  acceptable for normal use including watching videos. The computer is fairly responsive for normal use including watching videos.  All in all  I am happy with this computer for running a Linux distribution.
5,This is an excellent laptop for what I do; writing and researching.  It is fast and easy to negotiate.  It arrived on time with no issues.  If you're into gaming probably not the machine for you  but for basic needs it will work very well.
5,Screen stopped working on its own
5,OK this is my second Stream.  The original was a 32GB that is still operating and is obviously limited by the couple GB remaining after the operating system space.  However was useful for web browsing.  This one is 64GB and that leaves about 30GB space for programs plus one year of MS Office free.  I got rid of the Windows 10 S mode and the speed for web browsing and program operation is fine.  And I'm used to an Intel 11th generation i5 on a desktop and have no complaints. That is an absolutely amazing unit for $200.  Of course in both cases I've added extra room using a USB 128GB flash drive so really it's a fantastic deal.  The only con that I've found so far is that the sound is rather puny but connecting a cheap bluetooth speaker solves that issue.  Update:  I hooked this up to an external monitor and it gave me an option to go from the native internal screen resolution of 1366x768 to 1920 x 1080 and it shows up great on the external monitor.  I'm shocked.  I cannot believe this computer was $200.  Well we'll see how long it lasts.
2,I'm writing this for a typical user using plain language so they know what they are getting into.I've been in the IT profession for 27 years. For most of that time I fixed other people's machines for a living; dealing with the demands of an engineering workforce. I also use PhotoShop a lot on my home workstation which is a monster configured for performance so yes I know what I'm talking about.I bought this laptop knowing it was a toy. The only thing I'm going to used if for is surfing the web and checking email using a browser. I don't need it to do anything crazy but I want to have more control over what little data I plan to store on it than a Chromebook. For the record this was to replace a 6 year old HP Pavilion x2 Detachable. So a 5 star rating means it does everything I want it to do at least as well as the machine it replaced and not my graphics monster. I'm approaching this review as if I was a typical customer.My preferred browser is Opera so I had to get this machine out of S Mode to install it. It's the only change I made to the initial setup from HP. S Mode is not it's fault that's a Windows thing. We don't deal with S Mode in the corporate world so it took a little research to discover that removing it is an app off the MS Store.My first impression was it's pretty terrible. Opera frequently had lag while typing and that isn't good at all. Edge the default browser wasn't much better. Very slow to load pages and a lot of buffering on youtube. I almost returned it until I mucked around a bit and experimented. I found that Avast Secure Browser gave me the performance I expected from a low end machine. But it took work that is beyond an average user's knowledge and skills to make it adequate and that's a serious problem.Honestly if it came optimized the way I made it I'd give it a 4 maybe 5. BUT it took work beyond the skills of a normal user... that would make it a 3 if you only wanted to do web browsing and email. BUT (again) it's offering Office 365 free for a year and based on what I saw there is absolutely no way this machine can handle Office.... so that's why it gets a 2.If you're looking for a light weight low power machine for web surfing and email that has better data management than a Chromebook then this is an adequate machine. Do not expect it to be good enough for a child's school computer... please.
5,Daughter use for online school so flawless no issues
4,It's a good product and light weight. I've been using for 2 months and haven't seen any problems yet.
5,My granddaughter love it  light and easy to carry around the house during her visit
3,My daughter has not used the Laptop much yet because it is for college. So far my only issue is that we ordered Royal blue and got black and it seems to be smaller then the 14inch we ordered as well. Since she needed the device before we took her to school we just let it go this time. Once classes begin and she starts using it we will do an updated review.
4,These things are great particularly in the day of escalating pc/laptop prices.  Obviously not a lot of memory and it's not going to be a primary business laptop but I bought 2 for staff members who have very basic computer needs.  They are mostly on Google Drive and webmail use Excel occasionally and they have been great.  My IT person said something to the effect of "these are surprisingly peppy."  Just bought a 3rd for another person who is helping.  Can't beat them for the price.
4,El anuncio dec√≠a 64MB y me enviaron de 32 MB
5,Upon opening and charging the laptop a virtual assistant introduces itself and offers to help set the basic features up. Signing into my Microsoft Onedrive allowed and immediate download of my MS Office subscription. It sets up a security password up front. Connects to your wifi without u having to search. I was up and running in 15-20 mins. Sleek thin and light. So far so good.
5,Idk about some of these reviews but this have been great since I got it this morning it‚Äôs fast battery life is great I will check back an a few weeks an give another update I had to buy another computer because my first one didn‚Äôt have everything I needed for school but this is amazing I love this laptop
5,I had a previous chromebook for my son and he outgrew it plus I had to repair it which cost me $150 + tax to get fix. My son started to use it again and lasted until May when it died. No fix this time I went for a larger Chromebook. This time larger screen 9 inch model not a good fit for videos for teens. I had a Macbook Pro which he used with my wife and they were almost coming to blows on who was using it. I had checked out Walmart for this computer but it was $100 more. I was checking reviews and one review said this was a good one and the price was good. I checked and agreed. My son got it on his birthday. All smiles with braces. He like the color too. I got mad props from my wife and son. It came with Windows 10 suit pre installed and 1 year free. This was also a great value for me. This will do for at least 3 years. Macbook no  not at that price.
5,The laptop came as described and has no issues whatsoever. If you're going to be using it for school or light office work then you should be fine.
4,I may have received a newer model or something but the version I received did not have three full sized USB A ports like depicted in the description. I did have a need for three USB ports for my application so this was important in me choosing this particular model. Instead my version has two full sized USB ports and one USB C port. This is a higher speed port which is why I think the version I received is a newer version so might be a good thing for most but in my case that difference meant I had to buy an additional $9 cable to convert the USB C to USB A.Also no big deal but the version I received has the SD card reader on the right side of the unit not the left side of the unit like depicted in the product description. Otherwise computer does everything I need it to do at a budget price.
2,EDIT: Within a day of writing the original review the mousepad completely locked up on this 3 month old laptop. What an absolute waste of money. Lesson learned.ORIGINAL REVIEW9/15/22 I find myself using this thing more than I expected. The mouse is absolutely terrible. It gets stuck and I have to mess with the dang thing until it releases the ‚Äúdown press‚Äù. The mouse jumps around and is an all around pain. Also I hate that the keyboard is not backlit it feels cheap and flimsy.
5,I needed a new laptop as I have not bought a decent one since 2000. One teeny tiny screened netbook and one borrowed laptop that doesn't hold a charge in between really made me feel the lack. There are loads of bad reviews saying there isn't enough memory to do anything with this particular model. I only really wanted it for some tax work and light internet browsing and it has been great so far. It's nice a light (those models from the early 2000s looked fabulous to us since we were all used to desktops but wow were they heavy!) I haven't used the laptop long enough to drain the battery in one go so I'm not sure exactly how long the charge lasts but it's at least a few hours. I enjoy the portability of this unit the keyboard feels nice and the screen size is perfect for casual usage. Clearly this isn't the fancies unit out there but if all you need is some light internet and Microsoft usage this is a great unit and reasonably priced. Here's hoping it will hold up for years to come.
5,Like it
3,As above.  If you need portable and low cost for web and typing it's great.  Mostly describing feel since that hard to gauge from specs.Keyboard has a good laptop layout with dedicated home/end/pgup/pgdwn/del buttons along the right side though no context-menu key.  Up/down keys are halfsize. All keys feel low cost but not outright cheap.Mousepad is a bit rough with touch for left-click and flexible corners for left and right rather than dedicated buttons.  Does feel cheap though still useable.Shell actually feels better than most mid-tier laptops I've handled.  All plastic but smooth and lean with no rough seams.  Very light.  Screen swivel is sturdy.Screen and sound are adequate;. Probably not great for streaming services if that's a major concern but par for cost.Half of the very small hard drive is OS so you may want to price an SD card into the equation before making a decision though 25-30gb is more than sufficient for web and basic use
3,It does what is intended. The only problem was the charger brick went bad a couple of weeks after my daughter started using it. Had to buy a replacement for it.
5,I did not realize that there was no cd player with this laptop. I should have checked it out more thoroughly before I purchased it. Though it seems to be a great PC.  I had trouble getting it to eccept my printer. Technology has really advanced.
4,It holds battery life all day and is easy to take in tight areas like cars or trains. Only dislike its memory capacity as it will not store videos. Also if you download any app that is not windows recommended it will exit the secure mode.
3,Shift key was broken within hours of using it and I had to return it. The edge is very sharp and made my forearms hurt when typing. I just didn't like this laptop
3,I didn‚Äôt wanna spend a lot on a laptop I wanted one that was reasonable that had good reviews but I should‚Äôve went with the reviews that weren‚Äôt so good.It is very slow.I‚Äôve only had a couple days and I‚Äôm already not happy with it & most likely going to return & end up getting one that is a little bit more expensive.Even though a lot of the good reviews are ones for kids who need it for homeschooling it probably doesn‚Äôt matter to them if it‚Äôs not very fast it & does what it needs to do. I‚Äôll have websites windows close out on me randomly goes slow have to click on some thing a bunch of times before it actually works.Another thing that sucks is after only having it for a couple days it had to do a system update.I stop paying attention after it was half an hour that it still said restarting.Seriously?? It shouldn‚Äôt take THAT LONGlaptop is ridiculously slow & stupidThe royal blue is gorgeous though.I don‚Äôt have a work from home job or anything but I still wanna laptop that‚Äôs gonna be better than this.
4,No touch screen so im not sure why it asks for stars on that. I immediately took it out of S mode because its kind of pointless. That was super simple to do. The computer overall is very lightweight and nice. My only complaint is for a 2019 laptop the graphics are pretty bad. Very grainy. I have to push the screen back at an angle to make it slightly better. For the price it works well.
4,I really like this laptop. I am using it for work and it is great. I do wish it were a bit faster but overall a great purchase!
5,I bought this for my ex husband to replacement his older notebook of the same brand. He's not very tech savvy and definitely not a power pc user. He primarily uses it to watch movies YouTube videos and to work on office documents. He was able to set it up and connect to Wi-Fi and use it by himself right away. He's still very happy with it after having had it for over a month. It does everything he needs to do. It was a perfect for him. It's a great inexpensive option for non gaming younger and older computer users.
2,Case is not blue.  Just old hp charcoal grayThere is no media card readerCame with windows 11 which sucks not 10 home as listedI had specific reasons for those items.Another Amazon bait and switch
4,Bought for school and basic use.  It's lightweight attractive in blue.  Has 3 USB ports and 1 HDMI.  With an external disk drive I was able to load some necessary programs off CD-ROMs.  So far very pleased with it.
3,Bought this for my 19 year old son it did an update and doesn't work at all now. The screen blinks and never turns on. We hooked it up HDMI and tried to get a visual that way and nothing!!! I'm not impressed at all pretty disappointed that HP even put their name on this! Nothing was downloaded so its not like a virus attacked it. We've had it 3 1/2 months and its dead!? You dont get quality with stuff these days.
5,Good for light use. Performs well.
5,I purchased the laptop for my granddaughter in middle school she loves it.
1,Do not purchase this laptop.  It was messed up  and didn't work.  I sent it back and they won't return my money.  I paid 214.00 and they gave me 114.00 of my money back and said they rest is for restocking fee. The Laptop was not in working order to start with but unfortunately I'm having to pay for it.  Don't do it.  They will keep your money and the laptop that don't work.
3,I would consider this a cheap laptop that's ment for entry level tasks. If I had it to do over I would not buy it.
1,Between the dumpster fire that is Windows 11S and the usual array of HP bloatware the computer is next to unusable without wiping the hard drive and doing a fresh install of Windows 10. Will not allow you uninstall edge pushes Mcafee antivirus even after you have installed your preferred software. Throws an endless array of buzzword filled warnings at you in an attempt to make you panic and keep you from installing another browser or disabling S mode which basically forces you into using only their app store with it's rather sad and small section of approved apps unless disabled. Won't even allow you to set the time and date manually. If you set your privacy settings to keep the computer from broadcasting your location your clock will be incorrect and you will have no way to reset it. Trash all the way around.
3,It's an okay computer. Not too bad. It does what I need it to. Very low storage space and it's noticeably slower than my 10 year old Toshiba (this was when I first plugged it in out of the box before I even loaded anything onto it so it wasn't because I had it overloaded or anything) but the battery life has been great and it's just a work computer for me so it works just fine. If does the job but anything more than web surfing and saving a handful of documents you wouldn't want this computer it's just not meant for anything above basic use.
3,I was really hoping this computer would work out however it is extremely slow and the battery does not hold a charge
5,It doesn't have a touch screen but computer works perfect
3,The computer itself is OK no complaints. Good value for money. The only reason I am leaving 3 stars is that I ordered in royal blue color and I received pink one which was disappointing for me. The return is not an option since it's an international order and I already paid international transport customs taxes etc. so there is no logic. Anyway not OK at all.
5,I purchased this laptop for secondary use with a hobby of mine.  This unit seems to fit the bill for size weight and ease of use.  I have not tasked it with any memory-hogging apps.  I am very happy with it.  I do not know why Amazon is asking me to rate the touchscreen as this model does not come with one.
1,How on earth does have such high reviews?  I have not had this laptop for no more than a few hours and already it is too slow to load basic things such as shut down or settings.  It is basically frozen and I cannot do anything on it.  I absolutely will be returning this.  I better get my money back.
5,I was looking for a laptop under $300 that I could use for personal use for budgeting etc. and to internet surf on. The HP Stream met all my expectations and more! It came with 1 yr free Office 365 and set-up was easy with on screen instructions. Highly recommend this product and this seller!
4,Was great for the price. As long as you realize that you are getting a computer with specs that are at the lower end and are good with that then I would say go ahead.  It has worked very well as a computer for a child to do virtual schooling on.
5,So far so good  I‚Äôve only had this a few days but it is nice lightweight the battery is great.it‚Äôs got great features. I did turn off the S mode which was kind of a pain but now it‚Äôs running much better
1,Very angry that all my travel agent information personal information is on this laptop and can't power on it to erased anything. I have a HP laptop which is bigger but had it for over 4 years with no problem except replacing a new battery pack. They want me to send the laptop back but I can't erase all my personal information off of it. Too many hackers stealing people information and identity these days. Sorry I purchase this laptop poor quality it is.
4,Me cost√≥ un poco salir del modo S de resto funciona bien
4,It's OK for the price.  Not something to put up a banner for . . .
2,Half the storage was full when I got it and it‚Äôs really slow. Working on trying to return it.Also didn‚Äôt have touch screen. Don‚Äôt know why tf they say it does
3,Laptop color is nice smaller than I had expected easy to set up. However there are several problems with this laptop. The memory is very small. Especially if you have many videos or files to load. The internet runs very slow even when connected with WIFI. Overall the price is right but having bought from HP before this is an inferior product.
5,Great price for a good laptop I love it! It handles everything I needed it for.. school works from home
5,Good product for a cheap price.
1,This screen clears off unable to wake can‚Äôt even set up  I am soooo disappointed
5,My son says it works great. Even came with microsoft for a year. It only is good for school type work no cd rom or gaming. Other then that works great.
5,I love this computer  I‚Äôm a collage student and I had to purchase a new laptop and I saw this one and I bought it .The Battery life is amazingReally fast laptopA high quality screenA high quality product .I love it .
4,Everything is amazing but The sound is to low like the worst
1,Lasted a whole 3 months before it crashes and no way to fix it or return it. $$$$ down the drain I hope they enjoyed it
2,For a laptop that requires wifi to run it often can‚Äôt connect to wifi when my phone and tablets can. To make matters worse it won‚Äôt be connected but will try to update windows which it can‚Äôt and will sit in an endless loop that you can‚Äôt get out of.
5,Great for the cost fast delivery.
5,Great laptop with easy set up fast processor and responsive keyboard. I like this one better than the Lenovo I bought last year
5,My son loves this laptop
5,Love this laptop. Would purchase again and would recommend to my friends.
3,Don't explain how to set the pen.  Has some one else I know as the owner.
5,Perfect for school
5,Personal use
5,Great for general use.
5,The color is great! I bought for Father‚Äôs Day and my husband loves it.
5,So far she works good for what I need
2,When you try to listen to Youtube videos you can barely hear them.  After updating all drivers and turning volume settings up to 100% speakers still way to low.  After going through this problem with tech support they said that this is as loud as you can get with this model of computer.  I have to plug in the headphones in order to be able to listen to the Youtube videos.  No good.
5,Is very efficient perfect for basic school work and office work
5,My mom loves her new laptop!
5,This is a great laptop for school aged kids.  It is not that expensive and does its job.  The battery life is amazing!!!
3,üöõLleg√≥ a tiempo üëç buena laptop por el precio les doy tres estrellas‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê porque me lleg√≥ de color equivocado üòîüíô‚ö´
5,Product comes brand new which I did not expect. It was easy to set up and very clean. Much worth the money! 10/10.
3,There was no 1 year warranty card included with laptop delivery.
5,I love this laptop light small great price I recommend this for anyone
2,1. touch pad is hyper sensitive.2. at times a page loads quickly other times it seems the laptop hesitates and it takes a long time. (other hp's in my house are working great.)3 I wish there were lights on the keyboard i didn't check that before i ordered.  I use the laptop in the dark Other than that it is a pretty good laptop.
5,I like how easy it was to set up
5,BOUGHT IT FOR SISTER FOR BDAY GIFT.  SHE LOVES IT!!!
5,It‚Äôs lightweight and provides good battery life for my needs.  Very pleased with this purchase.
5,It arrived before date and it is really neat.
5,This is a great laptop. Can handle most standard tasks and programs with ease.
2,It is with little memory. The keyboard isn‚Äôt very typing friendly. Wish I didn‚Äôt buy it.
3,Battery life isn‚Äôt great. Two months in and it‚Äôs having issues booting up. Not terrible for what it is but probably would not buy again or recommend to someone.
5,Very nice product üëç nice laptop
1,The one-star rating is based on the false advertisement of the blue model of this computer. I purchased two black and one rose gold and I really liked them and decided to buy two blue ones. They arrived today and are different than the others even though the pictures show them being the same only in blue. The screen design is different there are only two USB ports instead of three the computer has a rough plastic design all over it instead of the smooth finish in the pictures offered and like the other colors. I would return them but I really need them and don‚Äôt feel like hasselling with it. This is the most disappointing purchase I believe I have ever made which is saying a lot since I make purchases every couple of days!
2,When I turned on the laptop immediately the screen started to glitch it got to the point where you have to hold the top of the laptop at an angle so that the screen doesn't go black. While it might be light weight& the battery life is good and a inexpensive option clearly it's got a lot of screen problems/inner hardware issues.
3,Nice and cheap laptop. But not a lot of storage and memory space.
5,Me encanto es tal cual la publicaci√≥n
1,Specifically searched for and paid for a windows 10 laptop. This is running Windows 11 and completely worthless for my needs
1,Turned on connected to internet  5 minutes later  the computer only flashes. Totally unusable
5,Nice
5,My son is in 1st grade and needed a computer for homeschooling due to COVID19 school closure. He absolutely loves it.
1,This computer is very slow.  I'm talking..takes 10 minutes to open the control panel slow.  It also comes in S Mode which is basically where you can only run windows apps and programs on the computer.  Hardly any ram hardly any storage space.  you will get less than what you pay for with this purchase.  Only purchase this if you have a lot of patience.  Not ideal for those who are not computer savy.  To be honest not really ideal for anyone.
5,I loved everything about my laptop
5,Every thing good
2,It was advertised as a gaming laptop but it is not. This is an office to the fullest extent. And should be treated as such. Very annoyed as the false advertisement.
1,Save yourself the stress. This laptop has stopped working for me twice and it's barely even been a month and a half. I saw others say the same thing but unfortunately still went ahead and bought it. Save yourself to stress unless you want what you pay for
1,Broke 9 days after 90 day warranty I am so frustrated with Amazon not replacing it! I will never buy anything from electronic again! Just piddly stuff!
1,I ordered just to start going college but it really sucks the laptop turned off by itself the screen was not working at all and every time got stuck and I‚Äôm a very careful so it was terrible üò¢ looks like it was not new at all
2,Will randomly turn off printer spooler will not let you download drivers for various software or hardware very SLOW!!
1,Its just not a good buy for $200 its really slow and not worth the money in my opinion
1,This computer acts like it's from years ago the battery life isn't too good. Also I noticed it was bought from the clearance rack at Walmart then sold on here for double the price.
1,so cute
1,First off while the laptop is blue it has a rough texture to it vs. the smooth one which is shown. In addition there is NOT 1 year of Office 365. I really think they sent me the wrong one. To top if off customer service is HORRIBLE and keep getting a canned answer to to call Microsoft. Real drag - don't order this laptop and save yourself frustration.
1,This laptop sucks. The keyboard doesn't light up which I assumed all laptops did- so that's my bad. But what a stupid design. I mostly need it at night so I wasted my money. It is heavy slow dies quickly. The volume doesn't get loud enough and the screen doesn't get bright enough. I just want to return it at this point. Junk. (I've only had it a couple weeks)
1,This thing runs incredibly slow we got it for my son (5th grade) for school and it freezes after every click and lord opening a new window (add 2 to 5 mins) is a whole jeopardy songs wait! I wanted him to try it one more time with school today and I'm already gearing up the used one a friend gave because its already acting up
1,This is the WORST experience I have ever had buying something via Amazon. The seller sold me a lemon! The laptop stopped turning on after about 3 weeks of use They will not help me at all!!! I purchased a protection plan and trying to get the laptop replaced.
1,I have to call and order a diff computer. This is some old refurbished machine that someone named Sherri Braizee had.  Did they supply us with a factory reset? No.  Password?  No.
1,TOTALLY Useless!! You can't even add a simple external printer to this computer. It won't recognize it because of low hard drive space!!!! Useless!!!
2,Low space.
1,Error screens began a month into ownership. I am an author and take excellent care of my laptops.  Finally two months in it wouldn‚Äôt work at all. Save your money.
1,Slow and glitchy right off the bat
1,The computer came with another persons profile set up.  Had to hire a repair tech to erase it so I could register the computer under my name.
1,git this for my mother  and it already has a black screen. light blinks but screen stays black.. not very happy over this at all.
1,just got it today when it came it was way to slow i‚Äôve been waiting for 5+ minutes for it to load. don‚Äôt buy it wouldn‚Äôt recommend.
1,As of right now we don't have the information we need to register the Microsoft office which was the selling point for us
1,I have no idea how to activate the free 1 year trial of Office 365
1,Died after less than 3 months of basic use. Very disappointed. Wasted my money here.
1,Screen didn‚Äôt come on just flashed.
1,Doesn‚Äôt even keep time or day correctly
1,Camera is horrible. Looks like it was made in 2010.I ordered a blue one they sent a white one
5,i bought this laptop for mainly reading and to carry it on the go just in case. its really light and easily the best thing i bought. it runs smooth even at the highest settings. i Look it uprecommend this laptop.
4,i have a high opinion on touchscreen laptops and i like the touch screen model better this model has no graphics card
2,What I Like: The price is right for what you get which is bare minimum computing. And mine came with a 1-Year subscription to Office 365.What I don't like: Well it is dead s-l-o-w. I performed an operation that took over 4 hours to complete instead of less than 30 minutes on my other laptop. But again my other laptop has a 500 GB hard drive and 16GB of Ram so apples and oranges. Just don't plan on doing any heavy stuff like video editing burning a DVD etc. Unless of course you are not in a hurry to complete the heavy tasks. And Gaming is completely out of the question. Why?1) 4GB Ram is just barely enough for Windows 10 to function. This limitation can be remedied however by upgrading the RAM module to 8 GB. And yes in spite of what some folks will say you CAN replace the module. It is NOT soldered in.2) 64 GB of hard drive storage is pitiful but there is a work-around to remedy this as well.There are two remedies one which requires replacing the WiFi module with a PCi solid state drive which will require using a USB WiFi adapter to get on the internet. Not the easiest remedy but doable.The other work-around is much simpler. Purchase an SD Card (FUL SIZE not micro) and use it as a second hard drive. It simply plugs into the SD card slot on the side of the laptop. Then do the following:1) Format the SD card to NTSF. It will become your new Drive "D".2) Change the "Location" for whatever folders you need to move from the "C" drive to the new "D" drive. I installed a 512GB SD card from Amazon (PNY 512GB Elite-X Class 10 U3 V30 SDXC Flash Memory Card - 100MB/s Class 10 U3 V30 4K UHD Full HD UHS-I Full Size SD) and moved my Documents Pictures Downloads and Music folders to the SD card Drive "D". I would go into how to do this but it requires too much typing. Find a Windows savvy computer geek and ask them for directions.
3,I got this for Christmas last year and I thought my old Chromebook was bad but this is worse so aside from a garbage storage terrible Ram that can barely open Chrome don't spend your money on this I hate Apple but I'd even say go shell out for MacBook mine can barely even run Doki-Doki literature Club a visual novel so the Rams awesome terrible + this is the problem with most Windows products it struggles to open Chrome it can't use YouTube the amount of problems I've had with Netflix on it is a how old laptop from 2004 probably better than this
2,The display on this laptop is so poor that it is not worth buying even for the low price. The viewing angle is so narrow that the image is never quite right and the greater the angle the worse it gets. Even at the optimum viewing angle the quality is mediocre. It is ridiculous for HP to sell a crippled operating system that is only good for streaming (hence the name) that is not even good for that.
1,The only good thing about this laptop is that it came fast but the fact that I can‚Äôt do anything on it is a pain it lags and crashes when ever I attempt to do anything. I can video call Screen share or do any of the editing I‚Äôm trying to do! Down right terrible.
1,nothing but problems and HP support are useless.
5,Works very well. Suprisingly peppy and battery life is astounding good! Not for gaming by far but videos and normal computing (businessing) works great! Highly recommend for the price point!
4,We love this laptop and it's rather user-friendly. One flaw that it has is that the speakers are rather low and weak. We have had to add an external speaker to help boost the volume. Otherwise we like the computer just fine.
5,Exelente llego a tiempo y todo perfecto
1,Very poor quality
5,I'm a third year college student and i've been through 3 laptops this by far has been the most convenient lightweight fastest little laptop i've had my entire studentship. It isn't touchscreen but other than that i have no complaints.
5,I Love My LapTops Computer. Never Laptops Compuer.
5,Delivered on time with care. Extremely slim light neat little laptop. Works great for what I needed. Microsoft office etc. Working from home as well as streaming every now and then ü§ì very pleased! Fast once the set up is complete. Very easy set up talks you through it if needed. Would recommend üòä
5,Buen precio
5,Si es lo que esperaba. Es liviana y muy completa
1,Excruciatingly slow. Nonstop pop ups from Microsoft. Constant blocking of products makes use very difficult.  It took me over two days to set it up. I have to wait around 10 minutes to do basic setting changes
5,Great laptops!
5,Good for some one just need a quick one
5,It served my purpose and some
5,Excellent Product Excellent Service
3,Very lightweightIdeal for a child though because it is a simple computer. Not ideal for adults as the screen is so small.
5,My previous laptop stopped working all of a sudden (it turned on but did not respond to the mouse pad or mouse). Since I didn't like it much at all - it was slow really heavy and the screen resolution was awful - and had it for long enough I decided to buy a new one. I was looking for something for casual light use and decided on this.I received it yesterday. The initial set-up was so easy I was able to finish it within 30 minutes while working. I charged it fully and then unplugged it. I've binge-watched a few YouTube videos done a lot of web browsing for hours since then. I left it unplugged overnight and this morning it still had 80% of the battery left!I really like this because I could carry it anywhere without having to worry about charging it often (and this laptop is so light). As someone who prefers computers to cell phones for web browsing and general typing portability is so important.Since I bought this for casual use I was not expecting or needing too much but I am really happy with this laptop!
5,This lightweight blue laptop is not only attractive but it's functionality is great.  It was easy to set up; the system comes up fast; the keyboard is finger-friendly; and the personalization is also user-friendly.  I'm really glad I made the purchase.
5,I couldn't believe i would get this for a low price well be buying another soon very happy with this laptop
5,La compramos porque tiene buena  capacidad es liviana a un precio bien accesible
5,I bought it for my 7 year old. It is great for this age group.
2,This laptop had a nice blue color but it never booted up.  I left it for 4 hours and all I got was the continued message "Just a moment".  Not only was I disappointed about the laptop not working but I was MORE disappointed that I had to pay $30 to return it.  The return instructions said to take it to the Post Office but if I chose to use my own method to return it I would have to pay the cost.  The return instructions are particular and threatening.  I followed it to the letter and I expect a refund.  NOTE TO THIS COMPANY - If you're going to charge someone to return your product that does not work you could AT LEAST pay for the return.  This company is on my do not shop list from now on.
5,I use this laptop todo homework play internet watching movies
4,so I've had the laptop for a year and what 3 months now. Its actually a.good little laptop. The bettery life in total is about 24 hours if you're not on it much. I'd let it sit for about 2 days with the charger not on it before it has half of battery life. I liked the key pad I can see the letters just fine when Im actually half blind lol I wear glasses. I enjoyed this little laptop it didnt start acting up until 4 months ago the screen did start to go out and the on and off button wouldn't turn on. Id have to push it like 4 to 5 times to get it to turn on. But its lasted till now. The screen finally went out on me so its time for a new baby. I was going to reorder the same one but I saw yalls price went up lol. So I'll just get a new one from someone else. But I give it 4 stars for lasting this long.
5,The laptop is good for basic work like online classes and surfing. The finish is nice and looks premium. Initial setup to come out of window 10 s mode is easy but essential to install third party softwares. Office 365 asks one to make a Microsoft or hotmail account which is a pain. The memory kn the laptop is very least almost like a phone but these days one doesn't need to save more data with more work in the cloud. Overall satisfied purchase and good experience so far.
5,Laptop packaged well. Came on good order. Very pleased
1,DON'T ORDER. It will stop working trust me. Screen will not turn on. Save your money.
5,Works well. Not a gaming laptop

3,hate windows 10/11
1,Super lent... Y'a absolument rien a faire avec. Une perte d'argent.
3,1st Item was replaced. This one hasn't blown up yet or made any fizzling electrical noises.
4,loved the color and works great the only reason I only gave it 4 stars is that I find the edges to be sharp
1,I had not used a new laptop that is this laggy in a long time‚Ä¶ Please do not consider this product. It is absolutely not worth it.
5,All good
