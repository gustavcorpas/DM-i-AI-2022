5,RE: Prosumer's Choice Natural Bamboo Charging Station Rack for Smartphones and Tablets / DARK BROWNI love this thing and I was all ready to send it back if the reviews ended up being correct but this is a great charging station holder.I already have a "Unitek USB Charging Station for Multiple Devices Charger Organizer Stand Dock with Dividers Quick Charge 3.0 Compatible for Smartphone Tablet iPad and Other Electronics" that I put inside this (without the plastic dividers on that --needed a real solution like this wood one since the dividers on the Unitek are cheap crap that can't hold the weight of a tablet for long and constantly BREAK).I also got a few packs of braided USB C (fast) to Lightning Cables (MFi Certified iPhone/iPads) to use with it. ***3ft long ones would be perfect for this*** but I got mainly 6ft ones just in case I wanted to use some elsewhere. The ones I had on the old charging station were 1ft and while they worked with that just barely they definitely don't fly when inside this thing and go up to the device so something to keep in mind.Since I keep this in the kitchen this "dark brown" one goes really well with out dark cherry wood cabinets so it looks like it fits right in. You do notice dust right away so if you don't have dark wood already you might want to get the light colored one.I took another reviewers advice and used a rubber mallet to get the divider in but then I realized I didn't really need it you just have to push down harder than you'd expect but they do fit.I was kind of shocked at how well packed it was so maybe this is a new procedure since they other reviews? I agree though that the "Prosumer" branding should NOT be where it is so visible but I turned it to a side it would be least seen (figure this out before you wedge the dividers in there). Also there are open squares on each end of the base for the power cord to go out but they diagonal from each other so no matter which way you turn the base it never works out so the square hole is in the back if you want the cord going out to the outlet (viewing the unit wide side facing front cord going out your left hand side).If you are going to face it so the short side is toward you instead of using all taller dividers there is one really short one you can put in front so if you want to watch videos or look at a recipe on a tablet you can put the tablet there.  I used that shorter one there even though I use the stand wide side facing front because I put my phone there normally and if I want to do as mentioned previously I can just turn the unit that way while doing that. So I have an extra tall divider that I store inside the base with the charging unit (sold separately). There's also some velcro cord organizers and a couple pieces of flat velcro in there that came with this stand.This is a great stand if you're like us and have several devices a few of which have very heavy cases on them. This is a million times of an improvement from the plastic divider situation but I would be reckless with it because it certainly could break just not as easily as the plastic ones. This is the ONLY option I found like this (that also had the dark wood).
5,This charging station rack has done an excellent job of taming the tangled cord monster in our home.  Plus it looks lovely and simple.I will say that the space inside of the charging station is limited.  We were able to put a small power strip in it but we had to make sure all the cell phone plugs were the kind where the USB sticks out perpendicular from the strip and not parallel to the strip or else we couldn't fit them all inside.So this definitely works best for phones or small electronics.  We were able to fit a single charging cable for a Chromebook in there too but we would not have been able to fit in the charging cables for multiple Chromebooks or laptops.
4,The top is wonderful for organizing my tablets phone and other things. But inside where most people will store some kind of multiple USB connection device to charge your stuff there is only enough room for small thin USB hubs.The photo is of my USB charging hub. When the type A end of a USB cord is plugged in it is too tall and the lid sits on the cable. Doesn't sound too bad but when you add the weight of several devices sitting on the top I believe that those type A-s won't last very long or even cause the main unit to go bad. I tried laying it on its side since that would let all the cables plug in without issue. Nope still won't work it is too tall for the lid to close.There is a scalloped opening on one end to allow your electric cord to come out to plug in and power your charger.  You can easily run your cables through that opening and then out to each of the side scallops for the individual equipment slots but I found it difficult to keep it from turning into a snake pit as the type of equipment changed and required a different type of cable to charge it.All in all  I WOULD RECOMMEND this item especially on a bedside piece of furniture.
5,Does what it‚Äôs supposed to do decluttered my kitchen counter of 3 ipads and 3 iphones. It only has holes for 5 chargers but that‚Äôs okay. We don‚Äôt charge at the same time anyway. I used a Trip-it thin strip inside and really works well.
4,It‚Äôs a great little organizer for electronics! The price seems high for what it is but it does it‚Äôs job and we are happy with it. Went with this one primarily because I really wanted something that would fit our charger inside instead of instead of the charger built into it.
5,Love how easy it is to charge all of our family devices in one place now. All of my kids know where their tablet goes & the cord is ALWAYS right there so it‚Äôs easy to plug in. Our countertop looks so much better with the pretty bamboo charging station than it ever did when it was just a pile of cords plugs and tablets. Guests are constantly asking me where I got it‚Ä¶ duh. Amazon.
5,This stand enabled me to consolidate all my devices in one area. I can store all the charging wires in it instead of rummaging thru my house for one. üôÇ It is also good looking sturdy and goes with the rest of my decor! A+++++
5,I really like the aesthetic of this piece. It‚Äôs a visually appealing piece and it‚Äôs functionality is great. Each slot is big enough for my devices to fit into. With a lot of the device organizers I looked at the slots were too small. I have two kids tablets (with thick cases) that fit with plenty of room to spare. The storage part of the box for all the wires is big enough to hold everything. This also came with zip ties for the wires. Overall a great product.
5,Looks great on my dresser. Keeps the cord mess contained which is the main reason I bought it. Bonus tho - The power strip I use has lights on it which made it impossible to get the room super dark for sleeping...now those lights are inside the box and it is much darker during the night. I like it! Looks and feels higher end not a cheap-o feel.
4,In my busy house someone is always needing to charge a device: our kids their friends visitors or ourselves. We could never find a cable or block when we needed one - it was so frustrating. The Apple cables are so expensive I couldn‚Äôt afford to keep replacing them when lost which seemed to be all the time. The daily ‚Äúyou took my charging cable‚Äù accusations were putting me over the edge.In 2017 I decided to buy the following items to make a charging station for my house:- 5 Anker charging cables (love Anker cables!)- Sabrent 10-Port [UL Certified] charger https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OJ79UK6/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_awdb_t1_uhAJDb3MDVF6X- This Bamboo Charging Station RackIt sits on a main table near the entrance and we have one rule: The cables are never to be removed. It is used every single day by many different people and it was the best decision I have ever made.Since then I have added some micro usb cables for speakers/headphones/kindles and even a Chromebook charger to the station. It‚Äôs definitely the most used item in my entire house. During sleepovers/hangouts all my kids friends know where they can charge their phones; they don‚Äôt ever have to ask or worry about their phone dying. It‚Äôs a great spot for phones overnight to keep them out of the bedrooms too. Now we always have a dedicated spot that guarantees us a charging cable for any type of device we own. No more searching for cables all over the house! Yay!Some things I love:- The low profile sleek design. You hardly notice it in a room.- The color & quality of the wood. Looks expensive.- The magnetic top closure is pretty solid- Just the right amount of room in the opening below.- Great slot size & overall design. It holds anything; Laptop Chromebook iPad kindle phones of all types with protective cases and occasionally even my husbands wallet. Ha!A few things I would modify if I was being picky would be:- top slats that snap in or are able to be secured somehow. Since they are fairly loose I had to glue mine to prevent them from occasionally popping out.- slightly smaller cable openings in the front so there is a bit more control of the cable and which way it leans.- longer narrow opening on the side close to the bottom to use for additional cables if needed.- power cable hole in the back so it remains unseen.I have purchased a few different bamboo charging racks over the years and this one is definitely the  best! You will not regret setting this up for your house!
5,I debated between this product or a similar one that already had USB ports. I ultimately decided on this one for a few reasons.‚Ä¢I liked the flexibility of being able to use a long cord on some devices. This let me charge the device while still using it then tuck the cord into the box when I was done.‚Ä¢ For some devices I wanted them charging off a USB-C block for faster charging. This product lets me choose whatever block I want to charge off of.‚Ä¢ The extra room inside allows me to store spare blocks and cables.The product is sturdy and assembling it was very easy. I‚Äôm glad I got it. The area I store all my devices at is finally organized!
4,This is a great home organizer charging station but if you get it I highly recommend getting the Anker 60W 6 Port USB Charging Station (B00P936188) to go inside. It'll provide enough ports & power to charge the devices you may set in this rack.Rack construction is good and I couldn't see any over glue or other issues. I do wish there was a small shroud covering the hole for the larger power plug or a matching bamboo pice that would fit in once the cable was through which would reduce the size or appearance of the opening.
3,It is small barely fits my surge protector but I made it work. However it won't work with certain chargers if the plugs aren't facing the right way like my leapfrog/leap pad charger. One of my dividers didn't fit into the slots which was fine because I used the small one that was included to prop something up while it's in use. Overall I like it but definitely could use some tweaks.
4,Well-loved and well-used this product for over 2 years. (Purchased in Oct 2019 broke this week - Jan 2021.) The make was not as sturdy as I would like. We kept 3 laptops in it at most times and it was very "top-heavy" and easy to knock over. We have an old Mac with one of the fat chargers so the top didn't close - also adding to its instability. We also found that plugs didn't stay plugged in very well - but that probably has more to do with the power strip and us pulling on it than the station itself. This week 2 of the dividers broke. I wish it was heavier so it didn't knock over so easily and was more bottom-heavy. Also would be nice if the top could clip to the bottom or something.
3,This is a very expensive charging station. I purchased it in dark brown in late December of 2021. One of the dividers split at the insert point. I am very upset with the poor quality. I have purchased. I still have the two Mobile Vision Dividers purchased in 2018 that are still in perfect condition.Poor quality and I have no idea how to get a replacement divider.
5,This is exactly what I wanted. I was tired of seeing all the wires and the plugs on the counter. I wanted a place to keep them neatly and out of the way. I liked the idea that the power supply was not included because I was able to choose what best fit my needs and if anything was to go wrong with it I can replace it without replacing the entire box. The slots do have rounded edges while the inserts have squared edges but that‚Äôs to ensure they have a tight fit and don‚Äôt slide out. I used a mallet to lightly hammer them into place and they went in smoothly.
5,This is just what I was looking for to help organize our counter and all our electronics. Looks nice and functions great.
4,This is a pretty great organizer and made my charging station look much neater. Putting it together was a bit difficult though because some of the slots were bigger than the space provided so I had to sand them down to fit. Otherwise it‚Äôs great. Love the little zip ties that came with it for keeping the cords in order.
4,We like this and it helps us organize but wow it does not hide cords as well as expected. Even with zip ties cords are always bumping up and causing the top to lay improperly. Next time we will go with a better-built option for a cleaner look. Functionally we‚Äôre satisfied but appearance wise this just did not provide the visual esthetic I was hoping for.
3,I ordered two of these. This product looked promising online but when I got it in my hands I was not impressed. They looked cheap and the quality was shoddy. The stain was far too dark in places appearing black while it was extremely light in other places like a medium brown appearance. There were stain drips on the sides. The slats for holding items fit into the slots unevenly sometimes very loose (so they would tilt) and sometimes too tight to fit so I would have to try a different slot. They also smelled STRONGLY of stain or chemicals. There‚Äôs no way I was going to put up with all of those negatives for the price. I sent them back fast.
5,I like the product but am getting tired of having to review every item I order. Please quit asking for a review of everything I declare you guys would want a review of toilet paper! Please!
4,I‚Äôm so happy to have this so my kids have somewhere to charge their school chrome books that is out of the way. However it‚Äôs like a tricky puzzle trying to fit two large chrome book chargers an odd shaped Android phone charger and an iPad charger in there along with the power strip.  I wish there were a little more space. Also I saw the reviews about the flimsy dividers‚Ä¶they aren‚Äôt that bad but I am extra cautious after reading the reviews. Overall I‚Äôm happy with it though. It‚Äôs much better to look at than the cords all over the house.
3,I loved this charging station for a short while. Over time the bamboo separators broke. It was difficult to fit all the device charging cords inside the box.
4,This is a nice unit. I have several phones and gadgets that need charged. This definitely helps keep the area less cluttered. Only thing I have slight issues with is top will come loose when I plug devices in but it's nothing I would consider a problem. Definitely worth the money!
5,Between my wife daughter and my devices to charge all the cords just sit on a chair until one of us needed them. I really got tired of looking at this miss. After doing a little research and shopping here I purchased most of the materials I needed here and some from a Home Big Box Store.I made a Charging Station  and I might add I think it came out  very well. Wife loves it!I actually built this into the wall with an on/off outlet also with an green indicator light to let me know when power was on. Very simple to build. All red oak wood and stained with red oak.This box is made from bamboo Always drill a hole 1st before putting a screw thru it it WILL split if you don't.Pic's attached.https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076C67G6V?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2_dt_b_product_detailshttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B07F2SJHW6?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2_dt_b_product_details
3,Had to size up to accommodate for the powerstrip.  Larger one works fine.
5,Before buying this box I had cables and devices all over my bedroom floor and night table. Now I've wrangled my Kindle tablet phones and even my laptop into one place with the chargers and cables concealed. Very sturdy easy assembly bingo! Does the job!
5,My use for it was for all our electronics cell phones tablets and etc
5,Right I said box.  This is exactly as I envisioned it.  The joining on the pieces of faux wood are tight and well glued.  Properly treated (ie no bathtub voyage or dropped to test resiliency)  this should do the trick holding the power charger for the devices that require a vampire fix (trickle charge) at night.  It was easy to put together. I gently inserted the dividers into the slots on the top.  (no hammer or weight lifting required)  Next I checked the fit of the dividers to ensure they do not just pop up by gently turning it upside down (NOTE: I did this by holding the top over a table top from a height of 2 inches.  After all I was not attempting to determine survivability of a divider.)  I checked the interior to see if it will hold the USB power strip.  Hot stuff it does.  Does it close correctly as in the cords are not causing the top to be propped up.  Yes it does.  The power cord for the strip goes through the hole without issues.  Placing the devices this is a tablet and several phones.  Sue me everyone in the house has one of these little dictators. (ie smart phones)  The devices did not fall or drop and took the charge correctly.  Ok so the devices are not held tight like a smart phone in the clasp of a teen daughter (no I am not a misogynist just the father of a bunch of empowered women) but they do not fall out or slide forward or back (yes I did level the table the box sits on).  We are in business.  All in all a good product.
5,This charging station is perfect for our household!. It is constructed of sustainable bamboo which is a plus in my opinion. It conveniently holds a power surge strip inside the box ( has removable lid) . The station itself has room for 5 devices to charge simultaneously. The dividers are substantial & "weighty" enough to support IPad Air2 & mini IPad in their cases along with 2 phones in their cases & 1 hearing aid box. Very happy with product!
2,Unless you have a power cord that has flat heads which no PC power cord I know if has this unit is not functional since the bay or tray that the power extension strip goes into is too shallow.  That is if you plug in your power cord it will stick up and interfere with the closing of the top.  However we use it to simply power USB cables so as we're not using it with PC/laptop power cords it's not an issue.  Two stars instead of one star since the wood looks pretty.
5,Organizing our various devices is made so much easier with this organizer.  Box contains the multi prong wall charter with all the cords. There‚Äôs 5 holes for the 5 devices.  Slots easily keep iPhones portable chargers kids kindles (with covers on) and other devices corralled.
5,It hides all of the clutter & looks good
5,I recently purchased two office tables with a bamboo surface so I was happy to see a good variety of bamboo charging stations on Amazon.  The Prosumer's Choice product had excellent ratings so I thought I would give it a shot and I'm happy that I did.Packaging: The product arrived within 3 days which was surprising considering the increased demand put on Amazon in general during the Covid-19 pandemic.  Packaging was superb and the product was in perfect condition.  The box not only contained all the structural components but also some Velcro adhesive strips and ties to secure the power strip in place and organize charging cables.Assembly: Setup was easy as one would expect however instead of using a full size power strip I opted for a 6 port USB charging hub and I'm very happy with the results.  With this option I didn't have to worry about plugging in any additional adapters and only had to provide some 3ft charging cables.Aesthetics:  The product looks great on the desk and is a good choice for reducing the cluttered look from having the USB hub and cables strung out across the table top.Function:  The product is light but sturdy and I was able to comfortably dock a 13" MacBook Pro 10.2" iPad and a Google Pixel 3a.
5,I was looking for a ‚Äúcharging station‚Äù and at first looked at ones that also provided the charging power but I was put off by some reviews that said those products overheated and even caught fire.  Which brought me to look at this product.  First this product doesn‚Äôt provide the power for charging‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs simply the ‚Äúcase‚Äù to keep things looking stylish‚Ä¶ which it absolutely does! I actually love it.  Super sturdy without being super heavy.  Looks great .. love the wood stain choice.Was easy to insert a power strip and get the cords all organized.  Now we have a simple place for teens to put their phones and devices at night to keep them out of bedrooms.  Very happy with how clean and organized it is.  Would definitely recommend.
5,Our family has 4 iPads 2 Android phones a Kindle a Kindle fire a fitbit and various other electronic devices that require every imaginable type of charging. The phones support Quick Charge 3.0 using USB-C 2 of the iPads support USB-C fast charging over a usb-c -> lightning cable the other 2 ipads use a normal lightning cable. We also have various devices that still charge over micro usb and the fitbit has it's own proprietary charger. Needless to say this creates a huge mess on counter. I looked all over the place including on Etsy and ended up buying this charging station rack. I'm really happy with it.Pros+ Inexpensive!+ Fits 5 ipads easily.+ The interior let's you fit a full size powerstrip with all the chargers I need plugged into it.+ Cleans up a huge mess into 1 nice neat box.Cons- My wife thinks it's kind of ugly but it's 100% better than cords laying everywhere so she's happy.- I wish it had 1-2 more slots.Make sure if you get a power-strip that you get one that will fit your chargers. I use an Aukey Quick Charger that's really wide and required a bought a power strip that had horizontal plugs instead of vertical ones in order for it to fit in the charging station rack. If you have a power strip with plugs facing vertical the chargers won't allow the lid to stay flat. See links and pics below. It also really helps to buy short USB and Lightning cables. 1ft cables work perfectly and you can find them on amazon for cheap.I have the following fit into the box.Power Strip: https://amazon.com/gp/product/B071Z8BD2SUSB-C Charging Station: https://amazon.com/gp/product/B078W5CKSRQC 3 charger: https://amazon.com/dp/B01BBZJ31YSamsung Phone Charger: https://amazon.com/dp/B00CQS0S7E
5,One of the best purchases ever use this as the kids charging station and no longer have to run around and look for their devices
5,Finally! I‚Äôve been looking for a charging station that could organize my kids chunky kindles and tablets. As well as our iPads and phones and iPods. This is the one!!I bought two of them as well as two round 6 port chargers and a pack of wire/cord holders. Before I got this I was using a 10 port charging dock that wouldn‚Äôt fit anything and I hated it so much. After finally getting sick of the piles of tablets phones and cords on my counter I bit the bullet and bought these.The dividers seem sturdy they fit perfectly in the allotted slots. They‚Äôre easy to pull out but not overly so. They stay in place with heavy tablets and cases in them. This set also comes with Velcro to stick to your charger inside the box. And it comes with Velcro cord wrappers for the cords. To top it off-it‚Äôs gorgeous! I love the bamboo wood look.This thing is absolutely perfect. I love it!! I sent a picture to my husband -the same husband who said that we didn‚Äôt need a new charging station. Even he had to agree that it looks so much better and it was worth it. Now I have my counters back!!
3,I love the look of this product and it functions well; however the sides around the lid are very sharp and just seem to splinter off. I brushed my finger along the edge while plugging something in and got an awful sharp splinter right near my nail bed that took days and removing some skin to finally get out. Overall the product works as described but I think the wood itself could be sanded or something to prevent edges from looking like this.
4,Product arrived on time and well packaged.  Assembly was easy but.....The dividers fit somewhat loosely into the slots.  Moving them around to different slots helped a bit with that as well as with one or two that were a bit more difficult installing.  Not a deal breaker but certainly not the best manufacturing.  One extra divider was provided.  Dividers are large enough to hold most items well.  The largest used by me are a pair of Kindles and both fit into one area.Overall an OK product.  I chose this because I already had a good multiple port charger that would fit easily into the base.
5,Works like a champ charges all my devices without a hitch. Well made and easy to assemble.
3,My husband put this together and we placed the max amount of gadgets on it. I was getting tired of placing the top part back on as it would shift. There is no way to lock it in place. Within two weeks it was broken and we can no longer use it. Time to look for something else to organize our electronics.
4,i would go 5 star but of course i ended up with one that seemed to be really loose fitting on the lid area but after some peel & stick foam seal it locks together super tight and is really nice to look at.
5,We‚Äôve been through several types of organizers over the years and this unit should hold us off for many more to come.
5,Only needed it for iPads and iPhone. Works perfect. Got short cords for only apple products and got cable hub. Bottom is roomy. Love it
3,Overall this will work for what we need but it‚Äôs really not ideal‚Ä¶ pros: the slats are wide to accommodate our rugged laptops the slats are nice and tall to support larger devices the holes on the ends are large enough to allow running all the ends of the power cords out without being big enough to reach into the box the box itself it big enough to accommodate the power supplies. Cons:  it will not hold all the power supplies with cords and power strip so we had to run the cords through to a power strip outside the box the wood is flimsy I‚Äôm not convinced it‚Äôs bamboo as bamboo is dense. I believe this is pine. I attached a hasp and lock and the wood split.  Verdict: as long as you don‚Äôt want to store a lot or large cord/power supplies or you want to secure it you may want to look at something else if you just want a place to store your devices and you have another way to control cord clutter this would do well.
5,Easy to put together (small rubber mallet will help with the dividers) and very sturdy.  Especially love that there is plenty of storage inside for earbuds extra cords etc.
5,Finally found something for laptops kindles phons watches...everything that needs charging all in one.  Looks good sitting on our desk.  Happy with purchase.
5,I was a little surprised that it did not come with power cord.  Took an extra couple of days to find and install the power strip
2,The front panel felt loose when I took it out of the box and it came off when I began to put the rest of it together.
5,This product works perfectly for what we needed. It holds two laptops and three chrome books. It makes a great charging station for all these items and helps keep them stored and organized when not in use.
5,Finally an answer to the never ending need to store and charge everyone‚Äôs devices in one central area. It blends in to my kitchen counter well so it‚Äôs not an eyesore. Easy to put together and easy to use
5,This was exactly what I  was looking for. Have to laptops and 3 tablets changing at the same time with no clutter. Perfect
5,We've used this for about 8 months as a docking station for iPads and Chromebooks. (Charger not included.)It does what we needed it to providing a place where expensive devices could be easily placed by kids without scratching screens or allowing pets to kick them off furniture. The pieces still fit snugly.The only downside so far is that there's no lock to prevent the kids from taking the charging cables! (They forget where they used them last.)We have it set up so there are what I would call 4 "safe" slots where the device would not get knocked off if it was tilted against the wooden divider and 1 "working" slot where you can use this as an easel for your device. I believe there was an extra "safe" slot divider so you can configure it for your own needs.
5,I already had a charging base but it was made of plastic and broke easily.  I saw this in a search.  My current charging base fit inside perfectly and now I have the storage I need.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†Solid construction. Helps organize devices and cords.
3,This was okay if you are only connecting tablets and/or phones but the box was simply too small for laptop adaptors.  Returned and built our own.
5,Easy to assemble and sturdy
5,Great color.  Hides all of our cords.  Perfect!
5,I love how much this cleans up an area for charging devices and it looks so attractive as well.
5,Very happy with this product. We have 3 kids with tablets lined up and still had room for a wireless charger so we can set our phones down. Love the way it hides the spiderweb of cords. I got some shorter Aukey USB C cords that were perfect for minimizing the original tablet cords. We are now remote learning and have picked up a few Chromebooks. Was searching for a charging stand for those and this came up first on my list. Will likely buy again for those other devices. Only complaint is the rubber feet on the bottom didn't hold very well. When the kids push their plugs in its just enough to move the charging station. Over time the feet slide off leaving a sticky mark. I replaced with felt pads to allow a bit of movement.
5,Needed something to keep multiple charging cords and charging devices from being in the way or all over the counter.  Works well and gives a specific place for them to be.  cord storage area is big enough to hold multiple cords easily.  Bought a small charging strip to put inside. Happy with the purchase.
5,I have bought other charging stations but all were plastic and broke very quickly.  This charging is very sturdy.  I bought the bundle with all connections and it works great.
4,This is great to hold my kids iPads and laptops. It is easy for them to plug them n my themselves. The charges in the box do get very hot and we have to take the lid off to let more air in to the power strips.
4,It is a very good build with excellent space for cords. One of the uprights was not the right size for the slot but easily adjusted‚Ä¶
5,This screen holder was just what we needed. Our own powerstrip and cords secure inside and several tablets/phones can be charging at once in the stand. Looks good on the counter and is much better than the previous jumble of tablets and cords.
5,Keep a family of Kindles & iPads charging ing one location
5,Shopping through options this product appeared to be exactly what I was looking for. After research I finally decided to bite the bullet and purchase one.  We were not disappointed.  We have 3 kids and our biggest concern was is a Kindle Fire with a kids case would fit since they are so thick.  Thankfully it fits perfectly (see photos).  We liked the product so much we purchased another for our kid's Nintendo 3DS's.The only complaint I have with them is some of the inserts are not cut consistently - some of them were too large to fit into the slot.  But the slots are also off by millimeters so some quick switching around and we were able to get them all to fit.  Worst case scenario you may have to grab some sandpaper to sand it down to fit.  We also did have one of the inserts that I had to sand down because it had a rough area that could possibly cause a splinter should one of the kids rub their hand across it the wrong way.  But in either case there are simple quality control issues that do not warranty me docking a star for such a well made and sturdy product.
5,Holds 5 chromebooks. Wish the box was a bit deeper since the chargers for these are so bulky but if you use the ties then it helps keep it under control. This is what I was looking for last year with school being virtual and now that they have to take their chromebooks back this year every day it works out perfectly. Kids come home put the chromebook on the charger and in the morning put it back in their backpack. Neat organized and I‚Äôm one happy Mama.
5,Tames our mess of chargers and cables well and has a good tidy look.The Good:---------------  * I liked that this product is big enough inside to allow you to use your own small surge suppressor strip and the original power adapters for the devices.  Other similar products provide their own internal USB charging hubs but don't provide surge suppression.  As a result if you want that you still have to plug competing products into an additional surge suppressor.  This product can fit that all inside so I have a single cable plugged into the wall outlet in our kitchen so this doesn't look to messy.  * If you want to you can fit your own USB charging hub inside as well (they would easily fit)  * This product is easy to use and even comes with Velcro cable ties to use inside it so the cables have just the right length to your devices.Room for Improvement:---------------  * The only improvement I would prefer a slightly lighter shade of Bamboo.  The shade of Bamboo in this product is definitely not an eyesore but the slightly darker shade of this product doesn't immediately look like Bamboo unless you look up closely.
5,Just what I needed. Tidies up the kitchen desk of all the disorganized charging cords.
2,***updated review.After the replacement everything has been fine with the unit. Until now.(See image. ) the bamboo on the top is already splitting after less than a year.The unit isn‚Äôt subjected to hot and cold to cause shrinking.However I remember when I was assembling the unit I felt that the slots were not big enough to handle the Fins. They were exceptionally tight. I had thought about sanding it but chose not to at the time.I guess I‚Äôll have to disassemble the unit and try to re-glue the seam. Then dremel out the slot so that it isn‚Äôt so tight. I‚Äôve adjusted the str rating to 2 stars down from 4.** I did return it and got an exchange. The new unit was in perfect condition. I really like the unit now.Thanks.So I‚Äôm a little bit disappointed. Hopefully my photos will show that three of the four corners have become separated and flex. I guess I could go and get some wood glue and some clamps and reattach the corners but lately I‚Äôve been having to return quite a bit of stuff to Amazon.  So much so that I‚Äôm thinking about trying to buy somewhere else.Otherwise the unit is nice bamboo and It feels sturdy for the most part. Except at the corners.Where it flexes. If their glue had held I‚Äôm sure it would be really sturdy.
5,This charging station was just what I was looking for‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not to big easy to put together and perfect for the kids!
5,Organizing charging of iPad and iphones
4,The holder is nice looking. I purchased the darker one. You have to also purchase the power strip. I bought as a gift for my husband. He returned it. He thought the cost for just a holder was too much.
4,I really like this charging station. It holds my computer kindle & iphone. My watch lays nicely on the bottom portion of the stand. I wish there was a designated area for the watch but it works fine since I left the insert out and the watch sits flat on the surface anyway. I like how the wires are nicely tucked away inside the box and I only have the power cable coming out of the box which going into the wall. The unit is a bit pricey I would have preferred spending 10.00 less but its sturdier then any other unit I've found on Amazon. I'm happy with my purchase.
5,Our cord and charging area was trash. This made it pretty and organized. Kids now have no excuses. Freaking love this holder.
5,Hold all my gadgets and hide the charging cables
4,I'm pretty impressed by the solid build quality of this charging station but it suffers three significant design flaws that may or may not apply to you.First the rear opening is about 1cm too small in each dimension to allow rotating power cord plugs to be inserted.  I have five power strips with rotating plugs and none of them fit through the opening.  Design fail.  It was a shame that I had to spend a half hour defacing this product with a metal file to make the opening large enough for common power strips.My second wish is that more partitions could be inserted into this fairly deep (12+ inches) stand.  The stand would be more functional for me if it allowed me to place more devices upon it for charging.My last suggestion is that cable holes be made available on both sides or reconfigurable so that either side can be chosen.  As it is this stand only supports cables running through holes on the right side which may not be suitable for all placements.
5,
4,received as described easy to assemble fast shipping.
5,I paired this with Anker's 6 port usb charging brick and it works very well.  It would be nice if it came in oak but the bamboo looks pretty good.  It would be nice if it came with a couple of taller dividers for an 10" tablet but the ones it comes with do work for them.
3,Haven't been able to use because I cant find a power strip that will work with it yet
5,It keeps my devices organized without cords all over.
5,I like that this uses your existing chargers.  As you change devices everything wants their own style charger so it is easy to make the change with this charging station.
5,This is a great choice for a charging station.  I combined it with a Anker 60w 6-port USB wall charger and it easily fits in this solid bamboo charging station.  Dimensions of the outside of the Prosumer's Charging Station are 7 and 5/8 inches wide by 12 and 1/2 inches long 3 and 1/8 inches fromthe bottom of the station to the top of the of the station and 6 inches total for charging station in height once you add the bamboo dividers.Inside dimensions of the box are 6 and 3/4 inches wide by 11 and 3/4 inches long.  With the top on the inside of the station is 2 and 1/4 inches deep.  The photo shows a 2017 Ipad with the 9.7 inch display.There is so much room inside I didn't even purchase shorter cables I just used the existing cables and used plastic ties to store the excess insidethe charging station.  This is not a cheaply made bamboo charging station it is an outstanding value that I would recommend to anyone.
5,I wanted a solution to help corral all the electronics cords and mess that come along with having two kids with their own tablets (Kindles) and multiple battery packs. I was using a basket which would hid the mess but look like a disaster when you reach in to pull out your device. Just set this up and it's perfect! Now each person can easily access their device their charging cable etc. And they also know where it is at a glance. I got the Natural Wood finish and it's beautiful. Fits my farmhouse style perfectly.
5,Works as described. Easy to assemble and easy to use.
4,Some craftsmanship issues but it's a charging stand.  Finally able to have a charging stand to hold the bulky kids tablets.  Looks good.Bought a 8 port high speed usb charger (for a mix of cable types) and separate one foot cables. Like that I can upgrade my charger and still reuse the stand.
4,I liked the wood style however the dividers had to sanded to fit right.
5,Originally I was Looking at charging stations which included the charger. But it seemed like you needed to make a compromise on either the charging station or the charger. I wanted something reliable and sturdy. So I ended up deciding to buy a separate charging station in a separate charger.I looked at several different designs and liked how this one was solid wood and could accommodate a small power strip or a charger.  So I ordered it and I‚Äôm really happy with it. It‚Äôs well-made and sturdy and seems to be well thought out. The dividers insert snugly and hold an iPad with no problem.  It includes an extra divider which is low profile so that you can use it as a stand for your iPhone or iPad. I recently used it this way while cooking dinner and looking at a recipe.So while this station may be a little bit more expensive than others I expect it‚Äôs going to last. It looks good and is very functional. Well worth the money.
5,I added those stick on cable holders and this thing is amazing all the cords are organized. So happy with this purchase. Perfect amount of room inside for the cables.
5,Handles all types of devices cords.
5,I never write reviews but I just had to with this one! I have struggled for years with trying to find a good way to stow tablets with chargers and it has just left me with a tangled mess and tablets stacked on top of each other. This box is AMAZING! No cords everywhere tablets resting nicely no more fumbling around while trying to get tablets. It‚Äôs amazing and you need it too!
4,This is strictly a nice looking stand. I tried the tiny cords first don't bother they wont reach from an inside the box surge protector. I used the standard Apple charger cord length and had to tuck them into the box. Make sure your surge protector will fit the length its very specific to the specs.
4,We just received the charging station a couple days ago. So far it has been easy to set up with a power strip and charging cords and it has done a wonderful job containing our devices in an aesthetically pleasing manner. The box is a nice color and the wood is sturdy and seems durable. The lid is easy to remove and replace and fits together well. Our one complaint is that one of the inserts for holding the devices arrived cracked in the middle. Very disappointing thing to experience with an otherwise pleasing purchase.
5,I love this item so SO much. It keeps our devices organized and cords from becoming a tangled mess. I have it placed against a wall so it easily fits 6 tablets (all 10in devices) with bulky cases. I put a surge protector inside the box which remains hidden so no bulky mess. The inside of the box fits a surge protector with 3 ipad and 3 kindle plugs with ease.
5,This container is exactly as described! One detail I may have missed in the description but is suggested by the pictures is that there are six spots for dividers but there are seven includes... the "extra" divider is the short divider so you have a choice between six full height dividers or five full height and one short divider. I got creative with my install using a Renogy USB charging station (I've had great luck with their solar panels!) and a TP-Link Kasa smart plug programmed to turn on a few hours at a time a few times per week. This way I'm (hopefully) using less electricity but more importantly to me reducing the risk of overcharging batteries. I'm sure the tablets manage their charging reasonably well but I doubt the same could be said of rechargeable torch lighters or flash lights! It's a nice tidy solution that is hopefully a bit smarter than just leaving everything plugged in all the time.
4,This is really nice looking and holds a variety of sizes. I left some dividers off so our phone soap can sit up there too. The wood appears to be coming unglued on the box part but I was able to apply some pressure and push it back together.
5,This charging station fits two kids kindles in the cases my iPad kindle paper white and all the chargers. We don‚Äôt use all the slots but I was worried that the kids kindles wouldn‚Äôt fit because the cases are so bulky. However they fit with no issue and some room to spare and my 6 year olds have no trouble getting the kindles in their slots every day.
2,The dividers did not fit the slots on the box whatsoever.  Had to do extensive filing of each divider to get it to even barely fit.  Not sure how they didn't catch the dimensional mismatch in the design phase.
5,Simple sleek sturdy enough.  Keeps our bar top much much neater
5,I got the wooden one. It is well made simple and elegant. What i like over many others in market is that it fits a whole power strip inside and space for your existing adapter and wires. The planks fit well with a little bit of give that actually makes for a better design in my view. There is enough space left for my iwatch charger to stick on the surface. Overall simple design high quality and looks good.
2,There were splits in the wood and not as sturdy as expected. It still works but would not buy this again. One of the corners did not come to a point so I turned it around to put it in the back and the other side had a noticable split in the wood.
5,I have three kids homeschooling and I work from home.  Any parent these days will tell you that there's nothing worse than realizing two minutes before both you and your kid need to get on separate zoom calls that their device is at 2%.This works great - it fits all our devices securely and eliminates the tangle of charging cables.  We plug everything in before bed and have no more 8:59 freakouts trying to find an iPad charger.
3,Multiple dividers broke off the base of the organizer.  Need replacements.
5,Very well built and well designed.
5,Very Well made. Before I received this product I was concerned about quality of the partition rack based on one of the review. When I received the product I was pleasantly surprised. The partition boards are very sturdy. If you have kids or have four or more devices look nowhere else and just buy this. I am very particular when it comes to accessories I am happy with this product. I purchased Anker 10 USB charging station and housed it inside this. No more clutter. I can charge 10 devices at the same time. Without this charging station charging 4 or more devices was a mess. Researched for a while and then settled on this. I am glad I purchased this. I attached an apple watch charger to side. I wish the price was better.
5,Works great sturdy I ended up buying 3
5,This is great for a family charging station. The only thing I would change is that it should be just a little taller. Some of the plugs for the phone chargers have the cord facing up and it jams into the lid so it doesn't close right.
2,While I do really like the function of this box the quality is poor.  I wanted a black box and this was one of the few brands that offered it in black.  However  I‚Äôve only had it about a week and already had to glue one of the sides back together!
5,My daughters use this for their iPads Chromebooks AirPods and Beats and of all the chargers we have tried this is by far the absolute best!  It is a great size and sits on a book shelf.  Because of the design all the cords are hidden away when they are not charging anything.  and the color is excellent and matches the color of the bookcase perfectly.  I absolutely love it.
4,I absolutely loved that I finally found a dock that would fit my kids kindle fires with the big cases in it. All the other docks I‚Äôve had or have seen were too small for them. There is plenty of room for them with this. The only thing I was a little disappointed with was it did not come with a charger. I had to buy one separately and place it inside. But like I said I absolutely love the look and that everything I have fits!
5,Wow what a space saver! It makes ALL my kids devices and chargers look so much better! It was a constant battle to make the counter look neat with all the devices and cables everywhere but now it's all contained in this super sturdy very visually appealing box. It looks so nice I moved it to my living room. Highly recommend!
5,This is extremely sturdy seemingly indestructible and looks nice.  I had a different kind that was metal with plastic dividers which my kids completely destroyed and the wires were all worthless in a month.  Now this is just the shell so I put the old charging base in it with new charging wires and it looks better no chance of it breaking and is fantastic.  I love it.  I got the black painted one which goes so much better with our things then the natural color.  Very nice.
4,Actually would give 4.5 stars if possible.  We are using it to organize 2 Chromebooks a MAC 1.5 inch thick laptop and iPad.1/2 star off because the compartment holding the power strip is small perhaps because I also have two computer power supplies inside.Very sturdy and may end up buying another for the other devices.
3,Where to start with the issues.  The tabs that go on the top often have chips missing because there is packing inside to protect and hold them in place but it is not used.  The packing for them sits inside unused.  Then the finish can be either glossy or matte so you never know what you get.  I ended up getting 3 of these because it came chipped every time and should didn't have enough tabs to make 1 single unit without chips.
3,I took 2 stars out because some of the pieces were too big and I couldn't get them into the slots. Its still usable though. Its a pretty organized way to keep all my charge cables semi hidden but in one area. I feel like if I sanded the dividers down a bit they would probably fit better. But I don't have those now so it'll be a later project. Its working for me right no. No major issues.
5,I searched for a practical solution to managing my devices and this rack did the trick.Pros: unobtrusive design well built. I use a six slot Anker charging station inside and there is plenty of room for it plus extra cord.Con: there is a drum effect when placing my devices on to the rack - so if you need to worry about waking a partner or spouse at night it's not the most stealthy solution - but I am sure there is a DIY fix if becomes a problem.
5,It took us a while to find one with wide enough spacing to hold my kids tablets that have fat rubber cases. You provide your own power cord and chargers which was fine. I wish it had more storage to hold their head phones or extra cords but overall it is great for us!
4,The first one I received had to be glued. I contacted the maker and they shipped me another one and didn't ask for me to return the broken one. That was refreshing. I like the product. My problem is the extension and outlet I already had fits but I can only turn it one way so I wasn't able to place it the way I would have wanted to. Outside of that. Each cord has it's own little twister to keep it in place it doesn't take up much space and I'm finding it useful because I know where all my devices are. I am happy that I purchased this .
4,So far we have found this to be a nice convenience for all our family‚Äôs rechargeable devices! Never have to go looking for cords or find a vacant outlet... very happy with our purchase... I like that we can alternate the divider on top. That‚Äôs one of the best features!!
5,I have had so many compliments on how nice this is and how great it looks. I have it in my living room at the hub of all the entertainment and its a great tool to have to keep all the devices charging and readily available. It's sturdy the pieces fit in nicely and i have zero complaints. I have multiple devices that are constantly charging with all my kids and this helps organize all the cords and hide them. Highly recommended to people with lots of cords that need constant charging.
3,It is a box. Nothing more. After searching for a charging station for my tablets I found this. Looked sturdy had pictures of power strip cords etc... I was very disappointed to find it to be just an empty box. It's a nice box. But if like me you are looking for a charging station with everything you need to charge your devices this is just a nice box to organize your devices. You will need a smaller power strip and your own cords.
5,This product is so perfect for our family! It‚Äôs a great resting place for my kids devices! Keeps the cords secure looks great and keeps everything neat. The product is of really excellent quality and looks so nice. I will say that the pieces fit together extremely snuggly so while it took a little muscle to put together I definitely wasn‚Äôt worried about it falling apart afterwards! When ordering I was initially worried that it might not live up to expectations but it has by far exceeded my expectations. I would definitely highly recommend this to anyone.
2,Photo shows individual ports for cords the main reason I purchased this. My item doesn‚Äôt have this on any side which means wires will be coming out where the main cord comes out (the only hole provided). With 3 kids wires will be tangled immediately. Quite disappointed. If it had the ports I would give it 5 stars.
4,This is a great box could be a little taller to allow more room for a power strip and the plugs that will go into it. My lid kind of floats on top because I have things plugged in that have larger plugs but it is doing it's purpose and looks great.
4,my unit came with a definite nick in it which detracts from the look some of the dividers were hard if not impossible to get in place and there are  rectangular holes at both ends. Not sure why the holes on both ends but the second hole which seems unnecessary limits how you can place the unit if you care how it looks visually.
5,
5,We combined this with a USB charging station inside and it certainly has helped keep the counter clean. It also makes it easy for our family of 4 to know where their mobile devices are we've made it a house rule that everything gets charged in one place. No longer do we spend time searching the house for our phones as we are trying to run out the door.  I wish there were more wood and color options but the bamboo seems to work.  No problems.
5,Great quality and very functional. We have a ton of devices and cords that are everywhere. The inside is big enough for a power strip and to hide extra cords. I like that the wooden dividers on top can be moved around. Overall a great product!
4,Great organizer! The spaces were large enough to hold our child‚Äôs kindles with their large cases (many other ones like this did not) I bought an additional 6 pin charger and it fit fine along with all the cords hidden inside. Was also able to fit more than one cord out of the side to plug in directly to the wall outlet. The top moves easily which is why I gave it 4 stars - it can easily be bumped and open up.
5,Perfect charging station
5,My wife wanted to eliminate all the charger clutter on the part of the kitchen counter where we used to charge the phones and "stuff".  This charging station seemed expensive but appeared well finished in the Amazon pics.  I am glad I purchased it.  It is well made and nicely finished.  The box is large enough to hold multiple chargers and contains all the excess length of the cords.  I would definitely buy this again.
5,Great product stays together very well and with a usb brick charger I can have 8 chargers under it to charge all the iPads.
3,When it arrived two of the side panels fell apart. Had to glue it in myself. Other than that it does what it supposed to
4,From the pictures the power cord extending out the side doesn't seem all that bad but when you have it on your counter and have a (seemingly) giant power cord from a power strip hanging out then wrapped around to a wall outlet (we placed ours on the counter in the kitchen) it's kind of an eye sore.  My suggestion is to put the box in a location where you can hide the cord or it falls to a wall outlet near the floor so it's hidden more.No issues at all with the box itself material how it works etc.
4,The box is beautiful and made well and just what I was looking for.  I was planning to use it with a surge protector but my Samsung plugs have the USB port on top of the charger and when plugged in it's too high to fit inside the box (or the cord would need to bend and that usually leads to a broken cord).  I swapped the surge protector for a USB charging station and it works fine.  But FYI on the Samsung chargers.  For iphone or other plugs that have the USB port on the side this would work perfectly with a surge protector.
5,Feels nice and sturdy.  Looks great.  Fits lots of devices.  Can fit two phones in a single section.  Comes with a short divider for propping a tablet on the end and viewing it while charging on the dock.  The device on the end is a 12.9 Inch iPad for size reference.  Came packed very nicely.  I very professional looking product all around.
2,The color and style is nice but the whole thing fell apart. I am in the process wood gluing it back together. It has the tiniest metal "nails" holding it together. I expect more for the price.
5,This charging station has worked out great for us. It‚Äôs helped us organize 2 pads 1 iPhone 1 android & a blue tooth speaker. I like that the dividers are removable. I didn‚Äôt add one to the back so that there was room for my Sonos and another blue tooth speaker to sit on the back. I bought an anker 6 port usb charger to go with the station. Although a power strip would have worked fine too.
3,This thing is HUGE! If you are using it to store laptops as well as phones an accessories I think its the right fir for you. However this ting was cheaply made for the price I paid. The front panel is not flush with the panel on the right side creating a gap in-between the two panels right at the front of the piece. It also does not stand on its four sides but rather wobbles on two. Its not worth sending back at this point because its functional but I was hoping for better quality.
2,This item arrived poorly assembled.  It wasn't damaged in transit the nails holding it together were poorly installed.  I was able to glue it back up and clamp it and it is in OK shape now.  But I would not recommend anyone else buy this unless they have wood glue/large clamps or a brad nailer.  Once assembled correctly it seems like a fine charging station and it's working well enough.  It does smell pretty strongly still though.
5,This bamboo cell phone cord tamer looks great. The dividers fit on pretty snug but after rocking them back and forth a few times they slipped right in. The bamboo is pretty thick and sturdy.  Overall high quality.
2,I have started using it yet but seems like it will do the job just fine.I ordered black- it looks like it got knicked up at some point on the corners and someone took a black marker to cover it up. üòí
5,We have a couch with charging ports in the consul  it's great however the charge cables were a mess.  I saw this but kept debating about buying it finally my husband said to get it and we'll make it work.  It's perfect for what we needed the slots are large enough for tablets in their cases in fact in the picture you can see 2 10" tablets in one slot both have thin covers.  This organizer has ordered our chaos.
2,It arrived with one side not meeting up with the others and nails were sticking out. It was also very large bigger than the pictures led me to believe. It was poorly made and not worth $40. I returned it.
3,Overall it's a decent hideout for charging cords and a power strip. The instruction indicates it should come with velcro strips to adhere power strip on on the walls but they were not included with this order.  Contacted the seller but no response. I'm still keeping as it adds to the household decor and tames the unsightly tangled / cluttered charging cords for my devices.
5,I had cords going everywhere and it looked ugly and disorganized so I got this thinking maybe it will clean things up. Looks great went together easy and it‚Äôs so much better than the disorganized mess I had.
4,Ordered two of these.  One had a perfect finish the other had some roughness where short fibers were splitting off.  I considered it a minor defect and didn't bother to complain about it.These have proven very useful for getting my electronics organized.  I paired it with a RAVPower charger but there is plenty of room for your brand of choice or even a smaller power strip with the individual chargers that came with your devices.
5,Everyones phone can be charged at the same time in the same place
5,This product was exactly what I thought. It's sturdy it works well and looks nice. I bought it for my kids tablet organization.
5,Bought this for my mother to better organize all her electronics. It was very easy to put it together and the material looks very well made. I also don't regret buying this verses the electronic organizers. Reading reviews for those made me worry that they may not last as long as a box would where as you can just put in your own extension plug and if anything happened to that you can easily get a new plug instead of having a big hunk of a broken electronic organizer. Plus the bamboo looks prettier then plastic and is relatively more eco friendly in the long run.
4,Love it! Just wish the slats didn't come out so easily when my kids pull their tablet off.
2,Lid doesn‚Äôt close even with smallest usb port inside. I bought the lowest profile usb ‚Äúsurge protector thing‚Äù to connect all the cords to and it still doesn‚Äôt shut all the way. Box is nice so it‚Äôs disappointing they didn‚Äôt raise the height by 1/2 of an inch.
5,I love this thing! My boys have a kindle each a nintendo ds each and a leap pad. Between all these cords were everywhere fights were had over which charger belonged to which boy and the device was plugged at random spot in the house just looking for a plug in. Now they all charge in one spot all cords are accounted for and all devices are docked each night so mom and dad can monitor device usage. We travel a lot so I love that I can unplug the surge protector from the wall and take the entire box with us and plug in at the hotel. Very sturdy!
5,Feels way more expensive than you are paying for. Be mindful of the type of power strip you purchase for this one is not included and it needs the original style power strip. But it cleans up a counter nicely and keeps everything neatly organized fits laptops well.
5,This is a very well constructed box. I like being able to hide a multi-port usb hub and power supply inside. It's a much cleaner look than the cable disaster I had before.
2,I began to assemble this and I got a nasty sliver in my thumb.This product is very useful just wear gloves while handling it. It's not finished.
4,Very happy with this product. Much better than the tangled mess we had pre-charging station. I like that you can hide the cords inside rather than having to buy short cords separately like a lot of the other charging stations I looked at. One downside is that our power supply strip was too big to fit inside. We ended up attaching it to the backside which worked out better because we occasionally turn off the main power to the strip and it's much easier to reach. 2 thumbs up!
5,Charging all our devices left the kitchen counter a mess of tangled cords and no space.  This charging station took care of all that!  I really like that the power strip goes INSIDE as does all the excess cordage of all the devices.  No more mess of cords and I get my counter back to boot!  This is the only "rack" I found that had spaces wide enough for my son's school-issued chromebook which came with a skin that makes it even wider.  We can charge his chromebook an iPad my Kindle 2 smart phones and 2 external batteries all at the same time--with no cord spaghetti!  I am very happy with this purchase!
1,Looks nice but straight away you can see it's small. And by that I mean too slim and low to fit a power bar in and then have charging plugs for your devices as well.The lid doesn't close properly so what we pictured of having a tidy charging station is going to look like spaghetti junction.Definitely not worth the money.
1,This thing is a piece of junk.  It literally disintegrated in my hands while holding it.  The seams are held together by tiny little metal pins.  I rarely post reviews but this one deserved it in a bad way.
5,Very sturdy each slot would hold an iPad with a heavy duty case. No issues so far. Plenty of room for cords and it comes with Velcro cord ties. Does not come with power strip.
5,This Bamboo charging station is the bomb!  It keeps all of my devices in order and looking clean and neat. I have an Anker USB 5 port charging unit inside the box. I also added two 4 - in - 1 Multi-functional Universal USB Charger Cable Adapters which handle all of my charging needs. The construction of the box is top notch. Although not needed it comes with assembly instructions. It includes sticky back velcro to hold your power source steady and several thin velcro straps for cable management. It looks good and does what I need. After you look at other similar items you will be back for this one to put into your Amazon Cart!  :-)
5,Came as expected and was a definite improvement from my past charger station.
4,Looks beautiful on our counter and holds everything I need it to. However the power strip I bought for it fits perfectly but does not allow me to plug anything in and replace the cover....unless I use the USB ports. That only allows me to charge 2 things at a time. Hopefully I can find something that works.
1,I really wanted to like this product. When it first arrived I assembled the lid and installed the wooden guides and thought that the lid felt very thin and weak. Like the type of wooden material that I put airplane kits together as a kid where the pieces just snapped apart.My family used it for two weeks and we set phones and tablets on top of it and today when I tried to add another USB cable inside the tope broke into 3 pieces. They should consider glueing a small piece of ABS plastic to the bottom as reinforcement nor using a better quality thicker wood for the base.The color & shape are great. I really like the design. A bummer it didn't work out.
5,Love it. It‚Äôs larger than I expected. Holds full sized iPad nicely. Looks expensive.  There are Velcro ties included for 5 wires. A nice extra.
5,This looks nice and helps to minimize the random charging cables around the house. The kids and adults all know that they can find an open cable to charge their device at any time. We use it for iPhones Kindles even phone power pack batteries. I like that the organizer is separate from the charging system - so that if any of the charging ports fail we can replace that without having to ditch the organizer.
1,Way overpriced for something that fell apart within a two days.
5,This is a great piece charging station. It is thick great quality and stylish to leave in a visible place. Holds the entire family‚Äôs phones at night. Wonderful value!
5,This charging station is outstanding amazing craftsmanshipvery well put together and made from bamboo not from beautiful big trees but from awesome bamboo.
4,With all the devices in our home we needed a charging station. The dividers that come with the electronic part kept breaking so we got this. It is very sturdy and looks much better than devices laying all over the table. Works with most charging devices.
3,I love the look of this station. I was disappointed to get a splinter from it though while unpacking it. One of the top dividers has a slightly unfinished edge. I'm hoping a little sand paper doesn't hurt the appearance or I'll have to send it back.
5,Love love love this charging rack! I researched a long time before deciding on this one and I'm so glad that I did! I purchased a 6-port USB charging station to fit inside and also a package of 1 foot micro USB charging cables rather than placing a power strip inside and using the longer charging cables that came with the individual devices. The cables I purchased are different colors so each kiddo knows exactly which one goes to their device which they love! I now have all of their electronics stored in a central location and out of the bedrooms. I would definitely buy this again!
5,I got this to house our tablets and kids phones. It's really sturdy I remember reading a review saying the slats were loose. Mine fit well and aren't loose at all. It also seems well made and looks good. I also like that the cords come through the little holes and don't get all tangled.
5,I hate a pile of chords on the counter and this hides it in a stylish convenient way. Love.
1,1.  It arrived with a broken piece.  It was broken BEFORE it was painted black.2.  Shipping is a nightmare and took nearly three weeks.3.  Don't try to register your product because the website does not exist.4.  The value for the price is horrific.  Do not waste your money on this.5.  The unit is very small.  If you have laptops or Chromebooks with charging cables that have the box unit half way through the cords forget it.  They will not all fit along with even a slim power strip inside the box.6.  Overall = A very disappointing experience for nearly $50.
1,This item could have been perfect for its intended purposes but multiple dividers did not fit in the slots on the lid. With improved manufacturing it could be perfect. As is...this is useless.
5,Ordered this to try and organize the charging cords for various devices. This works great very please with the quality of the product. Thank you
2,Right out of the box I could see the lid was cracked and one of the seams on the bamboo box was coming apart. The box it was delivered in was in good shape so I have to think this was a problem right from the distributor. I've purchased bamboo items before like a bamboo drawer organizer which also had similar construction or structural problems. Bamboo seems to be a poor material if you're looking for quality products.
4,This item is great. It easily fits the kids Fire Tablets with the large cases. Only complaint is the whole for the power plug is on the side instead of in the rear.
5,These are very nice bamboo boxes. Assembly is super easy. There is also a lot of room inside for either a power strip and chargers or a multi port usb Charger.I fit two 6 port usb charging hubs inside with plenty of room to spare and allow heat to dissipate.I also used a little wood glue to glue the fins in place. I plan on adding a few screws to prevent the cables from being pilfered.Very pleased. Great value.
5,Tablets and phones all over my counter were making me CRAZY! This is PERFECT. Nothing I would change. It's not too bulky is very well made and it holds even my kids' chunky tablet cases. Game changer!
5,This product has exceeded my expectations wonderfully made great quality. Now we have a place to charge our phones and tablets  at the same time and cero cord clutter!  I'm in cloud 9 right now thanks to the reviews I found what I needed. Thank you AMAZON and thanks to all customers that take the time to write a review it's important that we share our opinions on a product so we can save time and invest on the right product! üòçüòç‚ù§.
5,We have three kids doing online schooling. So we have four iPads and five iPhones. This is really nicely organized to store many of them at once.
4,Could have been an inch deeper to hold original charging cords. Simple fix is to use angled cords.  Took out 1 slat and sat 2 wireless chargers on top
2,The wooden slot didn‚Äôt stay in the hole and that‚Äôs my only problem! Considering gluing them at some point
3,Although the box itself is very nice the dividers on top are supposed to fit in some slots and they don't. The bottom of the divider is square and the slot has rounded edges- don't fit.
1,Fell apart before we even got anything was plugged in
5,Finally a rack that the electronics can be shelved away still visible and charging more like cataloged. The fact that a regular powerStrips fits inside is a great added bonus. Just make sure to measure the inside before ordering. I believe it can hold a simple 11‚Äù extension cord just fine.
5,Great quality! Exactly what we were looking for to hide cords and keep everything organized!
1,What a shame - it looks great but two issues for me. The first is the fact it was already falling apart see the photo‚Ä¶ held together by tiny staples. Doesn‚Äôt even look like anyone checked this before it was shipped. Second is I got a massive splinter in my hand because this wasn‚Äôt sanded down/polished. Cheap work and splinters everywhere that forced me to use wood polish with gloves to smooth it out.
5,Great product! Sturdy and nice color. Helps keep your electronic area looking nice and organized.
5,Bought for my daughter.  She loves it
4,The product is well built and looks great. If I could change one thing it would be to lock the movable device dividers in place.  I ended up hot-gluing them in to keep my kids from accidentally knocking them out of place when grabbing their tablets.
5,I love this! It looks good in our kitchen and the box is big enough that it fits all the cords inside (just barely). It fits 2 laptops a switch and 2 kindles that both have thick covers.
5,Yes! Exactly what we needed to keep our charging cart organized. I‚Äôm so glad I found this. Delivery was fast and product seems durable.
1,It‚Äôs pretty obvious that a black sharpie was used in multiple spots to cover up spots where the finish was chipped off. For $43 I would have expected better.
5,Came quickly. Very sturdy. Love that the slots can be moved if needed.
5,I took it out of the box and was so happy. So sturdy and nice!
1,
1,I purchased the darker version. The finish is uneven and very thin in some spots. Also the logo is obtrusive and really janky looking. The dividers don't fit in the slots (the slots are too narrow). The lid is simultaneously too big along the length so it overhangs by 4mm - 5mm and too narrow by 4mm - 5mm. It also fits extremely loosely. You'd think that for nearly $50 it would attach with magnets like most of the sub $30 versions do. The bamboo is also very thin.I would pass on this and go for something cheaper and better made.
5,I finally have hidden storage for all of my charging cords!  Works perfectly and looks good on the counter in my kitchen!
5,This has taken our electronics and organized them all in one spot! Works great! Is sturdy. We use it for 2 laptops an I-pad and two I-phones. The cords and power strip tuck away nicely In the base and allow for neat storage.
1,I bought many items that my decorator picked out to redecorate my kitchen. When they arrived I left all the items in their boxes and waited until she came to put them in place. This  item arrived broken but the return date closed a couple days before it was opened.
5,Needed something to organize my family‚Äôs devices. This is perfect! Finally got all of the cords organized on my kitchen counter!
5,So far very satisfied. The dividers slot in snuggly and the whole thing feels very sturdy. Still looking a bit of a mess while we wait for the USB hub/strip to come in. Will update with a picture of the final set up.
5,Incredibly sturdy quality construction. Everything was packed very carefully to keep it safe during delivery. For it's size it is still fairly light but it's heavy enough that I don't have to worry about it sliding around.
4,Love it! Wish it also came in a darker color.
4,This is a nice looking charging station. I wish I didn't have to see the little bit of cord I am still seeing out of the back.  I like that the power strip hides inside the box.Mist of the dividers were a snug fit but one was loose.It has made our jumble of cords less annoying so I guess it's doing its job.
3,Got this as a gift for my son who has several devices to charge and have at the ready on his nightstand. Works great and looks great. Only issue was that one of the dividers cracked when putting it into position. It 'is' bamboo so that probably accounts for the delicate nature of the divider; however all the others are sturdy. Bonus: we had one extra in the box so it worked out fine.
4,works well for what I needed.  Cleaned my desk up a bit.
5,Plenty of room to cram it all in. We use it for more than 5 things. You can fit 3 cords thru one opening. House Rule: Push your cord back in after you unplug.
3,It's a lot harder to fit things in this than you'd think. Make sure you measure your powerstrip before you buy this. If you have anything that has a brick style plug the lid won't fit.
5,I love this thing! All cords did not fit inside so I placed on end of buffet with a strip next to it on th floor and cords come up from the strip and plug into my electronic product and when not charging I stick the end into the little hole on the side waiting for the next use.
1,I received a box of broken wood pieces however the box was just fine. It was only made with itty-bitty staples. The staples you use to staple paper together are thicker than the ones used on this product. I will be returning!!!
5,I love that a power strip hides in the bottom.  It has clean lines and looks stylish where it is sitting.  It could even be used as a mail holder.  I like that you can choose how many of the dividers to use.  It holds multiple iPad Pro's with covers with no problem.
5,I have been looking for a nice charging station for a while to help me organize all of the family gadgets. I love that it holds a power strip so that we can use our own chargers instead of universal ones and it looks really nice. The bamboo is exactly the color shown in the picture and the box/station is light and well made.
5,Love this! Clean design and looks great!
4,Awesome idea and looks nice... but two parts already broke. Not overly sturdy around kids that flop iPads in it.
5,Well made and beautiful! It's already on my dresser with all my devices! Looks really organizes. I'm in love! <3 I wish they made some different styles and even bigger ones for more devices! @_@
5,Absolutely fantastic! Sturdy very well made pretty. And best of all I now have a place to put all of my charger chords and my Kindle and cell phone so they won't get lost!
5,This just works very well. It is a little expensive but overall I really like it and have no complaints.
5,This is a cool little device holder and charging station. Got it for my mom she has a bunch of tablets and what not works great to help declutter her electronics and is pretty.
5,I wish I took a before pic. I had a basket with all the electronics and it turned into a junk collector. I got this and it looks amazing. I wish I could have found one with a more ‚Äúrustic‚Äù look but who cares it‚Äôs in the laundry room. I took one of the slates out to put the mini speaker.
2,Started out good but in less than 5 months the entire top is cracked.
5,This wooden piece is very nice good quality wood nice finish
5,You just need to find a power strip that accommodates the plugs you want here. I have two phones two Amazon Fire tablets and an old iPad on mine and it has really cleaned up our cabinet.
5,This product is nicely made and works well.
4,Quality finish very nice.
5,The charging station is perfectly spaced to allow for your tablets or phones. We have covers on all our devices and the tablets still fit within the slots on top of the box. I also appreciate that you can hide all wires and allow only what is needed from the pre-cut openings. All around a great product.
1,This could have been better designed if it were a larger box (there is not a whole lot of room for wires inside the box especially for macbook chargers).Also the hole that goes from your  wall outlet to the power strip is in an odd place. The power strip had to be tilted the way it is designed.It also would have been handier to have the power strip go through a slot and not a hole (in case the wire is bigger than the hole).  And it would have been nice if the area where the electronics stood had some sort of friction to prevent them from sliding out easily.So basically I can't use this :(
5,I like that it‚Äôs bamboo. Looks nice on my counter.
2,I thought this would be perfect for a chrome book charging station for my kids. It looked fantastic and I was excited to set it up. Over the next week three of the wooden dividers broke off where they insert into the lid. Very disappointed and now it‚Äôs essentially useless. I thought it would be a lot more sturdy. Save your money.
5,This is perfect to hold our electronics and organize the cords. It looks very clean and sleek.
5,Perfect quality came with extras I appreciated very well made product. Feels like something that was built with care.
5,Great way of organizing your techie mobile devices! We have 2 IPads 2 IPhones and 2 Fitbit Watches and this solved our messy cordage problem and cleaned up our dresser dramatically! I put the Ravpower 6 port charger inside used all factory cables with the enclosed Velcro wire ties to shorten what protruded to about 8-10". A perfect solution to what was a messy spaghetti bowl... Love It!
5,Just what was advertised and what I wanted
5,Perfect for all of our devices. Hidden bin has plenty of space for power strip charging blocks and cables.
4,Works exactly as expected and looks nice. Nothing fancy but functional.
3,Two of the slats were too wide for the slots which was disheartening. I trimmed the bottom of the two slats to try to get them to fit. I should have returned for replacement. I like how the product was packaged the sturdiness and configuration. It would have been five stars for me if all the slats actually fit on the one I received.
5,Made of bamboo so lightweight but it is a perfect "parking lot" for our family devices.  I may order another one to try to keep up with the tech. I appreciated the velcro to keep the power strip in place in the box and the cord straps to keep things tidy. Great idea!
5,Like this quite a bit! Great place to charge my kids‚Äô kindles with the bulky cases. Needed a charging hub inside but that was easy enough to find. Keep cords and clutter to a minimum. Wish there was a place to charge all four sets of over the ear headphones too!
5,It is compact yet functional.
4,Exactly what I needed on the side table to hold my mobile gadgets. Be careful when lifting the lid after assembly as some of the dividers may slip out of the slots. The clackety-clack when adding gadgets isn't bad ‚Äî probably a norm for bamboo-made items like this. Fairly sturdy and attractive.
5,The unit will neatly hold thick or thin phones/tablets the inside of the unit is large enough to accommodate most charging solutions it is sturdy appearing built to last and the price was good given the design and material.
5,Easy to assemble. Once we figured out how we wanted it I lighltly glued the dividers in. Inside is large enough for my 6 port charher with room to spare. This is  a well designed and strong unit that has centralized our charging and even finding phones and tablets.
5,Initially I really liked this charging station rack.  It had just the right amount of slots and they were far enough apart to fit all the iPad and Kindle Fire tablets we had.  It also had room to add an appropriate multi-port USB charger and could keep the cables neatly stowed.  I had a few issues with the sides coming off but customer service took care of the issue promptly.
5,I was in desperate need of a charging station to contain all our electronic devices and this fit the bill perfectly! Not only is it small and functional but it‚Äôs aesthetically pleasing and looks great sitting on my desk! I rarely take the time to leave a review but if you‚Äôre considering an organizational station for 2018 I couldn‚Äôt recommend this more!
4,This box is nicely constructed and holds your devices well. The top sliders are a little loose and could stand to be designed to be tighter. The storage under neath has ample amount of room for cables and usb chargeing station
5,I got this for my wife who has more tablets and readers than I do.  Before. We had lots of cables running everywhere to charge them.  Now. The USB charger strip is hidden inside and it is all easily accessible and organized.  Great purchase.
2,This is cheaply made. I do like the design and the material.
5,I had to return a couple charging stations because they couldn't hold tablets that are in cases. This one seems to be a perfect fit.
5,We used to have cables strewn all over the counter.  This cleans up all the cables and gives us a great place to store tablets and phones.  Be sure you purchase a separate USB power block as this does not come with it.
3,Arrived broken.  Shipping box was in tact but item was not sturdy enough to survive the shipment.  One of the sides fell off in the shipping box.
5,Excellent charging station for all of our devices!
5,I love it.  But the average size Surge Protector doesn't fit in it.  11" inches inside but most are longer than that.
1,The product came in broken and I had to return it. That is all I can say in the review.  I would have probably have liked the item if it had been in tact.
5,The seller is great to work with. Product arrived intact. I love it. Would definetly buy again.
4,Keeps cords hidden the countertop clean and we always know where the tablets are.
5,Love this! The bamboo is modern looking the box interior was just the right size to fit our current power strip and now this family of 5 has a tidy and organized little charging station instead of an ugly tangled mess of cords!  Perfect!
5,Very easy to put together. Works great for my child to keep all his electronics organized without having to search all over the house to find where they are plugged in. He now keeps them all perfectly organized in this charging station.
1,Broken right out of the box. The front panel of the box is almost split across the whole length of the box. Didnt even have the option to replace only to return..and now if I want to reorder I have to pay more than the cost the first time I purchased. Disappointed I couldn't even get a replacement without paying more.
3,Overall I like the organizer.  Unfortunately there was a manufacturing flaw and the dividers would not fit in the slots.  The slots we too short so I had to trim the tabs on the dividers with a Dremel tool yup get them to fit.
5,This desktop charging station is awesome.  I fit my own 5port charger inside it and it hides all the cables.  The removable slots are a nice touch and I can easily fit kindle fire kids edition with case on in between the slots.  Well worth the purchase.
1,Don't waste your time on this one. If you have chargers that have any sort of size to them at all this box won't accomdate them. Also the dividers are near impossible to put in based on how they are tooled in relation to the lid. I was so excited to have a neutral cord management system in our living room and this is a complete and utter disappointment.
5,This thing is awesome it has plenty of room for my tablets with thick foam cases for the kids and everything fits in there great i also purchased a usb hub and a pack of short cables and all our tablets can charge at the same time it looks great and does exactly what i bought it for!!!  Great looks and quality!!
5,Works as directed looks really nice and clean it‚Äôs light but stable and is the perfect width.
5,Unit is well-made and easy to assemble. I'm not sure what some reviews are referring to that the unit seems flimsy or cheap. It's bamboo which is lightweight but it definitely doesn't seem flimsy or cheap. Plenty of space between dividers for all of our tablets with cases. Note: if your charger doesn't I recommend a different style of surge protector.
5,Looks and feels well made. Fits Kindle fire kid edition with the cases on. Its main use for us is to hold and charge all of the kids kindled in the school room.
5,Wow I wish I had purchased this long ago.  We have 5 or 6 devices floating around/charging at any given time in our house.  This is a great way to keep the charging area organized.  It's next to me right now with 3 devices charging in it.
4,Looks nice and works well. I have a lot of cables so I wish it had a little more space inside the box.
2,Almost perfect until I tried to place the dividers into the slats. They don‚Äôt fit. It‚Äôs maybe a couple mm off. It‚Äôs so close but no amount of forcing will get them in. Otherwise fits a multi port usb extension cord and various charging cables well. Looks nice. Great size for countertop organizer.
1,Was broken on delivery.  I glued it back together as to avoid dealing with the return but it does not look very good now.  Would avoid this cheaply made product.
5,I bought it to have a cell station most of it for my visitors and nailed it! Everyone uses it and it's easy to remember where in the world did I leave my phone!
5,I installed an outlet strip and a multi-USB outlet inside the box and hooked all my devices up including a Macbook.  Only wires I see are the short ones coming out the holes in the side of the box.  Looks much nicer than the spaghetti mess I had before.
5,Good design. Does what it's supposed to. Easy to cable manage.
2,Dividers keep falling off. Glue that I have for wood doesn‚Äôt seem to even be keeping it up. Don‚Äôt waste your money.
4,Helps eliminate device and charger clutter on my desk. Pretty natural wood adds style to the glass metal and plastic world of electronic gadgets.
4,Met expectations
4,Very attractive and sturdy. I would give it five stars but the lid doesn't fit very securely. Other than that I am very happy with my purchase. I would definitely recommend it.
5,I've tried many different charging stations but I didn't like having wires everywhere. This station is perfect because the power strip and wires are all hidden inside so it pleases my clutter-hating heart.
5,We needed something bad.  I was tired of everyone's tablets game systems phones and cords all over the house.  Now everyone goes straight to this docking station and mom is happy!
5,We live in a world of gadgets and this means charging cables - lots of them. This bamboo charging station rack helped me stay organized and uncluttered. No more entanglements no more flailing cables all over the place.
5,works for all our kids crome books and phones.
2,The wood on the lid is starting to split with a piece coming off and I haven‚Äôt even had it a day. It‚Äôs a clever idea and much neater than other charger systems I‚Äôve used but it costs a lot and the quality is questionable.
1,I would have loved this except the dividers are a little too big for the slots. My charging station rack CRACKED while I was trying to fit the dividers into the slots. Maybe mine is defective but I am really disappointed in the workmanship.
1,Dividers didn't fit.  Broke the base because of how hard I had to push on the dividers to get them into the slots.  Tried 3 only 1 fit.
5,I like it. Very sturdiness but kind of heavy and bulky. Kind of pricey for this as well but overall it‚Äôs a good purchase to make cables organized.
5,Our technology is now organized nicely!  Great product!
5,This is exactly what I was looking for.
5,Little over the top as far as a luxury goes but this is a great piece to have.  Very clean and organized way to store your devices or to have on hand at a party so you can offer your guests a charging station.
5,Great product nicely made and sturdy.  Exactly as described.
3,Mostly great however one of the wooden inserts snapped at the point where the tab fits into the bottom slot which means it has lost functionality of one of the slots. Overall a terrific product but the upright inserts could do to be stronger
5,This gets used often in our house. We use it for iPads iWatches and iPhones. At first I purchased 4" cables but they were too short. It works better with longer cables. Plus you want the ability to look at your phone while it's charging. Great when visitors are over. They all love it.
5,Love this so far! Everything went together perfectly! Would buy again!
5,The perfect solution for dealing with a web of cables on my kitchen countertop. Finally everything is tidy.
5,Looks so much better on my counter all my chargeable stuff in one place nice and neat! Headsets cell phone iPad etc Love it!!
3,Very quick delivery!  The product does not stay shut and with five Google chrome books with the chargers the lid does not stay closed. There are only 5 slots. A power strip does not fit in there with the cords.
5,Have two 5-port USB Anker desktop chargers in the base.  There's plenty of space to store the chargers and there's lots of leftover room to effectively manage the cables.
5,This looks Beautiful on my night stand. It's a great place to put all of our devices particularly my kids devices after technology time is over. I can see at a glance who hasn't turned in their iPad or iPhone and hunt it down lol!
5,The product stores phones and tablets well reducing clutters. Slight issue with one divider wobbling but customer service responded fast and promptly sent out part. My Anker 6 port charger fits with plenty of room left.
5,Great looking and functional charging station/organizer. We use it with multiple iPads and phones with no issues.
5,This is such a lifesaver! Between my kids I have to charge 6 tablets every night and this keeps the area clean and organized. I wish I purchased this earlier!
1,I rarely write reviews but I am compelled to do so for this product. I really had high hopes when I purchased this as I have multiple devices to keep up with and having 6 different chargers to deal with was getting to be a nightmare.Upon its arrival I realized the mistake I made. Poor quality. The dividers are much thinner than the slots except for one. I did what i could to wedge paper in to help but that didn't solve the problem fir long.Also the design is such that you need to tape down each cable or they will be constantly shuft into other positions. It's a shame because having a single main charger with an organized neat way to store your devices is such a great idea. This one however is poorly executed. I've finally lost my patience and threw it away.
5,This is terrific and more durable than expected...highly recommend.
2,Not sure if we just got bad pieces but It was so hard putting it together & seeing that it‚Äôs pieces you insert that says a lot!! The pieces are diff shapes and so thick. It was such a pain.
5,No more misplaced charging cords and devices scattered throughout the house. All you need is a surge suppressor strip. (Under 12" long I believe.) This product keeps everything tucked away neatly within reach.Tablets and phones with covers easily fit . Station seems solidly built. Recommended.
3,Good organizer. Unfortunately one of the dividers had a piece of the top that snapped off. It wasn‚Äôt dropped or anything so I‚Äôm not sure why it happened? It looks nice and does the job lab
2,This is actually a nicely made piece the wood is solid the paint looks nice and it works perfectly.  However they branded it with a big gold logo right on the top as if anyone cares.  It‚Äôs ugly and unnecessary.
5,Good quality you need to order all wires to go inside. Matches well with light wood. Looks good with black cables.
5,I don‚Äôt know why didn‚Äôt get it sooner! I can keep up with all my family‚Äôs tablets our phones and my Apple Watch...all in one place! Love it
5,So far so good.  It needs a power strip inside to really be effective.  I will update once I get it like I want it.  However the product itself seems to be well built and sturdy.
1,Material is not worth the money .. perfectly sealed and packaged ‚Ä¶. But the box was broken ( lot of cracks) that‚Äôs visible without even opening the package40$ is expensive for the box that‚Äôs not well made
5,Family (and most importantly wifey) absolutely love it - looks function all of it.  No more cable mess and you can fit tablets with thick cases easily between the slots.  Paired with an ankler 6-port fast charger and short cables you can't ask for more.
5,Super functional and a nice way to keep your charging station looking tidy.
5,This was really life changing for us.  We charge all of our phones and kindles on it and keep it in a nightstand drawer.  Very well made.
2,I wanted something that looks nice and hides all the cords but you can't really hide everything with a 2x2 inch hole on both sides of the box.
1,Two of the wooden separators broke on this within 3 months of use. This only worked to separate phones. IPads broke 2 of the separators. It was expensive. I‚Äôm really upset that this only has a 30 day warranty. The company should replace or refund me.
5,We use this in our home office. Great way to organize cords and charge devices. iPads and phones fit great. Love this!
2,The slats holding the device up while charging have all broken.  I wish I could return.
1,The dividers have rectangular bases and the slots to put them in have long slots with curved edges so the holders don‚Äôt even fit.
5,Works beautifully and the quality is great!!
5,Sturdy great design. Looks great on my desktop.
5,Bought this to keep 4 cell phones and an ipad organized.  Works great looks nice and it isn't plastic! yay!  Fits our decor and was super easy to assemble.
5,Really nice little stand holds all of my smart devices neatly and keeps them organized! Love the wood and how the wires can be hidden. Does not come with UsB multi port so you'll have to buy one separately.
3,I actually needed to add to the height of the box in order for the combo outlet bar to fit inside with the converter male cords attached. It was kind of awkward.
1,Arrived very cheaply constructed with sides poorly secured and nails poking out of gaps between the sides. I would not buy it again.
1,Poor quality cheaply made. Came apart just taking it out of the box. Terrible for the money.
5,Plenty of room for multiple devices.  Looks attractive and everything fits all of our devices
1,Products slots did not fit into whole. Pieces of wood slintering. Returned this product.
5,posted a review earlier but amazon deleted it for some reason. Was a 5 star and 5 star again...  You'd think ...  THINK that amazon would want to keep a positive review ...  lets try again!
5,Great. Doesnt smell at all. Keeps our families charging station very tidy.
3,Nice product but NOT worth the $30... more like a $15-$20 product.Well built but cheap and smaller than I thought for a Tablet stand.
4,has organized our entry nook nicely
2,Well packaged and looked of descent quality.However the shelves were cut in such a way that none of them fit in the slots returned it.
5,I love how this is designed. It's sturdy yet lightweight and fits easily on our small side table.
5,Great charging station for multiple devises. Love how it keeps the cords stored away.
5,Very nicely made and practical. Well thought out giving you the option of using it as a stand for a tablet or phone. Attractive.
5,I really really LOVE this organizer  Finally something STURDY and compact and attractive for all my devices.  No more tangled unsightly cords.  I HATE cords!!!!!
5,Good quality what I needed. I removed the slots on top and am just using it as a cable management system which is great since it's larger than the other items available
5,It does everything it says that it will and it does so while looking professional.
5,Just what we needed to clean up the charging area
5,This is great. I just wish it was more clear that it does NOT come with chords or anything. It‚Äôs literallt just the wood
1,When we opened the box the organizer was in pieces. And not the "some assembly required" type pieces. I'm talking dried glue exposed staples etc. I figured I'd have to insert the dividers but not break out wood glue and furniture staples after spending $30. Returning for a refund!
5,Works great with multiple laptops..you can store the power cables inside and keep your desk clean.
4,Works as expected. Slightly smaller inside than I anticipated. Need to buy new surge protector to fit inside.
4,Works great but cords do still stick out a bit.  It is great for organization though!
5,Tablet & smartphone. It is small in size & space.
5,Love this product. We created an overnight charging station for our kid's devices and this product looks nice and is well made. Would definitely recommend.
5,I love it
5,Very happy with this. Holds smartphones iPhones Chromebooks RAV batteries and more. All with cases. Short cables out of the box keep the tangle monster away.
2,Bought this to organize our electronic devices in our household. Within the first week it was broken.  The slats broke off at the base with minimal pressure--all but two (smallest)--rendering this practically useless.  I want to note that the wood actually snapped it did not break off where it may have been glued.  Not durable. Looks nice but didn't work for us.
2,This is a great idea but the box is too small to hold all the wires.  Get a bigger size
1,After only 2 weeks of use the top of the docking station split in half and is no unusable. I reached out to Amazon for a replacement & they said I had to contact the manufacturer which was closed at the time. Sadly the return window closed 2 days ago and now I‚Äôm stuck with a $30 docking station I can‚Äôt use. It looks lovely but it‚Äôs not sturdy & a total waste of money.
5,This has organized all of our electronics! Especially nice that it hides the cords.
5,Finally my desk doesn't have a huge mess of cables as they are all nicely tucked away inside of the box below
5,It meets our needs
5,Great product.  Looks exactly like photo's nicely finished (was half expecting splinters and things) well provisioned with Velcro strips etc.Nice design touches (rubber feet on lid and bottom of case) nicely spaces cable cut-outs.
5,I love this!  It was absolutely perfect.  Well made.  Easy to put together and sturdy.
5,Nicely put together. Nice finish. Excellent quality. Does what I want.Assembled my own charging station with an Anker 10 port USB charger Anker cables and bamboo charging rack. System works great and Anker quality is excellent.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00YRYKEYM/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01BIARJRM/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
1,First of all This bamboo charging station was supposed to be strong. As you can see in my pictures it wasn‚Äôt strong enough. I was kind of skeptical of buying it because of some reviews I saw. Unfortunately it happened to me too. Second of all the price should of been $10. The staple tag holds this ‚Äúbamboo‚Äù wood wasn‚Äôt strong. Finally I contacted the seller and never got a respond. So consequently i would have to give it a bad review for quality over price and bad customer service. Save your money and look somewhere else.
5,Built beautifully. all parts fit nice and snug. Just the right size for our space. Makes everything so organized and we love it.
5,Met my need perfectly!  A way to keep it all together in one place.
2,This box fell apart as soon I it arrived. The bamboo is too soft to just use staples and not glue. I added wood glue to the sides of the box and it will do but I should not have to reassemble a product i purchase.
5,This is a good product and it looks nice! Each device has a place to stand while it charges. The wires are under control better than my old one. I love this product.
5,Just what I was looking for. It easily holds all of our household tablets and cords.
5,Kids can use it simply.  Having the kids kindles put up looks great.  Holds the fat rubber bumper kid Kindles easily!
4,Looks nice in my Living room No more cables laying on my floor!
5,Works well for charging our Samsung tablets.
4,Natural look. Like the product. Good fiction.
5,Worked well to clear up my mess of cords.  I use it with chromebook ipad ipad mini and multiple iphones.
5,Work great in the classroom to keep multiple devices organized.
5,Beautiful and just what I need
5,Works great combined this with a multi-charger at 2.4 amps per outlet now every night our family of electronic devices now charge silently line by line row by row.
2,Was excited to get this in the mail. However after using it for less than a week I noted that separation was already forming in one of the corners. We have had to put hot glue in it to keep it together as it just is held together very poorly. However after making our minor repair it does work as advertised.
5,Perfect for my kids iPad storage and my phone. Looks sleek and take up little page.
1,I wanted a charging station to organize my electronics and thought that the bamboo box from Prosumers was attractive and the solution to my clutter. The first box arrived poorly constructed and the second box (replacement) was even worse.
5,I love this piece - I can plug in all  my electronics in one place!
5,This is great very helpful. Exactly as expected.
5,It does the job.  Fits MacBook iPad 2 fireHD 2 iPhones. Good electronic clutter organizer.
1,3 of the 4 corners of the box were splitting before I even removed it from the shipping box. It also had glue strands or fiberglass residue all over the inside of the bamboo box as well. Not worth shipping back for a discount. They might as well sell the box and have people DIY the gluing; it'd probably be a better job.
3,One of the wood dividers broken pretty early on.  I'm sure some wood glue would work to fix it.
5,Great addition to our kitchen counter.  Looks way better and it's a must if you have a herd of kids with tablets.
5,Just what I was looking for. Fits my children's iPads with the big bulky cases. The bottom part fits all of the cords and a charger.
5,Purchased for Daughter she was using this to organize her electronics.
5,Well Constructed.  Fits large tablets like the kids Amazon Fire Tab with rubber bumper and an Ipad with Otterbox case.  Looks good too!
1,Poor quality
5,Sturdy construction and easy to put together. Includes Velcro for power strip and cord organizers as well. Uncluttered my counter with a sleek wood design. Absolutely love this product!
5,High quality wood and a great charging station all around. It really organized my charging set up. It's a great all around product for the price!
5,This thing is great the kids their friends and I all love it!
5,It is a great idea to organize the cables and your devices.
5,Easy system for organizing things
5,Easy to setupLooks goodGood quality
5,I love this item. I bought a power strip to go with it b/c of the various items we had to charge. It was exactly what I was expecting.
5,Beautiful and hold my tablet and phones on my desk
5,Lid could be a bit heavier. But honestly cleaned up our charging station.
5,This works really well to keep our electronics organized and charging.
5,Sturdy and compact.  I‚Äôm happy
5,Well designed way for us to charge multiple tablets phones etc.
5,Beautifully crafted. Functional for our home. One of the few products that I could find with slots wide enough for devices with kid protectors on.
5,Great quality and good setup. It does need a lid lock though.
5,Love it!!! My area looks so much better now!
5,Beautiful product!  Holds all my family's iPads and phones and looks great in our living room.
2,It's beautifully designed and of incredibly good quality.  BUT I found it cumbersome to use my existing power strip and cords with this.  Also I would have to pull the cord out pretty far to answer my phone while it was charging and then I'd have to stuff it back in.
5,Seriously awesome!  Keeps our cord madness contained and organized!
5,Very nice and great quality!
5,great idea to keep kids tablets or phones in one area
5,Very pleased with this product
2,Three parts of this have cracked off easily.
5,All is right with the world! This solves all the nightly dance of the cords! It's a answer to my prayers!
1,As soon as I took the product out of the packaging it started to fall apart. The staples holding it together were detached from the body of the box. To be fair it was probably damaged during the shipment but I was very disappointed as I had to start over and order something else. I‚Äôve lost several days and am still in need.
1,This was not sturdy at all. It broken within a week of us using it. It might handle one or two phones easily but nothing else.
5,Great piece. Helps keep all my gadgets organized.
5,This is a great charging stand. Sturdy construction snug fitting pieces no need to glue stays together.
1,The holes to mount the stands in are too small and the wood cracks apart.  The stand fell apart the first time in fell off the table too.
5,I like this a lot - it's by my bedside and keeps everything organized.
5,Beautiful product and I believe almost every home needs to have one to organize their electronic devices.
3,It looks nice but my charger sits up too high for the cover to close completely.
5,Works for all our our devices and cleans up the cord mess on our counter.
5,keeps all ipad organize when charging.
5,Nice!
5,Very nice product. Starting construction. Very useful item to have worth the money.
5,Well constructed and works great for hiding messy wires
1,The box contained 2 pillow cases not a organizer.
1,I‚Äôm really disappointed in this product. I used this to store chrome books in my classroom. Initially I loved it. Easy to set up fit laptops perfectly and looked nice. After a few weeks one of the dividers snapped! I wouldn‚Äôt purchase it again unless it was to store phones or very light tablets.
5,This is very nice looking and great for a classroom.
5,Finally something that looks good and controls the clutter. Easy to assemble.
5,I love this very nice looking and easy to use
5,Very useful
5,Very nice box
5,Been using for over a year and it works great!
5,Exactly what we needed to clean up the charging clutter.
1,Would like to have used this but literally the second we put a device on it it cracked. Looks like pieces of bamboo glued together and not very well. Good design but poor quality
5,Very useful I love it!
5,Love it
1,Item looks great but had to use wood glue to glue seams back together after less than a week. Good design with poor craftsmanship.
5,Very nice setup and works just as advertised.
2,Looks nice but extension barely fits the box so you can't close it. I just use it for mail.
1,Box already coming apart at the corners:(
5,Worth every penny!
5,Excellent construction everything I expected
1,Fins keep breaking!  Not well made!
5,very handy unit attractive and convenient.  good value
5,very ergonomic and useful.
2,Pictures make it look like a solidly built product.  In reality it's very lightweight and feels cheap.
2,Design was good but the top cover started to crack or was already cracked when i got it.
5,excellent station
1,The slats were too large to fit in the respective openings in order to create the "standing folder" look.  Returning ASAP.
5,Perfect for organizing our electronics
1,Sucks!  Looks cheap.  Poor quality.  Two of the dividers did not fit into the pre-cut slots.  Basically unusable.  Returning it.
1,I got the top rack part not the bottom box part. Maybe it shipped separately?
5,Works as advertised.
5,Excellent product.
1,Cheap
5,What a great find!  I am not really a Data Hoarder but I have a few backup and/or storage drives to keep my MacBook from being clogged to the max.  Still I got sick & tired of the cluttered mess of my extra hard drives... more than the Mac's two USB ports could deal with.  When I started looking for a solution finding a good USB 3.0 hub was easy but I wanted the MESS cleaned up.  Oh I found a couple of trashy plastic racks that might have done the job but we just remodeled the family room that houses the desk... and  wanted something nicer.  This rack by Prosumer's Choice was even better than I'd hoped.  I found it on Amazon and my spouse loved it and ordered it immediately.** I never expected a piece of furniture made from SOLID wood.  This box is built like they made them a hundred years ago... that's not an exaggeration.  It's made from bamboo wood but I wouldn't know it from any other nice wood.  I expected the usual pressed "wood" chip junk and would have been satisfied with that.  This is MUCH nicer... very solid with good quality and finish.  I looked it over three times trying to find the decal veneer or evidence of the garbage you find when you buy an inexpensive bookshelf.  -No ground up wood here!  I would have expected it to cost much more.-In my searching for a solution I learned that other people are in the same boat.  Many are tired of looking at surfaces cluttered with phones & tablets external drives etc.  My answer was a 7-port Sabrent HB-U930 that's a bit smaller than a pack of cards and this classy rack for my four external drives (with room for a phone and iPad to boot).  I was prepared to settle for a cheap-looking plastic rack that I'd hate looking at.  Instead I found that makes the desk look a LOT nicer for a few bucks more.  They have a few other sizes of this also but this box can actually hold my surge protector bar along with that USB hub!  You might think then that it's a huge thing- but it isn't.  The main box is about the size of a kids' shoebox.  If you think it's a bit expensive when you can get a crummy plastic CD holder to do the job it's a good value.  If you prefer a better appearance it's a real bargain for the quality you get.  If this model isn't the perfect size or color for you then go to the manufacturer's site for other versions.  My before and after pics tell the whole story.
5,It was exactly what I wanted
3,Won‚Äôt charge through case.
4,Great style but could be longer and deeper especially deeper.
5,Finally! A solution to our desk of chargers.  I wish it was a little cheaper but overall great purchase
5,Really happy to see this in bamboo due to the environmental benefits. Really helped to clean up our growing ‚Äúcharging area‚Äù. Some of the tolerances aren‚Äôt quite perfect for example you may be able to tell in the photo that there is a slight overhang on the top only on one side. This doesn‚Äôt bother me but might bother some perfectionists out there. It seems high quality for the price point.The dividers are press fit so you may need to tap a few of them into their holes but this is not difficult.The box is just the right size IMO to house the charger and the random-length cables you‚Äôll undoubtedly populate this thing with. I suggest bundling and zip tying your cables to maintain order inside the box. I paired this with an Anker USB charger and it‚Äôs a great partnership.All in all a fine solution to the charger mess problem and it suits our family well.
3,I should have bought something like this years ago. It looks very nice and once I got it set up it has kept me so much more organized and productive in regards to always having my laptop tablet and phone charged. It has also kept me from losing my devices all over the house as it is a pleasure to put them away and plug them in. That being said the construction of this box is very flawed. The slats are not big enough for the dividers. The dividers are not all the same thickness. The thinnest ones were able to fit in the slots with great force and patience. The shorter phone divider cracked the end of the lid when installing. It's not visibly noticeable but it makes that divider lose. There is one slot that has no divider as the two remaining dividers (they give you one extra) are not going to go in not even close. I kept it anyway and enjoy having it.
5,This is a lightweight sturdy made product. The dividers are firm and fit easily into their slots. This is exactly what I was looking for and I searched a long time. My son is in his 30's and he was also giving it a thumbs up!
5,Researched many many charging stations and chose this one because:1.  Slots work with Otterbox cover on IPad2.  Also fits children's kindles with oversized covers3.  Attractive bamboo finish to use in any decor4.  Drawer below hides either a surge protector or multiple USB charger5.  Small support in first slot allows to see phone in case of calls while charging.Purchased an Anker 5 port usb charger on Amazon to work with this station.  Children put away their kindles when not in use.  Eliminates chargers and electronic devices all over the house.  Only item not fitting in the charging station was their robot monkey but he sits next to station and still can use one of the ports.  Win win for me!
5,This was a gift for my parents. They have embraced all the tech gadgets and rather than listening to my mom complain again about my dad‚Äôs charging cords everywhere I had this sent to them. It‚Äôs perfect. It does the job looks nice and you can customize the slots and gaps to accommodate different gadgets. They love it.
5,Product arrived as described. Well packaged good quality easy to assemble.
5,My husband loves this tumblers. Hot and cold beverages work ot great. Great tumbler!
5,Nice and roomy keeps cords hidden gaps are large enough of thicker charger cords can hold several chargers and bricks and hubs in a tidy little space. Great little box.
5,I buy way to much stuff (crap) but I am pleased with this nifty charging station for two IPads two IPhones Camera's and one Kindle. So much neater to look at and as one who hates to see messy wires and cables this solved the problem.
5,Nice quality looks good and keeps everything nice and organized with hideous wires out of sight.
1,(Mine was dark brown.)  Only one of the slats actually fit into the cut grooves in the top and when I tried to remove it the slat split leaving a piece in the groove it had been in.  It was really nice looking but if it doesn't work it really doesn't matter.  Amazon immediately refunded my money.
5,First I want to say that with my need to keep things organized and my wife's need to put everything in either a basket or decorative bowl. I have been pulling my hair out with the kids tablets and phones.Finally after much debate I successfully got her to ditch the bowl.Now on to the reviewProsIt's a box with slats allowing me to hide the cables and the USB charging hub.It can handle the large cases on the kids tablets.Its better than a bowl for this purposeConsCan't think of any at this moment.Good buy if you are looking to organize your family tablet spotPica will come when I update the review
2,I loved the idea of removable slots that had wider gaps compared to the one I previously purchased. I tried to put my child‚Äôs iPad in the charging station to charge and the wood just completely snapped at the base. Definitely not sturdy.
5,This works near perfectly for my classroom chromebooks. I HATE cords everywhere and because of limited wall plugs I was really worried about where to put the Chromebook. My ONLY complaint and this is laptop or Chromebook specific is that the box space inside only holds 4 laptop chargers (because they are so bulky). I wish it were a bit larger so I could fit one more in there!
4,I have had a few plastic ones and unfortunatly because of my toddlers..  you guessed they get broken. I decided to try again with a wooden one. So far this has been reallt nice and doing the job. oy reason for 4 star is i wish the dividers locked in easier they just slide out easily so i may just glue them in but the same thing with the top piece. Wish it had a locknor something to stay on you bump it and it slides ofd
1,I should have believed all the reviews that described the product arriving in pieces. All 4 sides were detached. Luckily I have tools and glue to put together my supposedly assembled product. I could have tried return roulette to see if a replacement would have arrived properly but I've had terrible luck with Amazon returns in that regard.I had no issues with the fit of the dividers nor have any split. At least initially. I'll update the review once I own and use it for some time. The branding is visible but I don't find it objective.All in all not worth the $40 price perhaps half that
5,This is a sturdy well thought out product. I would buy again.
3,It has a very tiny room for the chargers. I could only out two laptop charger and one iphone charger. The laptop charger needs much more room than ipad/phone charger. If you are trying to keep a laptop with other small devices organized it is a good organizer. But if you are trying to keep multiple laptops like I do it is not an ideal organizer.
5,My husband loved it. It got here just in time for Christmas too !
5,We've had a stack of iphones and ipads  that were a giant mess.  This finally cleans that up and does so cleanly.  Love it.  I wish there were different colors offered but it's a really great organizer.
4,Pricy for what it is but great product.
5,Very nice and worth it. You feel really organized when you set it up. Get a power strip to put in it.
5,Favorite purchase in the past few months. I love how nice and neat it makes my shelf look.
5,Great organizer worth the money
5,This is very well made and sturdy and well worth the price.  The concept is well thought out and works wonderfully for our needs.
4,It's what it is a wooden box with separators.
5,Love this well built and sturdy and looks great and hides those cables very well
5,Easy for organizing all mobile devices.
5,I was originally going to just make my own charging station but figured I'd take a look at what was available first.  This item was almost exactly what I was going to make so I just bought it.  It even came with a few cable ties and Velcro to hold a power strip in the base.  So far it's been a perfect solution.
5,There are complaints that this product doesn‚Äôt work well with MacBooks. I‚Äôm here to tell you it works seamlessly with mine. My charging area is so neat now I don‚Äôt recognize it.  Easy to set up looks great and even comes with twist ties for cords. A happy purchase!
5,Great price not cheaply made great wood
5,This was just what I was look for. It‚Äôs great quality and fits a full sized plug strip hidden away inside. It fits everything neatly and looks perfect. Very pleased with this.
2,Cords  lift lid up...
5,
5,This fixture allowed us to wrangle 3 Leap Pads an iPad and a phone.  The hardest part of this purchase was finding a power strip that would work with the transformers and plugs I already had.  (Hint:  A surge suppressor with USB ports built in did the trick but I also had to watch plug orientation.)
5,My kitchen counter looks so good now without all the cords on it!!! Completely worth the money!
5,Works great.  All but one dividers fit in sung and won‚Äôt fall off. I did get a sliver though from the corner but hoping that was only a one time thing.  Would recommend.
4,I would give this 5 stars if one of the dividers didn‚Äôt crack and split. I ended up having to take the time to glue it together & hoping it stays together. Otherwise it‚Äôs a nice box to hold your power source
5,I was going to build my own device charger but found this one. Once I received it I put a power strip and a multiport USB charger in there. All that fits nicely and I can charge 7 devices at one time. It's very stable and looks good as well.Pros: DurableStableGood AestheticPlenty of room on the inside for charging equipmentCharge 7 devices at the same timeLightweightCons: I haven't come across any thusfar.I would recommend this for anyone that is trying to find a central place to charge devices in your home.
5,My brother's kids always stacked electronics poorly and they fell off the charging table a lot.This helps (when they use it).
5,Ok so this deff exceeded my expectations. Was looking for a organizer that would hold the bulkly Kids Fire Tablets and this holds them perfectly. Built pretty sturdy and plenty of room inside for power adapters. Super happy to not have random tablets and chargers everywhere
5,This is a great docking station for devices in my home. I love that it came with a Velcro cord tie and adhesive for a surge protector. It‚Äôs the little things you know?
5,The device rack looks great and holds all my tablets safe and secure. Had one issue and the company quickly addressed my concern. Will buy more in the future.
5,4 kids means 4 tablets! This is amazing! Very sturdy and easy to use! I even took one wooden spacer out for room to charge there fitbits! I am going to get another one so they all have space for their tablet and Fitbit!
5,Good value
5,What a great product. Needed something with wider spaces for tablets and one that wasn‚Äôt plastic and would break. So happy with this one!
5,I struggle to find a way to store and charge all of my kids fire tablets neatly. They were often just stacked on top of the desk or sitting on the floor with cables everywhere. I wanted a place for them to charge and keep their tablets together and this was the perfect find! It hides all of the charging cables and keeps their tablets upright. The plus side is that it‚Äôs also a much prettier way to display and charge them. I‚Äôve had multiple people ask me about this item and purchase it once they saw it in action. My only complaint is that I feel like it is a little overpriced but I wasn‚Äôt able to find anything that I liked better than this for the price.
5,Well made...like the mild bamboo smell...
5,Needed something to fit iPads with cases kindles with cases and other devises and it works perfectly. Now to just get them to plug it inüôÑ
5,Perfect to charge all my families devices while hiding all the cords within the box.
5,Seriously amazing !!! Love it !! Didn‚Äôt realize it came with Velcro zip ties to tie wires inside but was so excited it did
5,Love this little thing! Received lots of compliments from visitors saying ‚Äúwe should get one of those‚Äù.
5,while this was a little more money that i had wanted to spend it was totally worth it. i wanted something that definitely had room for my kids‚Äô thick tablet cases and this totally fit the bill. plus plastic dividers probably would have broken pretty quickly anyways. these dividers are going to be able withstand daily use. and now there‚Äôs a safe ORGANIZED place to store and charge their tablets nightly.  plus it looks good so that‚Äôs always a plus.
5,Nice box with good packing and well fit design.The inner space can be bigger. I am using this box to cater 3 fast charger with 10+ cables out quite tight.
5,Parts fit well seems to be very sturdy.I like the black color
5,Bought for kids Kindle Fire tablets.  Fits them well even with Amazon's bulky kids case
5,Easy to set up and looks great hiding away the unsightly cords.
5,Phones
1,Ordered dark wood - got the light wood‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs fine.  Does what it‚Äôs supposed to.  Not really convenient.  Searching for a better option
5,I needed a charging Station because I am a wrter and need to hook up a lot of devices.  It is great.  I did not read all of the words about the item.  My fault.  I did not notice there was not a charging strip.  My mistake .  I like the wires don't show and it is. Easier to use.
4,It works exactly as it says. The box is a little tight with the cords inside but works super well once you get it all situated.
5,Just as described. Good quality well made.
5,Streamlined our space
5,Love this little organizer.  Our two computers Ipad two phones and two ear buds are all in one organized place and wires/cords are hidden.
5,I don't know how I lived without this.  Yes I do . . . electronics scattered here and there.  Now they are all in one place and there is a place to put them back.  It holds everything even with the case on.
4,No issues cute but a little more ‚Äúunstained‚Äù look than I thought it was going to be. High price wish it came with iPhone cords or outlets.
5,This is the best charging center. It allows for the power strip to fit inside perfectly. I am so pleased with it.
5,I was looking for something nice affortable and practical and this product was the perfect fit. In size color and most of all it came just in time.
5,Eliminated the rats nest of cords for phone/tablets and earbuds. Put it on a smart plug and you can turn it off when not in use.
5,This is a well-made product. It has room for at least five tablets and devices although it‚Äôs easy to fit several more as each slot can fit two or three devices. I really like how it‚Äôs cleaned up my table so instead of four or five cords all over the place there‚Äôs only one cord coming out of this box
5,I use this and it makes the counter a bit less cluttered with cords.  Got a USB charging brick to put inside and it is working well for me.  Looks good too!!
