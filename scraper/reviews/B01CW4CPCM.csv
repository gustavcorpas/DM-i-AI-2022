4,I live alone and got this to keep an eye on my cat while I was gone for a week and to make sure the pet sitter was coming. Like others have said the night vision is great and being able to hear sounds live from the camera is nice. It does constantly pop up to pay for their cloud though which is 100 dollars for a year. I certainly don't have that kind of money and wish I could turn the pop-up every time I open the camera feed off. That being said the live camera feed is definitely good enough for what I bought the camera to do! It does catch some activity but it seems pretty inconsistent and also cannot differentiate between my cat and a person. It will send me "person detected" when my cat walks by in the middle of the night which is either quite a fright when I'm not home or maybe would cause me to disregard the message if a burglar actually did come in. Also I think it will only record activity in 5 minute intervals or so. It will take a screenshot when it detects the activity but without the subscription you can only see a tiny thumbnail of the picture. Which again is enough to be able to tell my pet sitter came or perhaps see my cat's tail somewhere in the frame but no more than that.All in all it's a great little camera that certainly will do what it needs you to do but the more convenient options are locked behind a paywall that may not be affordable to some like myself.
5,This camera is great! I’m able to check in at anytime to see what my cats are doing! I’m able to talk to them and can also hear them! The night vision works great!  There is a spot for a micro sd card but I decided to spend the $5 for the Kami cloud! It’s cheap and there are multiple package deals and options for monthly or yearly!
5,It works great! Easy setup following the instructions. A great view of the whole room and if you set it up motion sensor it follows every move. The sound is quiet but it works. We might have to play with it more to know if it has volume settings. The video picture of it can get pixelated but it clears up so it's not a big deal. I like how it turns to the ceiling to know that it's off.
4,This little camera does pretty well but if you want to mount it sideways or upside down and wish to use any type of inversion look very hard I finally figured it out but it still didn't help with sideways mounting only upside down and rightsize up. The package this comes in isn't bad tho and it does the job for a fee but the fee isn't too bad so you might want to give em a try they're cheaper than the name brands and work just as good!
5,This was super easy to set up the cost was low the quality for the money is on point! I'm looking into getting some for my house. I bought this for my office. The night vision is awesome I can talk through my phone to anyone I see in my office I can see the wallart that's on the wall when the light is off!  It's just fantastic I highly recommend!
4,I have purchased the camera for kitten purposes and it did it’s job. The only thing I hate is when it goes offline and you have to manually reset it which is super easy but sucks if you’re not home.I did not use it with any memory card I only used it live.
4,Great camera. Easy install. I thought it would be an easy setup but there were few instructions given. The cameras randomly turned on; which felt a lot like being spied upon. Online support was of no help. So I played around with the settings until I found the schedule option. It remains to be seen if the camera will follow and maintain the schedule. I can’t get it to stop alerts when home yet. So that’s why it gets 4 maybe 3 stars.
4,Dice q la calidad de la imagen es de 1080p pero no es buena.
4,This camera is good for what you pay for. I mainly use it as a baby monitor in the play room and it does the job. Picture quality is good however the app can take a minute or two to load which can be annoying. And the camera doesn't tilt down because of the design
5,It serves its purpose well.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Works great with the YI home software has a really good picture… but the tracking is slow and people can walk by the camera and it doesn’t move to track them easily quickly if at all… also after owning it for a few weeks the motor is starting to make weird noises like it needs oil (a faint screech) and it’s only gotten louder… 😥
5,I wanted to purchase a camera and system in order to remotely view my car parked in front of my offices.  Remote viewing was essential and ability to record and motion detection were pluses.  I had contacted a CCTV company with strong internet presence and received an estimate of approximately $1000 with five (5) hours of installation time.  No thank you.  My computer programmer suggested the YI with a card since his company was using it satisfactorily.  I purchased the camera and card from Amazon and same arrived promptly.  It took me all of about five (5) minutes to successfully install it and another ten (10) minutes for a learning curve.  The total cost was under $50.  It operates flawlessly with my Ipad and IPhone and I can even adjust it remotely.  It has motion detection with immediate notice to me ability to record and view remotely and spectacular night vision.  I know that it has other features that I do not even need.  This product is so good that it actually is scary.  It is absolutely the best!
5,I've had 3 Yi cameras for about 3 years and I find their products to be excellent. When I received the Dom Guard camera I had it working in less than 5 minutes. Like All Yi cameras it works perfectly and crystal clear pictures. I highly recommend Yi
5,Provides the quality of picture needed at a fair price.
5,love it
4,Not working anymore or connecting
5,Easy to set up and use. Cloud advertising is too much
4,The camera itself is good as expected the app is not. I use the sd card and every time I want to look back to the recordings it forced me to ‘try’ its cloud function! Even if I have refused tens of times! That’s really alloying!!!
3,Ordered this camera to keep an eye on our dogs while we are gone. The motion detection works great and the picture is pretty good.  However the option to speak through your phone to the camera doesn't work that well.  Maybe we were too far away but I tried speaking through it and it was very delayed and muffled.  Couldn't really make out what I was saying.  It did allow us to watch our dogs and it alerted us when movement was detected.  It may even be a little too sensitive as it notified me every time a car drove down the street outside.  All in all for the price it's a pretty good little camera.
5,I've purchased several Chinese made cameras over the past few years. This one is the best. Great picture quality user-friendly easy set-up & robust functionality at a great price!
3,I ordered this camera on 7/21/22 and it was delivered on 7/23/22. The camera was working perfectly until after the update on 9/5/22. There is now a black spot that I can't seem to get rid of in every video and picture. I bought this camera to monitor package delivery so I have the camera pointed toward the window looking outside. The black spot is not on the window pane. I cleaned the camera lens but the black spot remains. How do I get rid of this black spot which now appears in every video? The return window for this product was 8/22/22.UPDATE 9/8/22: I gave the camera a little tap and whatever the black spot was drop out of view. The camera once again has a perfect picture.
5,This camera sees it all...  I couldn't believe that I set this up in about ten minutes...
5,Good
5,Works great as baby and dog monitor
4,I love the camera.. however I would like to turn off the constant rotation so I could get a stationary view…. I get an alert and the only thing I see is the cabinet or the ceiling… not too helpful… Also I wasn’t aware I would have to subscribe for a fee to actually see the video…I does what it’s supposed to as far as letting me know there is movement in the house and overall the live camera footage is clear…. Considering buying a cheaper one that is stationary to add to or replace this camera.
5,Got this to keep an eye on my dog when I leave him alone longer than usual and it works perfectly. It was easy to setup and works great! The controls to move the camera (from app) could probably use an update to make it more "smoother" when trying to turn but overall the camera works great. Happy customer here.
5,Para mi habitación  puedo ver mismascotas
5,Love this camera I talk to my dog through it a lot. It’s a great camera good quality and has great pictures and video review. Would recommend to anyone
5,This is my second camera I bought. I bought one a year or so ago and it works amazing. I needed another one so I bought this one in white. It blends into the wall so much better.It’s easy to set up customer service is 24/7 and fast at responding usually. You can have multiple people have access to it have passwords on certain cameras use Face ID to identify too. I have a membership (basic) where I can have 4 cameras involved.Wifi needs to be pretty strong for it to work awesome but even if it’s not the best wifi network it still works.I mostly use this to spy on my dog. You can talk through it too. 12/10 would even use this as a baby monitor.
4,This was a nice camera however I didn't like that it was constantly moving and it didn't return to where I needed it to be stationary so I sent it back and bought a different camera .
5,Great voice communication
2,It looks like an adorable little robot. But this camera has got problems that I didn't experience with its predecessors.I have several Yi cameras.  Although this is pretty inexpensive PTZ I found that:1) the pan and tilt is pretty noisy and noticeable thereby limiting the covertness of the camera.  My older Yi cameras are very quiet and I can barely notice the pan and tilt motions.2) the night vision center is not sensitive enough.  I have the camera set up across the room from a 60 watt light bulb. It's not intended to be terribly bright but it is bright enough for anybody to see clearly. However in this brightness the night vision of the camera switches on.  When I first looked through it I thought it wasn't working. But I found that you really had to point it at something very bright in order for the night vision to turn off.  I had an older camera in the same location and it didn't have this problem.YI also seems to have diminished its capabilities for non-cloud-based set up.  I personally have never used the cloud-based setup but it seems I cannot view anything beyond like 30 seconds of recorded activity and I cannot download anything longer than 30 seconds.  Either that or they don't make it intuitive.  This is a rather serious problem.  I know that the video does get recorded for longer than 30 minutes because you can go to the timeline view to see it.
4,I was going out of town and left my cats to my dads care. I wanted to be able to keep an eye on them while I was away so I could monitor their food and water so I could tell my dad when to check on them. It did the job. Not a fan of the app as much. The plans available for having storage are a bit much and I feel like it’s a little pushy with the hard sell of it. But if you just want to be able to check in real time not a bad little camera. I’ll probably move it so I can use it as a puppy cam to check on my dog while I’m at work.
3,This camera is okay. The picture is pretty good & it catches motion most of the time! The only thing I’m not happy with is the night vision pictures all look like they have a haze over them!! I have 4 more of the YI cameras (different style) & the night vision on them is fine except the living room one is foggy on occasion. I also don’t like the way this one attaches. I had a previous one (not a YI) on the wall but this one looks like it only attaches to the ceiling. I have 1 more week to decide if I want to keep it or not!!!
5,It’s perfect picture and the app is good
4,afsw
5,Originally had my YI stop working just past the time I could return it to Amazon….. YI stepped up and honored their year warranty and replaced it ….. I will stay with YI for my video security needs …..I like and trust themwas/am really sold on YI cams have 4 they have been going for years. But this one died 3 weeks after I could return it so it’s my loss I guess. Tried to contact YI but no answers ….. want to stay with them but this one leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Had several of my friends go with YI …. I hope they didn’t have these troubles
3,I had my first camera running for about 2.5 years before I had to replace it it seems like I got lucky with that. About 6 months after I got the replacement it suddenly started disconnecting from my internet on its own. If I was out of the house and wanted to check on the camera I was out of luck as none of the settings within the app would help. The only thing that would work is if I was physically next to the camera to unplug it and plug it back in. Well last night that fix stopped working as well. I even tried reconfiguring the camera but it kept telling me “WiFi password error” and I promise you there wasn’t. I retyped it about 5 times and also tried using auto fill. It wasn’t the password it was the camera. It also was located not just in the same room as my router but within 2 feet of it so I know that wasn’t the problem either. After reading these other reviews I guess I should feel lucky to have had it work for that long.
5,I’ve got two and very happy with my purchase. Very affordable good quality and no need for purchasing expensive ones and pay for the subscriptions. Highly recommend;) Thx !
5,Para mi es excelente. Me ha funcionado muy bien para mi necesidad.
