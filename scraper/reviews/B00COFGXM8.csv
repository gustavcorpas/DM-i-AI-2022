5,I have ruined at least 2 previous Canon printers by using knock-off cheap ink supplier's products.  I've learned my lesson the hard way.  You can not afford to send your printer off to get repaired the cost of the repair and shipping charges back to you.  Not to mention the down time in not having a working printer to use.  I consider the Canon ink to be quite expensive but I bite the bullet and now only purchase the Canon ink cartridges and so far have never had any printer ink related problems in 6 years.
5,No one uses all the colors at the same rate.  Single colors must be available to even the usage rate differences. You will always run out of one color sooner than another.
5,We like to have the XL refills so we donâ€™t run out as often and from experience your printer will last longer and fewer problems using the brand name ink for your printer
5,I did a little research using adjusted cost per page when the products were bought at Amazon and the bottom line is it is cheaper to purchase individual XL tanks for the 4 color tanks than it is to purchase a 4 pack of the regular ink tanks despite the seemingly great looking price of the 4 pack.You can basically stop here. From this point on I go into detail including some math as to how I arrived at this conclusion. If you are interested in the background please feel free to read on.At the time I wrote this I saw on Amazon that they are selling packs 4 regular ink tanks one of each color (Y C M BK) for $37.94 which is about $9.485 (bear with my fractional cents here there's a purpose) making it cheaper per ink tank than Canon's list price of an individual regular ink tank of $11.99. So it got me thinking is the XL really cheaper than the regular-sized ink cartridge 4 packs? Canon's list for the XL tanks are $17.99 and Amazon cells the same XL ink tanks for $16.99 some XL color ink tanks on Amazon at the time I wrote this are even cheaper at $15.06 per cartridge. I did the math at the more costly $16.99 to show there is a savings at this price meaning there will be more of a savings for the XL color cartridges that cost $15.06.Let me explain with math:I found a web site review of the MX922 that actually broke down the retail ink tank cost to a per page price. At Canon retail prices the regular-sized ink tanks cost $0.166/page (16.6 cents/page) and the XL at retail cost $0.128/page (12.8 cents/page). Now that gives me a baseline to which I can figure out the cost per page of Amazon's price on an individual tank in the 4pack vs. an individual price of an XL tank on Amazon.The math goes along these lines:Cost of the regular tanks in the 4 pack when bought on Amazon is: $0.136 per page  a.k.a. 13.6 cents per page compared to Canon's retail on the regular tanks of $0.166 (16.6 cents/page).  [If you want the math here it is:  (($0.166) x ($9.485)) / $11.99 = $0.136]Cost of the XL tanks per page when bought on Amazon is: $0.121  a.k.a. 12.1 cents per page (rounded up the last digit) compared to Canon's retail on the XL tanks of $0.128 (12.8 cents/page)  [If you want the math here it is:  (($0.128) x ($16.99)) / $17.99 = $0.121]Summary:Canon regular tanks bought in the 4 pack at Amazon costs 13.6 cents per pageCanon XL tanks bought at Amazon costs 12.1 cents per page (even less for the XL tanks that cost $15.06)Bottom line:Despite the great price break of the 4 pack it is still cheaper per page to buy the individual XL tanks.The baseline prices of retail Canon ink tanks were done in a review of the MX922 printer and the review included the printer's ink usage cost for the different size tanks. The review was conducted by a third party meaning their website is outside of amazon.com (and canon.com for that matter). Amazon rules say I cannot provide a link to the external web page that reviewed the product and it's per page price testing. All I can say is those really are the results of the research and I did this cost break down in this review because I am in need of purchasing all ink cartridges and am now going to be buying all individual XL ink tanks as a result of my research into the Amazon cost per page breakdown. I thought I'd share what I figured out in cost savings since this stuff is pricey to begin with. 12.1 cents per page is still pretty pricey (ouch!) but my printer is about out of ink in each of the tanks that came with it. I have to bite the bullet and purchase the XL tanks now (I need to do more grey scale printing to save on buying all the color tanks every time!).Hope this helps!
4,Returned these cartridges along with set for a different printer. Neither set worked with my printers. Went to Staples and purchased two sets that did work.
4,OEM print cartridges have excellent quality but the price of printing on a MX922 printer is getting outrageous.
4,Great printer ink but too expensive.  An ink refill cost more than I paid for the printer.
5,Everything was great. Good quality. Fast shipping.
5,Whenever you purchase ink for an inkjet printer you have to ask yourself a couple of questions. Are you printing on quality photo paper to reproduce high-quality photos you have taken? Or are you printing out memos that were sent out to everyone in the company? Do you need a long-lasting print or is the print something that only needs a "shelf life" of a year?For my inkjet printer at the office I use an inexpensive third-party ink brand for printing up occasional items that I need to distribute at the office. And this approach works fine (also using a Canon printer by the way). But when I am printing photos I took and want A3+ (13"x19") suitable for framing I use only professional Canon printer paper (either matte or one of the glossy types) and there is no substitute for the REAL Canon ink. Yes it IS hideously expensive. But it makes a significant difference in the printing of photos for display on high-quality paper. By doing so you'll get the correct colors smooth operation and a print that will last a number of years before fading sets in. These inks are indeed expensive but there is also no substitute for them: they work great they look great they print the correct colors they have a generally long life before fading and so on. It hurts to recommend them at this price. But then again it's hard NOT to recommend them if you want good prints particularly if you are a semi-professional or enthusiast photographer and the difference is obvious in the final print. Most of the prints that come out from my PIXMA ix6820 using real Canon ink and their high-end matte and premium papers look astonishingly good sometimes revealing sharpness and clarity that I don't even notice on my 4K monitor! So Five Stars. For printing photos this is the way to go.
5,Based on previous experience the brand name provides excellent results. I use mostly in the grayscale+fast mode for text and occasional color or business quality as the need arises. For me XL delivers noticeably at least double what I was getting from the standard size provided I run it close to the ground and not when the first warning displays.  Canon's own statistics show slightly less than double in their yield tests even though about 64% (11ml vs 7ml) of it is equal to the standard size.  What this suggests to me is a lot of ink being "lost" in the mechanisms used for delivering dye to paper.  Whether it be coincidence or not I've found after having to dump two printers this brand name is far more reliable than its imitating cousins.Whether it be premature clogging or the size imperfectly matching the alleged compatibility resulting in physical damage none of this happened as long as I stayed with Canon.  While I like saving money and I do understand that getting an entire set of the name-brand is almost the same price as a new printer nah with the XL sizes it will last twice as long (my experience) the size the printer comes pre-loaded assuming you get a full "standard" size.  So that makes a new printer every other reorder in cost right?  Well that's about how long my printers lasted after using competitors colors.  Now I know there are a lot of happy customers of the lower priced versions out there so obviously YMMV.  Just sayin.
5,Gosh these things are expensive. I hate every time I am required to order a new one. But for printing high-quality photos on Canon paper these Canon inks can't be beaten. Color accuracy operation and the all-important "end result" makes these the item of choice whenever printing a high-quality image. I use mine on a Canon Pixma iX6820 and when I print in high-quality mode on Canon's best glossy or matte 13 x 19" (A3+) papers it still shocks me at just how good the results are. All inkjet prints will fade over time particularly if you have the print in an area where sun or humidity are at play but these genuine Canon inks will stand up over time more than off-brands. So how do I handle the cost? I use third-party inks when printing handouts on plain paper for the office but when printing photos I stay with these Canon inks. In spite of the price their superb consistent performance make them a Five-Star item.Note:Please carefully note that this cartridge is the "XL" version of the 251 Y cartridge. They are both the exact same physical size and can be interchangeably used but this one contains more ink than the standard 251 Y model. I don't know if this actually saves much on a per-page printing cost but it does reduce the frequency with which you have to change cartridges. I prefer the "XL" versions for this reason.
5,I'm finding that my Canon ix6820 produces a much better photo than my Epson XP-830. The Epson is constantly leaving streaks of black ink on the photos because the black cartridges seem to leak. When I want to print photos I have to remove the black cartridges and carefully wipe the silicone ring around the print heads to remove this excess ink. Then I can print photos with no black streaks but the Epson has always put too much ink down on the prints and images containing plaid shirts or similar areas tend to get muddied in the darker areas of the photos  The Canon printer and inks do not do this even when printing the same photo that was printed on the Epson. I hope the new XL cartridges for the Canon last a lot longer than the first set that came with the printer or I'll be looking for a new econo tank printer for cheaper operating costs. I have no complaints at all with the print quality of the Canon just hope I can get economical use out of these new XL cartridges.
5,I have a Canon Pixma MX922 printer.  The printer is a bit old and somewhat slow but does a superb job in printing color photographs and regular documents.  I am loath to use off brand ink refills but prefer to keep this as an "all Canon" operation.
5,Gosh these things are expensive. As I said in another review I hate every time I am required to order a new one.

All inkjet prints will fade over time particularly if you have the print in an area where sun or humidity are at play but these genuine Canon inks will stand up over time more than off-brands.Noteâ€”and this is very importantâ€”that this is the "XL" version of the cartridge. It is the same physical size as the CLI-251 C but contains a higher quantity of ink than the standard cartridge. I try to purchase the "XL" versions whenever I can because of some increased (minor) economy and the fact that the cartridge does not have to be exchanged quite so frequently.So how do I handle the cost? I use third-party inks when printing handouts on plain paper for the office but when printing photos I stay with these Canon inks. In spite of the price their superb consistent performance make them a Five-Star item.
5,Great ink. Print quality is fantastic. Only complaint is that they don't last long enough.
1,I always buy ink replacements as soon as I put a new one in so I don't forget or run out in an emergency with no backup. This tank was purchased several months ago but after I finally ran out of my previous magenta xl two days ago I replaced the old magenta cartridge with this one  (and have printed maybe 3 pages - in black and white no less - since). And yet I am now being alerted once again just two days after replacing it -  that the magenta ink has again run out completely!? This has never happened to me with canon inks I've ordered on Amazon before and I'm usually very satisfied with the quality and longevity of these products. However this time I am really frustrated and upset I can't get my money back for this one since I ordered it a while ago. I paid for what was an "xl" cartridge with apparently little to no ink inside. The empty cartridge indicator/warning did go off for 2 days so it's not anything related to the sensor. Instead I believe I was sent a tank that had just enough to make the warning light go off temporarily and since I've not printed anything in color in the last two days (and maybe 3 pages total in black and white) this is an outrageous rip off. I do recall feeling that the empty tank and new one were quite similar in weight which was strange as I usually notice a difference but I didn't think too much about it until today. I ordered another magenta cartridge to be delivered tomorrow but I'm now concerned about whether I'm actually receiving genuine Canon ink tanks from Amazon anymore. I have several other XL ink colors I have ordered from Amazon since this one but not yet used and I worry I won't know if they work or are empty vessels until I run out and replace each color. This is deeply concerning and a potentially very expensive scam. I would like someone to reach out to me to address the and refund the cost of this product as I paid for an extra large vessel of ink yet there is no ink inside this tank.
5,For the quality of the printed image these are great.  Just wish that ones from Canon (the only source that I go with) were a bit cheaper.
4,This is a good  "value pack" depending on the price you pay for it.  I treat my canon printers to canon ink just because I am silly enough to believe that canon ink is better for the printer than the knock off inks.  I am currently running a little comparison...  I have a second printer that I am feeding only the knock off inks and I want to see how they compare.  But for my photo printing needs I rely on the canon ink and right now the MG6300 printer.  These inks really do produce stunning results they never seem to clog.Here's what I don't understand....  why don't they sell a 251xl FOUR pack.  My printer also uses a gray ink tank.  It would be very convenient to have that as well.  Perhaps the reason is because some of the folks who use this ink only use three tanks?Anyway the key to purchasing the value pack is to make sure the price is a value on the day you are purchasing.  Like the stock market ink prices go up and down. Some times it is more of a value to purchase the inks separately.BOTTOM LINE:  Great ink.  You can't go wrong with this.  Just make sure its for sale at a good price on the day you are buying it.
3,Okay let me break down my star rating here so it makes sense.... this ink is fabulous and as inks go it is a 5 star product. So why only three stars? Two reasons really.... the first and most important is that I just really don't think it lives up to its XL status. There just does not seem to be all that much ink in these tanks to merit such a label. I go through them like they're water. While it is true that I have been known to print many 8.5x11 photos I still think that something labeled XL should last more than 30 or 40 prints. These often don't. The second is that each tank is a bit ridiculous in its pricing. I mean seriously. At the prices they charge for ink Canon should be throwing in the printers for free. Its pretty insane.I understand why so many people go for the cheap 3rd party inks. Believe me I've been tempted. I have a hundred dollar month ink habit. Totally ludicrous.One other important point about this ink.... I've been using these particular inks for a couple of years now and I've already described that I do a great deal of printing and have probably gone through 30 magenta tanks at this point. I have NEVER had one clog on me. This is impressive. Not that ink tanks should clog but many of them do. Not these.So there you have it.... Great ink but not so very cost effective and you don't get all that much.  And the prices keep climbing.  Is there some sort of ink shortage someone forgot to tell me about?BOTTOM LINE: I highly recommend this ink but I understand the need to look for less expensive ink. I will stick with canon ink but it gnaws at me that this one ink tank is 20% of the cost of the printer. Honestly I would love to give it 3 stars because of the cost factor but the ink is just so good I can't bring myself to do it.
5,Right product for a good price
