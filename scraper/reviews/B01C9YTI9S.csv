5,This adapter works great for what I needed it for which was to broadcast my computer screen on a tv without wires. If you're worried about the bad reviews of people saying they can't connect or update it here's the thing:This product does NOT work on Windows 11 right out of the box. This version of the Microsoft Display Adapter was first introduced in 2014. Windows 11 was introduced in 2021. Some of you may luckily get an adapter that has been updated before it was packaged so a few of you might luckily get one that does work well with Windows 11 right out of the box but that's extremely rare. You MUST first connect and update this in a Windows 10 device. Only once you do that update will you be able to use this with Windows 11 devices. The newer 4k version of this adapter is the one that works with Windows 11 right out of the box.
5,I have a HP all in one desktop with an external 32" monitor connected via a HDMI cable. Wanted to add another monitor but no free physical display port. This product allows me to add a 3rd monitor via wireless. At first I was disappointed as the mouse was slow but found if I changed the setting from gaming to work on the adapter and that fixed the problem.  I had tried a device that said it could do another monitor via USB-C to HDMI adapter but it didn't work on my PC.  This solved my problem.  Would recommend. Only thing I wish was the USB cable on the device was a longer but no big deal.
5,This can't get much easier using windows 10 just click on notification bottom right navigate to connect find the labeled wireless display adapter that's  hooked up to the big screen tv and BAM your in business.This device makes life easier instead of seeking longer hdmi cables or standing next to the tv when showing something to friends family or even at work.  Well worth the price buy this now to alleviate connection headaches.
5,Plug it into the HDMI port of TV plug in the USB end to a USB port on the TV(for power).  For Windows10 search 'connect to wireless display' or if using a laptop it most likely has a function key that looks like a monitor for choosing projectors or secondary displays.  Either way there is a 'connect to wireless display' button hit that and wait a few seconds and you'll see your TV show up on the list.  Click on it and another few seconds you'll have a 2nd display that can be used as a clone an extension or as the sole display.I've had no issues with lag drop out audio glitches or anything else negative.  Just a smooth extended monitor.  I have not tested range however as I use mine within 10-15feet of the receiver.
5,I use this for sewing projecting patterns for cutting. Leave it right in the projector and can transmit from with my laptop or desktop.  No wires. This thing is great.
5,I would highly recommend this product for hooking up a flat-screen TV that has HDMI ports to your Windows computer . I use it with my Surface Pro 4 (i7 Processor 16gb RAM & 256gb SSD) under Windows 10 Pro.  Nice out of box experience.  In fact before I got the Wireless Display Adapter V2 my Surface Pro docking station was not able to use more than 2 speakers connected to my Receiver (which has 5 speakers) through the HDMI physical cable).  While my MacBook Pro running Windows 10 Pro was able to use all 5 speakers for TV sound through the HDMI cable.  Even Microsoft's easily accessible phone support was not able to help me utilize all 5 speakers before I got the Wireless Adapter.  But once I got the Wireless Adapter the 3 other speakers (including the woofer) started working like magic!  I installed the Windows 10 1803 update two days ago and I was worried because it seemed like it was taking too long for the flat-screen TV to connect.  I immediately called Microsoft Tech Support (almost no wait time) and the TV started working about one minute before I got hold of the Tech Support Rep. With my approval the Tech Rep took a look -remotely-and it looked fine.  The Tech Rep noticed a problem with one of my docking station's USB ports in Device Manager (a problem unrelated to this Wireless Display Adapter) and after about one minute and a reboot the  USB problem was fixed.  I would highly recommend this product and thank Microsoft for their excellent and easily accessible Tech Support!
5,I got 5 of these for all the TV's in our offices and they work like a charm.
4,I connected the adapter to my laptop and got friezes in use.How I fixed freezes:1. DURING THE CONNECTION to adapter I opened the network settings (Control Panel \ All Control Panel Items \ Network Connections)2. Found a WiFi connection to the adapter and click on Properties.3. You need to leave only "Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP / IPv4)" and to release all other checkboxes.4. Click "Games" or "Working" at the top of the screen as in the my screenshot.Hope this help someone.
5,After reading some users poor reviews I came upon a positive review of this which had an almost identical use case. I am 15 feet away from the TV I am projecting to from an Android 9/Samsung Galaxy A10. I do not have WiFi. Streaming both Amazon Prime Video HBO and Netflix using mobile data I have no issues whatsoever in lag watching all movies and series on the big screen right out of the box. Setup and configuration could not have been simpler. It worked the first time and continues to work flawlessly. I just got this a few days ago and have already logged 15 hrs of casting without issue using the aforementioned configuration. Very happy.
5,Screen mirroring tools from Android mobile devices run a pretty big gamut but if you're looking for an easy to use reliable device with a quality picture there's not really anywhere else to go but here. Excellent full screen projection high quality reciever and a vivid colorful display. The Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter is exactly what I needed when I wanted to cast my screen. I will be thinking twice about getting any other product in the future.
5,Todo correcto sin novedad
3,I bought the first version a couple years ago and ended up returning it.  It was far too laggy and the audio/picture would not sync properly.  I would always have to pause and unpause so it would re-sync.  While this one is better it still suffers from the same issues.  Just not as much.Setting the picture quality in certain apps to 720p HD on my Galaxy S9 it pretty much works flawlessly while watching media.  Netlfix Hulu YouTube TV DisneyPlus all work really well.  Unfortunately setting the quality to Full HD (1080p) it starts to have problems like the first version.I'm hoping the 4K version is somehow better than these.
5,It just works. Painless and works without hassles. If you have problems with this it would be because you did not read the instructions.
5,I will be ordering more
5,I purchased a lesser brand a few months ago which worked at first but deteriorated - my puter eventually wouldn't stay connected.  Hoping that it was the product I purchased this Microsoft product (previously purchased for my father with no issues connecting to his tablet or laptop).  Problem solved.  It's been over a month and we use it almost every day for streaming (mostly movies).  Still great performance (as II expected).
4,Connecting to it with a phone or laptop was really easy. The sound quality was good too no lag. But the video would stutter here and there but I felt like it got better the longer I used it. Works well for watching videos or just to have something in the background but if you want great picture quality and consistent streaming then use a cable.
5,Simple and full featured using the windows app you can adjust certain settings. Carry one in travel bag for meetings and such. Wish the little plastic piece that hold the HDMI and USB plug together came with a bungie or string. otherwise I would give it 5 star instead of 4.
5,WIRELESS DEEEEEEEEEEXXXXXXX!!!! HAHAAAA!!!! so the Samsung adapter is twice the price and although it's a stable wired connection this microsoft adapter has minimal lag and allows me to freely operate my phone unencumbered by bulky hdmi cords and power supplies while still casting dex to the monitor. chef's kiss 🤌
5,Prior to this device I had purchased a similar one just different brand that claimed it had 4k support and all these neat features. However it was to good to be true type deal. Because of that it had led me to this wonderful product that happens to what I need and does it well. I strongly recommend this product if you are a Windows users. It does work with Android as well however it does not work with Apple.
2,I had the earlier version of this for a couple years without much issue. When it stopped working I bought this one. This one lasted a month! The picture went digital and froze. I turned it off/back on again and now it wont' even pair to the laptop I was using. I'll try again with another one (because it's nice when it works) hoping this was just a lemon...but I don't have much faith in it right now. Such a pain...
5,Exceptional and very easy to use.
5,I use this Monitor Mirror adapter to wirelessly connect my Laptop to to my TV.  It was very easy to install.  I did go on line for help in setting-up my Laptop to connect to the adapter.  I am pleased with its performance.
5,This is exactly what I was looking for to replace my 25ft HDMI cable that I've been using to plug in my laptops into my wall mount TV. Easy to setup and has a reliable connection. Thankful that Windows 10 has the Project to Wireless Display function baked right in.
5,I LOVE this product. It is so nice to be able to use the projector in my classroom from my desk and it doesn't require wifi like a chromecast would. Amazing :)
5,Wow this works with both my windows computer and my Android. I use the adapter send my Zoom meetings to a projector so I can have a 200 inch screen. No cables seamless functionality and best of all the audio is in sync with the video. Great Microsoft product
5,I work on two displays and hate the bulkiness of connecting my laptop to my second display via HDMI. This perfectly solved my problem and works great
3,It’s okay...  I was expecting more stability from a product that’s designed to work with Windows but have been frustrated with it’s lack of stability.  It’s a pain to connect and frequently disconnects while in use.  I’ve spent hours troubleshooting and it’s just easier to plug in an HDMI cable at this point.  I won’t buy another one that’s for sure.  It works but don’t expect a ot from it other than frustration.
3,I purchased this device so I can cast from my Windows 10 work laptop to a wireless screen. I cannot get it to work on my work laptop. It works fine on my personal Surface Pro with great picture/video quality. The only thing I can think of is there is some IT setting that is preventing the casting but I can find nothing to help with the issue.
5,Works excellent. If the user isn't computer proficient setting up the computer to work with this component could be difficult.
5,I need to do presentations on a Windows computer and this is terrific and reliable.  It's completely easy to setup. I have used it on a TV (to test it) and a projector in a large conference room. The signal is good - I've never lost a signal and have used it in a huge conference room for several hours.
3,Couldn't get it to work for the AMD PC I bought it for. So I did some research. Turns out if you don't have the on board intel graphics it won't support the adapter. Used it on my Intel cpu laptop and it works fine
4,Works really well but there needs to be more documentation on the security features for those of us who need to know the specifics. It is not designed for high end gaming or anything latency sensitive. Use it for presentations or throwing content to a flat screen TV at a friends house.
3,Have bought 4 of these for shared tv’s around my office. 1 has already died before 6 months. The others work ok. Have had issues with sporadic freezes. There are other options that will serve the same purpose although most others require 3rd party software.
1,Doesn't work I can wireless display connect to my Roku box but not this Microsoft Product. Also no way to check the firmware unless it is connected but I can't  connect so pretty useless instructions. Don't bother
1,I bought them because the description said that it would make a monitor with a Display Port work with a computer with an HDMI port. It didn’t. They wouldn’t accept my return.
5,Thank you for your fast shipment.  This adapter made a big difference with me working on my Surface from home.
5,Works Flawlessly with Windows 10 ; Some  Win7 users were OK but it was more of a struggle and Apple (ipads)? Fuhgetit! no way.. (Workaround) We were able to do a Skype meeting with an iPad and then the Win10 machine could present and show the connected/shared screen.Simple and Simple.. no other word to describe it. Simple.
5,Surprisingly good! It’s actually possible to watch movies on it! Works so well. If you’re playing a movie it might start out a little laggy but it seems to sort itself out. Fantastic for PowerPoint or images but not too bad for videos - however for normal use you’ll still need an HDMI cable.
5,Very simple to setup and get working.  There were a few artifacts at the beginning of YouTube videos but it quickly caught up and had no further issue.
1,This adapter does not connect for me.  The adapter show it's ready to be connected but my lap top does not see it.  After spending several hours without success.  I exchanged the item with the new one.  The second new adapter has the same identical on my laptop.  I tried on my second computer it recognize the adapter but could not connect.  I tried with both adapters and with all 3 TV's and I could not connect.  I have asked my IT department for help without success.  As an Engineer with over 40 years of experience in Problem Solving I could not get it work.  Save yourself the BIG trouble by not buying this adapter.  I feel bad buy returning both adapters as AMAZON was so wonderful in making the return process so customer friendly.
5,Great display adapter in my opinion I tried action tech version runs hot  no longer supported  . Microsoft product easier to install and displays on you TV or monitor with HDMI input clearly
5,You want to take your Samsung and watch anything off your phones data without needing wifi at all this thing is what you need. Works great on my phone and has beautiful quality. Couldn't be more pleased and wish I knew about this years ago.
5,Works perfect
5,Perfect for conference room computer presentations without having to stretch a HDMI cable from flat screen to computer.Our church has multiple users.Multiple wireless display adapters procured.Computer users that do not have Multiple wireless display adapter can automatically connect to others.
5,Item as described. Thanks !
1,To start I find myself to be a reasonably technologically savvy individual. Definitely not a pro but can progress through most difficulties either on my own or with a little help from Google. Maybe I just received a lemon but this wireless display adapter is shoddy at best. After hours of slow painful progression I was able to get it to connect to my Windows Surface 7 and a desktop PC however the connection could never be maintained for more than a few minutes on either device with a max distance of 5-7 feet. I did download the Wireless Display app and even updated the firmware to no avail. After 3 hours of frustration and continued poor performance from the Wireless Display adapter I will be returning it to Amazon.
5,Miracast is working exactly as I wanted. It is being used for business presentations. Will probably get another for home.
5,Other than movies or pictures off your computer you could also do Skype off of it and a whole lot of things you want to see from your computer to your TV love this product
4,This product works fine and easy to deploy. It is plug and play.
5,using this at work for a overhead projector that we use during training much easer than plugging in every different computer for the instructor
5,Perfect
1,The Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter does not work with all PC wireless Wi-Fi adapters.  I have two laptop PCs and this wireless display adapter worked fine with one PC but not with the other PC.  I finally figured out this wireless display adapter was not compatible with one of my PC's wireless Wi-Fi adapters in this case a Realtek RTL8723BE wireless adapter.  In searching the Internet I saw some people had success in substituting the driver for the Realtek adapter that came with the PC with a driver downloaded directly from Realtek support.  I tried this with mixed success.  The upsetting part about this situation is that Microsoft Support does not reveal this compatibility problem to their customers.  My advice is NOT to buy this product until you have ascertained it will work with your particular PC.
5,Say goodbye to your HDMI from your PC to projector. Works great. Easier set up for meetings now
5,Quick delivery and works as advertised.
5,Second unit and works great.  Only downside is windows only.  A mac and linux driver would be nice.  Video is smooth and no ghosting
3,It seemed normal. Maybe it needed to set itself. Overall the product receives an Okay from me.
5,I wanted to project my computer videos on the TV. It works well.
5,It works great do to me working out of town
5,Very easy to setup and works great with laptop to projector and TV.
5,Very pleased
5,Mirrors my phone.  Excellent video display.
5,Exelente invercion y evitas tener cables molestosos
5,I absolutely love this. Can quickly/easily share a screen to all our Samsung flat screens.
5,Awesome product! So simple to use.
5,This is the best Microsoft display adapter yet. Video quality is great and I have not noticed any significant lag.
1,The adapter works though the wireless adaptor built into the Xbox One works a bit better. The reason this product gets a 1-star is because of the seller. The item is listed new on the website but it came used. The box seals were broken and the item itself shows clear signs of wear. Rest of the items in the box also show signs of wear. Please do not buy from this seller.
1,This is my 2nd purchase. The 1st one stopped working after a couple of days. I thought it might be defective so returned and tried it again. the 2nd one worked a couple of days and now does not work. It's not worth the money Very disappointed.
3,It’s slow videocast
5,Easy to set up. Works very well with my big screen TV
5,Works well from laptop not from iPhone or iPad though.
5,Awesome product
1,Won't wirelessly connect with laptop thus firmware can't be updated either.
5,Great product to use with a MS Surface Pro
5,Great addition to the Surface to share presentations or photos on a TV.
2,low quality  with lag not worth itbut something else HD
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Unfortunately very low quality.And the resolution is not good enough and can not be changed comfortably.
1,The only troubleshooting method I found would work is to uninstall the display driver and restart. However it would not remember the new connection and would have to repeat the uninstall process each time to connect. Waiting on a replacement and will update in the event the new device works differently.
1,Generally a very poor product.  It disconnects every 20 minutes or so randomly and you cannot reconnect it unless you restart your computer (have tried this several times).  The initial connection process is tedious as well having to pull up several toolbars every time you use it - there is no "auto-connect" feature.  The adapter takes forever to boot up as well.Overall strongly do not recommend this product - biggest waste of money I've ever had on Amazon.
1,I bought this about 3 times. Each time trying to convince myself this one will work. I don’t like the Hdmi it looks awful. But this is the third time and I’m done. It keeps on freezing my computer is not even 10 feet away from the tv. When it worked it was amazing when it didn’t it was horrible. Returning for the third time and will never buy again maybe I can find some alternative.
5,Inexpensive does what I need them to do !
1,I spent 4 hours downloading Windows updates and adapter updates and uninstalling/reinstalling devices and drivers fo;;owing the multi-page troubleshooting guide only to have this device connect for 5 minutes or less before I had to manually reconnect. I have a degree in IT and 38 years of experience and as an IT professional I want to warn everyone that this thing is junk.  No customer should have to go through what I have experienced to get VERSION 2 of a product to work in the year 2018.
2,One adapter works flawlessly but the other seems flakey.  It will jump and pop around.
2,It is too short
5,Good product n services.
5,Works perfectly and is consistently connected with no noticeable latencies.
5,Better than expect. Easy to use.
5,Wonderful Product
5,Excelente
1,The unit  became an VERY HOT...I  was afraid to keep it connected to the tv.  Hopefully the replacement  will not have the same problem! !
1,Interface is clunky you have to constantly turn it back on from falling asleep. very poor product should not have been released until it was ready.
1,Junk
1,I was unable to use this to connect my Lenova Yoga laptop t the television. No good.
1,This didn’t last 90 days - it’s cheaply made
1,NOT for movies or gaming. Can't handle enough data for movies or games. Ok for pictures. Thats about it.
1,Expected it to work as "wireless HDMI adapter" unfortunately it work with terrible lags and artifacts.
1,Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.  No rhyme or reason why.
5,I take this along with me on travel and it works great with both my personal device and work pc.  I generally use it to watch movies on the hotel TV's. Keeps my from carrying an hdmi cable and my personal device doesn't even have an hdmi port on it.I have also used it in a pinch to throw up a presentation. Because it transmits directly between the Adapter and the PC it doesn't matter what else the visiting site has going on for network.There is an app to update the firmware in the Microsoft Store.  I'm not sure about the reviews that say it doesn't work because I have used it with quite a few devices and mostly to watch video without issue.  As long as the PC is on Windows 10 and has a newer wifi chip or an Android phone it should work quite well for videos or presentations.
2,This second version of the Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter had a great potential to allow you to connect your TV or projector to your PC acting as a second screen. The device does allow you to do that when it works.Unfortunately the device tends to disconnect quite often especially when streaming content such as video or games. When disconnected the device does not automatically restore the connection again but requires you to once again establish your wireless connection to the adapter.If you only intend to use this device for projecting power point presentations or other mostly static content this device works just fine. For transmitting video or game content I cannot recommend this product as it doesn't work most of the time.I initially bought this device in order to display mirrored VR content on my television instead of on my computer monitor in order to allow guests to see what the VR player was seeing. Unfortunately this is one of the cases that transmits too much data for the device to handle and it will disconnect very soon after trying to stream the video data.
5,I have read a few reviews on here that the units disconnect poor video quality etc.  I used to think that too until I recently purchased a new computer.  These receivers are awesome when your computer can handle it.  I have purchased a second one for another room and am more than satisfied.
1,It might work for you and it might not.  There is no way of knowing until you try it and Microsoft will not be able to help you if it doesn't work.  Even if by happy accident your machine is one it works on at first do not think that means it will always work.  Mine just works intermittently.  Sometimes it will connect and sometimes not.  When it does connect it never makes it through a full movie before it decides it needs a break.Even when it works as designed for a short length of time the specs are very poor so you get lags in your streaming and there are serious resolution and frame rate limitations.  It runs very hot and is very expensive for what it is.  You are far better off to get a Firestick or one of the other options made by companies who do not loathe their customers.  They are cheaper offer more features and work much more reliably than Microsoft's product.It really is insulting that this thing is still on the market.  It has been buggy since the day it was released and Microsoft knows a substantial portion of the machines out there will simply not work with it.  I think they feel like they have to have some sort of "solution" to keep up with the competition --- whether it works or not.
1,The real product is great. This is a price gouged pile of garbage.You can literally buy this for 1/5 the price from A LEGITIMATE source.
5,Worked like a champ. Even hooked one up to a dual display setup for a classroom.
2,I bought this to mirror videos on my Galaxy S7 to my TV.  S7usually connects with only a short delay but audio and video are terribly out of synch on flat screen TV.  5-year old Apple TV plays videos perfectly but requires WiFi.
5,Works exactly as it should.
5,this product was exactly as described and did the job for us.
5,great to use if you don't want cables.
5,Do you find yourself trying to share content with your co-workers or friends now that COVID restrictions are losening up? This is a great tool for windows users.
5,Easy to use and very convenient for watching movies. Nice to not have to plug and unplug HDMI cables into my laptop every time I want to watch a movie or take my laptop somewhere.
5,Use this in my business to duplicate computer screens on TVs for meetings. It's the easiest thing in the world to do. Works like a champ and essentially does what "air play" will do on an Apple for a PC. I used to carry a portable monitor with me but have replaced with this device.
5,This is the easiest and best way to project an image from a PC to a monitor. Forget chrome casting and other stuff. If you can't be wired this is the next best thing.
5,Every thing is fine but it gets hot if using it to display so many windows content like powerpoint and youtube and etc.
5,It was what I had been looking for so I could watch movies and videos on my tv
2,This device works . . . if you fiddle with it . . . regularly.Two problems:1. Sometimes the image freezes and you have to disconnect and reconnect the device.2. For some reason often the mouse pointer isn't really where it appears on the screen so you think you click on a button and it doesn’t work because in fact your click registers dozens of pixels to the side. You have to change the definition of your screen on your computer then change it back to correct the problem.It was a gift to a friend who’s not computer savvy and several times I had to troubleshoot for her. In this end it proved to be so much hassle each time she gave up and returned to watching Netflix on her laptop.A big waste of money.
1,Intermittent disconnection issues. 2nd Screen/Monitor Freezes. Really disappointing. Will return. Horrible device. Replaced with an HDMI cable cheaper and more stable connection now.
5,Work great with computer using windows no lagging or delay when typing or moving the mouse. Does not work with old android phone check before buying.
5,works flawlessly with Windows PCs. No other wifi connection needed your computer will directly connect.A much easier solution than cables or ChromeCast.
5,Used on our boat. Works great.
5,Works perfect
5,Love it. Office is now wireless.
4,No funciona en todos los ordenadores y demora a conectar-se es necessario varios reboots de la TV e do ordenador. Pero quando funciona sin problema:
4,Stuck @ max 30hrtz 1080p. It's definitely better than the original but it's still limited for media/gaming.
5,It works very well no connection drop outs very smooth latency probably the best Display adapter on the market right now
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Update : Finalement j'ai réussi à faire fonctionner l'appareil. Un ami est venu chez moi avec son ordinateur portable et il a réussi a connecter son pc sur l'appareil. Je lui ai demander de mettre à jour l'appareil et depuis plus aucun problème j'arrive à me connecter.J'ai augmenté ma note car le produit fonctionne mais ce serait bien que le produit soit directement mis à jour sur une version plus récente car ça peut poser problème pour s'y connecter et tout le monde n'a peut être pas la possibilité de tester l'appareil sur une multitude d'appareil. Surtout que personnellement avant que mon ami n'arrive a s'y connecter j'avais fais le test avec une machine sous Windows 11 et une sous le 10Post original :Impossible de me connecter sur l’appareil et donc d’afficher mon écran sur ma TV.Je n’ai pas réussi à me connecter une seule fois et pourtant j’ai essayé sur différentes TV ainsi qu’avec un autre ordinateur. J’ai essayé les étapes recommandées par le constructeur ainsi que d’autres trouvée sur internet mais rien ne change. Parmi une de ces étapes on vous suggère de mettre à jour le câble mais pour ça vous devez être connecté…J’ai renvoyé le produit en me disant qu’il était peut-être défectueux. Sauf que j’ai eu le même problème avec le nouveau que je viens de recevoir.Je suis quand même surpris qu’en utilisant un accessoire de Microsoft et un ordinateur avec un système d’exploitation de Microsoft. On arrive à ce genre de problème…
4,NOTE: This is an updated review after testing the device in more detail.I have a Chromecast an Amazon TV Fire Stick and this. For the ones who are wondering (I had the same questions before I bought them) although there are similarities all these products have significant differences due to their underlying technology standards. You will hear of terms such as Miracast WiDi etc. and it may be useful to check if the devices you want to use it with (laptop tablets smartphones) are compatible. For example relatively old versions of Android phones and Windows laptops that do not possess the correct hardware/software may not work but usually would have to be more than 3-5 years old. Also entry levels smartphones such as the Samsung Galaxy J5 (2016) won't work with it so it is advisable to check online if it works.What this device does (and quite well) is to transmit the image and sound from supported devices to a monitor/TV. It is basically a "wireless HDMI cable". It works by default in Windows 10 if using earlier versions you may need some Intel software. Both the USB port on my monitor and TV were enough to power it. Even thought the USB port on my relatively old LG TV was a "service" port it still worked. If you don't have a USB port nearby you can use your phone USB charger if it has a USB A port.Setup wasn't that complicated. Strongly suggest using a Windows 10 laptop for the initial setup and downloading the Wireless Display Adapter app from the store. After connecting to the device check for firmware upgrades and upgrade the firmware.To connect to it using Windows 10 use the Connect icon on the Action Centre in the taskbar.Funny and true story...when I first tested it (very briefly) I was able to get image and sound from my "fantastic" Dell Monitor using my laptop. A few days later I tried to mirror my Galaxy S4 screen to the same monitor but no sound. Then I went on to do something else and later discovered the sound on the monitor was super low (not mute) so I tought I need to try phone again. A few weeks later tried phone again same issue. Then a light switched on my brain checked and the sound on the monitor was super low again. So I asked my girlfriend if she turns the volume down when she uses my monitor to study. I think you already know the answer!So if sound is not working check for things like volume on both devices update firmware check with your partner :)So why the 4 stars instead of 5:On the good side the device in my opinion is very good and high quality the mirroring from my S4 was fantastic and lag free slightly better than the Chromecast!It does not have a dedicated USB power adapter which means easier to transport and seems to require minimum power because it worked well in my "old" TV USB service port.Great as a quick cable free solution from my laptop which I use a lot for work as an extended screen.As the image is transmitted directly no need to connect to Wi-Fi network like the Chromecast it feels faster and works much better with laptops.On the not so good side I don't think the original price is worth the money but when the price was halved it was a different story.On 2 different laptops I noticed a bit more lag than I expected (I read lot of people have different lag experiences) but the latest firmware seems to have improved it a bit.I also noticed a bit of blur (no it's not the resolution nor the monitor same on TV). I have a Dell UltraSharp monitor! For example the text on the Windows menus seems to be missing a few bits. On closer inspection seems to be a refresh/frame rate issue. A bit of reading confirmed that it may be a limitation of the technology. There may be workarounds (or not) but I haven't explored this further.If you use it mainly for work it's not an issue but if for gaming or movies you may be slightly disappointed.In extended mode sometimes when transitioning from monitor to laptop it's like the mouse cursor hits a wall I have to move it to the other side and then try again.As the USB cable is short (I haven't required it to be long yet) it would have been nice to have an USB extension included in the box since it does not have a USB power supply and other similar device that are cheaper offer one.Unlike the Chromecast Roku's and Amazon Fire TV Stick this is not a media player/streaming device but I believe it has its usefulness.
1,La chiavetta di Microsoft per lo streaming video è un'idea ottima veramente molto interessante con tanti punti di forza per un uso aziendale ma anche svariati punti di debolezza da considerare. L'ho provata e voglio condividere la mia esperienza nel suo utilizzo.Cos'è la Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter?Si tratta di una chiavetta HDMI che consente di passare un flusso video senza bisogno di fili. Da dove a dove? Da un computer compatibile a un qualunque dispositivo (tv o monitor) con ingresso HDMI. L'idea è quella di togliere i cavi e favorire soluzioni volanti soluzione ideale per sale riunioni in cui chi arriva e deve presentare delle slide necessita di "collegarsi" alla tv o al proiettore della sala senza troppi cavi o configurazioni.Contenuto della confezioneNella confezione troverai la il dispositivo che da un lato è HDMI e dall'altra estremità del filo è USB una prolunga USB di qualche centimetro di lunghezza la guida rapida e la manualistica il tutto confezionato in una scatola di plastica con apertura rapida. Sull'esterno della confezione il disegno di come connettere il dispositivo l'indicazione di compatibilità con Windows 8.1 e Windows 10 e l'indicazione "WiFi certified" che lascia immaginare l'uso di questa tecnologia per la connessione anche se vedremo tra poco perchè non è così.Compatibilità del computerQui arriva la nota dolente perchè l'hardware del computer deve essere compatibile con il dispositivo per poter funzionare aspetto decisamente poco chiaro in fase di acquisto su Amazon dove l'ho presa e ancora meno sulla confezione del prodotto che viste le indicazioni lascia intendere che funzioni con qualunque computer con Windows 8.1 o 10 dotato di wifi.Quello che non è chiaro in fase di acquisto è che questo dispositivo non funziona con il wifi di casa come una Chromecast o una stampante wi-fi che si connette al router e per questo si ritrova nella rete domestica. No questa chiavetta di Microsoft utilizza il Miracast tecnologia di trasmissione diretta tra il dispositivo che trasmette e quello che riceve che pertanto deve essere compatibile sia per l'hardware che per il software e non tutti i computer lo sono anche quelli più prestanti come il mio notebook HP che avendo un processore i7 ritenevo compatibile con tutto pur non essendolo.Cos'è il Miracast della Microsoft Wireless Display adapter?Il Miracast utilizza il Wi-Fi Direct utilizzando lo standard peer to peer. Esso permette di inviare fino a 1080p in video HD (codec H.264) e 5.1 in audio surround (AAC e AC3 sono i codec opzionali). La connessione viene creata tramite WPS e quindi è protetta con WPA2.Questo significa che durante l'utilizzo il notebook potrà connettersi al wifi di casa ai dispositivi bluetooth solitamente in uso mentre il dispositivo creerà in parallelo un collegamento diretto tra computer e chiavetta trasmettendo direttamente audio e video con quella connessione. Da una parte è un bene perchè appunto lascia libero l'utente di connettersi alle reti wifi che desidera anche per navigare su internet nel mentre dall'altra è un male perchè tutto il computer deve essere compatibile cosa che con un mio vecchio notebook HP con scheda video AMD non si è verificata.Prima dell'acquisto è quindi fondamentale verificarne la compatibilità assicurandosi che il proprio computer supporti la tecnologia Mirecast.Cosa si può fare con Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter?L'uso di questa chiavetta è strettamente legato alla condivisione dello schermo e di conseguenza trova la sua applicazione ideale nelle aziende in cui le postazioni di lavoro sono notebook e nelle sale riunioni è presente uno schermo o un proiettore su cui occorre spesso mostrare il proprio desktop. In questa situazione è ideale perchè l'utente arriva nella sala cerca il dispositivo attraverso il tasto "connetti" di Windows 10 clicca su "connetti" e starà già condividendo audio e video del suo computer con lo schermo della sala riunioni. In pochissimi passaggi anche un utente non esperto riesce a connettersi. Lo svantaggio è che oltre alla condivisione dello schermo non si va. Da smartphone e tablet (non Microsoft) è pressochè inutile e quindi poco versatile.Per uso domestico non lo consiglio meglio una chromecast che è compatibile con smartphone e app di terze parti mentre questa chiavetta da iOS e Android è inutilizzabile. Per altro a prezzo inferiore vi sono chiavette che supportano il Mirecast AirPlay ed altre tecnologie tutte assieme in una chiavetta e quindi sono molto più versatili nell'utilizzo domestico.Pessima esperienza di configurazioneQuanto sopra lo posso raccontare dopo due settimane di tentativi e ricerche su come funzioni questa chiavetta alla ricerca di un motivo sensato che giustificasse il fatto che su un computer non apparisse proprio mentre sull'altro apparisse tra i dispositivi rilevati ma non si connettesse pur vedendola a pochi centimetri. Inizialmente pensavo usasse il wireless ma non avendomi nemmeno chiesto la password della rete ho presto capito che non funzionava così. Poi ho pensato che funzionasse con il bluetooth ma anche li ho presto capito che non era questo il caso. Poi cercando e approfondendo ho scoperto che utilizza il Mirecast tecnologia compatibile solo con alcune marche di schede video e wireless (per lo più Intel da quanto ho capito). Quindi il mio computer su cui contavo di usarla non era compatibile. Ecco se sulla confezione del prodotto scrivessero tutti i requisiti per la compatibilità forse si eviterebbe di perdere una settimana a fare ricerche.La guida rapida è corretta ma dice solamente vai nell'area notifiche sul tasto "connetti" cerca il dispositivo clicca su "connetti" tutto verissimo ma se non appare? Da nessuna parte ti spiegano come fare.Ecco perfetto stile Microsoft per il quale se hai un problema devi cercarti qualcuno che lo abbia già affrontato per risolverlo. Ancora una volta un'esperienza negativa per un prodotto Microsoft che potenzialmente è molto interessante.Immaginate di avere tre schermi sulla scrivania mouse e tastiera senza fili e il case del computer dall'altra parte della casa. Tutto senza fili. Interessante. Con questo prodotto lo potete fare. Forse. Se il computer è compatibile.
4,Ich finde diesen Display Adapter Klasse.Einfacher ist es nicht seine Bilder vom Handy Tablett (jeweils Android) Laptop oder PC (Win10) an jeden x-Beliebigen TV zu übertragen 1080HD.Kein WLAN Router / Hotspot etc. nötig auch keine XX m Kabel mit schleppen.Das war für mich einer der Hauptgründe für diesen Stick. Wenn man unterwegs ist (Beruflich oder Privat) und man möchte Bilder/Videos  zeigen oder eine Präsentation muss man nicht umständlich sich mit einem Netzwerkverbinden um dann das Bild zu Teilen (Five Stick oder Chromecast).Einfach in HDMI und einen freien USB Port einstecken und loslegen! (Zur not auch mit einer Powerbank und einem HDMI <--> VGA Amazon Basic Adapter)Für den Preis um 30€ Top!Ein kleiner wehrmutstropfen bleibt das "Steckerchen" wird doch recht warm im Betrieb (40°C+)
5,Nachdem unser Smart TV (ein Samsung ES6710) nach einem Softwareupdate auf einmal keine Möglichkeit mehr bot Screen Mirroring zu nutzen wir aber den TV auch nicht gegen einen neuen ersetzen wollten weil er noch tadellos funktionierte schauten wir nach Möglichkeiten wie wir ihm eben genau dieses Screen Mirroring / Miracast wieder "beibringen" können. Samsung selbst bot keine Lösung. Das Gerät wurde nicht mehr unterstützt. Man sollte offenbar lieber ein neues Gerät kaufen. Dann haben wir einen Amazon Fire TV Stick Lite ausprobiert da damit viele recht gute Erfolge vorweisen konnten wie wir im Internet recherchiert hatten. Aber das funktionierte nicht gut: Bild war sehr schlecht aufgelöst der Mousezeiger lief ruckelig und mit extremer Verzögerung und auch die Verbindung zwischen Laptop und Fire TV Stick funktionierte - wenn Sie denn überhaupt zu Stande kam - nur sporadisch und ab und zu aber eben nicht verlässlich. Wir wollten den TV bei uns im Büro zur Präsentation vor Kunden nutzen (der Laptopbildschirm sollte auf dem TV gespiegelt werden und das ohne Kabelverbindung zwischen Laptop und TV). Das war aber aus beschriebenen Gründen mit dem Fire TV Stick nicht möglich. Also haben wir weiter gesucht. Und sind letztlich bei diesem tollen Produkt von Microsoft gelandet. Und Überraschung: Es funktioniert perfekt!!! Wir haben es selbst nicht geglaubt! Einfach ausgepackt angeschlossen im Laptop als externen Bildschirm gesucht nach wenigen Sekunden gefunden und läuft! Keine Werbung kein Konto eröffnen keinen Software installieren keine ewige Einrichtung. Einfach anschließen und loslegen! Und das Beste ist: Der Stick versorgt sich selbst über den USB am TV somit entfällt auch das lästige Kabelwirrwar was man z.B. beim Fire TV Stick hat der ja Strom aus der Steckdose braucht. Also von uns eine ganz klar Empfehlung für den Wireless Display Adapter von Microsoft. Ja er ist ein Stück teurer als Chromecast oder Fire TV Stick aber dafür funktioniert er und das ohne Werbung oder Daten eingeben. Wir haben bei uns im Büro ausschließlich Windows-basierte Geräte und im aktuellen Fall haben wir ein Surface Pro 7 mit Windows 10 und ein Surface Pro 8 mit Windows 11 ganz einfach und ohne Probleme drahtlos verbinden können. Fazi:t: ganz klare Empfehlung!
2,It works but it's not reliable.  Sometimes it just randomly loses connection and it's difficult to re-connect. Sometimes it stays connected but the picture stutters.When it's working there is a noticeable lag.  It's possible to change the settings in windows to improve that but the lag is still noticable.The main positive I can say is that when it's working it's actually ok.  The lag was disappointing but apart from that it works well enough.  If it wasn't for the unreliability I would give it 4 stars.  I would use it daily at home.  However because of how it is instead use an HDMI cable at home and only use this wireless display adapter when I'm travelling and don't want to carry the HDMI cable.
5,Il fonctionne très bien pour déporter l'écran de mon ordinateur portable
5,Después de probar el Chromecast con toda la ilusión del mundo lo tuve que devolver y buscar alternativas (Roku Android TV etc...) y finalmente di con este sencillo dispositivo de Microsoft.El Chromecast iba muy bien permitía hacer cast es decir ver un vídeo de youtube y aplicaciones preparadas para el chromecast mientras se hacía otra cosa con el móvil e incluso realizar una proyección espejada de lo que se veía en el móvil. El problema con el Chromecast es que requería disponer de una wifi a la que conectarla y además que esta wifi tuviera acceso a internet incluso aunque fueras a proyectar en espejo la pantalla. Esta restricción inútil fue la que me hizo devolverlo.Este dispositivo de MS es super pequeño y sólo requiere 05A de USB y una entrada HDMI.Desde android sólo permite ver la imagen del móvil en una pantalla HDMI aunque desde sistemas windows 8.x y windows 10 permite tratarlo como otra pantalla (clonar extender la pantalla etc...). No todos los sistemas son compatibles la mayoría de los nuevos portátiles lo son pero ojito a la compatibilidad con sistemas windows.No permite hacer "cast" como el dispositivo de google pero por lo menos funcionará siempre sin necesidad de wifi con internet ni nada.El alcance es muy bueno unos 10 metros entre adaptador y dispositivo emisor.Todos los sistemas que he probado hasta la fecha tenían retardo de entrada por lo que para jugar o manejar con el ratón no los recomiendo. No obstante este de microsoft y el chromecast eran los que tenían menos retardo y eran "usables" con ratón.El vídeo va perfecto a full hd y sincronizado imagen y sonido. En este punto sin problemas.Se calienta bastante aunque quiero pensar que está diseñado para aguantar estas temperaturas.El paquete trae el adaptador HDMI+USB y luego un cable pequeño extensor de USB por si se nos queda corto aunque podríamos usar cualquier otro cable USB pues sólo usa el USB para la alimentación eléctrica.Por último decir que para actualizar el firmware del adaptador es necesario conectarse a él mediante máquina windows compatible y aplicación que se descarga de la tienda de microsoft (gratuita). No hay aplicación para Android.No es compatible con sistemas Apple pues este fabricante no ha adoptado el estándar de Miracast / WiDi y tiene su propio sistema de "streaming" (Apple TV).Lo recomiendo. Aquí en españa no tenemos disponibles los sistemas de Amazon y para comprar el Roku Stick sale caro y es de importación.
5,Mine worked fine straight away although it might take a couple of auto connects its all good and realiable my screen didnt match the resolution and the desktop was slightly hidden but i just turned it off so that might be a problem as my card didnt allow adjustment but im giving it 5*
2,Während wireless HDMI Transmitter weit über 100 Euro kosten  habe ich hier eine zufriedenstellende und bezahlbare Lösung gefunden.Manchmal muss ich den Verbindungsaufbau etwas abwarten  aber dann läuft alles flüssig.  Ich nutze allerdings nur einen 42" Fernseher.  Wie die Bild- Qualität bei größeren Geräten aussieht  kann ich nicht sagen.Ich werde mir dieses Gerät allerdings auch noch für einen etwas älteren Beamer zulegen.Wichtig ist  dass das Gerät  an dem dieses hier angeschlossen werden soll  einen USB- Platz haben muss.  Darüber wird es mit Strom gespeist.UPDATE:Nach genau einem Jahr Betrieb lässt das Gerät leider keine Verbindung mehr zu. Es landet stets wieder im Startbildschirm. An den Einstellungen Anschlüssen und sonstigen Gegebenheiten hat sich nichts verändert. Das Gerät wurde auch nicht dauerhaft sondern fünf bis zehn Mal pro Woche (über insgesamt ca. 35 Wochen) für 5 bis 30 Minuten verwendet.Vor einem Monat kaufte ich mir ein weiteren dieser Geräte um ihn bei einem weiteren Computer zu verwenden. Nun werde ich ihn wohl als Ersatz für den ersten und defekten Adapter verwenden und hoffen dass er länger hält. Andernfalls ist es doch keine günstige sondern nur eine kurzlebige Alternative. Für diesen Preis sollten zumindest drei Jahre drin sein.
4,Le prix est correct et le câble est de bonne qualité.
5,Top Artikel. Schönes Design gute Qualität und super easy einzurichten. Eine super einfache Möglichkeit Bildschirme zu duplizieren. Sehr empfehlenswert!
4,This is a great gadget and good value at the current price. The only cloud on the horizon was Amazon delivering it to the wrong house. Fortunately I have good neighbours who brought the item round on their return from their weekenf break. Also the procedure for reporting problems to Amazon is just useless.
4,Sono arrivato a questo dispositivo dopo avere provato diversi 'dongle' cioè dispositivi analoghi a chromecast che funzionano come quest'ultimo appunto attraverso connsessione internet. La meraviglia di questo dispositivo microsoft invece è che funziona senza connessione alla rete. Vantaggi notevoli e praticità massima.Utilizzo il mirror dello schermo per lavoro dal portatile mentre dal celullare per vedere film in streming. Per queste due fattispecie non credo che abbia rivali. Occorre specificare a lettere cubitali che il dispositivo funziona solo con pc che abbiano la funzione 'trasemtti schermo' (windows 10 per intenderci) e stessa funzione sul cellulare (ultimi android per interderci). Una volta accertato queste caratteristiche non si riscontrano probelmi di installazione proprio perchè non c'è alcuna installazione ma il dispositivo è subito pronto e risulta immediatamente visibile dall'elenco dispositivi atti a ricevere la trasmissione schermo. Unica nota dolente è il prezzo. Al prezzo corrente non mi sarei sentito di acquistare. (Specifico di averlo trovato riferito a al modello precedente a 126 euro [inaccettabile] e il modello recente quello che ho acquistato a un range da 77 a 62. [ancora troppo per me]. Ho optato per l'usato AMAZON wharehouse che è una garanzia di perfezione del prodoto e sono riuscito ad averlo per 41 euro prezzo viste le mie esigenza molto piu ragionevole.Consiglio quindi questo prodotto a chi possiede requistiti per fruirne mentre ovviamente diventa necessario un chromecast perchi non ha recenti dispositivi. Devo a milincuore dare 4 stello prioprio per l'esagerazione del costo
4,Wanted this to mirror the screens of two tablets to a TV which had HDMI but no USB.  Planned to use a separate USB power supply plug to power the device.  The tablets I wanted to mirror are both Samsung. One is  Android  4.4  Android  9.  I  wanted to use the device to mirror movies.Plugged the dongle into the HDMI port of the TV and connected it to a separate USB power plug made by a leading manufacturer.  The device powered up and displayed the Microsoft landing page but was unstable.  Both tablets were unable to find/see the dongle.  At the time I was about one metre away from the dongle.I concluded that it might be a power supply issue.  I change the power supply plug over and the device worked perfectly with both tablets.  Video streamed okay with no jitter in sound or vision.Checking out the PSU plugs I saw that both were rated at 5v 1 amp.  My only thought is that the first PSU I used was not 100% spec for USB voltage.  Which leads me to conclude that the device may need a good strong USB voltage.  If the USB voltage is slightly off then there could be problems with it working.Other than this the device does what is should do. It works  with Android 4.4 and Android 9. and streams video okay.  I am happy with it except it does seem to be overpriced.
3,I brought this to extend my laptop display to my monitor to save me using a hdmi cable and this device doesn't work very well for that purpose.To begin with I was surprised how easy it was to set up and get connected to. It's pretty much plug and play just stick the hdmi in the display and plug the USB in (I used an external adapter as the minister lacks usb ports).Once connected to the laptop I found the picture quality good enough but not perfect with the occasional artifact and only slight input lag with the mouse. But after using it for a while I noticed two major problems that makes the device no good for what I want to use it for. Firstly on my laptop I use a Bluetooth mouse and I found the connection to the display works perfectly fine if you move the mouse around slowly but if you start being slightly erratic with the mouse it caused the image on the wireless display to have connection problems and jitter. This itself is slightly annoying but can be worked around.This second problem is that deal breaker for me though. Using the wireless display caused the CPU usage on my laptop to be way higher than it would be if I just used a hdmi cable. Just watching a YouTube video on the second screen with the adapter had my CPU usage at around 50% which is way higher than the normal 10% and less you get when using hdmi in the same situation. This means that using the display my laptop would both get hotter than it needs to (not good during the summer months) and also drain the battery way quicker than normal.Because of these two problem I've very quickly given up on using the device in the way I intended to use it.  Thankfully though it works well at mirroring my phone display so I can use it or doing that.So in short; not good for extending a PC display good enough for watching videos on a larger screen without any multitasking.
4,Ich habe heute meinen zweiten MS Display Adapter erhalten. Den habe ich als Geschenk bestellt weil ich mit der ersten (Version _CO) ziemlich zufrieden bin.  (Beide sind Version V2)Aaaaber :-)  Ich wollte den neuen (Version _A1) testen und das Firmwareupdate machen. Also hab ich ihn genauso angeschlossen wie den bisherigen. Erst mal ging gar nichts! Nicht mal ein Willkommensbildschirm. Dann hab ich mich erinnert dass der erste seinerzeit auch nicht auf Anhieb funktioniert hat.  Also habe ich ein externes USB Netzteil geholt und damit immerhin einen Willkommensbildschirm auf dem Fernseher erhalten.  ... Aber nach 10 Verbindungsversuchen und mehreren Resets - alles erfolglos - war ich genervt und hab mich an den Microsoft Chat gewendet .... das war (natürlich) umsonst! (...kostenlos auch :-) )Ich habe dann ein hochwertigeres USB Netzteil geholt und den Adapter damit mit Strom versorgt. .... und siehe da ich hatte sofort eine Verbindung!Dann hab ich das Firmwareupdate gemacht und einen anderen Namen vergeben Netzteil wieder abgesteckt und den Adapter (wie am Anfang) wieder an den USB des Fernsehers angeschlossen.... und auf einmal hat alles funktioniert.Microsoft funktioniert einfach nicht so wie es soll!  Aber man kann es meistens "hinbiegen" Wer Win 10 hat der kennt das ja auch. :-)Nachtrag am 24 Juli 2017:Ich habe den Adapter jetzt ein dreiviertel Jahr in Betrieb und kann inzwischen alle verstehen die damit Probleme haben.  Aber ich habe auch die Lösung :-)  ... zumindest für die wahrscheinlich meisten Fälle.Zweimal seit ich den Adapter habe ging gar nix mehr. (Im Mai und gestern)  Die Ursache war ein automatisches Update von Microsoft bei welchem eine neuere Version des Wlan Treibers auf Convertible-Tablet Gerät aufgespielt wurde.Danach ging entweder gar nix mehr ("Verbindungsfehler) oder alles war stark zeitversetzt und ruckelte ... also nicht zu gebrauchen.Ich hab dann in Windows den alten Treiber wieder eingestellt ... und von magischer Hand gezaubert funktionierte alles wieder 100%. Bei mir funktioniert übrigens der im angehängten Bild dargestellte Treiber. Alle neueren NICHT!!!Sehr komisch ist dass Microsoft den eigenen Displaysadapter durch ein Treiberupdate außer Gefecht setzt .... tja wie sagte ich anfangs "Microsoft eben".
4,Der Wireless Display Adapter hat viele gute Eigenschaften. Er ist unkompliziert: Das Verbinden zwischen Laptop und Adapter ist kinderleicht er muss nicht eingerichtet werden. Der Microsoft Store bietet eine App um den Adapter via PIN zu schützen sodass sich kein x-beliebiger/s PC/Smartphone damit verbindet. Er bietet den wahnsinnigen Komfort kabellos den Display zu erweitern oder zu duplizieren und dass direkt von der Couch.Er hat jedoch die eine oder andere Schwachstelle: Die Übertragung von statischen funktioniert problemlos gut sollte man jedoch z.B. ein Video angucken wollen hat man mit einigen Macken zu kämpfen. Da die Übertragung extrem geringfügig zeitverzögert ist aber dennoch zeitverzögert versucht der Laptop beim duplizieren des Screens das Bild ständig mit dem eigenen Laptopbildschirm und dem Wireless Display Adapter zu synchronisieren. Das Ergebnis ist: Der Ton wird leicht früher abgespielt als er sollte und zugleich gerät das Bild auf beiden Anzeigen immer wieder ins ruckeln und nachladen. Die einfache Lösung hierbei: Den Bildschirm nicht duplizieren lassen. Man sollte die Anzeige zumindest erweitern oder gleich nur auf dem Adapter anzeigen lassen sodass es rein von von der Verbindungsqualität abhängt wie gut übertragen wird. Dies ist auch nicht perfekt aber die Übertragung ist recht ruckelfrei flüssig anzugucken und in Bild und Ton synchron.Weiter ist es natürlich von der Hardware des zu übertragenden Gerätes abhängig wie gut die Übertragung gelingt. Ich stellte z.B. fest dass es eine schlechte Idee ist auf meinen Laptop die Displayanzeige zu erweitern und so den Adapter als zweite Bildschirmhälfte um das Abspielen eines Youtubevideos zu bemühen während ich auf dem laptopeigenen Bildschirm gesurft habe.Das alles sind Kinderkrankheiten und zeigt nur wie weit Miracast noch ausbaufähig ist.Ich bin mit der Leistung meines Microsoft Wireless Display Adapters zufrieden und kann von den Makeln absehen. Das kabellose HDMI schont die HDMIbuchse meines Laptops. Man kann damit gut arbeiten und falls man einmal Videos abspielen will funktioniert auch für meine Zwecke gut genug.
5,Firstly for those that may be unaware of what the Microsoft Wireless Display Adaptor is. It essentially turns your second screen into an extended desktop but wirelessly.It uses the Miracast 'standard' but don't let this put you off! Miracast has had a bad press and for good reason over the past few years as the idea never seemed to meet expectations until now! Before this gem of a device came along Miracast performance was largely dependent on hardware compatibility and performance at both source (PC/device) and the second screen (TV/Projector/monitor). It was hard to get devices to 'play' well together and thus Miracast tends to be very unreliable and often useless due to extreme lag.Microsoft have addressed this by producing it's 2nd version of this Wireless Display Adaptor to essentially bridge the gap of the performance issues of the other kit your using!It is once piece dongle with HDMI one end and a USB on the other. When not in use they plug neatly into a little plastic housing for easy storage.To use:1. Simply plug the HDMI and USB plugs into the 'second screen' that you wish to use.2. Go to your PC/Phone/Tablet and connect via your device 'Screen Mirroring' setting.3. Click/press 'MSDisplayAdapter' and that's it simple!There is no noticeable lag or delay although in use I have noticed a slight slow down from time to time but not enough to bother me. Just disconnect and reconnect and all is well. Microsoft do not market this device for use with gaming BUT I have tested and noticed around 0.5 sec delay (at it's worst) so not at all bad really. It would be fine for video sharing/viewing. Audio is also shared and automatically mutes the PC.To summarise this device is superb for office-based second screen sharing use and presentations and if using with Windows 10; behaves in the same way as if you had a second monitor plugged into your PC and with all the same options (duplicate extend and second screen). The fact that it handles video/audio well is a bonus. I have used similar devices at twice the cost but offer only mediocre performance. This device is far superior in my experienced opinion.
4,Works brilliantly on my laptop using windows.  However what I wanted it for was for my office computer so I could store it in the room next to where I work and use my 4K monitor wirelessly.  If you plan to do this:You can't set it to run off a second monitor and stay that way when you restart the computer.  You'll need a small cheap monitor (spare TV?) by the computer so that when you switch it on you can direct it to your monitor in the other room.My graphics card uses Direct X not OpenGL and the adapter defaulted to running off the motherboard instead (= terrible resolution) which is a deal breaker for me. You may have more luck with an OpenGL graphics card.So I gave up on this in favour of an HDMI cable instead.  That said my mouse keyboard and speakers are all wireless so I only have two cables going into my PC (power cable and HDMI).  This makes it a doddle to move it into the other room when guests come over.  Not the ideal solution but not too bad.
4,The value for money is quite dubious as it cost 3 times as much as an anycast dongle on ebay. However it's microsoft branded and worked out of the box.The main problem i have with it there are two.1. It generates so much heat it burns your fingers when you go to remove it.2. Because of this heat it has severe lag and picture jitteriness even just streaming twitch.3. If there's a wall between your streaming device and the router say goodbye to the picture being responsive to your mouse movements. Talking seconds of lag.
5,Fin dal primo utilizzo mi sono reso conto di come questo modello sia una versione realmente migliorata rispetto al suo predecessore.Con il precedente Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter mi è capitato più volte di avere delle instabilità di connessione con alcuni PC e dispositivi.Questo ora non capita più.Ma vediamo tutto più in dettaglio.OSSERVAZIONI GENERALISempre paragonandolo al modello precedente le dimensioni e la forma sono state migliorate: la parte con la presa HDMI è infatti stata resa più piccola a vantaggio di un cavo più lungo migliorandone la flessibilità e quindi la praticità di inserimento in una TV.Inoltre il dispositivo viene così ad essere anche molto più leggero e compatto.Il software è stato anch'esso migliorato: zero problemi di connessione o ritardi e funzionalità al top.CONSIGLI PER L'UTILIZZOL'ideale è collegare la parte USB di questo adattatore (unicamente per alimentare il dispositivo) a una presa della TV.Se però avete a che fare con un vecchio televisore o monitor dotati sì di presa HDMI ma non di USB allora potete tranquillamente collegare l'adattatore a una Powerbank in modo da alimentarlo con la batteria esterna. Funzionerà senza nessun problema.CONCLUSIONINonostante il prezzo più alto di altri della concorrenza se la vostra TV o schermo non sono dotati di Miracast integrato vi consiglio questo adattatore (magari in Ottime Condizioni su Amazon Wareouse un affare!) in modo da avere una connessione affidabile e in modo rapido e veloce.
5,Le top pas de temps à perdre utiliser depuis plus de 8 mois
1,This is Microsoft’s second attempt at a wireless display adapter that uses Miracast technology. I had the V1 years ago and whilst it was fun when it worked more than 50% of the time it refused to connect to whoever’s laptop was attempting to use it.Fast forward to now and I am kitting out some meeting rooms at work I figured I’d give the new V2 adapter a go to see if the convenience of wirelessly connecting to the projectors was any better this time on.And it’s INSTANT DISAPPOINTMENT. Plugged it in turned it on attempted to connect and FAILED. Again and again and again!Reinstalled all the usual drivers WiFi and display tried on two Thinkpads a T480S and a P14S with Windows 10 and 11 rebooted a million times and reset the adapter but no joy.These wireless display adapters are a useless waste of time and totally unsuitable for professional use in meeting rooms etc…. The last thing you want at the start of meetings is to be juggling reboots reinstalling drivers etc etc….Avoid like the plague.
4,Premièrement l'installation a été difficile. Impossible de se connecter avec mon ASUS VivobookPro. J'ai du m'y reprendre à au moins 15 reprises avec d'arriver à avoir une image. J'ai mis a jour le micro logiciel de la clef et depuis tout va bien.Une fois la galère de l’installation passée la connexion est on ne peut plus simple.Possibilité de régler le 2eme écran comme avec un câble HDMI (dupliquer étendre ect...)Après différent test la résolution 1080p présente pas mal de saccades en particulier dans un lecteur embarqué dans un navigateur web (streaming)  moins prononcé en passant par VLC par exemple.En fouillant les réglage j'ai remarqué que dans cette résolution la fréquence de rafraichissement était bridée à 30hz.J'ai réduit la résolution en 1600x900 et les saccades ont nettement diminuées (mais pas complétement) et la fréquence de rafraichissement est repassée à 60hz.Niveau qualité d'image il y a clairement une perte. C'est un système qui "stream" de la vidéo encodée en H264. Malgres cela elle reste très correcte.Niveau latence ne pensez pas à jouer. on est sur du 300/500ms d'input lagVerdict C'est bien cher pour ce que c'est. Très pratique dans certaines utilisation cela reste un gadget. Le câble HDMI reste quand même bien meilleur à tous les points de vue hormis la contrainte du câble ^^
3,Der Adapter wird mit einer "uralten" Firmware geliefert zum Update ist eine zusätzliche App erforderlich die gesondert geladen werden muss - es ist keine CD oder ähnliches dabei. Und hier liegt dann auch das Problem...Hat man die App im Inet gefunden und geladen dann funktioniert die natürlich nur wenn sich der PC mit dem Adapter verbinden kann und die Verbindung den Update unterstützt. Die meisten werden nur ein System zuhause haben ich habe drei Installationen zur Hand und keine hat funktioniert.1. PC verbindet sich die App verbindet sich Update geht aber nicht2. PC verbindet sich die App bricht irgendwo kommentarlos ab3. PC verbindet sich immer nur für Sekunden keine Chance irgendwas mit der App zu machenDas erste gelieferte Adapter habe ich daraufhin als fehlerhaft zurückgeschickt und Ersatz angefordert in der Vermutung es liegt an einer defekten HW - weit gefehlt exakt das Gleiche auch beim 2ten Adapter. Nach ausgiebiger Recherche im Inet wird klar das Ding geht im Auslieferungszustand nur bei bestimmten HW/SW Konstellation alle anderen Konfigurationen offensichtlich nur nach dem Firmware-Update. Insofern muss man zufälligerweise das Richtige haben oder irgendwo finden.Ich habe mich dann bei Bekannten umgehört und bin so auf einen etwas betagten eher einfachen HP-Laptop gestossen - und siehe da der kann das Adapter verbinden und auch den Update durchführen. Danach sieht der Anmelde-Screen des Adapters am TV total erneuert aus und alle vorher erfolglosen Geräte lassen sich jetzt verbinden und auch nutzen selbst die App kann man jetzt auch von dort verbinden. Es gibt immer noch manch unklares Verhalten des Adapters aber man kann es am Ende zumindest für den geplanten Zweck nutzen und einrichten.Im derzeitigen Auslieferungszustand und dem Update-Prozess ist es eigentlich unbrauchbar. Von Plug-and-Play weit entfernt...
4,This device is very useful and we use it to extend my desktop from our computer to the big screen TV in our office this allows us to show presentations and watch netflix on the big screen.We bought two of these one for the house another for the office.Setup in the office was extremely easy plug in to USB and HDMI on TV then go off and find the device in Windows 10 it was instant zero lag and did not drop and still has not dropped once. This operates at a range of 2 meters.Setup in the home was a different experience entirely.We did all the same things but this time we had multiple errors only after upgrading the firmware as the device asked us before upgrading the firmware it worked fine but dropped out every 10 minutes or so.So we upgraded the firmware we could then not connect at all we looked online for fixes and followed everything for around 2 days. We updated our graphics card wireless adapter drivers everything and still it failed to connect.In the end we re-installed Windows 10 on the laptop and this then fixed the issue extreme I know but we had no personal data on the laptop so we just went ahead and did it it drops out a bit more at a range of 2-3 meters.We are still not sure what caused the issue or whether the previous Windows version was at fault.Issues was with a HP Stream 11 laptop.
1,Habe das Teil 2016 gekauft um für mein Windows10 Notebook (Lenovo Thinkpad) ohne weiteren Kabelwirrwar eine Display-Extension auf den Monitor zu realsieren. Nach dem Kauf funktionierte die Verbindung zunächst mit dem Lenovo Notebook und auch mit meinem Samsung Galaxy Tab Handy wie erwartet allerdings wurde das Teil nach kurzer Zeit extrem heiss und kam nach "längerer" Laufzeit (15 min?) -wohl wegen wegen thermischer Probleme- ins Stottern. Mit einem Win10 Toshiba Notebook und einem Galaxy S4 Handy war dagegen schon damals keine Verbindung zu erreichen. Nachdem ich das Teil einige Monate nicht benutzt hatte und die Verbindung zum ersten Mal für eine echte Aufgabe nutzen wollte - ging gar nichts mehr: nach der Verbindung fror das Lenovo Notebook komplett ein und war jeweils nur durch Hard-Reset wiederzubeleben. Ein Firmware-Update des Adapter war so natürlich auch nicht möglich da dies ja nur bei bestehender Verbindung zu einem PC möglich ist. Nach tagelanger Foren-Recherche und vielen Stunden probieren meinte ich das Problem durch ein Update der WLAN Treiber auf dem Notebook behoben zu haben- danach funktionierte die Verbindung wieder. Auch noch nach dem nun durchgeführten Firmware Update des Adapters. Nach ein paar Wochen ergab sich dann wieder der Bedarf zum realen Einsatz - und wieder das selbe Spiel: das Notebook fror ein. WLAN Treiber Update brachte diesmal keine Hiilfe- aber nach tagelangem Foren-Studium- half diesmal ein Update des Intel-Grafik-Karten-Treibers. Aber man kann es sich denken auch das hatte nur für ein paar Wochen Bestand- das Noteook friert wieder ein! Mittlerweile hatte ich es aufgegeben den Adapter mit Windows benutzen zu wollen. Ich habe es auch mit anderen Laptops getestet und es hat nirgendwo funktioniert! Ich glaubte es ja wenigstens mit den Android-Geräten nutzen- zu können da es mit dem Galaxy Tablett und mit meinem neuen Honor P6 Handy immer noch funktionierte. Ber natürlich nur so lange bis ich es nach ein paar Monaten Pause wieder einmal tatsächlich nutzen wollte: - nun kam nach dem Bestätigen der Verindung auf den Android-Geräten (auf allen getetsteten!) die Meldung: "Verbindung nicht möglich". Jetzt habe ich die Nase gestrichen voll und das Teil per Hammer deaktiviert damit ich nicht in einem schwachen und verwirrten Moment in Versuchung komme noch mehr meiner Lebenszeit für solche unausgegorene Technik zu vergeuden! Es ist einfach eine Schande für die gegenwärtige Industrie und eine Zumutung für Ihre Kunden solche Geräte auf den Markt zu kotzen!Was soll der Nutzer mit einem solchen Schrott für den er noch den nicht geringen Betrag von 60+ € bezahlt hat und der nie wirklich richtig funktioniert hat? Ich habe extra ein Microsoft Gerät gekauft weil ich hoffte dass wenigstens damit die Anbindung an Windows- wenigstens für ein Markengerät (Lenovo Thinpad Windows10 zertifiziert) zuverlässig oder wenigstens überhaupt funktioniert. Durch den Update Wahn von Windows wurde die Hardware aber nach kürzester Zeit entwertet und selbst Microsoft ist anscheinend nicht in der Lage die Schnittstellen für seine eigenen Geräte und sein eigenes Betriebssystem so zu gestalten das es sinnvoll funktioniert. Als Kunde ist man für die grossen Firmen mittlerweile eh nur Bezahlvieh und deren Interesse am Kunden hat sich erschöpft sobald sie ihre Produkte an diese verkauft haben. Der Aufwand am Produkt wird konsequentwerweise auf eine schöne bunte Verpackung und viel blumige Werbung fokussiert für das Ausreifen und wertige Updades der Produkte wird lieber gar nichts investiert da ja die Produktreihe meist eh nach einem Vierteljahr beendet wird. Ist vielleicht bei dem Adapter nicht so umso erstaunlicher finde ich es das das Teil immer noch verkauft wird und bei Amazon- trotz 21% 1Sterne Wertungen immer noch mit 34 bewertet wird.Und bitte- komme mir niemand mit dem Hinweis ich hätte es ja mit dem Microsoft Support versuchen oder das Teil einfach tauschen oder zurückgeben können! Die Erfahrung aus anderen Problemen ist das es zumindest für die grossen Firmen noch mehr verschwendete Zeit ist sich an den Service zu wenden der einen meist nur mit Arroganz und Ignoranz und nutzlosen Dummy-Tips abspeist. Foren helfen bei ein bisschen Erfahrung und Nachdenken dagegen meist irgendwie real weiter. Und wenn die Probleme mehr als ein halbes Jahr nach dem Kauf auftreten (wie in diesem Fall) ist es mit der Durchsetzung Rückgabe und Garantieansprüchen bei Amazon mittlerweile auch nicht mehr weit her man muss viel Aufwand treiben - da kein Serviceticket über die Seite mehr gezogen werden kann- einen Ansprechpartner für den Vorgang zu erhalten. In dem Fall habe ich drauf verzichtet weil ich glaube das das Problem kein individueller- sondern ein genereller Produktfehler darstellt.Ich habe viel zu viel Zeit für diese Sache vergeudet ein HDMI Kabel tut es in den meisten Fällen auch!Das war übrigens meine erste Rezension bei Amazon (seit >10 Jahren Kundschaft) habe eigentlich keine Zeit für so was aber irgendwie muss ich meinen Ärger in dieser Sache mal loswerden und vielleicht hilft es ja ein paar Menschen vor Illusionen zu diesem Produkt zu bewahren!
4,Der Funkstick ist relativ teuer und muss ggf. noch ein Update bekommen bevor er funktioniert. Die Beschreibung ist nicht selbst erklärend und erfordert ein wenig Tüfftelei. Für Microsoft sehr peinlich! Wenn dann alles funktioniert ist es eine tolle Sache aber da gibt es auf dem Markt sicher auch noch Konkurrenzprodukte die ein besseres Preis-Leistungsverhältnis bieten.
5,bei Apple funktioniert Airplay wirklich super wenn dort auch nur mit 720 Zeilen Auflösung. Eine ähnliche Lösung habe ich seit Android 4.2 gesucht wo schließlich die Spiegelungsfunktion in Form des miracast-Standards standardmäßig eingebaut ist.Ich habe mir inzwischen bereits 5 verschiedene Sticks gekauft welche Miracast und meist auch noch DLNA und Airplay versprochen haben. Das war alles Schrott. Meist war auch eine spezielle App erforderlich.Beim MS Wireless Display Adapter funktioniert nun alles beinahe so wie bei Apple Airplay. Am Android-Handy (ab 4.2) die Display-Spiegelung aktivieren nach ca. 5 Sekunden wird der Stick gefunden angeklickt verbunden. So muß es sein!Ich war erstaunt wie ruckelfrei die Übertragung (natürlich auf kurze Distanz max durch eine 12 cm Ziegelwand) funktionert. Mein Handy unterstützt WiFi mit 5 GHz vielleicht hängt es auch damit zusammen daß deshalb ein freier Kanal gefunden wurde (meine Wohnung ist mit ca. 15 Umgebungsnetzen "verseucht").Gegenüber anderen Sticklösungen und Apple Airplay wird vom Microsoft-Stick ein eigenes WiFi-Netz aufgebaut. Das bringt folgende Vorteile:- kein Konfigurationsaufwand für WLAN am Stick- kein WLAN-Netzwerk oder Accesspoint zum Betrieb erforderlich da miracast Wi-Fi Direct verwendet- kein Ruckeln wenn Onlineinhalte gespiegelt werden weil keine Doppelbelastung des WLAN-Kanals- Stick wird nicht im gesamten Netzwerk aufgefunden nur innerhalb der Reichweite von ca. 7 m.Nachteile:- Reichweite begrenzt auf ca. 7 m UmkreisDes weiteren stellte ich fest dass es mein Smart-TV problemlos schafft den Stick über einen der USB-Ports mit Strom zu versorgen. Das ist schon mal positiv da der Strom z.B. für die meisten USB-Festplatten nicht ausreichte.Der Stick wird im Betrieb warm aber nicht heiß.Mein Windows-PC ist relativ aktuell (mind. Win. 8.1 und Graphikkate mit WDDM 1.3-Support) und konnte sich zum Glück auch problemlos mit dem Stick verbinden. Somit konnte auch die Windows-Konfigurationsapp gestartet werden und das aktuellste Firmwareupdate installiert werden. Einstellungen für PIN-Codes zum Koppeln oder Verbinden habe ich nicht aktiviert da sich auf Grund der geringen Reichweite noch kein Nachbar aufgeschaltet hat.Wer aber kein entsprechendes Windows-Gerät hat sollte wenigstens die Möglichkeit haben bei einem Bekannten (falls erforderlich) eine Grundinstallation vorzunehmen.Ich muß gestehen dass ich alternativ den Fire TV Stick und den Chromecast nicht getestet habe. Beim Chromecast befürchte ich dass der Stromverbrauch für den USB-Ausgang des TV zu hoch ist. Beim Fire TV Stick gehe ist davon aus dass ein Bedienfunktion am Stick vonnöten ist (z.B. WLAN-Konfig für selbes Netzwerk; Fernbedienung muß betätigt werden) welche meiner Anforderung einer einfachen Bedienung für die reine Miracastfunktion widerspricht.
5,Bon produit pour projeter un écran PC sur un écran TV à distance et sans fil. Il faut juste adapter la résolution du PC afin d'obtenir une image sur une TV FHD via le connecteur HDMI. Ayant un écran de PC portable FHD (1920x1080 pixels) il a été nécessaire de réduire sa résolution à 1600x900 px maximum. Par ailleurs l'image TV est stable et les teintes sont respectées. Pour la diffusion de vidéos sonorisées il faut penser à basculer le paramètre son vers l'adaptateur sans fil en cliquant sur l'icône "son" de Windows 10 afin de pouvoir entendre la bande son à partir du téléviseur. La distance entre mon PC et la TV est d'environ 5 mètres. Je ne connais pas la portée maximale de ce système de projection "Miracast".
4,La utilizzo molto per collegare il mio PC proiettori / monitor quando sono in viaggio per lavoro e funziona quasi sempre al primo colpo.Prima di acquistare però valuta bene cosa ti serve:1)NON è un dispositivo per lo streaming non è pensato per trasmettere Film o serie TV2)NON è compatibile con Windows 7 (Windows 8 non ho avuto modo di testare)3)OTTIMO per trasmettere lo schermo del PC Windows 10 per presentazioni o brevi video4) OTTIMO per condividere lo schermo dello smartphone con un proiettore (anche con audio)P.S. Il prezzo non è proprio competitivo...
5,Très bon rapport qualité prix pas toujours évident pour des produits de la marque Microsoft. Utilisé et testé tout de suite j'ai un souci de taille d'écran je vais regarder car cela doit être juste une manipulation à faire. Facile à installer et reconnu par les 2 appareils de suite... Terminé les fils qui traversent mon salon. Je suis conquise ! Merci
3,Kann ich nicht gut verwenden
4,Connexion super simple avec Smartview (tablette et telephone samsung).Avantage par rapport aux autres solutions existantes (Appletv chromecast ...) c'est que l'on a pas besoin de connexion internet !!! Pratique notamment en déplacement/vacances quand l'accès internet se fait via une page de connexion propre à l’hôtel et qui ne permet donc pas de connecter d'équipement type chromecast et AppleTV. Alors qu'avec ce produit cela fonctionne sans problèmePoint négatif: vos appareils doivent disposés de la fonctionnalités screen miror smartview ou équivalent (ex: connexion impossible avec téléphone samsung J06 2016 alors que connexion sans soucis avec samsung s8 ou tablette galaxy tab S)
5,Erfüllt genau den Zweck der Übertragung wofür ich den Artikel gekauft habe.
3,Cet adaptateur est prévu pour effectuer l'affichage des scores lors de compétitions sportives.Par contre inutile pour des vidéos et photos. La qualité est médiocre.Le câble "HDMI" ou "VGA" reste plus performant.
4,W il Warehouse Deals a prezzo pieno non l'avrei mai comprato. Fa il suo dovere peccato che se vogliate cambiare il metodo di collegamento "in corsa" poi mi tocchi sempre riavviare il PC perché non me lo individua subito di nuovo.
5,Items for Business and a great assett
5,Irgendwie war ich es leid bei Vorträgen lange Kabel durch den Raum zu spannen über die immer mal wieder jemand stolperte. Das muss doch mit meinem neuen teuren Lenovo X1 mit WiGig besser zu machen gehen. Dieses Tablet mit Funk-Dockingstation für ein heiden Geld kann tatsächlich zwei 4k Monitore per Funk betreiben. Warum sollte das nicht auch per Adapter am Beamer klappen? Eine zweite  WiGig Station für 250 EUR wollte ich für die Arbeit nicht kaufen denn die anderen Gimmicks brauch ich da nicht wie USB 3.0 LAN Anschluss usw.Allerdings gibt es Lenovo gar keinen einzelnen Adapter. Was tun? Irgendwie bin ich nach einiger Suche über die kabellose Funkübertragung von Microsoft gestolpert. Ich hatte hier auch noch mal gefragt ob der X1 das überhaupt beherrscht. Wusste keiner genau. Nun jetzt ist klar jeder neuere Lap oder Tablet ab Win 8.1 mit passender WLAN Karte spielt mit dem Teil zusammen!Und nun zu meinen Erfahrungen. Der Adapter muss an einem HDMI Port am Beamer betrieben werden der KEIN HML kann. Fragt mich nicht warum. Glücklicherweise hat der Acer zwei HDMI Ports und an einem funktioniert es sehr gut. Wichtig ist bei dem Microsoft Adapter außerdem das man noch einen USB Port daneben hat zwecks Stromversorgung (was der HML Port eigentlich eingebaut hat).Einstecken am Beamer am Tablet "mit drahtloser Anzeige verbinden". Dann wird ein paar Sekunden gesucht und der Adapter taucht in der Liste auf. Achtung das funktioniert NUR wenn der Beamer eingeschaltet ist und der Adapter mit Strom versorgt wird via USB!Dann klickt man den Adapter an und wartet. Der Acer meldet dann erst mal hat nicht geklappt das Tablet rödelt aber weiter und dann steht eine stabile saubere Verbindung in HDready also 1280x800 Pixeln. Auch bei Videos in dieser Auflösung gibt es keine Probleme. Ob es auch mit fullHD klappt werde ich noch testen.Bis dahin gilt die Wertung: ist sein Geld wert und vereinfacht das Leben eines Dozenten ein klein wenig.
5,Non appena ho ricevuto il pacco dalle mani del postino (spedizione amazon prime 1 giorno: eccellente) ho subito collegato il dispositivo alle prese HDMI e USB del mio televisore full hd e senza scaricare alcun firmware o installare alcuna app ho ottenuto con successo il mirroring dello schermo dei miei due tablet sullo schermo del televisore utilizzando la modalità "Smart View" dei tablet. C'è sì un leggero lag tra lo schermo del tablet e quello del televisore ma abbondantemente inferiore al mezzo secondo (un paio di decimi di secondo al massimo). Il trasferimento dell'audio è altrettanto buono e ho potuto verificarlo sia con un video realizzato da me sia con un video preso a casaccio da youtube. Per quanto riguarda la risoluzione gli schermi dei miei tablet hanno un rapporto di 4/3 che tale rimane anche sullo schermo del televisore. Quando il tablet è orientato con lo schermo orizzontale l'orientamento viene mantenuto sullo schermo del televisore: compaiono due strisce nere ai lati di quello che rappresenta lo schermo del tablet e quindi si ha anche un inevitabile calo di risoluzione che dovrebbe passare dai 2048x1536 del tablet ai 1440x1080 del tv full hd. Non so se c'è la possibilità di avere una risoluzione maggiore ingrandendo parte dello schermo del tablet su l'intero schermo del televisore ma per quello che serve a me non interessa scoprirlo. Dovendo utilizzare il dispositivo su di una LIM che ha un cavo volante HDMI con connettore maschio all'estremità e non avendo la possibilità di utilizzare la presa USB ho connesso il dispositivo alla LIM utilizzando un connettore HDMI femmina-femmina e alimentandolo con la presa usb del carica batteria del cellulare. Anche in questo caso il risultato è eccellente. Per quanto mi riguarda sono molto soddisfatto. Spero solo che il dispositivo regga a lungo i ritmi a cui lo dovrò utilizzare.
2,Schnelle Verbindung übertragungsweite max 3m
4,I wanted a device that doesn't need Wifi to enable me to cast the screen (downloaded content) from a tablet to hotel TV on holiday. I'd already done research & knew lots of people said this device wasn't compatible to their Android tablet etc otherwise mixed reviews on performance. Upon receipt I found the device connected to my Surface & Windows phone first time but not my old Samsung SMT210 Galaxy tablet. Samsung support referred me to Microsoft who in turn pointed me to an article on their support page about compatible products. I decided I needed a newer tablet. I tried connecting a few different tablets without success. I did find one Lenovo Tab 3 Essential worked fine & subsequently purchased from Amazon. A little surprised to find that all the other tablets I tried would not connect Acer other Lenovo all Samsung tablets (wasn't able to try Fire). I've contacted Microsoft again & await a reply. With needs met I found the performance to be acceptable (you'll not get HD quality) & am happy with the purchase. Advise research before you buy in case of compatibility issues.
5,Habe mir den Adapter gekauft um Inhalte meines Laptop drathlos auf dem TV anzuzeigen. Ich habe das bisher schon über einen Chromecast gemacht da kann man im Chrome Browser den Monitor teilen. Es treten dabei aber bei Videos Zeitverzögerungen zwischen Bild und Ton auf die nervig sind. Auch ist die Bildqualität nicht berauschend. Mit diesem Adapter kann man den Bildschirm auf dem TV anzeigen lassen oder den eigenen Bildschirm erweitern (wie ein zweiter Monitor am Laptop). Bild Tonqualität sind super. Das Teilen wird von Windows 10 von Haus aus unterstützt (Win+K) mithilfe der kostenlosen Microsoft App habe ich ein Firmware Update durchgeführt und Hintergrund und Name des Sticks geändert. Der Stick passt bei mir super hinter den TV Stromversorgung durch den TV USB Port reicht für den Stick aus. Verglichen mit anderen Sticks die das gleiche können sollen aber recht teuer. Habe mich trotzdem für dieses Produkt entschieden da ich keine Lust hatte mich mit NoName Geräten herumzuschlagen - da habe ich in der Vergangenheit sehr Unterschiedliche Erfahrungen gemacht
5,Hat Dein Fernsehgerät einen freien HDMI-Eingang und einen USB-Anschluss? Dann hat der Kabelsalat ein Ende. PC- oder Laptop-Bildschirm drahtlos auf das Fernsehgerät oder den(Großbild)Monitor übertragen? Kein Problem. Filme ohne Verkabelung von PC oder Laptop am Fernsehgerät abspielen? Geht problemlos. Auch für Präsentationen bei Kunden bestens geeignet. Ich bin begeistert.
4,Das Gerät kam schnell und sicher bei mir an.Neben meinem Ipad das ich über einen Apple TV spiegle habe ich noch ein Surface pro 5 für meine Arbeit. Da ich nicht immer mit einem Kabel arbeiten wollte hatte ich den Adapter geholt.Die Einrichtung ging wirklich schnell und lief auch ohne Probleme. Man merkt beim Bild eine kleine Verzögerung die zwar bei Präsentationen  ich stört bei schnellen Videos aber auffallen kann. Wichtig zu wissen ist dass der Adapter irgendeine Art von Stromquelle durch den USB-Anschluss braucht sonst läuft gar nichts.Insgesamt aber ein gutes Produkt das eine einfach kabellose Übertragung ermöglicht.
5,Forget the crappy Chinese competitors with all their bits and pieces that won't even power themselves off the USB port on your TV/monitor annoying software you have to download that doesn't work half the time and require an external wired connection anyway which kind of defeats the object.Very compact and discrete no extra software needed (though you can update the firmware from Microsoft) plug and play connects in seconds perfect picture and sound quality no lag jitter or dropouts. Don't believe the naysayers who obviously have problems with their hardware or Wi Fi signal.Does cost a few bob extra but well worth it if like me you you want to say goodbye to an HDMI cable trailing across the floor every time you want to watch media on the big screen from your laptop or just the annoyance of constantly having to plug and unplug it which eventually will knacker the port.
4,Facile a utiliser
3,Confezione: manualetti inutili adattatore USB-HDMI (lungo 40cm 30cm di cavo + 10cm dei 2 connettori) prolungone USB da ben 16cm (sfruttabili 12cm!!!!!!!). Veramente poco per la cifra che sfiora i 60€.Perché ho acquistato questo adattatore?1-ovviamente perché possedendo Notebook e tablet 2:1 Windows ero stanco di collegare e scollegare cavi ai vari monitor e/o TV con l'enorme limitazione della distanza PC-monitor;2-perchè ero stanco di girare con un parco cavi scomodo e pesante (HDMI DisplayPort miniDisplayPort);3-perchè possiedo già Chromecast 2 (ne riparliamo dopo.....)Il funzionamento è semplice: si collega ad una porta HDMI e ad una porta USB per l'alimentazione fine. Ci si può già collegare col proprio dispositivo Windows: si attiva il WiFi si preme "connetti" nel centro notifiche Windows 10 e si individua l'adattatore Microsoft; a questo punto si sceglie l'opzione preferita (duplica schermo estendi schermo solo schermo secondario ecc).Provato con Surface Pro (primo modello) ed un vecchissimo LCD LG non ho avuto problemi di accoppiamento ma ho verificato parecchi artefatti e lag quindi non molto fluido.Ho anche scaricato dal Windows Store l'apposita applicazione "Microsoft Wireless Adapter" la quale mi ha permesso di regolare l'immagine e di impostare la lingua italiana ma nulla più; i lag sono rimasti.Gli aspetti migliori sono:-) funzionamento WiFi Direct OFFLINE senza alcuna necessità di essere collegati ad internet;-) funzionamento con std Miracast quindi Google e produttori Android permettendo si può effettuare il mirroring anche con device Android (cosa che ho verificato con successo con un LG G2 e un tablet Asus Z300CG).E riprendiamo il punto 3 sopracitato: volete prestazioni ottimali con Android quindi anche con i servizi Google (play film ad esempio)? Non avete alternative: tocca acquistare anche Chromecast  poiché Google se ne frega di Miracast tanto da impedire la riproduzione dei suoi servizi su tali adattatori (e altrettanto Microsoft non si sogna lontanamente di "vedere" Chromecast)......... e va bene (si fa per dire). Ma perché Chromecast deve per forza funzionare solo ONLINE???? Per fare un mirroring ho bisogno di una connessione internet?? Già..... niente WiFi Direct a mio avviso assurdo.Sul lato costi l'adattatore Microsoft costa uno sproposito; almeno Chromecast costa 39€ (ma stranamente si trova in tutti i negozi fisici a prezzo imposto stile monopolio e non  si trova neppure su Amazon......mah) e fornisce anche la possibilità di alimentarlo via microUSB con alimentatore fornito nella confezione.Concludendo:  tocca averli entrambi = consumatore sempre mazziato............
5,Je déteste les rétroprojecteurs : images déformées couleurs non conforme…Si vous souhaitez projeter une présentation sur un écran de télévision  ou vous débarrasser de la filasse qui encombre votre salle de réunion ce produit est fait pour vous.Il suffit de disposer d'un port HDMI et d'un port USB sur la TV (ce qui est le cas de tout les téléviseurs à écran plat) et d'un ordinateur ou smartphone compatible Miracast.L'installation est simplissime il suffit de brancher l'adaptateur sur les prises HDMI et USB.Microsoft inclut même dans le package une rallonge USB pour pallier à un éloignement trop important entre la prise HDMI et la prise USB.Sélectionner ensuite le bon port HDMI comme source sur votre téléviseur.Connectez vous instantanément ou presque avec votre PC sous Windows 10. Si le dongle n'est pas reconnu immédiatement il suffit de faire un petit tour dans les paramètres d'affichage.Avec ma Surface Pro 4 la projection de PowerPoint et de vidéos est parfaite sur un écran 4K de 65" jusqu'à une distance de 12 mètres.
5,J'attends avec impatience un modèle avec batterie qui permettrait de s'affranchir de l'alim USB pas toujours accessible à proximité immédiate du vidéoproj.L'utilisation et le paramétrage sont  simplissimes : contrairement à d'autres sytèmes inutile de gérer une connexion au WiFi existant.- Brancher la fiche HDMI sur le Vidéoproj- Brancher l'USB sur un port USB alimenté ou à défaut sur un chargeur de téléphone par ex. L'écran affiche le logo windows et est en attente- sur l'ordi sous Win 10 cliquer sur l'icône notifications (barre des tâches en bas à droite > Projection > connecter à un dispositif sans fil. Choisir dans la liste votre appareil. L'écran affiche qu'il se connecte à votre ordi.- Il n'y a plus qu'à indiquer au PC de fonctionner soit en mode étendu soit en mode recopie d'écran.Le tout prend 1 à 2 minutes difficile de faire plus simple.Avantages du système : simplicité de paramétrage et de connexion surtout si on est amené à changer souvent de lieu de projection.Inconvénients : ne marche que sous windows contrairement à d'autres systèmes plus compliqués à gérer.Excellente fluidité de l'image le système est très réactif.
5,Soy profesor y necesitaba deshacerme de los cables pues la instalación no estaba muy bien pensada y éstos eran muy cortos. Me veía obligado a permanecer en un lateral sin poder mirar directamente al alumnado. Hace ya bastante tiempo que estaba mirando toda clase de dispositivos que me permitieran alejarme de esa esquina y al mismo tiempo que fuera independiente de la Wi-fi del centro (servidor Radius que funciona con certificado de seguridad).Probé el ChromeCast conectándome a un modem-router 4G de viaje pero sin tarjeta sin conexión a Internet solo con la función de router. Comprobé que no podía usarlo sin estar conectado a Internet por lo que lo descarté enseguida (además no conseguía que la resolución fuera la idónea).Con Roku pude transmitir la imagen sin estar conectado a internet pues no realizaba la comprobación pero el lag era terrible. Tenía que mirar a la pantalla del ordenador directamente porque si miraba a la proyección había un gran desfase.También probé el ActionTec Screenbeam pero con muy malos resultados (cierto que no probé las últimas versiones). Se conectaba a través de Wifi-Direct por lo que no necesitaba el router (ventaja que no pude aprovechar).Finalmente llegué a la versión 2 del dispositivo de Microsoft y estoy muy contento con su rendimiento. El lag es mínimo y no necesito nada más. Puedo proyectar video con audio sin problemas y puedo configurar el zoom y la seguridad del dispositivo con su aplicación. Decir que la imagen va a a parar a un proyector VGA por lo que tuve que comprar también un convertidor HDMI to VGA y un conector hembra-hembra HDMI para enchufarlo más un cargador microUSB doble para el convertidor y el Wireless Display.Todo perfecto. Recomendado.
5,Fonctionne parfaitement et simplement avec Projecteur Xgimi Halo + Samsung tablette A6 et Samsung S10Permet de répliquer l'image sans Wifi externe connecté à internet.l'Ecran du périphérique doit rester allumé sinon l'image se coupe. C'estHyper simple à installer.Suffit juste d'utiliser le smartview sur la tablette et le téléphone.J'ai pas essayé avec Windows mais j'imagine que ça marche aussi parfaitement
5,Like a fool I’ve had this in my basket for years occasionally seeing the price drop to a more respectable figure but still not taking the plunge.Working from home and having the need for a dual / triple screen set up but not having a laptop powerful enough I have tried multiple other options including a fire stick.This is a simple plug and play option and makes having an additional screen quick and easy!Need another screen? Get this!
5,Ottimo prodotto. Ne avevo già provato un altro della NetGear e non posso lamentarmi delle prestazioni. Consente a qualunque dispositivo che supporta il Miracast di estendere il proprio display (video e audio) sul dispaly a cui si collega questo adattatore Microsoft. Ne ho provato il funzionamento con vari sistemi operativi per SmartPhone: Windows Mobile e Android (versioni non troppo vecchie) e funziona bene. Dovrebbe funzionare anche con iOS di Apple (non l'ho provato). E ho esteso il desktop del mio tablet con Windows 8.1 e del mio laptop con Windows 10 usando il display come secondo schermo collegato in WiFi.Per utilizzarlo da smartphone tablet laptop PC occorre che il computer/device abbia il WiFi attivo (anche se non collegato ad una rete). Verrà creata una connessione punto-punto con l'adattatore Microsoft collegato al display per il trasferimento dei dati audio-video.Troppi device che utilizzano la stessa frequenza di trasmissione potrebbe ridurre le prestazioni e determinare un effetto video "a scatti" (esperienza avuta guardando la TV con la app RAI sul mobile collegato WiFi al display mentre sulla stessa frequenza il PC collegato in WiFi ad Internet scaricava dati) o far saltare l'audio (esperienza avuta con Spotify).Si avvia rapidamente il software di gesione per gli update è disponibile anche via app per SmartPhone. Molto comodo.Il fatto di avere in pochissimo spazio sia la componente che si collega alla porta HDMI del display sia la componente che si collega alla porta USB per l'alimentazione rappresenta sicuramente un plus.Non collegabile a display di vecchia generazione che non hanno porte USB a meno di avere una presa elettrica con adattatore USB e probabilmente un cavo USB di prolunga.
5,Performs fairly well. Every now and then I get a 1/2 second freeze but nothing major or that I can't live with.When I first tried it I couldn't get it to connect to my Dell laptop (4k display). I was about to return it when I decided to try it with a different laptop and it worked fine. I was then able to update the firmware and retried my Dell and it worked fine. Only small issue I have since is that it says Firmware update available but won't update = since it's working fine I am happy to bypass this firmware anyway.
4,Ich habe den Artikel bei einem lokalen Händler gekauft da ich ihn noch am selben Tag gebraucht habe.Ich bin sehr zufrieden. Die Übertragung ist sehr gut. Es ist zwar ein kleiner Lag bemerkbar aber der liegt völlig im akzeptablen Bereich. Cool ist dass sowohl Laptops als auch im Prinzip alle halbwegs aktuellen Android Smartphones den Stick unterstützen.Bei Laptops mit Intel Prozessor läuft alles "Out of the box". Bei Laptops mit AMD Prozessor (etwas älteres Modell) habe ich es mit einem Registry "Hack" zum Laufen gebracht. Vorraussetzung ist hier Windows 10:1. im Startmenü nach "regedit" suchen und öffnen2. An den folgenden Ort navigieren:"Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\ControlSet001\Control\Class\{4d36e968-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}\0000"3. und einen neuen DWORD-Wert (32-Bit) mit dem Namen ""DalWirelessDisplaySupport" erstellen. Diesen Wert nun auf "1" setzen.4. Rechner neustarten. Es sollte nun funktionieren.Ich habe nur zwei Probleme. Der Stick zieht dauerhaft etwa 260 mA. Bei 5V sind das 13 Watt. Er besitzt keinen Energiesparmodus. Es ist egal ob gestreamt wird oder nicht.Weiterhin hat das Bild irgendwie einen etwas grauen Farbton.Trotzdem kann ich den Stick wärmstens weiter empfehlen. Gerade für Präsentationen ist er unschlagbar.Per VGA konnte ich ihn mit dem folgenden Adapter an einen Beamer anschließen:     HDMI auf VGA Rankie Vergoldet Active HDMI to VGA Kabel HDTV Adapter Konverter Male to Female mit Micro-USB-Ladekabel (Schwarz)
2,Attention! Si vous achetez ce produit pour vous passer de votre câble HDMI afin de regarder vos videos en HD le débit wifi sera insuffisant pour une image fluide. Sur les traveling notamment l'image deviendra saccadée. Par ailleurs par rapport à un bon câble HDMI  de type  Audioquest comme celui que je possède l'image sera bcp plus terne.Par contre il sera suffisant pour diffuser  des photos ou autres documents non animés (et probablement aussi pour de la vidéo non HD mais je n'ai pas testé)
4,Works flawlessly!Didn't have USB port on my TV (it's my fault I should have checked it before I purchased) but managed to connect the USB to my phone charger fortunately my power plug is close enough to the TV. After turning it on white screen with Microsoft branding flashed immediately and within a minute it's ready to connect. I tried with my Lenovo laptop running windows 10 & android phone both had no issues in connecting.The video performance was quite impressive when connected to laptop no lag/delay even when playing 1080p videos noticed a slight lag/delay while playing high intensity game but that's nothing to do with the device - the technology isn't there yet that's it!Playing video from my android phone wasn't that impressive even with a normal you tube the screen rendering wasn't smooth but that's not an issue for me as I purchased this only to connect using my laptop. Overall this product worked exactly as I expected it without any hassle in connecting or setting up.BTW I used the Microsoft's "Wireless Display Adapter" app from windows store to rename & update the firmware of the device.
5,C'est pas donné mais ça fonctionne parfaitement depuis Tablette et Tel Samsung même sur télé ancien modèle doté d'une Prise USB et d'une HDMI.En revanche ne fonctionne pas depuis tel Xaomi
1,Jup. Verpackung schön. Sonst Null.Wollte auf TV streamen vom Notebook aus (ziemlich neu inkl. Win11 mit allen Updates). Chromecast vom Smartphone direkt auf den TV geht ohne Probleme. Wollte aber DVD auf NB abspielen und an den TV senden. Fernseher unterstützt Miracast direkt also ausprobiert: Verbindung klappt - aber Aufbau dauer eher lange (Entfernungen TV NB Repeater alle unter 4m!) und leider "ruckelt" das Bild auf dem TV während es zeitgleich auf dem NB (mirroring) ohne Probleme läuft.Also MS Adapter gekauft in der Hoffnung dass es damit besser klappt (früher war MS Hardware mal echt ne Klasse für sich). Fazit: Nix geht. Adapter wird gefunden aber Verbindung wird nicht aufgebaut kein Fehler keine Reaktion einfach "wird verbunden" und dann nix mehr. Ne sorry so wird das nix Leute. Das geht also wieder zurück. Dann stelle ich halt das NB direkt neben/unter den TV und schließe ihn stumpf per HDMI an. Kostet mich dann gar nix weil Kabel sowieso immer da sind.
3,Jetzt habe und benutze ich den MS Wireless Display Adapter bereits seit mehr als 2 Jahren. Verwendung findet er am MS Surface und von dort aus an verschiedenen Ausgabegeräten TV und Beamer.Wenn es funktioniert ist es super: ich kann mich mit dem Surface im Raum bewegen mit in die Gruppe setzen einen geeigneten Ort suchen - alles wird problemlos auf den Beamer übertragen. Um Filme mit Ton zeigen zu können und dabei den Ton an einer PA-Anlage auszugeben habe ich einen Splitter zwischen geschaltet der das Ton- und Bildsignal voneinander trennt - auch das funktioniert problemlos wenn es funktioniert.Und eben da liegt das Problem: "Wenn" es funktioniert.Leider gibt es immer wieder die Moment in denen es eben nicht funktioniert und das auf verschiedene Weise und kaum reproduzierbar:Manchmal kommt die Verbindung überhaupt nicht zustande d.h. es erscheint auf dem TV/Beamer nichtmal das Anmeldebild.Manchmal erscheint zwar das Anmeldebild aber das surface findet den Display Adapter trotzdem nicht.Manchmal finden sich die beiden nach dem Klick auf "Verbinden" ändert sich auch das Bild aber die Verbindung kommt trotzdem nicht zustande.Manchmal ist die Verbindung doppelt hergestellt und funktioniert deshalb nicht.Manchmal steht die Verbindung und bricht dann zusammen.Das ist leider sehr unbefriedigend.Es ist unzuverlässig.Ich benutze es weiter weil ich geduldig bin. Und weil mir die Technik an sich gefällt. Und weil ich in meinen Präsentationen durchaus auch mal humorig über die Technick schimpfen kann und nicht immer auch auf die Präsentation angewiesen bin.Und manchmal bin ich froh dass ich auch noch ein ordinäres Kabel dabei habe um das surface rasch doch per Kabel an den Beamer anschliessen zu können.Das ist meine Erfahrung.
3,Nach endlosem Ärger mit verschiedenen MiraCast-Geräten (TrekStor und Lenovo Tablets mit Asus-Dongles) habe ich versucht das Problem zu lösen indem ich Geld draufschmeiße und mir ein MicroSoft Surface (mit Windows 10) geholt und dazu das aktuellste MicroSoft-Dongle. Alles aus dem gleichen Stall sollte sich ja eigentlich vertragen oder?Falsch. Die Ergebnisse sind etwas besser als mit günstigeren Geräten aber *weit* von stabil entfernt. Ich habe einen ganzen Tag lang die lächerliche Troubleshooting-Seite von MicroSoft abgearbeitet (alleine Treiberdownload für 2 Stunden mit sagenhaften 80kB/Sek) und natürlich keinerlei Verbesserung erreicht: Treiber aktuell Firmware aktuell alles nach Vorschrift und die Verbindung reißt alle 5-10 Minuten ab.Am Arbeitsplatz mit Dutzenden von Smartphones mit ihrer eigenen WLAN-Verbindung kann ich ja noch verstehen dass dieser Frequenzsalat zu Problemen führen kann aber im heimischen Testbereich habe ich nur ein einziges WLAN auf voller Sendestärke und das DECT ist nicht mal auf Sendung so lange das Telefon nicht benutzt wird - an Interferenzen sollte es also nicht liegen?? Ich habe beide Frequenzbänder für den WLAN-Adapter aktiv (Standardeinstellung) und freie Sichtlinie vom Tablet zum Dongle bei weniger als 3 Metern Entfernung. Vielleicht liegt's ja mal wieder an Windows selbst denn das System scheitert ja immer wieder an seinen eigenen Updates - nachzuschlagen im Updateverlauf in der Systemsteuerung.Interessanterweise habe ich auch herbe Unterschiede je nach verwendeter USB-Stromquelle für das Dongle feststellen können: 2 USB-Netzteile mit exakt identischen Spezifikationen (5V 1A) führen bei mir zu deutlich unterschiedlicher Stabilität der Verbindung. Tja liebe MicroSoftler das passiert wenn der Hersteller es nicht gebacken kriegt ein geeignetes Netzteil beizulegen! Es ist hinlänglich bekannt dass die Stromstärke von USB-Ports massiv variiert da wäre das Mitliefern eines *funktionierenden* Netzteils mal echt sinnvoll!Eigentlich wollte ich beruflich mit diesem Setup arbeiten aber da muss ich das Tablet wohl doch wieder an die Leine nehmen was meine Möglichkeiten drastisch einschränkt. Drei Sterne lediglich weil die manuelle Neuverbindung nach dem Abriss meist halbwegs zügig klappt. Das Asus-Dongle das ich getestet habe kriegt noch nicht mal das hin und musste sich mit einem Stern weniger zufrieden geben.FAZIT: Ich bin enttäuscht wie mies Drahtlosvideo unter Windows momentan (noch?) läuft. Da kann man leider nur Apple empfehlen denn Apple TV funktionert wenigstens stabil.
3,Wollte kein HDMI Kabel in mein Wohnzimmern verlegen und habe diese Lösung gesehen.Naja zum surfen reicht es vollkommen und für Office Arbeiten aber beim Zocken leiden die FPS und das Bild wird am Rand teilweise Grün.Also eine Lösung fürs Gaming
4,(AGGIORNAMENTO.: amazon video non e più supportato con le nuove protezioni drm) Premetto che: l'ho provato su 2 diverse tv sia con lo smartphone android (ovviamente dotato della funzione miracast) che con il pc windows 8.1 a non piu di 3 metri di distanza senza ostacoli..Con smartphone (lg g5): provato con videoimmagini e un gioco..nessun problema connessione fluida.Con pc: desktop foto e film Buono! forse solo un poco di ritardo nei film sul tv rispetto a quello che si vede sul pc ma non e rilevante osservando solo la tv. PERÒ provando poi con un gioco questo ritardo si fa notare sopratutto quando ci sono azioni veloci che si devono premere molti tasti velocemente..e spostamenti veloci delle inquadrature tende a sgranare l'immagine.o addirittura a perdere la connessione..e a rallentare il tuttoCONCLUSIONE..se la volete per un uso esclusivo di giochi pc con grafiche ad alto livello la escluderei..non per il modello in se che e ottimo.."ma proprio come tecnologia in questo caso il "vecchio" cavo hdmi rimane il migliore..Ps: mi e capitato di leggere in altre recensioni c'é chi trova lag anche solo nel muovere il puntatore del mouse o altre semplici operazioni forse ha un problema di interferenza con qualcosa..questo a me non succede..
5,Fácil de instalar y se ve perfecto. Negativo el precio elevado. Pero lo vale.
5,Ich habe ein Appletv3 ein chromecast gen2 und nun den Microsoft wireless Adapter.Vorteile des WLAN Adapters ist eine echte Bildschirmübertragung als zweiter Bildschirm. Es ersetzt vollständig das HDMI Kabel. (außer für 4k und Spiele ist alles Top) Chromecast und Appletv haben den Vorteil dass man sie auch mit Inhalten aus Apps (Netflix&Co) direkt bespielen kann.Aber das echte Bildschirm teilen ist auf wireless Stick wesentlich besser sauberer und flüssiger als bei Chromecast und das Verbinden ist viel schlanker.Mit dem AppleTv gibt es so oder so keine gut funktionierende Lösung dafür.BildqualitätTop wenn keine schnellen Bildfolgen wie bei Spielen übertragen werden müssen.EinrichtungSuper einfach. Einstecken am Laptop verbinden fertig.VerarbeitungSehr wertig aber sieht man ja eh nicht hinter dem Fernseher.PraxisIn der Theorie hört es sich gut an es laufen auch Filme flüssig der Ton wird übertragen und alles in guter Qualität. Ich hatte allerdings mehrmals ungewollt eine abgebrochene Verbindung allerdings nie wenn ich daran gearbeitet habe sondern immer nur wenn ich mal die Finger weg hatte. Filme liefen bis jetzt immer durch. Hier gab es nie Probleme.Alles in allem: Klare Kaufempfehlung.
5,I bought  this so i could give presentations form my Tablet which had no HDMI / USBC outlet. All tht online advice told me i had bought an inferior tablet  etc. Then i stumbled on this and now it solves everything. Flawless screen mirroring to any device with HDMI in. Runs from tablet Android phones etc. But not Apple - who cares!!!I used this when travelling on the road delivering training  but also to watch films on a hotel TV screen or show people the photo on my phone without crowding round a tiny screen. Such a greta and flawless versatile device.Its limitation is simply the quality of the display you are using it on - NON HD screens or projectors  sometime cant keep up and go pixelated - not a fault of tht device just the display being older tech
5,Habe erst über einen IT-Admin unseres Betriebes davon erfahren dass es einen solchen HDMI-Stick ausgelegt für Windows gibt. Privat nutzen wir das Ding nun fürs TV-/Film-/Serien-Streaming ebenso wie für Foto-/Videoshows privater Aufnahmen einfach von unseren Windows-Notebooks und -Tablets: Super einfach verbunden und schon geht es los mit Bild und Ton in einer Qualität die auf unserem 55-Zoll-Full-HD-TV und unserer 5.1-Surroundanlage keine Wünsche offen lässt.Unsere iPhones können damit zwar nichts anfangen - und umgekehrt aber das ist für uns kein störender Punkt weil an den Windows-Geräten alles benötigte/gewünschte an zu übertragenden Inhalten abspielbar ist und man das dann eh lieber eines dieser Geräte erledigen lässt. Am Hand würde man eher parallel noch etwas tin wollen wozu es dann die volle Funk-Bandbreite nutzen kann und sein Akku wird auch spürbar geschont.
5,Ich habe den Adapter gekauft damit ich kein Kabel unter dem Teppich und durch den ganzen Raum ziehen muss. Anspruch war: auf dem Fernseher Filme anschauen aber auch ab und an Spiele mit Freunden spielen. Deswegen habe ich intensiv nach einem guten Dongle gesucht wobei es einen geringen bzw. am Besten keinen Lag haben sollte. Nach einer langen Recherche habe ich mich für den MWDA entschieden. Dongle angeschlossen (auf 5V und 1A achten.. mein TV hat auch 05A USB Schnittstellen was zum Glück bei mir beschriftet wurde) und den ersten Test mit der Maus gemacht: ich konnte wirklich keinen Lag feststellen! Alles ganz flüssig und wie es sein sollte. Man sollte wirklich auf die 6 Meter Begrenzung achten. Mein Setup:- Samsung TV (ue32s6200)- ASUS WLAN Empfänger (PCE-AC58BT mit 802.11ac)- Entfernung ca. 4 Meter mit einem kleinen Schrank vor dem EmpfängerFalls ihr eine Entfernung unter 6 Metern habt und einen Dongle ohne Lag sucht dann greift zu!
4,L'adaptateur est très facile à installer : il suffit de le brancher sur un port HDMI et de relier la connectique USB à un port USB pour l'alimenter. Ensuite il suffit de faire "Connecter" sous Windows 10 cliquer sur l'appareil et c'est fait.En revanche si tout est simple d'utilisation je regrette la qualité de la transmission. L'image et le son sont nickel mais il arrive régulièrement que l'image ne suive plus : elle freeze une microseconde puis elle passe en accéléré pour rattraper son retard d'affichage. Rien de trop gênant mais ne comptez pas dessus pour du jeu vidéo. Et pourtant mon PC est à moins d'un mètre de l'adaptateur (branché sur un projecteur voir la photo). C'est ce lui coûte la cinquième étoile.
4,I bought it to use it instead of hdmi cable on my old TV. It works perfectly.Connection is simple and stable. TV can be used simply as additional monitor it does not only mirror the screen.However it is strange that when used with laptop the video and sound works fine but when used with my samsung phone or tablet the sound is not in line with the video therefore one star less.
4,Très bon petit récepteur Miracast fonctionne parfaitement sur les écran lcd tv ... Je l'ai acheté pour transmettre sur mes lunettes FPV Fatshark Transformer là il ne fonctionne pas ... Ecran rose et c'est tout ! Dommage. Je ne sais pas pourquoi car il est censé de fonctionner sur n'importe quel écran avec HDMI.Fonctionne parfaitement avec les autres écrans par contre. La latence me semble relativement faible qui est un bon point pour les jeux ou pour piloter (intérieur moins de 5m pas testé en extérieur).
5,Grund für den Kauf war daß ich eine einfache Möglichkeit gesucht habe meinen Fernseher mit Handy und Tablet zu verbinden. Für mein Online-Zoom-Training waren die Platzverhältnisse in meinem Büro wo ich über den PC zoome eher ungünstig. Der Tablet oder das Handy haben jedoch einen viel zu kleinen Bildschirm um in anderen Räumen aus einigen Metern Entfernung noch erkennen zu können was im Training vermittelt wird. Nach einigen Recherchen habe ich mir den Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter gekauft. Der Anschluss ist kinderleicht und alles funktioniert sofort einwandfrei. Dazu steckt man ganz einfach den HDMI-Stecker und den USB-Stecker in den Fernseher auf dem Handy oder Tablet wählt man Drahtlosprojektion - und der Rest läuft von selbst. Ich bin mehr als zufrieden! Absolute Kaufempfehlung!
5,Acheté pour palier à la piètre qualité de notre WiDi sur notre Android TV (frame rate aux fraises latence d'1s) : aucune déception la latence est très faible (une trentaine de ms) et le frame rate est proche de 60 images par seconde.A noter que ces performances sont bien entenu également dépendantes de l'équipement qui émet (dans mon cas un laptop moyen/haut de gamme)L'installation est très facile et même la mise a jour du firmware se fait sans problème.Seul bémol (si l'on peut dire) l'image est légèrement compressée ce qui se remarque parfois sur le curseur de windows... Mais c'est là un défaut vite balayé par toutes les autres qualités.
5,Hatte zuvor Erfahrungen mit einem sehr gut bewerteten Miracast Stick von einem anderen Hersteller gesammelt. Diesen habe ich aber nie zufriedenstellend ans Laufen bekommen.Deswegen habe ich den deutlich teureren Microsoft Adapter getestet. Am Ende kann ich sagen dass er mit einem Lumia 950 einem Surface Pro 1 und einem Surface Pro 4 problemlos zusammenarbeitet.Ein paar kleine Hindernisse hatte ich trotzdem. Von diesen möchte ich kurz berichten:Fehler: Bild auf dem Monitor hatte verfälschte Farben.Lösung: Hatte zwischen dem Adapter und dem Monitor noch ein HDMI Kabel als Verlängerung. Irgendwie entsprach das Kabel wohl nicht der HDMI Norm. Nachdem ich es ausgetauscht hatte waren die Farben in Ordnung.Fehler: Verbindungsabbrüche.Lösung: Habe mit der Wireless Adapter App aus dem Store ein Update des Display Adapters gemacht. Danach traten keine Abbrüche mehr auf.Fehler: Hohe Latenz zwischen meinen Mausbewegungen und dem Bild auf dem externen Monitor.Lösung: Eine richtige Lösung habe ich nicht gefunden. Es scheint mit dem "sendenden" Gerät zu tun zu haben. Die größte Latenz weist mein Surface Pro 1 auf das Lumia 950 hat nur eine kleine Latenz das Surface Pro 4 hingegen fast gar keine.Fehler: Nur eine geringe Auflösung möglich.Lösung: Auch dieses Problem hing mit dem schon etwas in die Jahre gekommenen Surface Pro 1 zusammen. Das Surface Pro 4 schafft mit dem Adapter auch Auflösungen von über 2000 Pixeln ohne Probleme.Insgesamt kann ich den Adapter absolut empfehlen. Ich hoffe ich konnte mit dieser Rezension dem ein oder anderen ein paar Tipps an die Hand geben.
4,Aufbau:-> Bild und Ton werden über einen 5x HDMI-Switch an einem Sony Full-HD TV-Gerät ausgegeben.-> Energie bezieht der Miracast-Adapter über einen USB-Port des besagten TV-Geräts.*-> Über Miracast angebunden sind ein 2017'er Surface Pro ein HP Elite X3 und ein Sony Tablet Z1 (Sony nennt Miracast hier Throw).Alle Geräte bauten im bereits ersten Versuch ohne zu Murren eine dauerhafte und stabile Verbindung auf und auch die weiteren Verbindungen waren ohne Beanstandung. Hierbei fiel mir negativ auf dass es beim ersten Verbindungsversuch keine Sicherheitsabfrage gibt. Ferner ist das Gerät wenigstens 1x doch recht warm geworden. Die "App" aus dem MS-Store ist übersichtlich gestaltet und wird für den eigentlichen Betrieb nicht benötigt wohl aber für Firmwareupdates und (Sicherheits)-Einstellungen.*Jene die über Abbrüche und/oder Aussetzer klagen sollten hier ggf. eine andere Energiequelle wie z.B. ein USB-Netzteil ausprobieren.P/N/K:+: Kompakte Gerätegröße.+: USB-Verlängerungskabel.o: Kann recht warm werden.o: Typisch Microsoft recht hoher Preis.-: In der Grundeinstellung keine Sicherheitsabfrage beim ersten Verbindungsaufbau.Eine Randnotiz:Auch wenn es vom Standard her wohl möglich sein soll so konnte ich unabhängig von diesem Adapter hier kein mit einem Kopierschutz versehenes AV-Material (z.B. Netflix Streaming) über Miracast übertragen werden
5,Très simple d'utilisation et très pratique !
4,Really like this product and it does what it is supposed to do most of the time.When we received it it would only work correctly with some laptops. Others would connect and then the unit would immediately reboot itself.We decided to upgrade the firmware which was easy enough just a little frustrating that we had to download an app from the store to do so.This meant that it worked on more laptops than it did previously but we then found another problem although not specifically with the device - some of the TV's we use looked like were not able to give the device enough power. The unit powered up and would allow people to connect to it but would then reboot.To solve this we had to plug it into an external USB wall plug and power it that way and since then have not had any problems.
5,I travel a lot and stay in a lot of hotels and wanted to use the hotel's TV's to watch my own content from my laptop. It has been perfect! I use the TV as extended desktop so I can watch anything I wish while working on the main laptop screen! You do get the odd stutter from time to time but it lasts for less than a second.You need to make sure that your wifi card supports wireless displays but most wifi cards made in the last 5 years should work.I've not noticed any real lag but you couldn't really game on the wireless screen due to the nature of the wireless technology but it is perfect for watching netflix/youtube/VLC player!I did own the first version of this adaptor but it used to drop out all the time and was a massive pain so I gave it to a friend but Microsoft has greatly improved it no end.Really would love to see TV's have these integrated into them in the future as it's made travelling a lot more enjoyable just remember to unplug it when you're done and not leave it in the hotel like I did loleasily a 5 out 5 for me!
5,Just arrived.  Bought to enable me to teach physics to my students using my Surface Pro 4.  Have just ran several tests using power point presentations and associated linked videos from a variety of online video sites (youtube vimeo etc)...All faultless straight out of box.Audio automatically routes to the wireless display adaptor (in playback devices it is labelled as Digital Output: MSDisplayAdaptor).  I bought a MPOW Bluetooth audio receiver to enable me to free roam with the SP4 and play video from anywhere in the class.  I can route the audio from video on the SP4 to the main speaker input in the room (using the Bluetooth audio receiver) or play it from the SP4 speakers easily (using volume control: Playback Devices).Downloaded the display adaptor app from the store and altered the adaptor name and upgraded the firmware to latest release...took around 60 seconds to restart.VERY slight time lag I could game on the SP4 with minimal issues.I can draw using the Surface pen without looking at the SP4 screen as lag is minimal so ideal for visual artists wanting to work wirelessly on a larger monitor/projector.After typing this I no longer notice the time lag....:) almost instant response.
5,Super Geräte  einfach zu verbinden (Software Im Betriebssystem schon vorhanden).Man braucht kein Wlan und muss das Geräte auch nicht Registrieren oder AnmeldenZum Verbinden mit dem Windows - Computer:Wischen Sie vom rechten Bildschirmrand nach innen und tippen Sie auf Verbinden > Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter. Wenn keine Verbindung mit dem Adapter hergestellt wird wischen Sie vom rechten Bildschirmrand nach innen und tippen auf Alle Einstellungen > Geräte > Verbundene Geräte > Gerät hinzufügen.Und schon ist mann verbunden ;)Zum verbinden mit dem Android - Gerät:Ziehe vom oberen Bereich deines Handys die Schnelleinstellungsleiste mit zwei Fingern nach unten und tippe anschließend auf Smart View. Das Smart View Suchfenster öffnet sich und sucht nach verfügbaren Geräten. Tippe in den Suchergebnissen auf deinen Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter.Und schon ist mann verbunden ;)
4,La connexion est stable et fonctionne bien.La prise en main est rapide et l'adaptateur fonction tout de suite.Testé en wifi direct sans box internet avec un windows 10 toshiba et un oneplus avec android 7.Les vidéos 1080p passent assez bien. Il y a un très léger décalage du son mais ne gêne pas. Pour les vidéos en 720p la connexion passe mieux. La musique passe très bien aussi lecteur foobar et fichier flac. Les présentations textes et autres fonctionnent très bien.L'adaptateur n'est cependant pas recommandé pour les jeux vidéo. Temps de latence important que ce soit sur windows ou android.Pas de différence constaté une fois mes appareils branchés sur la box internet.Les vidéos passent en général mieux sur vlc directement. Sur kodi le décalage semble important (surtout la navigation dans les menus).
3,It comes with pre-installed firmware 2.0.8350 which is known for having an extreme bug where you cannot connect to windows machines therefore you are unable to update the adapter. Otherwise it connects to android phones perfectly and has quite low latency which makes it possible for wireless movie share.
5,Excellent product but check your computer/laptop is able to output Miracast signals! it might be that your running windows which has the "connect App" but that doesn't mean the computer has the circuity to send a WiFi Miracast signal. I bought this Receiver along with an Anycast Receiver to compare them. The image quality is better on the Microsoft device than the Anycast device although the Anycast device does also link Apply products this Doesn't. IF your screen or projector doesn't have a USB socket (needed to provide power) then you will also need a USB PSU and a Male-Female extension lead (1m or 2m) as the cable on this device even with the 25mm extension is only about 150mm Long. The system is easy to set up there is a small time lag between moving the mouse and seeing the movement on the remote screen but nothing to problematic.So far I've only used these for PowerPoint Presentation I've not tried to send video but the Audio link works fine. So far I've not pushed to see how far this link will work but I've had a reliable connection greater than 30ft with a Wifi Route in the same space. Jan 2017 - Alan
4,Guter Miracast-Empfänger. Ich benutze ihn für mein Smartphone mit Samsung DEX.

5,Essentially this dispenses with the inconvenience of connecting an hdmi  cable from my windows 10 laptop to the TV which is limited by the length of cable.  It seems a touch pricey for what you get but It works really well.  For a non-smart older TV like mine you also need to connect the USB end of the device to a power plug with a USB connection.  To do that I had to purchase a USB extension cable to reach the nearest power plug.  An Amazon Basics USB worked well.
2,Ich habe diesen Adapter gekauft weil ich etwas namhaftes für die drahtlose Bildübertragung haben wollte. Zumal ich nahezu komplett mit Windows unterwegs bin auf allen meinen Systemen lag die Wahl eines Microsoft-Adapters nahe.Der Adapter wirkt gut verarbeitet und lässt sich sehr einfach handhaben. Es gibt keine extern anzusteckenden Antennen oder so was auch schon ein Vorteil gegenüber diversen "noname"-Produkten ist. Die Verbindung mit dem Bildschirm klappt absolut unproblematisch und die Stromversorgung ist leicht herzustellen. Mit einem Android-Gerät hat auch die Bildübertragung auf Anhieb anstandslos funktioniert. Daher gibt es bis hierhin von mir 3 Sterne.Leider kommen nun die negativen Aspekte.Ich habe mit mehreren Windows-Geräten (Win10 1909/20H2) einen Verbindungsaufbau versucht. Der Adapter wird in der Verbindungsübersicht sofort erkannt und man kann den Verbindungsaufbau starten. Allerdings kommt nie eine Verbindung zustande sodass man kein Bild übertragen kann. Die Grafikkarten und Netzwerkkarten aller Geräte bei mir sind Miracast-fähig. Mit anderen "noname"-Produkten klappt auch hiermit die Bildübertragung. Nur der Microsoft-Adapter verweigert sich. Ein Firmware-Update war für mich nicht möglich da dazu scheinbar eine aktive Verbindung benötigt wird. Auch das Durchführen aller Problemlösungsvorschläge des Microsoft-Supports hat hier leider keine Besserung geschafft. Da ein Microsoft-Produkt nicht mit einem anderen Microsoft-Produkt zusammenarbeiten kann muss ich hier leider nochmal einen Stern abziehen. Der Adapter ist so für mich leider nutzlos und muss zurückgehen. Sehr schade!
3,Eine unproblematische und einfache drahtlose Bildübertragung zum Beamer hatte ich gesucht und der Display-Adapter erfüllt das eigentlich auch sehr vorbildlich: einfach in den HDMI- und USB-Eingang gesteckt in Windows 10 mit Windows-Taste+P und "Mit drahtloser Anzeige verbinden" ausgewählt und zack ist das Bild da. Einfacher geht's nicht. Es gibt eine minimale Verzögerung die aber überhaupt nicht stört. Für Präsentationen Diashows und ähnliches ist es also super geeignet.ABER:Sobald man Filme oder Videos darüber übertragen möchte kommt es zu minimalen Bildrucklern. Sie sind nicht besonders stark ausgeprägt und beim flüchtigen Hinsehen wird man sie wohl kaum wahrnehmen aber schaut man sich einen Film an in dem sich etwas bewegt dann fällt einem sofort auf dass da irgendwas komisch ist.Die bisher im Netz kursierenden Notlösungen dafür sind entweder den USB-Stecker des Adapters an eine Quelle mit höherer Spannung anzuschließen die Bildwiederholrate zu ändern die neueste Firmware aufzuspielen und/oder das übertragene Bild nicht als duplizierte oder erweiterte Anzeige sondern als alleinige Anzeige zu nutzen.Alles ausprobiert nichts bringt Abhilfe weder an einem normalen Laptop noch an meinem Surface. Super schade denn wenn das Problem nicht wäre (und es besteht wohl schon seit der ersten Version des Adapters und bisher gibt es keine zufriedenstellende Lösung dafür) dann hätte ich ihn definitiv behalten.
5,when travelling. Easy to connect your phone or PC to an external screen for streaming or just as a wireless link. Doesn't work with iOS devices.
5,Bought this to replace my Netgear Miracst device which was awesome but sadly the USB connection was becoming a little dodgy through heavy use. This Microsoft Wireless adapter is the perfect replacement exceeding all expectations. I guess it should work well as I use it with my Microsoft Surface Pro 4 and thus both being Microsoft should work well together. I have also used it with a Samsung phone and also worked well. Video is almost perfect with rarely any stutter and for normal presentation work nigh on perfect. It is also neat and compact and simple to set up. Unlike a number of similar devices it does not require to be connected to your wireless network so is completely transportable enabling me to connect to any TV or projector via an HDMI slot and powering off any available USB slot or via an adapter. Sadly the only time it wont work is through a HDMI cat5/6 Video sender but I can live with that. After all I don't always need to project wirelessly just like the freedom it gives me when doing presentations and it looks very professional when I do.I highly recommend this device.
5,Mon téléviseur  PHILIPS 55POS9002 OLED 4K ne savait pas faire (enfin j'ai jamais pu réussir à afficher mon portable Win 10 dessus) maintenant il sait et c'est bien pratique ! Et ça marche avec tous les téléviseurs !Bien mieux que la fonction de casting de Google ("Caster" dans Chrome).Là tout l'écran s'affiche directement.Excellente portée 10 m facile !Je ne regrette absolument pas mon achat.Ce produit est vraiment de bonne qualité et je le recommande sans hésiter !📦✍😃 J'espère ne rien avoir oublié et que ce commentaire vous sera utile à l'heure du choix.Vous pouvez me joindre en passant par mon profil pour tout renseignement qui vous manquerait. Si je peux y répondre ce sera avec plaisir. 😊Merci à vous de m'avoir lu.
3,Die Idee ist gut: Den Adapter per HDMI einfach an einen Monitor/Projektor einstecken die andere Seite in eine USB-Versorgung dann einen beliebigen Rechner/Smartphone per WLAN verbinden und los geht's. Der Teufel liegt dann aber im Detail. Oft hängt ein Projektor irgendwo an der Decke oder ist sonstwie nicht direkt zugänglich sondern nur über einen bereitliegenden HDMI-Stecker. Aber Stecker des Adapters auf Stecker des Projektors geht nicht. Da braucht man eine HDMI-Kupplung. Die liegt dem Adapter aber nicht bei. Und wo soll ich die USB-Versorgung des Adapters dann anschließen? Selbst wenn ich HDMI direkt an einen Projektor anschließen kann meine Projektor hat nur einen USB-Mini Anschluss. Eine geeignete Stromversorgung hat man also eventuell auch nicht.Übrigens der Adapter meldet sich unter "Benachrichtigungen" bei einem Rechner/Smartphone an! Etwas ungewöhnlich und nicht immer leicht zu finden. Alternativ: [Windows-Taste] + [P] und dann [mit drahtloser Anzeige verbinden].Es ist verwunderlich dass der Adapter etwa 5 Watt verbraucht daher wird er bei Gebrauch ziemlich schnell warm um nicht zu sagen heiß. Wenn die USB-Verbindung nicht 5 Watt (= 1 A) liefert meldet sich der Adapter zwar unter "Benachrichtigungen" bei einem Rechner/Smartphone an aber es kommt keine Verbindung zustande.
4,It's is a very good gadget but it DIDN'T work with my Samsung 12.2 tablet on android 5.02.I tried a few wireless display apps but to no avail.It did work on an older Samsung tab using samsung's own screen mirroring settings without the need for a 3rd party app.It also worked fine on my Samsung  S5 2015 phone just not my 12.2 tablet.When using it with the old tab it mirrored the screen but I was missing a few mill off the top of the screen and it did not ask for any pin code.There was no missing chunk of screen when mirroring the phone.Also having  used it for about 20mins it got a bit hot.
5,Facile d'utilisation et pratique à emporter partout. Je recommande.
4,Ich habe mir den Microsoft Wireless Adapter primär für mein Surface Go geholt da ich öfters Präsentationen halten muss und somit nicht immer ein zusätzliches HDMI Kabel dabei haben muss / vor Ort benötige und mir keine zusätzlichen Kabel im Weg umgehen. Den Wireless Adapter einfach in das gewünschte Präsentationsgerät (Beamer Fernseher...) stecken und mit dem Laptop Surface oder Smartphone verbinden. Funktioniert einfach und zuverlässig. Ab und an verbindet sich das Gerät nicht sofort und ein zweites Verbinden ist nötig. Dies geschieht allerdings sehr selten. Die Bildqualität ist gut. Für die die öfters Präsentationen halten müssen ist der Microsoft Wireless Adapter eine echte Empfehlung.
5,I purchased one of these for myself then one for my Dad. I'm a tutor and hate being tied to Cables this enables me to move around the room. Image quality is good 99% of the time. I've used with amazing quality on some locations but have also had one day where the picture was fuzzy. This was using a 4k Television so I imagine the 1080p image was being stretched or there was some interference.I am really happy with this as is my father with his. Works really well with Powerpoint from windows 10 and android. I've also watched Netflix in Full HD with no problem.
4,You can nom see your computer-monitor on the TV. Great for films & fotos.It doesnt make the screen larger nor does it enable you to write mails from the couch but that probably isn't the intention either.There seem to be two options speed or quality. I choose speed as otherwise I get no picture.You need to be within a few less than say 6-8 m provided you have positioned the dongle in front of your TV - as described in the documentation.Summary: It works.TV with HDMI Computer with Win7 or Win10.
4,Besser als billige Chinakracher....wer billig kauftkauft 2x.Sehr gute Bild...Farb...Qualität bei VHD.Wesentlich weniger Bildruckler bei dynamischen Filmszenen jedoch noch immer deutlich zu sehen.Daher nicht wesentlich besser.Einfache Konnektion und leicht zu verstauenda nur 1-teilig.
5,Funktioniert super sowohl am Tablett auch als am Laptop. Ideal für Trainer um dem Kabelgewirr zu entgehen oder das Surface (oder Yoga oder anderen Convertibel) überall im Klassenraum mitnehmen zu können. Mit einer Whiteboard Anwendung auf dem Laptop ersetzt das auch den Overheadprojektor mit Folien - und dafür müssen a. nicht so viele Bäume sterben wie für 30 Flipcharts pro Workshop und b. Fotodoku ist supereinfach. Das würde auch mit HDMI Kabel gehen aber hängt mal Adapter + dickes HDMI Kabel an ein Surface und lauft dann rum ... und ich hab nie ein Stehpult mit und selten bei den Firmen.Bindet sich als zweiter Bildschirm ein Powerpoint Notizen Modus geht also.Videoübertragung mit Sound funktioniert. Youtube etc. geht HD Video nicht. Also zum Fernsehschauen bei mir zumindest nicht 100% geeignet Miracast halt.Tipp: Geräte beschriften dann bekommt ihr den beim Kunden hinten am LCD vergessenen Empfängerteil vielleicht sogar proaktiv wieder ... oder wenn der Kollege ihn "dauerausleiht" ...
4,Ich habe mir vor längerer Zeit mal einen Chromecast zugelegt und bin damit irgendwie nie so richtig zurecht gekommen und fand nervig das man immer Internet benötigt um ihn zu nutzen und hab mich mal nach einigermaßen seriösen alternativen um geguckt. Bin dann auf den Wireless Adapter gestoßen und ihn bestellt. In dem glauben die werden schon Sachen die funktionieren. Angekommen ausgepackt probiert. mein Laptop ließ sich nicht verbinden mein Handy jedoch ließ sich verbinden nach viel Probiererei dann mal nem anderen Laptop probiert beim 2ten Versuch ging es dann mit diesem.Nachdem ich die update Software auf dem zweiten Laptop installiert habe und das Update installiert habe konnte ich auch meinen Laptop ohne Probleme Verbinden.Fazit: schickes und zuverlässiges Produkt mit einigen Startproblemen der Ton ist bei mir nur fast unmerklich zum Bild verzögert.
4,Halloerstmal ist das wahrscheinlich die günstigste Lösung eine Bild-Verbindung zwischen zwei Endgeräten mit Windows herzustellen.Die Einrichtung und das Anbinden klappt super und der Preis ist auch dafür klasse.Ein Stern minus gibt es für die Abbrüche. Ich habe es vorübergehend in der Firma verwendet und hier gibt es immer mal wieder Abbrüche. Fazit: Für ein Gerät im privaten Bereich klasse Firmen sollten jedoch hierfür mehr Geld in die Hand nehmen.GrüßeKai
4,This was very quick to set up and works as expected.  Initially I was losing the edges of my screen (compared to what was visible on my laptop screen) but this was easily fixed once I had downloaded the associated app from the MS store.  The app enabled the firmware to be updated and also provided a slider to enable the user to adjust the display so that 100% visible.Lag not noticeable for my usage - replicating my laptop screen for work - not gaming.One thing to note is that I also had to purchase a right angle adapter for HDMI as there was limited space with the wall mounted LG screen.
4,Ich liebe diesen Adapter! Die Bildwiedergabe ist etwas verzögert ist mir aber egal da es trotzdem Synchron mit dem Ton verläuft. Ich verwende es zum Filme schauen und zum Unterrichten mit Stifeingabe über mein Tablet (Lenovo MIIX). Funktioniert bei uns auch mit sehr alten Beamern an der Schule solange der Dongle seine Stromversorgung über USB bekommt (mache ich dann öfter über Laptop).
5,Acquistato per trasmettere tutti i contenuti del Tablet o del notebook su uno schermo esterno (TV o LIM) dopo un primo istante di panico per quanto riguarda la connessione del primo ritengo sia un ottimo accessorio che svolge alla perfezione la sua funzione. Nel dettaglio: collegato ad un Notebook Asus Win 10 tramite la funzione Collega schermo wireless del PC - PERFETTO.Collegato ad uno smartphone Galaxy S5 tramite la funzione Screen Mirroring del cellulare - PERFETTO.Collegato ad un Tablet Samsung S2 con aggiornamento ad Android 0.7 tramite la funzione Smart view del Tablet - PERFETTO.Unica difficoltà: trovare la funzione Smart view che mi ha fatto disperare e che alla fine un operatore Samsung mi ha aiutata a ritrovare... nella seconda pagina del menu a tendina che si ottiene facendo scorrere la schermata dall'alto verso il basso... prima di dire che una cosa non funziona è necessario conoscere i propri devices...In tutti i casi sopra esposti ho provato a usare app di messaggistica o streaming di film senza alcun problema di qualità del segnale. appena ritornerò a scuola lo proverò sulla LIM. CONSIGLIATISSIMO.
4,Avec mon Lumia 950 ou mon PC Windows c'est un plaisir.L'affichage est rapide réactif s'il n'y a pas de source d'interférences entre l'adaptateur et la source je peux même passer des vidéos sans coupures. Une petite sensation de saccade de l'image parfois mais cela reste une bonne solution pour se passer d'un câble entre le PC et la télé.En revanche impossible jusqu'ici de diffuser l'image et le son d'une tablette ou un smartphone Android et ce n'est pas faute d'avoir essayé. Je précise que j'ai mis le firmware du périphérique à jour avec l'application Affichage sans fil disponible sur le Windows Store ce qui a bien arrangé les divers problèmes d'affichage rencontrés au début avec mon PC.
5,Purchased this as i didn't need any streaming services ala chromecast etc just a wireless hdmi lead replacement. It does pretty much exactly that plugged into a 15 year old flat screen the usb port on tv powered it fine so no need for a plug on win 10 you simply select connect from notifications box click the adapter and the desktop is on the tv in 30 seconds. You can then move it as an extended display to watch a video while still using laptop. The sound also goes through tv.The picture isn't as crisp as a hdmi cable but fine for me no noticeable lag even with a low power pentium  n4200.
4,Je cherchais un moyen facile de connecter mes pc et tablettes hybrides sous Windows.Le Wireless Display se comporte comme un cable HDMI faut juste aller le chercher dans les périphériques sans fil. Clone du bureau ou bureau étendu tout fonctionne.La qualité est similaire à un cable filiaire pour peu que la source soit dans les 5m. Il existe en effet une petite latence rien de grave pour la bureautique le surf ou le multimedia mais peut être un obstacle pour les jeux; mais ce n'est pas le principe de ce périphérique.J'ai eu quelques déconnexions intempestives 1 mois après l'acquisition sans remonter jusqu'au problème. La seule chose que j'ai vue c'est que ça s'empirait quand j'utilisais une souris bluetooth. Le conflit vient certainement de moi.
4,Pros and Cons.Pros.:Very good product and easy to set up.Cons.HP laptop does not connect I have two HP laptop both are not connecting.There is delay in screen and frame rate drope some times.How to set up:Connect HDMI to the tv and usb next to it so it will power it self leave it for 5 second.Use you phone for example samsung you can connect via smart connect.Windows 10 click on Action centre bottom right.Click on connect find the name of device and click it wil take few seconds and you will be able to see you windows screen on tv.
4,nach zwei Wochen hier die ersten Erfahrungen:Lieferung erolgte problemlos zwei Tage nach Bestellung obwohl diese erst nach Ostern avisiert worden war; dickes Lob für Verkäufer. Die umfangreiche Plastikverpackung von MS und der übergroße Umschlag irritieren etwas.Installation: an HDMI und USB am dreijährigen Philips-Fernseher angeschlossen wurde sofort als neues Gerät erkannt und ließ sich problemlos konfigurieren; am Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5. unter Android 5.0 Screen Mirroring gestartet Dongle wurde sofort gefunden und gepairt.. Videos werden in voller Auflösung ruckelfrei wiedergegeben.kleine Probleme:-  für ausreichende Lautstärke muß ich den Ton am Fernseher deutlich erhöhen. Hier habe ich noch keine Konfigurationsmöglichkeit gefunden liegt wahrscheinlich an meinem Gerät- manchmal bricht die Verbindung nach ca. 30 . 40  Minuten ab und Screen Mirroring muß neu gestartet werden nicht reproduzierbarer Fehler (WLAN läuft stabil und ist definitiv nicht die Ursache)
3,Tout est dans le titre le système est vraiment très simple.Je l'est acheté pour relier mon pc à ma télévision ce qui me permet de regarder tous mes films stockés dans mon ordinateur. Il reproduit à l'exact ce qui se passe à l'écran bureau fenêtre Windows films et même les jeux vidéos. Pour les jeux il y à cependant quelques latences mais pour les films c'est l'idéal !J'enlève une première étoile car la connexion est parfois laborieuse entre ma télé et mon pc il faut recommencer 5 ou 6 fois des fois. Après tout marche très bien. (Mon ordinateur n'est éloigné que de 4 ou 5 m de ma TV)La seconde étoile que j'enlève c'est pour le prix que je trouve un poil élevé pour ce type d'objet. Je l'aurais vu plutôt aux alentour de 35 - 40 Euros et non pas à 50.Produit que je recommande pour sa facilitée d'utilisation et du fait qu'il me soit vraiment utile pour regarder mes films. Attention tout de même aux connexions laborieuses.J'espère que mon avis vous auras aider dans le choix ou non de ce produit.
3,My TV unfortunately doesn't have Wireless Display capabilities but it does have USB and HDMI ports so just by connecting and configuring this adapter (which is easy to do) you can have wireless streaming from your PC to your TV or monitor. If you use Windows you can easily extend or duplicate your PC screen or just project to the second screen from the Operating System which is nice. The reason I'm giving 3 stars is because unfortunately the connection is not robust and it doesn't last for more than 20 min without me having to manually reconnect it again. Also although the range of the connection is quite reasonable (sometimes I stream from my Surface Pro 4 to my TV almost 3 meters away) the transmission stops if you move the computer or streaming device too much. For such an expensive adapter I would expect much more quality this rather resembles a prototype and not a seriously tested product.
5,Die Installation ist einfach und problemlos. Die Verbindung lässt sich bei Windows 10 (mit Tablet und Laptop getestet) völlig problemlos herstellen auch mit Android SmartView läuft alles reibungsfrei. Diese neue Version ist auch wesentlich vorteilhafter geformt als die vorige denn zwei kleine Blöcke mit Steckern lassen sich besser unterbringen als ein großer. Für den Fall dass der USB Stecker für einen Steckplatz zu klobig ist liegt eine kleine Verlängerung auf einen kleinen USB-Stecker bei. Die ist bei mir auch in Benutzung.An der Bildübertragung habe ich eine Kleinigkeit auszusetzen da Filme nicht unbedingt ruckelfrei übertragen werden. Auflösung Farben und Schärfe sind aber beanstandungsfrei.Für alle die den Adapter nicht vornehmlich zum Filme Schauen verwenden wollen gebe ich eine klare Kaufempfehlung .
5,UPDATE:Replacement arrived quickly and item works as expected no crashes or anything.First it is expensive for what it does. Bought one because our smart TV despite having Miracast and chromecast buil-in would not work well with one of our PCs but did fine with others. Was really happy with the item: build quality good but not premium it would allow to watch video in good quality without dropouts or disconnections with fluent picture experience. Some lag was present so definately the adapter would not do well for gamers. Setup was really easy and connection from a Windows 10 PC would take some 5 to 10 seconds. However after two days of limited use it broke. Simply it would not broadcast over wi-fi and the only thing on display one would see was a broken Microsoft startup logo on white background. Resetting the device did not help. Ordered a replacement and if it does not break I will give it a 5 star rating instead of 1.
5,This Microsoft display adaptor was bought to mirror cast my Amazon Kindle Fire HDX 7 to a widescreen TV.My Kindle HDX 7 tablet stopped mirror casting after Amazon updated the software on my Firestick TV Dongle.I investigated that Amazon in their wisdom tweak their own version of mirror casting ( Miracast) technology.Microsoft use the industry standard Miracast and it shows flawless transfer straight forward connections just as it should be.Problem solved my Amazon Kindle Fire HDX 7 tablet now mirror casts to TV trouble free - via the Microsoft Wireless Display Adaptor V2 .Conclusion:The Microsoft wireless adaptor V2 works as it should it does as stated on the box easy to set up and use.I bought the V2 on recommendations in other reviews apparently the performance is improved over the V1 and the size is smaller.If you need Miracast cast then this display adaptor is proven stable technology.  For use with all Miracastt enabled devices.
4,Plug and play hätte nicht problemloser laufen können. Ich habe vor Inbetriebnahme mit der Windows-App die Firmware auf den neuesten Stand gebracht zu mehr taugt die auch nicht wirklich. Ansonsten klare Kaufempfehlung wenn es nur darum geht einen Windows-PC auf den Fernseher zu bringen. Der Preis ist mit 45 € meines Erachtens grenzwertig die 80 € die hier teilweise dafür aufgerufen werden finde ich vollkommen überzogen.
4,Transmits video over WiFi Direct (does not require an intermediate router) to your TV . I use mine to transmit a full quality screen image from my Samsung TV . You require both an HDMI port and a USB B (for power) type socket on your display device and obviously WiFi on
4,Funziona molto bene l'unica pecca (anche se non è indispensabile) e che non ha istruzioni in Italiano
4,J'ai essayé ce dongle sur TV et projecteur avec un téléphone microsoft.Aspect physique très agréable. C'est aussi bien fini que les photos le suggèrent.Une petite rallonge USB est fournie en cas de besoin.Le tout est ergonomique très bien pour les nomades.La connexion est très facile avec le téléphone windows 10. A priori il en est de même pour les PCs windows 10 et les téléphones/tablettes Android.Il y a peu de latence et c'est assez fluide.Parfait pour les films ou les photos.A voir pour les jeux-vidéos...Pensez à vérifier la compatibilité de vos PCs/téléphones/tablettes avec Miracast.Mon PC et mes tablettes datant d'avant 2012 je n'ai pas pu les connecter :(
5,Ich möchte direkt vorweg sagen dass ein Einsatz bei Bewegtbildern nicht immer ideal ist. Ich würde es also niemandem empfehlen damit ein Tablet oder PC-Bildschirm zwecks Filmgenuss spiegeln zu wollen. Doch der Stick ist ebendeshalb für den Einsatz bei Präsentationen perfekt geeignet muss er doch in kein WLAN eingebunden werden. Während die meisten Sticks zur Bildschirmspiegelung voraussetzen dass sowohl Stick als auch Übertragungsgeräte in einem gemeinsamen WLAN sind verbindet sich hier das Ausgangsgerät direkt mit dem Stick. Man muss also wirklich nur den Stick in einen HDMI-Anschluss stecken und fertig ist. Wirklich sehr praktisch z.B. in Schulen wo kein WLAN zur Verfügung steht.
5,Refonctionne depuis une des mises à jour de windows 11
5,Bien utile pour eviter les fils disgracieux.. petit souci d'installation dû au maj de windows update qu il faut faire avant.. ça fait plusieurs mois que je l utilise et ça fonctionne très bien les seuls bugs que je rencontre sont surtout dû à ma wifi qui est de temps en temps mauvaise. Sinon aucune perte de qualité d'image et facile à utiliser. Par contre ça a tendance à chauffer un peu quand ça reste longtemps sur la télé donc je le débranche à chaque utilisation histoire qu'il me dure plus longtemps..
5,Compared with other models that try to do the same thing this is above and beyond seemless. So far it's pretty much plug and play from both my Sony Android phone and Windows 10 Laptop with both able to handle a half decent 1080p YouTube video and documents easily.One thing to note is yes the Windows store mandatory method for updating it of course didn't work but that's not really a suprise and the device works fine for now.Another thing is I'll admit the clarity of the video encoding on the TV is a bit rough in places. With some fonts appearing a bit jagged around the edges which is a shame. Personally that's fine for me although if I was to run a presentation I might want to use a cable simply for hi-def.
3,Souvent des problèmes de connexion il faut le débrancher pour se connecter…. On a remis un bon vieux câble hdmi…
5,Correspond tout-à-fait à mes attentes. Permets l'utilisation du mode Continuum ou la duplication de l'écran de son smartphone Windows sur un écran (TV vidéo projecteur) permets de dupliquer son écran d'ordinateur portable sur un écran TV ou un vidéo projecteur distant via "projeter/dupliquer". La mise à jour du micrologiciel fonctionne très bien grâce à l'application "affichage sans fil" du Windows Store (application disponible uniquement pour les ordinateurs pas pour les smartphones sous Windows 10 mobile). Ce dispositif prend peu de place. C'est un pois plume. L'adaptateur qui permet de réunir les deux cotés est pratique. Dispositif qui peut être très utile pour les professionnels (ou autres) itinérants. une source de courant USB proche doit être disponible. Dans le cas contraire il faut avoir à disposition un prolongateur USB.
2,Der Adapter ist an sich eine tolles Konzept und gut durchdacht. Ich nutze ihn nur um meinen Decken Beamer (etwa zwei Meter entfernt) an zu steuer.Das Aufsetzten der Verbindung ist unfassbar simpel und schnell.Für den Preis bekommt man außerdem keine Andern Produkte die in irgendeiner weise Hdmi Signale übertragen können.Mankos sind jedoch die nicht zu übersehende Verzögerung des Bildes (und Ton) sowie ein abscheiden des Bildrandes (die Windwos Taskbar ist beispielsweise auserhalb des Anzeigebereiches. Mega nervig).Das ätzenste jedoch ist die nicht zu verlässliche Verbindung. Wenn sich PC mit dem Stick verbindet bleibt diese Verbindung auch solide bestehen aber öfters werden wird die Verbindung nicht angezeigt und kann nicht gefunden werden.  Außerdem hängt sich während des Verbindungsaufbaus öft die Anzeige auf sodass ein kompletter neustart notwendig ist.Ich würd das Produkt nicht weiter empfehlen es hat dafür zu viele Mängel und arbeitet absolut nicht zuverlässilich. Auch ich greife daher regelmäßig auf ein normales Hdmi Kabel zurück die sind wenigestes störfrei und Funktionieren immer solide ohne Latenz.Leider ist die Technik scheinbar noch nicht so weit für den normalen Markt.
1,Der Win10 Laptop findet das Gerät das Gerät findet den Laptop. Verbinden? Unmöglich! MS empfiehlt Windows neu zu installieren und Firewall etc. zu deaktivieren. Ein Android-Gerät findet den Adapter gar nicht.Dieser Miracast-Müll scheint bei manchen Leuten zu funktionieren wenn es aus irgendeinem unerfindlichen Grund nicht klappt hat man jedoch verloren! Ausgereift ist jedenfalls anders. Ganz anders! Wieder 3 Stunden Lebenszeit als Beta-Tester verschwendet!!!!!!
5,Ich will mich gar nicht in zu vielen Details verlieren das haben netter Weise schon viele Andere vor mir getan. Somit nur eine kurze Zusammenfassung meiner Erfahrung.Gekauft habe ich den Adapter damit ich YouTube vom Smartphone auf dem großen TV übertragen kann. Genau diese Aufgabe wird durch das Gerät wunderbar erledigt. Den einen Stecker in den HDMI-Port den anderen in den Power-USB am Fernseher Miracast am Smartphone aktivieren Gerät wählen und schon steht die Verbindung.Aus Interesse habe ich auch noch einen Verbindungsversuch mit einem Windows 10 Rechner gestartet. Auch hier wurde die Verbindung sofort aufgebaut. Sogar durch eine Trockenbau-Wand hindurch. Was mir allerdings schon aufgefallen ist man sollte wohl nicht zu weit entfernt sein. Ich lasse das Smartphone auf dem Tisch vor dem TV offen liegen denn wird die Entfernung nur ein wenig erhöht hatte ich schon mit Rucklern zu kämpfen. Die Reichweite ist bei diesem Adpater also durchaus ein Thema besonders bei datenintensiven Übertragungen.
4,Der Adapter wurde wie bei Amazon üblich schnell geliefert. Die Verwendung (Anschluss und Kopplung) geht kindeleicht. Ich nutze es für Verbindungen vom Windows Phone und Microsoft surface Pro Tablett zu Fernsehern oder zum Beamer (für Präsentationen). Das klappt eigentlich sehr gut. Leider nur über kurze Distanzen. Bei wichtigen Präsentationen sollte man aber lieber noch ein Verbindungskabel dabei haben da die Drahtlosverbindung doch recht störanfällig ist. Deshalb auch nur 4 Sterne. Trotzdem würde ich es wieder kaufen. PS: Es wird am Gerät ein USB Anschluss für die Stromversorgung und ein HDMI Anschluss für das Bild - und Tonsignal benötigt. Falls bei älteren Geräten kein USB Anschluss in der nähe ist verwende ich eine kleine Handy Powerbox.
5,arrived quickly  set up to my big screen Samsung tv  from my Toshiba laptop plug the adapter into the tv HDMI and the USB  end into any USB port (5v supply) on your computer I have windows 10  click on action centre select pogect then choose  duplicate . when that is done action centre again click on connect then you will see come up MDA wireless adapter click on that and you are away.
5,I don't usually leave reviews but this device is amazing just plug in and start streaming. The update is a bit of pain to figure out using the windows app store but once done it was same.I would recomend this device to anyone wanting something simple with no fuss or thinking just plug in and it works
5,Brilliant stick I've broughtbut it seems to keep pausing and static even though the phone is right next to it that's the only frustrating thing about it..
4,Vor der Bestellung bitte darauf achten dass am Beamer ein USB-A-Ausgang vorhanden ist. Dieser wird vom Display Adapter als Stromquelle genutzt. Bei evtl. vorhandenen USB-B-Ausgängen sollte geprüft werden ob diese Strom liefern sonst ist auch ein Adapter von USB-B male auf USB-A female wirkungslos.Wenn der Stromanschluss vorhanden ist liefert das Gerät gute Bilder.  Voraussetzung dafür ist dann aber wieder ein Miracast-fähiges Sendegerät. Bei älteren Windows (z.B. Windows 7) muss dies ggf. erst umständlich hergestellt werden: Ersetzen des Netzwerktreibers Installation des nicht mehr regulär verfügbaren Intel Display Adapters.
2,Je l'ai acheté pour dupliquer une tablette (modèle récent: Samsung Tab S5e) sur une TV mais l'image est dégradée et surtout saccadée. Impossible de regarder un film avec cette qualité. Je la renvoie et j'achète un câble USB-C/HDMI normalement (j'espère) la qualité d'image devrait être satisfaisante.
5,Premessa: non mi serve per vedere film in HD.Il principale uso del dispositivo per me è quello di poter utilizzare lo schermo del 47 pollici come monitor del notebook via Wireless stando seduto comodamente sul divano distante circa 3m dimenticandomi della presbiopia :-)Il collegamento è immediato e non richiede particolari settaggi (almeno su windows 10)Il risultato è impressionante a volte mi dimentico di essere collegato senza fili il tutto alla risoluzione di 1080p (1920 x 1080).La risposta del mouse è immediata e il lag è molto basso. Raramente si può osservare qualche artefatto.Anche la maggior parte dei video su youtube non da problemi. Discorso a parte se si cerca di vedere un film in HD si nota una certa "scattosità".Vorrei dare 4 stelle a causa del problema appena esposto dei film in HD ma so che è dovuto principalmente alla tecnologia e non al hardware e inoltre come scritto in testa per le mie esigenze la visione dei film in HD non è prioritaria.Sicuramente è tra i migliori (se non il migliore) adattatore esistenti ad oggi Giugno 2016 nel mercato.
5,Macht was es soll. Also alles gut.
4,Utilisé pour dupliquer ou étendre un écran de PC fixe sous Windows 7 Pro 64 : Aucun problème de connexion en utilisant l'application Intel WIDI (Côté ordinateur il faut juste entrer un code qui s'affiche sur l"écran TV).Second test effectué depuis un PC portable sous Windows 10 : Aucun problème non plus la connexion est directe (Pas de code à entrer).Dans les 2 cas (W7 + Intel Widi ou W10 natif) la vidéo est parfaitement fluide et la qualité de l'image irréprochable. Simplement on peut observer un très léger décalage entre les actions sur le clavier ou la souris et l'affichage ce qui doit poser un problème aux joueurs...
3,... für den Dauerbetrieb an einem 2.Bildschirm an mein Surface Pro 7 angeschlossen finde ich das ganze etwas umständlich ... da ich mich jedesmal wieder neu verbinden muss ... sind zwar "nur" 3 Klicks aber das mehrmals täglich im 8 Stunden Betrieb wenn zwischendurch (Mittagspasue ...) runtergefahren wird. Ebenfalls sollte man wissen daß die Auflösung nur p1080 ist wenn man einen 2.Bildschirm mit höherer Auflösung hat (so wie auch das Surface) dann ist es eher negativ zu beurteilen wenn hier von einem MicrosoftZubehör fürs Surface gesprochen wird welches weniger kann wie das Surface! Es wird in der Beschreibung zwar auf die Auflösung hingewiesen ... ist aber dem unachtsamen oder unwissenden Käufer möglicherweise nicht ganz klar was das bedeutet! Wenn er bessere BIldqualität könnte dann 5 Sterne.
4,Fonctionne avec l'interface WiDi de ma tablette Toshiba Encore Write ainsi qu'avec la fonction "Screen Mirroring" (Miracast) d'ordiphones Samsung A5 2015. (Soit dit en passant Samsung a ôté Miracast des générations suivantes de ces ordiphones. C'est bien dommage.)L'image était un peu saccadée au début avec le WiDi et la tablette mais après avoir mis à jour le micrologiciel le problème semble avoir été résolu. Cette mise à jour se fait via le programme "Affichage sans fil Microsoft" disponible sur le magasin Windows Store (en anglais: "Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter").
3,Die Verbindung mit diversen Rechnern funktioneirt einwandfrei wer nur über den Adapter verbinden möchte erhält ein tolles Produkt.Für mein Zweck funktioniert es nur bedingt daher zwei Punkte Abzug denn man kann den Adapter nicht in Standby setzen kann der Monitor bleibt die ganze Zeit an....Das ständige "An sein" (über die USB Buchse) verursacht außerdem dass die Signalquelle vom Monitor geändert wird. Ich betreibe am Monitor auch eine Docking-Station über DP und wenn der Rechner in Stand-By geht aktiviert der Adapter den Monitor und die Signalquelle wird automatisch auf HDMi umgestellt.Nicht nur dass der Monitor anbleibt ich muss auch wieder manuelle auf DP umstellen wenn ich den Rechner an der Dockin-Station anmache.Werde mir nun einen USB On/Off Schalter zulegen müssen....
4,j avais des inquiétudes car mes écrans sont de vieux téléviseurs mais je confirme que cela marche parfaitement.L'appareil émetteur doit être "miracast "(ou disposer de l'application sur une version récente d' Android) mais pour le récepteur peu importe tant que les ports hdmi et usb sont présents.seul bémol le bout du câble chauffe énormément pendant l usage.j espère que cela ne posera pas de problèmes par la suite.
5,This is absolutely brilliant at treating my TV as a large monitor. I use it to follow church services broadcast on Facebook and/ or YouTube. By using it to extend my display I can follow what is happening on the TV whilst simultaneously reviewing messages and other things on the laptop display.
4,Conectarse a la pantalla sin necesidad de cables es muy cómodo. La calidad es obviamente inferior al cable (era de esperar) y hay cierto retraso entre el movimiento en el PC/móvil y la pantalla. El mayor problema es que en ocasiones se pierde la conexión y hay que reconectarse con la molestia que esto supone. Es un buen producto en general pero podría ser mejor sin los cortes de conexión y a mejora de fluidez aunque hay que entender que el wifi tiene sus limitaciones.
5,Permette di collegare pc compatibili a qualsiasi schermo o proiettore rendendolo wireless
4,ça marche avec mon appareil surface pro et l'écran facilitée d'utilisation mais il y à cependant quelques latencesidéal pour regarder films.
5,Great product works well in different situations.  This is the version 2.  Video image quality depends on device sending information.  Using older LCD projectors (prior to 2010) may prove problematic as they do not negotiate HDCP for this you need to use an HDMI splitter.  Later HDMI widescreen projectors like the BENQ W1300 work fine.Upgrades from MS are occasional but you need to be running Win 10 as the utility will not install with earlier versions.  The device will not upgrade by using the USB connection and must be done remotely with it plugged into an HDMI port on a TV for example.Uses two frequencies for working and does not require a local WiFi signal to operate.Buy with confidence.
4,Connexion facile entre ma télé et ma surface pro 7. Dommage que l'image ne reste pas active lorsque la tablette est en veille.Je n'ai eu un problème de lecture vidéo ralenti qu'une seule fois en un mois (utilisation tout les soirs)
5,As far as Miracast dongles are concerned this is probably the best. Compared to a Chromecast it does not appear to give the same quality of video images but when you consider that for a Chromecast to give that level of reproduction it needs an open local WiFi network it means the Microsoft adapter seems much better value. Casting from some android devices are more problematical than others. This is probably due to the switch in android OS from support for Miracast to WiFi direct. My Lenovo Tab 2 works perfectly my Cubot X18 not so much. I'm sure this is true across android. On Windows 10 devices when the drivers are updated the device works perfectly.
4,Ich nutze diesen Adapter mit dem Lumia 950 mit der neusten Windows 10 Mobile Preview Version. Konnte ohne Problem Videos und Musik über diesen Stick streamen. Leider werden momentan noch nicht alle APPs im Continuum unterstützt (z.B. Netflix). Bisher konnte ich auch nachstellen dass wenn es teilweise zu Abstürzen kommt (z.B. wenn ich die Deskop-Version von [...] aufrufe und mich einloggen will).Man kann zwar den Monitor auch spiegeln lassen dass ist aber nicht wirklich für Filme oder ähnliches geeignet da man dann auf der externen Anzeige den Inhalt des Handy-Displays sieht (Seitenverhältnis wie beim Handy).Ansonsten hat bis jetzt alles sehr gut funktioniert und auch die "Einrichtung" geht ohne Probleme.
3,Wenn man sein mobiles Gerät (Bei mir Handy oder TabletLaptop) mit dem Adapter verbunden hat funktioniert er Einwandfrei und auch mit guter Bild/Tonqualität.Es gibt jedoch bei mir ein großes AberEgal mit welchem Gerät braucht es bei mir in der Regel 3-10 Versuche bis die Verbindung steht. Ganz selten beim ersten mal jedoch auch manchmal noch länger.Abends im Bett kann ich das verkraften ich benutze den Adapter jedoch auch in der Schule um mein TabletLaptop mit dem Beamer zu verbinden.Wenn es dort 5 Minuten dauert bis die Verbindung steht habe ich eine komplett unruhige Klasse und viel Zeit verloren!Wegen der Probleme bei der Verbindung würde ich fast nur 2 Sterne geben da es wenn einmal verbunden jedoch einwandfrei klappt gebe ich noch 3 Sterne.Habe im übrigen 2 Kollegen mit dem gleichen Adapter und den selben Schwierigkeiten.
4,Fonctionne parfaitement avec Surface Pro 4 nécessite des pièces supplémentaires si vous avez l'intention de l'utiliser pour des présentations lors de voyages.Le câble USB pour alimenter l'appareil est beaucoup trop court l'extension USB de 10 cm incluse est une blague. Pour le prix je m'attendais à une alimentation USB externe et un câble USB de 15 mètre. J'ai dû acheter ces extra donc moins 1 point pour Microsoft.
4,Für Präsentationen ist der Adapter super. die Einrichtung/Verbindung ist in ein zwei Minuten erledigt.Für die Präsentation von Bild & Textmaterial ideal.Will man jedoch Videomaterial übertragen muss man mit Bildaussetzern und Verzögerungen rechnen.Bis 480p funktioniert es noch ab 720p aufwärts jedoch nicht mehr sinnvoll.Wer also vorhat über das Gerät ein Youtube Video einen Film oder gar ein Spiel zu übertragen muss sich weiterhin mit Verkabelung abfinden.
3,The maximum refresh rate it could do is 30Hz. There is lag whenever I play games(light) and also hd videos. Prefer cable instead this you could have full experience with cable. Lot to improves in these 1st Gen devices.It works alright for doing PPTs or word but not good for photoshops solid works or any design softwares
5,Produit idéal lorsqu'on veux dupliqué et utilise son téléphone sa tablette sur un écran plat...Installation facile un port usb et un port hdmi connections en SMART VIEW est le tour est joué.
4,Ziel: Bildschirm vom Laptop auf TV übertragen zwecks Abspielen von Bluray-Images über KODI da letzteres nicht auf den TVs direkt installiert werden kann. Getestet an zwei TV (Telefunken + Samsung) Entfernung ca. 3 m. Der Adapter wird von beiden TVs schnell erkannt das Verbinden geht ziemlich schnell. Videos laufen auf dem TV genau wie auf dem Laptop. Was etwas stört: der Adapter und der USB-Anschluß werden ziemlich heiß .
4,Works OK I use it to avoid having too much wiring in my home office and replace hdmi cable. Used with monitor and laptop within 60-90 cm.Had the issue with disconnecting every 10-15 mins plugged it in to a proper power source (phone charger) and issue dissapeared overall performance improved. (no cursor flickering no lag image quality improved)
4,I love it I am in a teaching profession. I do have to prepare some lessons on PowerPoint or other interactive board software. Well it enables me to mirror my laptop screen with my mini led projector. It changed my life. I don't need any cables anymore or work next to the projector. I can move around with my surface pro it gives me so much freedom! The only requirement  is to be connected on the wifi. Great product
5,Cumple con las expectativas es el dispositivo Intel WiDi/Miracast con el lag mas bajo que he probado es posible usar ratón sin problemas ya que con otros es complicado debido al retardo y el vídeo a 1080p se reproduce sin ningún parón ni bajar la definición tanto con el movil un Samsung Galxay S7 como con PC Windows 10 y un Intel i5 de gama media. El precio podría ser mas bajo pero dudo que los productos mas baratos se acerquen a la sencillez mínimo lag fluidez y calidad de imagen y sonido que presenta este dispositivo.Añadir que no requiere conectarlo a una red Wifi como hacen otros dispositivos de menor coste y que la app Windows 10 para configurar el dispositivo funciona correctamente esta senzilla app no es imprescindible pero sera muy útil a la hora de establecer contraseña para conectarse ajustar tamaño pantalla y actualizar firmware del dispositivo.
4,Très bien pour avoir une image plus grande vers TV à partir d'un smartphone.Utilisation élémentaire avec un Samsung.Aucun paramétrage.Mais je crois pas que ça puisse transférer le son...
5,Ayant acheté une Chromecast qui ne fonctionne que si l'on a un réseau WiFi domestique à disposition je recherchais une solution indépendante pour mon camping-car afin de diffuser l'écran de mon Smartphone sur la TV.Mon P30 lite étant compatible Wi-Fi direct (Miracast) c'était la solution idéale.PS: j'avais essayé avec un câble Usbc Hdmi mais contrairement à ce que certains vendeurs prétendent ce Smartphone n'est pas compatible pour une sortie TV par câble.
4,Der Wireless Adapter ist im Großen und Ganzen eine praktikable Lösung. Die Übertragung von Bild und Ton funktioniert schnell. Die Bildqualität läßt ab und zu zu wünschen übrig und das mitgelieferte USB "Verlängerungskabel" ist mehr als kurz gehalten
5,Anche se inizialmente deluso dalle prestazioni a causa della congestione dei canali wireless nell'ambiente in cui l'ho provato ovvero in ufficio (i canali 1-6-11 sul 2.4 Ghz dovrebbero essere se ho ben compreso quelli utilizzati da miracast e la connessione tra miracast e telefono viene negoziata automaticamente) mi sono poi ricreduto quando l'ho installato sulla TV di casa: il ritardo è praticamente diventato impercettibile i video sono accettabili (ogni tanto fa una micropausa ...) ma la cosa più bella è che si connette al volo e mi permette di usare il mio 950XL come un simil-PC con continuum senza dove attaccare l'ingombrante cavo che collega il telefono alla docking station. Volendo ci si può anche connettere alla tv alla "vecchia maniera" ovvero trasmettendo "paro-paro" (come fa attualmente Android ...) lo schermo del telefono alla televisione - utile per i giochi ... Inoltre l'ho pagata 10 Euro in meno grazie alla promozione Amazon!!! Più di così ...
5,I use it to mirror my surface tablet onto my large screen so I can sit on the couch surfing the net in style. The adapter is simplicity itself to install. Just plug one end into the HDMI port and the other into either a spare USB port and you're good to go. The tablet recognised it immediately and all Good.Not the best option for streaming video but its great for everything else.
5,Der Wireless Display Adapter V2 tut was er soll.Ich habe zwei unterschiedliche Samsung Tablets ein Samsung S6 und ein Microsoft Surface 3 ausprobiert: Es gab keine Probleme.Der Adapter wurde sofort erkannt der Verbindungsaufbau dauerte nur Sekunden und sowohl Bild als auch Ton wurden übertragen. Das hatte ich mit dem alten Microsoft Adapter nicht mit allen Geräten hinbekommen. Auch war es kein Problem zwischen den Geräten zu wechseln.Auf dem Samsung Note pro habe ich dann testweise eine Runde "Leo's Fortune" gespielt. Das Spiel ließ sich sogar brauchbar über den Fernseher bedienen auch wenn ein Hauch von Verzögerung zu bemerken war.Nachdem der Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter V1 und ein China Miracast Dongle durchgefallen sind funktioniert dieses Gerät nun endlich so wie ich es mir vorgestellt habe. Super!
5,Funktioniert am Monitor und Beamer mit HDMI Port. Einziger Nachteil ist dass Stromversorgung über USB nötig ist unser Beamer hat praktischerweise auch einen USB Port ein älterer Monitor nicht da brauchen wir ein USB Netzteil dann funktioniert es wunderbar.Ton kommt mit. Apple TV+ geht auch zu projizieren wenn man sich über Chrome einloggt.
5,Wow das Ding funktioniert perfekt.Anschließen verbinden arbeiten und präsentieren.Keine Ahnung wieso der eine oder die andere damit Schwierigkeiten hat. Ich benutze das Gerät an Beamern und Fernsehern. Alles perfekt. Dazu verbraucht diese Verbindung sehr wenig Energie.Eine Einschränkung gibt es nun doch: Verliert mein Surface die Verbindung weil es z. B. im Standby ist muss ich es neu starten um eine neue Verbindung aufzubauen. Das ist etwas lästig führt aber keineswegs zum Sternverlust.Ein kleiner Tipp: In der Win-10-App kann man das Bild mittels eines Schiebereglers noch ein wenig an den jeweiligen Bildschirm anpassen.
5,Oui ok on critique souvent Microsoft mais faut avouer que la ça marche nickel. Même pas lu la notice. Je déballe. Je branche sur ma vieille télé Philips (les prises sont assez étroites pour se brancher sur des ports très serrés contrairement aux Chromecast et autres clones en formes de poires). Pas d'alim externe à brancher. Je télécharge n'importe quelle appli Miracast ou même le Smartview sur Samsung. Et hop ça se connecte et ça marche! Pas de lag. Image de qualité.  C'est stable. On conserve bluetooth et wifi. En plus pas de dongle à brancher sur le téléphone  (contrairement à l'Ezcast et autres clones chinois). Bref 50 euros mais c'est le prix du sans souci...
2,Ich habe eine Möglichkeit gesucht kabellos mein Surface Pro 4 mit meinem Samsung TV (älteres Modell ohne Miracast-Funktion) zu verbinden.Die Annahme: Premium-Produkt zu gehobenen Preis wird schon funktionieren.Anhand der Rezensionen war meine Erwartungshaltung schon gering. Leider muss ich mich den negativen Bewertungen anschließen. Die Verbindung zum Wireless Display Adapter wird nur sporalisch aufgebaut und bleibt trotz keiner Veränderung an allen Geräten nicht bestehen. Kurzum: Die Verbindung ist nicht stabil. Die Qualität der Übertragung wenn sie funktioniert ist sehr gut. Minimale Verzögerung des Mauszeigers sehr gutes Bild mit minimal schlechterer Farbe (etwas grau) und klarem Sound.Was habe ich alles zur Verbesserung der Verbindung versucht?- Firmware Update des Adapters (keine Auswirkung)- Stromversorgung des Adapters (USB-Anschluss) über Surface-Netzteil (Verbesserung)- Heim-Internet-WLAN auf anderes Band geändert (keine Auswirkung)- Grafikkartentreiber auf Tablet neu installiert (keine Auswirkung)- WLAN Treiber auf Tablet neu installiert (keine Auswirkung)- Neustart aller beteiligten Geräte (ermöglichte teilweise den Verbindungsaufbau)- Surface am Stromnetzwerk betrieben (leichte Verbesserung)Ich vermute dass mein Heim-Internet-WLAN auf dem gleichen Band funkt und damit Interferenzen entstehen. (Schmunzeln erlaubt. Ich habe keine Ahnung von der Technik im Detail.) Außerdem hat sich die Initiierung des Surface Pen (Bluetoothverbindung) negativ ausgewirkt. War der Pen schon aktiv funktionierte die Übertragung wie gehabt instabil.Ich habe das Produkt zurückgeschickt. Als Kunde wünscht man sich ein Produkt dass vielleicht etwas initialen Konfigurationsaufwand erfordert aber danach garantiert funktioniert. Einschalten und Wohlfühlen halt.P. S.: Ich glaube nicht dass die Fehler durch ein anderes Produkt gelöst werden. Einfach mal nach "Miracast" googlen.
2,L'adaptateur fonctionne très bien... lorsqu'il peut fonctionner. Testé sur 8 machines avec du Windows 10 pour les PC et tous les drivers à jour.Toshiba Kira 10D (2015) > OK.

L'adaptateur est vu mais l'adaptateur ne voit pas le PC (carte Wifi Realtek 8821)En résumé ça fonctionne 1 fois sur 2 et ça ne fonctionne bien qu'avec certaines cartes Wifi. Dommage pour moi ça ne fonctionne pas avec le Shuttle et la Galaxy pour lesquels le WDA m'intéressait et ça fonctionne avec les périphériques pour lesquels ça ne m'est d'aucune utilité.Aucune documentation sérieuse du sujet ni de la part de Microsoft ni de la part du consortium qui gère la norme Miracast. Dommage le principe  est bon mais pour qu'une norme soit intéressante il faut qu'elle soit quasiment universelle.Retour et remboursement en cours il faudra attendre deux ou trois ans pour voir si Miracast s'impose ou passe au cimetière des standards abandonnés...
5,Good quality is something I expect from Microsoft and this does deliver that. It's intended purpose was to mirror screen my mobile devices to an non smart high definition TV. Those of you wanting to mirror stream Prime from your Android device will be pleased as I am.
3,J'adore ce système il suffit de le brancher la télé via USB plus HDMI et de se connecter via Windows 10 ou Android 6.0 (et+) quoique incompatible avec un Android 6.0.1 dans un Blackberry DTEK60 donc a voir mai fonctionne sur Galaxy A20 et A40 un gadget sympa mais comme tous les gadgets il a ses inconvénients jouer a un jeux PC diffusé sur son écran TV pour bénéficier du confort de la console de salon sera difficile j'ai une latence de presque 1 seconde donc c'est injouable (dans ce cas il faut previlegier hdmi/vga) hors le son et l'image passent par le dispositif donc aucun problème pour films musiques et séries.Je conseil vivement ce gadget.
5,Top
5,den MS Wireless Displayadapter zu nutzen empfinde ich als sehr einfach.Zumindest unter  Windows 10 Windows 10 Mobile und den Androiden die ich zur Hand habe.Unter Windows 7 und 8 sieht es anders aus. Habe es da nur mit 8 mit hängen und würgen geschafft. Und dann krachte es.Das übertragene Bild ist ziemlich zeitnah da und kann für Spiele die keine Echtzeiteingabe nutzen gut verwendet werden.Abenteuer Spiele funktionierten ebenfalls.Bei der Nutzung mit Windows 10 kann der Adapter als Spiegelung der Anzeige oder Erweiterung des Desktops verwendet werden.Dies ist dann unabhängig von den maximalen Anzeigegeräten die die Grafikkarte ausgeben kann. Zum Beispiel könnte man damit 3 Monitore um einen Vierten ergänzen.Ziemlich gut bin zufrieden.
2,Eccellente l'immediatezza con cui si sincronizza. Due tasti e con win 10  proietti su qualsiasi schermo le immagini del tuo pc.Ma...e ci doveva essere un ma altrimenti non si chiamava Microsoft... Dovete augurarvi che nelle vicinanze non vi siano Routers o apparecchi che trasmettano sui canali bassi del WIFI 2.4. Questi gli danno fastidio in una maniera assurda. Tanto da rallentare il segnale e addirittura bloccarlo.Non esiste una possibilità di andare su un menu avanzato della "dongle" e settare parametri di trasmissione come Frequenza canale e potenza.Non trasmette i contenuti di Premium in quanto evidentemente le specifiche HDCP o il programma stesso della penna non permette ne la duplicazione del segnale ne la semplice uscita come monitor primario. Ho telefonato all assistenza Microsoft e non conoscono il prodotto a tal punto che dopo un intero pomeriggio non hanno risolto nulla. suggerimento... NON LO COMPRATE!  A meno che non vi serva il mirroring del solo PC.Detto questo passiamo al suo utilizzo. La distanza media di funzionamento senza problemi di trasmissione varia a seconda dell' "inquinamento elettromagnetico" di altri apparecchi presenti in zona. Comunque sia non eccede i 10 MT normalmente. Detto questo se siete fortunati e la trasmissione non presenta problemi avrete un imput lag praticamente basso ( latenza tra il comando dato e quello che vedete sullo schermo mirror ) se le latenze sono grandi allora è indicatore di problemi di trasmissione spesso accompagnati da squadrettamenti dell'immagine e deterioramento della qualità dei video trasmessi.
5,Really easy to use.Simply plug at the back of the TV.One end goes into the USB Port and the other end in the HDMI port.Please ensure WiFi is onWIndows 10 Laptop: Click on the notification tab on the bottom right of screen > Connect Tab > Select the ID name Microsoft Wireless Adapter > ConnectMobile Android : Swipe the screen from the top downwards > Select option Mirror Screen (If Huawei) or Screen Share (If Samsung) > Select the ID name Microsoft Wireless Adapter > Connect.The laptop also displays auto-rotate of the mobileStating the obvious sound from video also transmits.Thanks
5,Benutze den Adapter in Verbindung mit einem Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 9.7 (Android 6) und der dortigen Funktion Smart View.Kurz und knapp funktioniert gut.Adapter an HDMI-Kabel und Strom entsprechenden Eingang am TV wählen und schon sieht man den Startscreen von Microsoft.Smart View am Tablet eingeschaltet und los geht's.Ja es ist ein leichter Versatz zwischen dem Bild auf dem TV und dem auf dem Tablet aber das ist normal.Bei großen Videos sieht man ab und an Micro-Ruckler aber das tut dem Spaß kein Abbruch!Funktioniert auch mit dem Lumia 930 (Windows 10 Mobile).Der Adapter lässt sich sogar mit einen Passwort schützen sodass niemand dazwischen funken kann!Gutes Produkt mit guter Funktionalität und schmalem Design (passt noch was in den HDMI Port daneben).
5,Si c'est pour utiliser avec un environnement Windows 10 ou + il est très simple à connecter et à configurer.
5,Um vom Smartphone (Samsung) Tablet (Huawei) oder Laptop (Microsoft) auf den Beamer zu übertragen habe ich noch nichts einfacheres und zuverlässigeres als den Microsoft Miracast Stick gefunden.Das ist mittlerweile der 3. den beruftich und privat einsetze. Die Verbindung braucht kein gemeinsames WLAN entweder die App das Tool oder beim MS-PC die Verbindungen aufrufen der Stick wird binnen Sekunden angezeigt und schon kann es losgehen.Mit Fremdanbietern klappt das auch aber hier braucht man keinen Code oder sonst etwas man kann sofort loslegen.
5,Je l'utilise couplé à une Surface et cette technologie est bluffante.Le display adapter permet d'avoir en sans fil un deuxième écran comme s'il était couplé physiquement au PC. Aucune latence !C'est très pratique lors des réunions ou le cable HDMI pour projeter est toujours trop court.Vraiment génial !
5,Auf dem Fernseher im Wohnzimmer wollte ich eine drahtlose HDMI-Verbindung zwischen Laptop (Windows 8.1) und Fernseher zustande bringen da mir das mit dem Kabel auf die Dauer zu lästig war. Für den Fernseher im Schlafzimmer hatte ich vor einiger Zeit einen Fire TV Stick angeschafft um Filme aus der Mediathek oder Youtube anzusehen was auch problemlos funktioniert. Zu meiner Überraschung habe ich im Eingangsmenü gesehen dass der die drahtlose Verbindung zum Computer ebenfalls können soll. Ich habe das mehrfach versucht aber ohne Erfolg. Für den Fernseher im Schlafzimmer ist mir das allerdings auch nicht wichtig.Für den Fernseher im Wohnzimmer habe ich mir deshalb den Microsoft Wireless Adapter angeschafft. Die Verbindung hat auf Anhieb  funktioniert. Auch mein Tablet (ebenfalls Windows 8.1) und mein Nokia Lumia (Windows Phone) lassen sich problemlos verbinden.
5,Brilliant. First class display of your computer screen on any size tv.It does use two HDMI sockets on the tv
4,Good but needs a software update to be more reliable when streaming videos or gaming. Casting is good but minor improvements are needed.
2,It worked out of the box at home on my Windows 10 laptop. However I bought it for my Windows 10 laptop given to me by my employer and for that it didn’t work. It turns out that my laptop uses Cisco AnyConnect VPN which is typically set up at the kernel level to disable the Miracast protocol that the Windows Display Adapter uses to connect your PC/laptop to a monitor. That is a semi-technical explanation and may sound like gobbledygook to most of us including me before I did a day’s worth of reading. However my summary is to be very very careful before buying. If you use a work PC/laptop or you use VPN (I.e if you need to type in a SecureID code to access your systems) check that the display adapter supports your VPN software by scouring the Microsoft website first.
4,Funktioniert technisch gut. Auch Firmware Update über Windows 10 App ist einfach. Leider auch nur über diese App. Wüsste nicht wie man das  per Smartphone oder Browser ohne Windows macht-. Die mechanische Ausführung könnte man besser machen. Muss das Ding so kantig sein. und man könnte die USDB und HDMI-Anschlüsse auch als Buchsen ausführen mit kleinen Kabeln. Sie sehe schon dass nach einigen Monaten mobilem Einsatz die Kabel am Gehäuse abknicken mangels schutz
5,Wurde für PC Übertragung auf TV gekauft. Für Bilder/Video gut. Für den Einsatz als zusätzlichen Office Monitor passt das TV Bildformat nicht daher Rücksendung.Ein zuvor gekaufter Adapter ist weiterhin für den Anschluss 2ter Monitor am Notebook im Einsatz. WQHDA wird leider nicht übertragen
4,Un produit simple à installer et à utiliser. La connexion internet est conservée ! Bien vu la petite rallonge qui m'a permis de connecter à l'USB (l'alimentation) qui était un peu trop près de l'HDMI sur mon vidéo projecteur ! Attention tout de même à la montée en température ! Il vaut mieux se trouver dans une salle climatisée ! Il faudrait préciser sur la présentation du produit qu'il faut un appareil compatible Miracast (mon vieux portable Toshiba L555-10R n'est pas compatible) heureusement que j'avais prévue l'utilisation avec ma tablette qui est compatible !
5,Ideale kabellose Lösung für Miracast. Keine x Kabel für unterschiedliche Handys die andere Adapter-Kabel benötigen. Getestet mit Samsung Galaxy S5 S6 S7 S8 und Windows 10 Notebook: Alles Plug&Play. Wenn man vom Handy z.B. über eine LTE-Verbindung zum Fernseher streamen möchte ist das eine ideale Lösung. Bei der Screen-Mirror-Funktion am Samsung sollte man nicht erst WLAN einschalten da dann die LTE-Verbindung unterbrochen wird. Sobald die Screen-Mirror-Funktion am Handy aktiviert wird werden entsprechende Protokolle zur Bild- und Tonübertragung via WLAN aktiviert und die LTE-Verbindung bleibt bestehen. Video-Performance in HD 1080 einwandfrei. Dachte nicht dass das Handling so einfach ist. Drahtlose Übertragung im Bereich von etwa 5 Metern Abstand der Geräte ist unproblematisch.
4,Guter Artikel Danke für das gute Angebot
5,Dieses kleine praktische und günstige Teil ermöglicht kabellose Übertragung von Laptops auf den Beamer btw. TV. iIn meinem Fall habe ich 15m langes VGA kabeln und ein ebensolanges HDMI Kabel "in den Ruhestand " geschickt.Auch Handy Inhalte können problemlos auf Beamer/TV geschickt werden.Seit einiger Zeit habe ich Besprecungen ohne mit dem Kabelsalat Getränke die auch am Tisch stehen umzuwerfen. Von der Kostenersparnis ganz zu schweigen (hätte mir je 15 m VGA und HDMI Kabel erspart))Allerdings: Dieses Teil funktioniert nur bei Windows 10. Mit Windows 8.1 konnte es nicht aktiviert werden.
4,The Microsoft Wireless Display is very easy to use.Time starting is very quick and configuring-less.However picture quality is around 720p.For corporate presentation enough but for home 4K connection not.Be a carefully please.
3,Habe mir den Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter gekauft als Kabellose Alternative zu HDMI.Leider musste ich feststellen dass ich den Adapter über mein ältestes Notebook (WIN10) nicht nutzen konnte. Mit einem anderen Notebook (etwas neueres Baujahr) hat es zwar funktioniert darüber aber einen Film zu schauen war nicht akzeptabel. Bild und Ton liefen nicht sauber ab. Nach zwei Minuten bin ich wieder auf HDMI Kabel umgestiegen.Fazit:Mag für eine Übertragung von Daten wie Präsentationen u.ä. ausreichend sein für den Genuss von Filmen (zumindest bei älteren Rechnern) ist es nicht ausreichend.
2,Does not work in 1920x1200 via HDMI to DVI adapter and colors are washed out compared to when connected to PC. Connection stability ease of use and image delay are good.
2,Der Adapter wurde mir empfohlen da in meiner Schule AplleTV in den Klassenzimmern Standard ist ich aber weiterhin bei meinem Microsoft-Setup bleiben möchte. Ich wusste auch dass das übertragene Bild mehr oder weniger Verzögerung hat. Alles kein Problem. Gut finde ich auch die Verlängerung für die USB-Stromversorgung da ich sie ab und zu tatsächlich benötige. Andererseits frage ich mich warum das Kabel nicht gleich länger dimensioniert wurde. Verringert sich durch ein längeres Kabel etwa die Leistung?Was mir am meisten missfällt ist dass kürzlich die USB-Verbindung beim Abziehen von der Steckerleiste auseinanderging. Das heißt der silberne USB-Stecker löste sich aus der rechteckigen Kunststoffhalterung sodass die kleine Platine und die Kabel blank lagen. Ich konnte das zwar wieder ohne Schaden ins Gehäuse zurückschieben doch hält das nun nicht mehr zusammen.Der Adapter funktioniert auch noch allerdings stelle ich nun häufiger Verbindungsabbrüche fest. Im Anschluss kann ich auch nur durch einen Reboot eine erneute Verbindung herstellen.Falls es einmal künftig eine Version im Metallgehäuse geben wird wäre ich wieder interessiert.
5,Wer einen Miracast & Co Adapter sucht der mit den Windows 10 Bordmitteln 1A zusammen arbeitet der ist hier - wer hätte es anders vermutet - total richtig. Immerhin kommt das Produkt von Microsoft also erwarte ich mir schon das es zu 100% mit Microsoft Windows zusammenarbeitet. Und das tut es auch. eine Coole Idee ist auch die Doppel-Kappe in die man beide Enden (USB und HDMI) einstöpseln kann - das ist extrem praktisch für den Transport.Reichweite und Übertragungsqualität sind auch bestens. Das Ding ist zwar teuer aber dafür sehr zuverlässig.Darum gebe ich hier volle Punkte.
5,Facile à installer et pas trop cher.La qualité est correct surtout pour du sans fil c'est rapide et facile de s'y connecter et surtout on ne se déconnecte pas du wifi et d'internet. Attention ce n'est pas de la qualité HDMI donc pour projeter des tableaux excel sur un écran le cable HDMI reste la meilleure solution.
3,I am using WiFi router for internet.I tried for hours to pair it with my desktop PC by a dual channel 5ghz AC600 wifi adapter (to keep PC connected to the wifi router same time). But i just couldn't.So right now i am using 2 wifi adapters one connected to the Microsoft Display Adapter and the other one connected to router.First i paired Microsoft display adapter with a 2.4ghz 300mbit adapter.(soon i will try an other 5ghz adapter)After this i plugged in the second adapter(5ghz AC600) and connected to the WiFi router(connection : 2.4ghz).I think Microsoft display adapter always connects to the wifi adapter i first used.And with this i both use MS display adapter and wifi internet.I think I may need a Blutooth adapter for better connection(That's what windows app of MS display adapter says)But unfortunately it's hard to find out what the problem is.
5,Using it with my Windows Phone (Lumia 930) and Surface Pro 4 works like a charm - both running on Windows 10.Extension did come handy since my HDMI input and USB port on TV are little to far away so it wouldn't reach on it's own.Also software for Windows that allows you to update firmware and fit your display to screen is really nice touch since all HDMI inputs from devices seem to be a bit larger than screen (some of actual screen is behind the border)But I do have some problems from my laptop which is running Windows 8.1.
2,I have owned the Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter V2 for the last three years. I chose to buy it so as to not have a wire going across my floor so I was okay with the expensive pricetag. However this device is very unreliable to connect to. It can take a half hour sometimes. It appears to have trouble connecting if there are pending Windows updates and it also disconnects my wifi connection when trying to connect. When connected there is often a noticeable delay with using the second screen and it can be very slow to do something as simple as move an application on screen. It is a great concept but the execution is very much lacking.
4,Der Adapter erfüllt voll und ganz seinen Zweck und ist nicht nur für Präsentationen sondern auch für das Abspielen von Youtube Videos auf meinem Samsung Fernseher in Verbindung mit meinem Microsoft Surface Pro 4 optimal.Die Verbindungsherstellung ist kinderleicht und wurde von meinem Samsung TV direkt erkannt.Binnen wenigen Sekunden erscheint das Bild auf dem Fernseher.Bei Präsentationen und Youtube Videos funktioniert der Adapter ruckelfrei und überträgt das Bild ausgezeichnet!
5,Bought a couple of these now to make it easier for users to connect their laptops to the projector wirelessly.They work really well and are quite easy to set up. Windows 10 has a connect to wireless display option.
5,Im Gegensatz zu anderen Display Adaptern bzw. Miracast Dongels ist dieser Adapter teuer aber leicht zu bedienen. Einstecken und mit Tablet oder Smartphone Screen Mirroring vornehmen. Als jemand der sich von der IT Industrie regelmässig auf den Arm genommen fühlt kann ich hier nur sagen daß man weder einen Bachelor in Adapterkunde noch einen Fremdwörterduden braucht.Nach einstecken im Fernseher oder Beamer und Verbindung mit einer Energiequelle erscheint ein Microsoft Bildschirm und die Geräte werden gekoppelt. Mit meinem Samsung Galaxy Tab  (mit Pen) ist dies eine wahre Wohltat Unterricht Vortrage oder Vorlesungen zu halten.That's it.
4,Easy to connect with Windows 10 as a wireless monitor. Using it in a meeting room saves sharing a cable. Current person drops connection next person adds wireless monitor. Superb.
5,Gerät nutzt integrierte Windowsfunktion um zb vom Laptop zum TV zu streamen. Dazu das Kabel in den HDMI Anschluss vom TV stecken sowie den USB Anschluss auch. Dann Zugriff über den Laptop. Beim ersten Mal etwas Zeit einplanen. Dann geht's ganz gut. Habe nur Office gestreamt und keine Erfahrung mit Filmen usw
5,Read the reviews on this before purchase and it seemed a bit hit or miss however I took the gamble and glad I did. It worked flawlessly straight out of the box plugged it into my projector turned on screen share on my lgv30 and the picture came up straight away. Didn't need to update it or connect to a pc etc. Watched a movie on Netflix and it didn't stutter once audio and video were in perfect sync. Best of all this unit doesn't need to be connected to WiFi to work as it uses WiFi direct
4,The only thing I miss is the possibility to change the device resolution to match the screen's resolution.Other than that it worked like a charm with my Lumia 950XL and my NexDock (where lacking the option to chenge the display adapter's resolution create a not-so-great image).On 1920x1080 displays it works like a charm with good video and audio quality.
4,This little thing works as described and is painless to connect to with a modern device. I've connected from a Sony Xperia Z3 phone and a Windows laptop. It sends BBC iPlayer flawlessly. Really irritatingly NowTV is set up in such a way as to block use of this adaptor so potential purchasers probably need to check for their specific uses before buying.
5,Funktioniert einwandfrei mit meinem Surface Pro 4 und Nokia 950 mit Win 10. Sehr schnelle Inbetriebnahme einfach in den LG Fernseher eingesteckt und mit dem Surface verbunden anschließend die App gestartet. Es wurde direkt ein Update auf den Adapter über die App gespielt. Verbindung mit dem Handy ging noch schneller und einfacher.Verbindung mit einem Beamer auf der Dienstelle hat auch gut und schnell geklappt allerdings musste ich ein USB Kabel mit Handynetzteil dazu benutzen da der Beamer keinen USB Anschluss hat.Filme auf dem Surface die ich über die Film & TV App gekauft habe streamt er ohne Probleme und Ruckler.Bin zufrieden mit dem Produkt.
5,Ich war erst etwas skeptisch da die meisten Bewertungen von Miracast eher schlecht ausfallen.ZU dem Wireless Adapter von Microsoft ist zu sagen wenn das entsprechende Streaminggerät nicht zur Verfügung steht kann man es tatsächlich vergessen. Es ruckelt stark und auch ein Versatz von Ton und Bild kann auftreten.Verwendet man aber bspw. ein Smartphone der aktuellen Generation ist es kein Problem.So lassen sich Musik und Bilder als auch Videos in Full-HD ohne Probleme übertragen und auch das Streamen von Netflix etc ist kein Problem und macht super viel spaß.Definitiv weiterzuempfehlen wenn die entsprechende Hardware vorhanden ist.
3,Je sais pas pourquoi mais avec le Surface PRO 3 256Go@8Go RAM cette adaptateur n'est pas en 'temps réel'.Il existe un petit délai lorsque on fait des mouvements avec le souris et tape au clavier.Je aussi essaye avec une installation toute neuf du windows et toujours reste le délai. Je pense qu'il existe à cause du processeur être seulement 4ieme generation du Core i5. D'apres les brochures de Intel les 5ieme et 6ieme (Surface pro 4) sont naturellement adaptees pour la affichage sans fils.Pour regarder des filmes et videos l'affichage a moins de délais mais il existe encore. Il est un peu incomodative mais on peut regarder sans probleme.Je pense que surtout le Surface Pro 3 qui est problematique parce que le explorer.exe se casse apres quelquer types de utilisation et aussi quelques fois les appli comment netflix (qui sont uwp) ont des problemes de se casser aussi.Pour les lumia 630 et 650 existe un petit delai mais rien de problematique.
5,Der Empfänger ist super für Präsentationen geeignet. Die meisten Beamer haben ehh einen USB Anschluss damit braucht man nicht mal ein Netzteil. Die Wiedergabe von Videos läuft leider nicht ruckelfrei.Ich netze es in der Lehre in Kombination mit einem Surface. Mit Windows 10 sind keine Treiber nötig und jeder Laptop lässt sich direkt über wlan verbinden.
4,Plugged this into our Panasonic TV and tried several laptops and all worked perfectly to project Amazon Prime video onto the TV.On one or two episodes of Grand Tour I did very very occasionally get a bit of audio stutter for a few seconds but I suppose that could be the laptop deciding to done some housekeeping at the wrong moment.
4,I almost love this product. It helps get rid of the annoying HDMI cable but it does stutter quite a lot when watching video. I use it with my Surface pro 4 (intel i5) so I'm not sure if its a processor issue or my router being slow (you do need a wi-fi router to make it work) or the device itself.
4,Ich finde den Adapter gut. Gut wenn man schnell etwas zeigen möchte. Schlecht zum Streamen von Filmen.Sollte es zu stark ruckeln kann ein Firmwareupdate Abhilfe Versprechen.
4,Pour visualiser films ou photos depuis smartphone ou tablette ou ordinateur. Pas toujours évident à installer suivant qu'on vient d'android de Windows ou d'IOS mais une fois que c'est fait les résultats sont d'excellente qualité technique.
4,Fonctionne parfaitement sur ma moniteur avec surface pro 4. On peut se connecter a sa box adsl en wifi en même temps afin de ne utiliser les data de son téléphone. Super! aussi Efficace et simple d'utilisation répond tout à fait à mon attente.
1,My second monitor is connected via HDMI cable and I get 100+Mbps internet speed. As soon as I connect this It immediately goes down to 1-10Mbps. I'm in game and get 30ms as soon as I manually setup and connect the display adapter it goes to 100+MS. As soon as I take out the USB cable which is powering the wireless display adapter my ping goes back to 30ms and my internet speed immediately goes up to 100+Mbps. Using a windows 10 Microsoft MSI laptop all drivers updated. Using HDMI cables to my 2nd monitor never had an issue something is wrong with this adapter and I've seen many comments on this when searching Google but Microsoft Support seems to be avoiding the issue in all replies.
5,Ich suchte nach einer Möglichkeit Inhalte meines Windows Phones (YouTube-Videos Fotos etc.) auf meinem Samsung TV (nicht Smart TV fähig) widerzugeben.  Da die Miracast-Kopplung mit dem Amozon Fire TV Stick leider nicht funktioniert entschloss ich mich für die Microsoft Lösung.Der V2 Adapter wurde sofort nach Verfügbarkeit in Deutschland von Amazon geliefert. Er sieht sehr wertig aus. Entpacken anschließen an den HDMI und USB Port meines Samsung TV Kopplung  via Geräte Hub am Phone und schon war mein Phone auf dem TV gespiegelt. Alles sehr reibungslos. Die Übertagung ist zuverlässig und noch flüssiger als beim V1 Adapter.Alles in allem eine Empfehlung für alle Windows Phone/Tablet Besitzer. Für Android Systeme gibt es sicherlich günstigere Alternativen.
4,I really like the idea of this and I've tried it once before but couldn't get it to work.I have now got it working and am happy with it.For others ... if you are using a firewall you will need to open the firewall to allow your computer to talk to the device.
5,Gleich zu Beginn: Ich habe den Adapter im Angebot gekauft ich finde den Originalpreis wirklich viel.Der Adapter an sich ist wirklich praktisch.Hauptsächlich nutze ich ihn für Präsentationen denn da er kein WLAN braucht kann ich den Adapter einfach in den Beamer stecken und mit drei Klicks mit meinem Surface Pro 4 verbinden. Anschließend wird die Präsentation direkt auf dem Beamer angezeigt während ich auf meinem Surface eine Präsentationsansicht habe. Ich kann mich frei durch den Raum bewegen und sogar in die Präsentationen reinzeichnen etc. Das ist wirklich praktisch.Ich empfehle den Adapter gerne und würde ihn wieder kaufen!
1,Dieser sch**** Stick funktioniert nicht mit Win11!!! Ein Firmwareupdate ?! Am A*****..... Hinterher war die HDMI-Buchse des Monitors defekt.... Also Finger weg von diesem Müll.
4,Les points positifs :- Sans Fil- Compatible nativement avec Windows 10- Simple à installerLes points négatifs :- Des lags c'est parfait pour des présentations et travailler mais je suis plus sceptique sur diffuser une video via cet adaptateur.
5,Très pratique avec un téléphone projetable sur écran HDMI (le continuum de Windows 10 mobile) notamment à l'hôtel en location de vacances. Pour moi un vrai lot de consolation quand on connaît l'actualité de Microsoft mobile. Rien à dire sur l'affichage mis à part quelques déconnexions quand on n'y a plus d'activité à l'écran. Par contre la partie logiciel reste à évaluer dans mon cas je baisserai l'évaluation dans le cas où Microsoft délaisse le suivi logiciel sur  Windows 10 mobile. Je ne parviens pas à faire reconnaître l'adaptateur via l'appli mobile et donc à mettre à jour son logiciel.
3,I tried with various setups I even lent it to someone with windows 10 and they could not get it to workI don't know why?
5,il top della semplicità tu lo colleghi tra la USB e HDMI di qualsiasi monito o tv provvisto di queste porte e in automatico si collega al dispositivo che volete noi lo utilizziamo con qualsiasi telefono o tablet android senza nessun problema. Unica cosa da tener presente: SKY GO non rilascia i permessi a NESSUNO di fare mirroring per cui se lo comprate per questa funzione lasciate perdere qualsiasi strumento simile.
4,facil de instalar e utilizar se perde la conexion algunas veces voy hacer algunos testes mas para ver donde es el problema
3,Very good device that was streaming 60fps for one day but Microsoft decided that the customer actually needs choppy max 30fps performance after updating to newer firmware. Overall still the best streaming dongle good build quality very easy use - no need to configure it just click Connect on my HTC android device and I have my entire screen on tv. Brilliant for watching yotube or media players installed on your phone. If only Microsoft will release proper update enabling again 60 fps that this will be hands on the best device on the market right now with 5 star rating.If you buy this adapter (I still recommend it) THEN DO NOT UPDATE IT FOR ANY REASON!. You should still have 60 fps enabled since the firmware on shipped item is not new and broken.
4,Doesn't work very well on very high quality streams as it will start to stutter. Sometimes have trouble connecting my phone to the dongle. There is also a delay so not recommended for games! But no real alternatives if you want to mirror your phone's display without using an established wireless network I. E.  Hotels :)
4,Stavo cercando un prodotto da mettere nella mia auto ma tutte le chiavette in commercio sono veramente lunghe. Questa invece divide equamente l'ingombro tra la porta usb e quella hdmi rendendo il prodotto ottimo. Inoltre funziona veramente bene abbastanza veloce ad avviarsi (circa 10 secondi) e bassa latenza. Insomma questa nuova versione del dongle Microsoft è riuscita molto bene.Aggiornamento recensione Dopo 11 mesi ha smesso di funzionare e quindi ho tolto una stella. Ho deciso di farmelo sostituire con lo stesso prodotto perchè alla fine funziona bene. Assistenza post vendita Amazon impeccabile
5,Super. Endlich problemlos vom LG G5 und Samsung S8 (der ganze Android Bildschirm wird gespiegelt) sowie vom Surface Pro 3 auf den TV streamen. Auch der Eurosport Player vom Notebook kann dargestellt werden (abgesehen davon dass der Eurosport Player auflösungstechnisch eine Katastrophe ist trotzdem okay). Mediatheken etc. in Hochauflösung. Kann als weiterer Bildschirm erweitert werden (nicht nur Spiegelung auf dem Hauptmonitor vom Laptop kann weitergearbeitet werden). Keine Verbindungsabbrüche etc. Erst bei Entfernung über 6m durch eine Türe gibt es Probleme ansonsten zuverlässig und stabil. Sehr guter Adapter Plug and Play.
5,Colis reçu dans les délais. Super pour le déport d'affichage de son mobile sur sa TV (doit disposer d'un port USB et d'un port DMI). Pour info fonctionne avec Samsung J5 Huawei P20 Pro Lumia.
4,Works really well with Lumia and Tablets and Sam S7 but be careful not all low end phones are enabled as I found out  the Sam J3 wont work with any display adapters. It does drop out occasionally and this can be annoying that's why only 4 stars.
4,Ich habe es an unserem Firmen-Beamer angeschlossen. Mit Windows 10 kann eine kinderleichte Verbindung hergestellt werden.Die Bildübertragung kommt leicht verzögert an stört mich beim präsentieren aber nicht wirklich (sofern ich als Präsentator nur auf mein laptop schaue).Im Grossen und Ganzen aber zu empfehlen. Würde diesen Adapter wieder kaufen.
1,10" Acer Windows tablet connected easily. Slight time lag in mouse movements but good picture and great for viewing photos videos etc.24" Lenovo all-in-one could not connect to it. Phoned Microsoft support. They told me that I should install the app. I informed them that the app is not necessary. No argument from them which tells me that they were just trying to get rid of me. Then they said that the computer must have miracast!! After 45 minutes of talking rubbish putting me on hold transferring me to others etc the tech person said that the Lenovo is not compatible with this product. Sounds like to bull to me but hey if the manufacturer can't be bothered then I'm not going to waste my time trying to find the answer. Sent it back for refund.Mr Gates there is no point employing a bunch of monkeys to answer your phones. Either provide some proper support or non at all. Non at all seems to be the Microsoft way if you have any complaint hence this here moan. Very disappointed.
4,Je l'utilise depuis environ deux semaines désormais et c'est très pratique.Beaucoup de difficulté à l'utilisé avec mon telephone android mais apres plusieurs minutes j'ai pu trouvé une solution.(Pour info : n'est pas utilisable pour jouer)
5,So läßt sich die Präsentationstechnik problemlos mit dem eigenen Gerät entern! Nur aufpassen es gibt in der Tat Smartboards denen USB-Buchse nicht genug Spannung abgibt da hilft nur auf das eigene Ladegrät vom Handy als Stromquelle zurückzugreifen.
4,Attention si vous faites le partage depuis votre smartphone Netflix ne sera pas pris en compte. Cependant marche avec pc
3,Die Idee ist gut der Adapter ist ordentlich gebaut aber das Ergebnis ist leider total unbrauchbar. Welche Zielgruppe will Microsoft mit diesem Adapter ansprechen? Bei Videos mit hoher Bildrate stockt das Bild. Der Adapter wärmt sich auch auf daher vermute ich einfach mal das die verbaute Hardware viel zu schwach ist.Selbst für Präsentationen halte ich den Adapter für unbrauchbar da bei größeren einfarbigen Flächen deutliche Artefakte zu sehen sind. Wenn man den Adapter mit dem Chromecast 2 vergleicht gewinnt ganz klar der Chromecast 2. Obwohl mir die Technik vom Ansatz her besser beim Wireless Adapter gefällt.Drei Sterne gibt es trotzdem da es eine nette Technikspielerei ist und ich mir durch aus vorstellen könnte dass es irgendwo eine mini Nische gibt wo dieses Gerät eingesetzt werden könnte.
5,Kaufzweck war die Vermeidung von Kabelsalat im beruflichen Umfeld bei wechselnden Präsentationen. Das hat super geklappt. Auch zuhause wenn ich auf einen Fernseher streame vom Laptop funktioniert dies hervorragend
5,Wow. This is so good. Why buy an unknown one for a few quid less? All day long sharing from my laptop.My Note9 connects to it seamlessly.Going to be getting another methinks.Don't go cheap n nasty! Get this.
5,Lo uso quotidianamente ci vedo film ed utilizzo come secondo schermo.Bellissimo! Dovrebbe essere integrato in ogni televisore!
2,Leider hat Microsoft mit der Version 2 des Wireless Adapters keinen großen Wurf gelandet. Positiv anzumerken ist dass bei erfolgreicher Verbindung neben eines Duplizieren des Monitorinhaltes auf das externe Display auch ein erweiterter Monitor eingestellt werden kann und die Tonübertragung erfolgt. Allerdings gibt es auch schwerwiegende Kritikpunkte:Kritikpunkt 1: Der Adapter ist unzuverlässig da er in regelmäßigen Abständen die Verbindung abbrechen lässt. Das darf bei einem System aus einem Haus (Windows 10 Endgerät + MS Adapter) nicht passieren.Kritikpunkt 2: Der Adapter basiert auf dem Miracast-Standard der von einem Hersteller-Konsortium betrieben wird. Geld wird verdient indem Lizenzen verkauft werden. Somit wird die Nutzung künstlich auf bestimmte Endgeräte beschränkt.Kritikpunkt 3: Der Adapter ist sehr träge. Selbst im Zusammespliel mit potenter WLAN-Hardware (AC-Standard) im sendenden PC und unmittelbarer Nähe ist es nicht möglich gering auflösende Videos ruckelfrei zu streamen.Kritikpunkt 4: Die von Microsoft im AppStore bereitgestellte App zum Adapter bestätig dass Microsoft seine Hausaufgaben nicht gemacht hat. Sie soll eigentlich Firmware-Updates ermöglichen Einstellungen erlauben usw. Da die Software bei aktiver Verbindung mit dem Adapter weder Einstellungen zulässt noch Firmware-Updates prüfen und umsetzen lässt ist die Software nutzlos. (Stand der Rezension)
3,Völlig überteuertes produkt. Es macht was es soll dennoch finde ich es total pberteuert. Dennoch kommt man nicht rum wenn man sowas braucht
5,System ist gut aber  leider Beschreibung totaler Mist mit viel Probieren habe ich es geschafft das System zum laufen zu kriegen das es auch das macht was es soll.
4,Provato con diversi dispositivi in mirroring da il meglio di se accoppiato a smartphone o tablet di ultima generezione ad esempio con lg g5 o s7 il paring è veloce e anche dopo ore di streaming full-hd non mostra alcun affanno non do il massimo per le difficoltà che ha con molti pc anche con schede di rete di fascia alta per problemi di driver spesso la connessione è instabile con lag evidenti . Rimane comunque il miglior compromesso per lo streaming di windows senza cavi.
2,Grundsätzlich funktioniert das Teil unter Windows 10. Mal gehts gleich mal erst nach ein paar Mal probieren.Im harten Besprechungszimmer-Alltag mit Telefonie Video usw. reicht das daher nicht aus. Da braucht man zuverlässige Technik. Man kann nicht wenn Gäste kommen noch mehrere Minuten mit der Technik rumspielen das ist peinlich.Das mögen Manche anders sehen aber ein Kabel ist immer noch das bessere WLAN ;-)Wir haben letztendlich ein 10m Flachband-HDMI-Kabel bis unter den Schreibtisch verlegt. Dort ist ein Anschluss für einen oben am Tisch aufklappbaren Kasten. Damit haben wir das Kabel per Kupplung verbunden. Am Tisch klappt man den Verschluss auf schließt sein Notebook per HDMI an und fertig.JETZT ist es zuverlässig. Und zwar dauerhaft. Der Microsoft-Adapter ist rausgeflogen.
5,article de qualité et très robuste je conseille cette article les yeux fermés
5,Corona... HomeOffice... ?Mit dem Adapter ist es kinderleicht den Heimischen  Fernseher zum gigantischen Monitor umzufunktionieren. Macht richtig Spaß die Gesichter der Kollegen zu sehen wie sie mit angespannten Blick auf ihr winziges Laptop starren während ich sie entspannt vom Sofa aus beobachte.
5,Ich verstehe die negative Rezensionen hier nicht. Bei mir funktioniert alles mit einem Samsung Book (Windows) und Windows 10 hervorragend. Gut die Einrichtung ist ein wenig hakelig und ohne Recherche im Internet sicher nicht ganz ohne. Aber danach funktioniert's.Also:1.Aus dem Microsoftstore Wireless Display Adapter installieren2. Adapter anschließen und auf Stromversorgung (USB-Netzteil oder Power am TV/Monitor) achten. Am besten erst mal einen Reset machen. Kleinen Knopf am Adapter 10 sec gedrückt hatlen.3. Über die Software verbinden und nach Firmeware Update suchen und ggf. installieren.4. Das war es dann aber auch schon.5. Danach kann über das Kontrollcenter das Display aktiviert / deaktivert werden
4,vous le branchez vous basculez la TV sur le canal HDMI correspondant et vous connectez l'appareil dont vous voulez reproduire l'affichage.Sur un téléphone HTC One Paramètres Sortie média et choisir l'adaptateurSur un PC Windows 10 Paramètres d'affichage puis se connecter un affichage sans filMa tablette ANDROID ASUS MT301 n'est malheureusement pas compatible (trop ancienne)Petit bémol l'adaptateur a tendance à chauffer un peu.
3,Ich benutze den MWDAV2 zusammen mit einem Microsoft Surface Pro 4. Man sollte also davon ausgehen dass die beiden Geräte einwandfrei zusammenarbeiten. Weit gefehlt.-Jedes Mal wenn ich die Tastatur des MSP4 an- oder abstecke verliert es die Verbindung zum wireless display adapter.-Manchmal scheitert jegliche Verbindung mit dem Adapter und nur ein Windows-Neustart und neues Verbinden des Adapters hilft.-Zuletzt noch wohl eher eine Kritik am MSP4. Wenn ich USB Stick eingesteckt ist dann verbindet sich das MSP4 nicht mit dem wireless Adapter. Keine Chance.Ansonsten: Wenn die Verbindung funktioniert dann läuft es wunderbar. Verzögerung ist natürlich nicht spielegeeignet und auch als Verbindung zu meinem Hauptmonitor würde ich es nicht verwenden. Für Präsentationen jedoch wunderbar. Auch 1080p Videos laufen ruckelfrei.
4,Sometimes the adapter restarts itself in the beginning. If there are many WiFi networks around refresh becomes slow and you can see image instability. This happens quite rare but at least once in few weeks
5,Ero interessato all’articolo per fare presentazioni libero da cavi dal mio tablet a proiettore/LIM con file che generalmente sono PDF o PPTX.  Ho fatto le prove con tablet “Samsung Galaxy Tab S2” con Android 7 collegandolo a un proiettore e il risultato è andato oltre le attese.  Il collegamento è stato semplicissimo e immediato - è bastato lanciare la funzione “Smart View” e senza altre impostazioni il proiettore ha duplicato lo schermo del tablet senza limiti di visualizzazione: sono riuscito a visualizzare tutte le app che ho provato.  Ho provato il dongle collegandolo all’estremità di un cavo HDMI distante dal proiettore con connettore femmina-femmina e funziona perfettamente.
5,La prise en main est simple et rapide.Idéal pour présenter des photos ou pour un environnement professionnel de type bureautique.Pas testé pour d'autres usages.Un peu cher par rapport a des concurrents mais pas de mauvaise surprise avec un produit de qualité !
5,Keine Kabelstrecken mehr quer durch den Raum bei temporären Installationen und perfekt um kein nervendes vom Beamer zum Abspielgerät zu haben auch bei Präsentationen perfekt.
5,Dongle indispensabile per godere a pieno dell'esperienza in mirroring schermo. Il ritardo è quasi inesistente tale da rendere fruibile questa tecnologia anche per il gaming a patto di lievi compromessi: Microsoft ha fatto le cose per bene!
4,Petit dongle bonne finition.Bonne qualité de transmission mais légers lags et décalages avec l'origine.Pas soucis dans un usage privé. Par contre risque de pb de connexion en entreprise selon les logiciels de sécurité utilisés.Microsoft ayant une hotline entre le 0 et le -1 ne comptez pas sur eux pour vous aider.Après domestication c'est un bon produit.
5,Work great. I use this with a projector in my classroom to display my surface pro screen on it. I’ve been using it for over a month now.
4,Es hat auf Anhieb funktioniert das Bild ist ok.
5,Le top du top ma éviter de changer de télé  je peut regarder mes films écouter de la musique via tout mes supports ( tablette pc gsm) je l'ai même conseillé à mes amis
4,Très bon matériel avec une bonne synchronisation son/image. Mais perte en qualité vidéo tout de même d'où mes 4 etoiles
5,Wir haben diesen Adapter an einem großen TV hängen und nutzen ihn für Präsentationen und selten auch Videos.Die Verwendung ist unter Windows 10 denkbar einfach. Der Adapter wird als "Drahtlose Anzeige" erkannt und verhält sich dann wie ein externer Monitor. Treiber werden im Hintergrund installiert der Adapter ist auch bei der ersten Verwendung rasch einsetzbar.Ab und zu kommt es zu Latenzen beim Weiterschalten von Folien. Bei Videos ist mir bisher keine Verzögerung aufgefallen. Insgesamt ist der Adapter sehr zuverlässig darauf kommt es uns am meisten an.
4,Very easy to install and set up. handy to use and carry as well.
4,Works well with my laptop and android tablet.  Slight lag but that is to be expected.  I did not expect it to be suitable for gaming.  I was hoping to have a better range as it seems to break up after about 5 metres
1,Um z.B. Videos auf meine TV's zu streamen habe ich mir diesen Adapter zugelegt. Laut Info's und Kundenrezessionen ein Kinderspiel!?Leider mit nichten: Das erste habe ich angeschlossen und auf dem TV war zu lesen 'Bereit zum verbinden -> Ready to connect...'. Mit Windows 10 habe ich es dann direkt versucht: Verbinden angeklickt... Nix! Und da nach mehrmals... Nix!OK! Smartphone Motoroloa G3 mit Andraod 6.x ... Nix... usw.!Auch OK! Tablett Samsung A10.1 (2016er Version) ... Nix... usw.!Gut habe ich ein defektes Gerät erwischt. Zurück zu Amazon und Ersatz geordert.Ersatz Gerät angeschlossen... Nix! o_OAlso muss es wohl ERROR 40 sein! (Problem sitzt 40 cm vor dem Display)In der Anleitung waren nur die drei Schritte erklärt. Auf der "Probelmbehebungsseite" standen auch nur die drei Schritte! Dementsprechend habe ich Google gequältund einige Infos von Anwendern Foren usw. gefunden. Ich habe es dann geschafft unter Geräte und Drucker (Win10) den Adapter zu finden und per PIN zu verbinden... das heisst aber nicht daß der Adapter dieses auch so sieht: PC Smartphone und Tablett schrieben 'Verbindung hergestellt'. Auf dem TV stand nur 'connecting' und nach einiger Zeit wieder 'Ready to connect'. Die verhandlung scheiterte wohl.Nach etlichen Versuchen mit diversen TV's und externem Netzteil habe ich nach ca. 5 Stunden aufgegeben und Ersatzlos zurück gesendet!Meine Empfehlung: Finger weg lassen! Ich gucke mir gerade Systeme von Realtek an. Die haben mich bislang nicht im Stich gelassen.
1,This is a seemingly simplistic item to use however when in hand this proved otherwise for me. The adapter relies on a WiFi connection from both parties the party you want to transmit the screen from and also the receiving display. It was problematic trying to configure this with an Ethernet wired PC which of course is quite common and is something you would have thought Microsoft would have considered. I purchased the item as I cannot wire a HDMi from my PC to my TV. I thought that this would be a suitable replacement however that turned out to be not. I have heard that it is virtually useless for anything other than simple work such as word processors anyway. For video it will lag and play up.
5,Great product if you don't have a WiFi connection but have mobile data.
5,Die Lieferung war sehr schnell gut verpackt und die Installation kinderleicht. Wenn man Videos mit Ton übertragen möchte ruckelt es teilweise ziemlich vor allem der Ton aber wir nutzen es für Bilder und Präsentationen dafür funktioniert es perfekt. Man muss am PC nichts installieren. Nur verbinden und schon kann der Bildschirm geteilt werden. Ich bin sehr zufrieden genau das wonach ich gesucht habe.
5,Also vorweg! Das WDA (Wireless Display Adapter) funktioniert besser als ich überhaupt erwartet hatte! Zudem: Maxdome behauptet steif und fest dass man aus der Windows App heraus nicht per Wireless Display Adapter streamen kann. Ähm nein! Das klappt! Und zwar wirklich erstaunlich gut! Continuum machts möglich!Fakt ist ich streame mittlerweile alles vom Lumia 950 auf das WDA! Office Anwendungen genauso wie Youtube Videos etc. Und eben auch Maxdome!Gelegentlich kommt es beim Videostreaming im Bild zu Kleinstrucklern oder auch Microruckler genannt. Wer sich daran stört ok.. Mich beeinflusst das eigentlich kaum bis gar nicht. der Ton ist hervorragend und ich kann mich nicht beklagen!!
5,Great device if you have a win 10 laptop and want it on the big screen. Its small so portable enough to carry it around as well. No setup needed just plug in change input  press win key and P and select wireless display it's that easy.
3,le problème majeure est la compatibilité matériel de ce produit : même avec Windows 10 certains appareil ne sont pas compatibleIl faut absolument être sur du Intel compatible Miracast : Ma tablette ne l'est pas  dommageSinon ça marche pas mal : à part le son qui est tres basSi vous voulez profiter de HD  passez votre cheminCe truc est en fait plutôt réservé à des présentations Powerpoint sans trop d'animation ni de sonEn tout cas ne remplace pas un bon cable HDMI
5,Si quieres pasar la imagen de android apple o pc a una tv o proyector sin depender de una red wifi de casa este dispositivo es perfecto crea su propia red wifi. Yo veo la TV de la operadora movil o videos de internet con datos 4G y los puedo ver en grande en la TV o proyector sin depender de una red wifi que no tengo en una finca en el campo. Probé con cables MHL y nada son pocos los dispositivos que lo tienen y es una tecnología un tanto abandonada (supongo que por temas de licencia). Esto es fantástico.
4,Fonctionne très bien et pas compliqué lors de la 1ère utilisation
5,J'ai acheté cet élément pour afficher sur mon téléviseur des "choses" que je regardais su mon petit portable (vidéos films photos etc). Connexion facile rien à paramétrer s'adapte aux différentes résolutions d'écran ; il peut arriver que ça ne fonctionne pas dès la première tentative mais au second click ça marche.
4,Le meilleur adaptateur display sur le marché avec un wifi autonome pas besoin de connexion internet.Même si il manque des améliorations niveau signal il est parfait pour les nomades comme moi.
4,Usefull product to use any display as wireless display without the need of a router or any other internet device.
2,qualité médiocre
4,Very good quality video and sound on the connected TV display sound and video well synced on the TV. If duplicating computer screen on TV then slight lag between appearance on computer screen and the TV.
5,Habe mir den drahtlos Display Adapter für mein Surface Book geholt damit ich damit den Desktop auf meinen smart TV streamen kann.Einfach den Display Adapter in einen freien USB (ich habe extra den mit 1A Ausgangsstrom gewählt) und HDMI Port am Smart TV stecken und fertig.Zum Verbinden mit dem TV den Adapter ansteuern und in den Verbindungseinstellungen des Surface den Adapter auswählen. Die Übertragung läuft sehr flüssig und ohne Zeitverzögerung.Mit einer offiziellen Microsoft App für den Adapter können weitere Einstellungen wie Sprache und Updates vorgenommen werden.
3,Die Verbindung war nicht zufrieden stellend. Ebenso war die Bildübertragung stark verzögernd obwohl der Abstand unter 1m bestand. Sehr enttäuscht..
4,al primo collegamento ho subito pensato : da buttare. non si connetteva al pc. letto innumerevoli guide ma nulla.poi giusto per  ho provato a cambiare la porta HDMI e come per incanto collegato. devo dire soddisfatto al 100 %. ho anche il chromecast ma questo della Microsoft è più immediato e di facile utilizzo.consigliato davvero. unica nota negativa è il prezzo davvero alto rispetto alla concorrenza.servizio amazon ineccepibile
2,It works but still is not very snappy. Also the quality of the image changes which is disappointing. I end up not using it at all as it takes some time to connect and is not really great.
3,I can't really write a review of the product other than to say 'it looks OK' because I haven't been able to use it as hoped for. As soon as I connected it to my Tv and then connected my laptop I received an onscreen message telling me I need Windows 10 in order for the device to function.I think it would a great idea if this vital piece of information had been made clear on the advertisement!!
4,Can be a little temperamental if switched on for too long (i.e. several hours) but otherwise good product that has reinvigorated our (non-Smart) TV.  Works well with Windows 10 laptops and Android phones and tablets.
4,Nice and tiny adapter to connect the Surface Pro to TV and play anything on TV from your Surface Pro.Distance is less than 20 meters and there are couple of issue on initial connectivity with the Surface Pro.Very Costly.
4,Ist gut aber ein bisschen zu teuer
3,VERY juddery able to use for presentations but nowhere near the quality required for watching TV or films. Range is great.Has some lag from pc to tv also. Unable to get it to work as extend or duplicate either although this may be compatibility issue.Sometimes need to reset device as no audio on connection. Overall a 3/5 with the potential to be 5/5. Would not buy at full price again knowing what I do now.
5,Génial ce truc! J’ai une télé pas récente (plus de 10ans) et une tablette pas récente non plus (Lenovo plus de 5ans) et le truc était installé en 20 secondes chrono et marche à la perfection! Pas donné à l’achat contrairement au câble direct mais vraiment top car on peut recharger la tablette en même temps.
5,Funktioniert per Handy (Sony Xperia zx und Samsung s9) am Sony Smart-TV (Android TV) und im Urlaub an einem einfachen Philips TV. Bildqualität ist völlig in Ordnung Kopplung dauert ein paar Sekunden danach ist die Verbindung stabil.Das Teil macht haptisch einen guten Eindruck. Wir nutzen es um damit im Urlaub streamingdienste auf dem TV anzusehen.
5,Ich habe den Adapter zurückgeschickt weil er für meinen Einsatz leider nicht brauchbar war. Er kann nur Auflösungen bis 1920x1080. Auf größeren Auflösungen wird das Bild nicht skaliert und es sieht nicht mehr gut aus
5,Works great for Wireless HDMI from my HP Spectre 360 Comvertable Windows 10 laptop.  A slight lag at full HD on mouse movements but video streams seamlessly.  If you adjust resolution down to 720p then it is smooth.  This is a limitation of the technology and not specifically this device.  I updated firmware but installing the Wireless Display Adapter Windows App and that helped the stability.  Overall I am very happy
4,Works well but if you are streaming a video to your laptop and then streaming it back to your monitor you will probably find quality decreases as it overloads your wifi network. Instructions could have been better.
4,Macht was man erwartet. Die von anderen geschilderten Probleme kann ich nicht nachvollziehen. Weder das Problem mit Verbindungsabbrüchen noch die Probleme mit der Qualität.
4,Du simple plug & play. Reconnaissance immédiate par un Windows 10. Aucun problème
5,Excellent product. We have fitted this to TVs in every meeting room at work so that our staff can connect their Windows 10 laptops seamlessly. We even use them on the TVs that have inbuilt wireless connectivity because we find these simpler more reliable and they give a better quality picture.You need to be pretty close to use it for video streaming but PowerPoint presentations from across the room are fine!
1,Wollte den Stick fürs Streamen von meinem Surface Pro 4 auf meinen Smart TV.Angesteckt die dazugehörige App aus dem Store installiert geupdatet und dann go......oder halt auch nicht :DDer Bildschirm wurde zwar angezeigt aber die Übertragungsrate war weit unter 5 Bildern pro Sekunde.....ein "Zielen" mit der Maus auf ein Icon musste also als Vektor 20 Sekunden vorher berechnet werden.Hab mich in einem Technik Shop meines Vertrauens erkundigt und den Stick dort geteste: selbes ErgebnisIch habe den Stick dann behalten um evtl. mal ne Powerpoint oder mal Bilder auf nem Fernseh zu zeigen für mehr war hier wohl nichts möglich.Ich ging also von einem Einzelproduktmagel aus und habe mir den selben Stick im Laden bei einer Sale-Aktion ein viertel Jahr später erneut gekauft:Leider wieder die selbe Geschichte! Der Stick wirde dann resetet weil ich dachte ich könnte ihn auch ohne aktuelle Software nutzen doch das stellte sich ebenfalls als Enttäuschung heraus.Von mir also leider keine Kaufempfehlung da hier Softwaretechnisch einfach noch viel Luft nach oben ist. UPDATES DRINGEND BENÖTIGT!PS: falls jmd noch einen Streaming-Stick benötigt.....ich bin dann auf ein "Netgear PushTV 3000" umgestiegen der funktioniert hervoragend. Sehr flüssige Bildrate bei Aualitäten von 1080p und sogar bis zu 4k. (mehrere Youtubevideos getestet Filme gestreamt)Gruß Felix
2,Der Adapter funktioniert nur bei jedem 3. Versuch. Manchmal wird er von meinem Surface oder Handy gefunden in den meisten Fällen aber leider auch nicht. Somit ist er für mich leider nicht zu gebrauchen. Da ich mit einem Microsoft SurfaceBook arbeite ist das Ganze noch ärgerlicher. Zumindest in der eigenen Produktpalette sollte man solche Probleme nicht haben. Wenn er denn funktioniert ist die Übertragung sehr gut. Bewegte Bilder haben gerade noch so gute Qualität.
5,Top tient ses promesses.Je l'utilise avec un PC qui est dans la pièce d'à coté (pas de mur en béton entre les 2) et ça marche super bien.J'aurais aimé (ou alors je n'ai pas trouvé comment faire) pouvoir gérer automatiquement la connexion lorsque l'écran sans fil est actif mais bon c'est déjà super bien !
4,con nokia lumia 640 xl e tablet hp per ora è perfetto  riproduce filmati da netflix o foto con buona qualità . acquistato per lavoro ( si può fare a meno di lunghi cavi hdmi) si rivela una valida risorsa pure in casa . a differenza della google cromecast proietta qualsiasi contenuto a prescindere dall'assenza di app specifiche. per il momento non mi sembra che incida molto sui consumi del telefono o tablet.
1,Ich habe mir den Wireless Adapter gekauft um mein Asus Notebook mit meinem Samsung TV 6. Serie zu verbinden und das Bild auf dem TV zu streamen.Bin dan gleich beim verbinden draufgekommen das es auch ohne Adapter geht da mein TV in der Verbindungsliste von win10 zusammen mit dem Adapter aufgeführt wird.Nach kurzem testen bemerkte ich auch gleich das es ohne Adapter viel besser geht sprich flüssiger weniger zeitverzögert und mehr ReichweiteMit dem Adapter hab ich eine gefühlte Sekunde Zeitverzögerung wenn das notebook direkt neben dem TV ist sobald ich den Raum verlasse fangt das Bild an zu stocken und brich dann auch bald ab. Also der Adapter ist für mich unbrauchbar zum zocken gehts gar nicht ( ist auch wahrscheinlich nicht dafür gedacht) aber auch zu internet surfen sehr schwer mit der Maus zurecht zukommen wegen der Zeitverzögerung.Ohne Adapter also mit der integrieren Funktion vom TV funktioniert das wesentlich besser solang mann auch im gleichen Raum bleibt wenn man den Raum verlässt wird die Zeitverzögerung größer aber es Bild bleibt stabil.Dann frag ich mich schon wieso baut microsoft einen Wireless Adapter was ca 50€ kostet der für nichts zu gebrauchen ist ( höchstens zum Bilder streamen) es aber technisch besser möglich wäre!
2,Ich habe mir den Adapter zugelegt um Filme vom Laptop auf dem Fernseher abspielen zu können. Anfangs hat das auch recht gut geklappt. Das Verbinden mit dem Laptop war kein Problem und Filme liefen relativ flüssig auf dem Fernseher. Jetzt nach ungefähr einem Monat hängt sich das Ding nur noch auf. Manchmal läuft die Verbindung für einige Zeit ganz gut dann ruckelt es nur noch und die Verbindung bricht ab. Gerade kann ich mich garnicht mehr Verbinden und schreibe deshalb jetzt die Bewertung. So wie es jetzt ist leider völlig unbrauchbar!!!
4,Ça fonctionne bien avec mon écran
5,Ich bin wirklich zufrieden. Ich nutze den Adapter mit einem Surface und es läuft sehr flüssig. Klare Empfehlung!
3,Que direNe fonctionne pas sur TOUT les pc cela dépend aussi des mises à jour et du système d’exploitation (faut Windows10) la connexion peut s'estomper soudainement l'adaptateur à tendance à chauffer vitesinon c'est assez pratique dans l’ensemble(film).Le prix est assez élevé ca aurait été plus rentable dans les alentour de 30 à 40€
5,Sehr einfach zu verbinden und tolle Bild- und Tonübertragung
5,Great product works great with Win10. Not tried with other devices but seems to work well with presentions only downside was a small bit of lag with video but mostly consistent casting experience.
5,branche sur la télé de ma chambre pour regarder avec mon Windows phone canal plus en vidéo à la demande.et je l'emporte avec moi quand je suis en déplacement en vacance pour le brancher sur la télé ou je me trouve pour la même chose.
5,Coole Sache wenn man einen kleinen Raum hat und trotzdem eine Präsi macht ohne Kabel Verbindung.
4,L'appareil envoie bien en 1080 60 fps on peut regarder un film facilement. Par contre faire attention à ce que votre appareil soit compatible et surtout j'ai eu plus de difficultés à le configurer que les autres appareils miracast que j'ai eu ce qui est dommage pour un appareil officiel microsoft.
4,Pour le nomade que je suis en mode continuum avec le Lumia 950 xl c'est génial en vacance dans le bungalow branché s/ la tv. Par contre avec le Surface la diffusion est moyenne petit ralentissement pour les vidéos 1080p. Pour les Os concurrent c'est du mirroring bof.
4,Installé sur un écran de télévision pour avoir la copie d'écran de l'ordinateur. Marche plutôt bien pas de décalage.
5,Weis nicht was die leute hier haben. Filme laufen absolut Ruckelfrei. Spiele kann ich nicht empfehlen wegen der leichten eingabeverzögerung aber der hauptaugenmerk bei diesem produkt liegt doch sowieso beim arbeiten und hier gibt es nicht einen kritikpunkt.
4,This device works on both of the TV's at home and allows me to connect with a windows 10 pc and a surface exactly what I wanted it to do.
5,Dongle super facile à installer et à utiliser. Mon téléviseur n'étant pas équipé de port USB j'ai réalisé l'alimentation avec un simple transformateur du type chargeur de portable. La connexion internet est conservée puisque le dongle utilise le protocole Miracast. Montée en température assez rapide je sais pas si c'est normale. Fonctionne avec mon Samsung S3 je dois encore le tester avec une tablette Samsung Tab A6 que je n'ai pas encore reçu. Je vous tiendrai au courant.
5,TRANSFER de vidéo sur un vidéoprojecteur
3,Installation pas simple  pour avoir acheté un produit  copie écran "alexa "ensuitepas photo : achat a éviter cher difficile a initialiser explications pas claires  logiciel a installer / pas simple
5,Parfait pour étendre l'affichage le produit est parfaitement compatible avec la technologie Miracast et fonctionne a merveille avec ma TV.Dommage qu'ils aient triplé le prix depuis mon achat du 12 décembre 2019 (achat à 1999€) !
5,Made my life easier as i have no tv. Fixed to my monitor prerty easily.
5,Dieser Dongle hat meinen Fernseher erweitert so daß ich jetzt auch Filme vom PC auf dem TV ansehen kann.
5,Super geeignet zum Projizieren von Präsentationen. Beim Zeigen von Filmen zu viele Verzögerungen.
4,Il prodotto è senz'altro più caro rispetto ad altri presenti sul mercato (che giustifica solo 4 stelle) ma ho preferito prenderlo in quanto col marchio Microsoft ero più tranquillo del suo funzionamento. Infatti è arrivato con la consueta puntualità di Amazon e dopo averlo scartato nonostante l'assenza di iistruzioni in italiano (ma non dovrebbe essere obbligatorio per le vendite nella CEE le istruzioni nel linguaggio del Paese del compratore ?) l'inserimento del dispositivo nel TV è semplicissimo e funziona immediatamente
5,Je l'ai eu en solde donc ça va.Mais sinon je trouve ça trop cher surtout si vous voulez le synchroniser avec un iphone. Il faudarait acheter l'appli à 60€.Bref je ne l'utilise que pour streamer mon laptop.
4,Braucht zwar immer zwei Anläufe bis zum Verbinden funktioniert dann aber super
5,The adapter works good with my Lumia 640 LTE (Windows 10 mobile build *.318). Quickly detected and connected and also easy to setup with the related app available on the store: you can change the language restart the adapter adjust the edges on your tv and check the firmware. No problem viewing contents with Netflix or Movies&TV app by Microsoft with good video and audio quality but there is a slight lag between what you see on your source device and the projected screen so it's not recommended for the games.
5,reçu en 24H00 installé en 2 minutes !!testé sur sony m5 ok lg g3 ok  surface 3 ok  portable toshiba I5 windows 10 ok  et tablette cube talk9xcertains parlent de latence j'en ai aucuneimage top  son top !finition topj'ignore ce que valent les modeles a 20€ mais je regrette pas d'avoir laché 60 pour un outil qui fonctionneAvec iphone 4 pas reussi mais pas bataillé non plus
5,Die Lieferung kam sehr schnell an.Die Erstnutzung war nicht sehr aufwändig und ziemlich leicht.Nachdem der Adapter vom Notebook erkannt wurde verbindet sich sehr schnell mit dem Monitor bzw. Fersehgerät.Die Übertragung ist sehr gut. Die Präsentationen verliefen bis jetzt alle sehr flüssig.In Anbetracht der Tatsache dass die Vergleichbaren adequaten Lösungen weitaus mehr kosten kann ich diese Adapter ruhigen Gewissen empfehlen.
5,It's good product but at this expensive price ( I paid INR 12000) it may not be cost efficient in Indian market. Also not having an ability to integrate with iOS/Android phones isnt a good idea. Works well - simple to connect and get started.
5,Das Ding hat mich überrascht. Positiv weil ich jetzt nicht mehr irgendwelche Kabel an- und abklemmen muss über die ich stolpern könnte und damit teure Technik mit in den Tod reißen kann. Diese Gefahr besteht nicht mehr.Funktioniert super: Original Microsoft-Produkt.Zusammen mit meinem Lenovo inkl. Win 10 pro hat es auf Anhieb funktioniert.
5,C'est une prise HDMI - USB qui se branche d'un côté du fil sur la prise HDMI du téléviseur (ou de l'écran) et de l'autre côté du fil sur la prise USB du téléviseur (ou de l'écran). Instructions incluses facile à installer permet donc d'avoir plusieurs écrans sur un même poste sans fil.
5,Ce dispositif d'affichage sans fil me permet de projeter (mode d'affichage au choix : dupliquer étendre ou deuxième écran uniquement) sur ma TV l'affichage de mon PC portable sous Windows 10 à distance sans fil (en Wifi). Utilisation pour surfer regarder des films en 1080p ...c'est fluide et sans bugs. De plus je l'utilise avec mon téléphone portable Microsoft Lumia 950 en mode Continuum et là aussi pas de problème constater fonctionne parfaitement. Que du bonheur.
1,- Lieferung war okay- Preis für das was es kann VIEL zu teuerHardware - gut verarbeitet ABER trotz mini USB Verlängerung viel zu kurze Kabel ( nicht für alle TV geeignet  wo die Schnittstellen etwas auseinander liegen )- bei eng gesetzten  HDMI Schnittstellen wird es sehr problematisch des Ding unter zu bekommen ( hab nen VGA am TV direkt daneben - da gehts wegen dem fetten Rechteck gar nicht  dran vorbei - Das ist extrem nervig und vom Hersteller nicht durchdacht.an meinen TV Geräten ( Panasonic & Samsung )in Verbindung mit Iphone SE  kann das Teil null und nichts !connection nicht möglich !mit dem dem Iphone SE am PC Monitor klappt es bedingt  ..Die Funktionen sind eingeschränkt - Spiegelung vom Zubringer Gerät klappt teilweise - Steaming von Vid bricht ständig ab - egal aus welcher Quelle gesteamt wird -- daher eigendlich unbrauchbar ! und hinkt der Zeit hinterher !- das handling bzw die connection hat erst nach etlichen Versuchen hingehauenwürd es mir nicht wieder kaufen - nict mal für nen 10nerGeldverschwendung ! nicht alltagstauglich
5,Transmits video over WiFi Direct (does not require an intermediate router) to your TV or projector. I use mine to transmit a full quality (no apparent compression) screen image from my Samsung Galaxy tablet to my projector. You require both an HDMI port and a USB B (for power) type socket on your display device and obviously WiFi on your computer/tablet. Both my devices use WUXGA (1920x1200) resolution so it works properly up to those resolutions at least.
5,Perfect Device for wireless streaming.The Device requires a USB and a close by HDMI slot available.At the Laptop/Device level one just needs to use the Connect option from Action centre and connect to it .. as simple as that.- Steady streaming- No Delays- I also use this to configure my television as extended screen for my laptop.Very useful and without the hassle of cables.
3,Purchased for MS Lumia phones 1x 640 and 1x 640xl for some reason the MS App on the 640xl wouldn't update firmware but same App on the regular 640 did curious. That said both phones connected to device and TV perfectly.Since buying have ditched the Windows phones and pleased to report that the device allows me to connect Huawei P8 Lite to TV.
5,Schnelle Lieferung super Möglichkeit einfacher Einsatz selbsterklärend und unkompliziert
4,Really easy to use and works well. Transfers phone video to TV. Good if you havent got screen mirroring built into your TV
5,Ohne besonderes Lob und Tadel. Ich bin zufrieden.
5,Parfait
5,I bought this as a curiosity at first. But use it almost everyday now. Being able to quickly connect my phone or tablet to my TV is amazing. Takes seconds to connect and then I just use my TV as a huge screen for my gadgets. Just what it is meant for really :) It is a bit expensive but is so simple to use.
1,Ich habe letztes Jahr diesen Adapter auf Amazon gekauft. Nun funktioniert er seit einigen Wochen nicht mehr und Amazon hat mir mitgeteilt dass mein Ansprechpartner für Gewährleistungsansprüche Microsoft direkt ist. Nachdem ich mich an Microsoft gewandt habe mit der Bitte hier zu helfen kam als erste Antwort dass ich keine Garantie mehr auf das Produkt hätte. Als ich im Anschluss auf mein gesetzliches Gewährleistungsrecht aufmerksam gemacht hat hat man mir mitgeteilt ich hätte eine einjährigen Garantie beim Kauf zugestimmt und hätte keine weiteren Ansprüche. Ich hoffe dass dies nur mit einer inkompetenten Mitarbeiterin im Support zusammen hängt nehme den Fall aber jetzt trotzdem zu einen Anwalt.
5,Benötige ich um mein Surface Book an den Beamer anschließen zu können. Funktioniert einwandfrei.
5,Vor der Bestellung war ich skeptisch ob der funktioniert wenn ich gesehen hab dass so viele Leute negativ bewertet haben.Aus der technischen Sicht finde ich die Funktionalität dieses Adapters akzeptierbar ist wenn man den Preis mit berücksichtigt.Fürs zuhause wäre er eine gute Option. Man kann natürlich keine professionelle Qualität erwarten.Nur eine Verbesserung wäre erwünscht wenn der Adapter mit dem WLAN Router direkt verbindet werden kann.
4,Ich habe den Wireless Display Adapter mit 4 Geräten ausprobiert. Bei drei hat es super funktioniert (unter Windwos 10) Bei einem älteren Gerät hat es nicht geklappt. Bis 5 m Abstand ist die Qualität sehr gut. Bei größerem Abstand wackelt es schon Mal oder das Signal bricht ganz ab
4,Ersetzt bei mir einen Netgear PTV3000 der sich mit einem Windows 10 Rechner nicht verbinden wollte. Mit dem Microsoft V2 Adapter ging das auf Anhieb bei ruckfreier Übertragung. Die beiden Stecker HDMI/USB sind etwas dick geraten; in das Seitenfach meines TV lassen sich beide nur leicht abgwinkelt einstecken. Die Firmware Aktualisierungs App zum V2 Adapter erfordert leider einen Microsoft Store Account.
1,Leider enttäuschend ein Odys Windows 10 Tablet verbindet sich grundsätzlich nur mit dem Stick wenn sowohl Stick als auch Tablet frisch gestartet sind ein weiteres China Tablet mit Windows 8.1 funktioniert einen Tick besser d.h. da funktioniert die Verbindung mit Stick auch mal beim zweiten Mal ohne vorherigen Neustart.Wenn die Verbindung da ist dann funktiniert die Übertragung gut allerdings  sind bei über 3 Meter auch mal Verbindungsabrüche drin (leider verbunden mit anschließendem Neustart aufgrund der Zickigkeit des Sticks).Ein Android 5.0 Handy (Yotaphone) verbindet sich mit dem Stick (gleiche Einschränkung wie beim Win10 Tablet 2x verbinden ohne Neustart geht leider nicht). Wenn die Verbindung da ist funktioniert die Bildschirm spiegelung allerdings nur bis im Browser eine Webseite geöffnet wird auf der ein 'Video wiedergegeben wird oder gar die Youtube App dann ist die Verbindung sofort weg. Lokale Videos funktinieren nur ohne Ton.In jedem Fall: wenn etwas schief geht ist immer Neustart von Stick und Handy/Tablet angesagt da sonst keine Verbindung mehr möglich ist obwohl der Stick am TV anzeigt dass er auf ein Gerät wartet und bereit wäre.Glüchlicherweise bei Amazon gekauft die stellen sich bei Rückgaben wenigstens nicht blöd an.
5,Funktioniert alles ohne Probleme Handhabung erklärt sich von selbst ansonsten wird auch nochmal angegeben was zu tun ist.Übertragungsqualität ist auch ok nur der Preis finde ich für dieses kleine Ding etwas krass. Leider geht es mit alternativen Produkten kaum da sich mein Surface GO nur mit orginalen Microsoft Produkten Verbinden lässt.
5,Wir wollten schnell ohne Kabel im Seminarraum den Beamer anbinden um Bilder oder Präsentationen (keine bewegten Bilder) an die Wand zu werfen. Da wir technisch unbegabt sind haben wir alle Rezessionen und Youtube durchstöbert und haben uns für diesen wireless Adapter entschieden. Funktioniert klar und sauber auf Anhieb.Was wollen wir mehr.
5,Je peux connecter tout appareil souhaité sans aucune difficulté (smartphone tablette ordinateur). Le câble usb peut se connecter à une prise secteur si votre télé ne possède pas de ports usb. Très discret simple d'utilisation. Je ne pense plus pouvoir m'en passer.
4,El conector funciona (casi) perfectamente con una surface pro 4. Lo único que me ocasiona alguna molestia es cuando simultáneamente a la emisión de contenidos conecto un disco externo al puerto USB. En ese momento corta la conexión con el adaptador. No pasa lo mismo con un pendrive. No sé si será cuestión de que el disco tiene mayores requerimientos energéticos y el wifi lo sufre.
1,Windows 10 AMD 270 AMD Phenom II x6.It kinda works sometimes but unstable and setup is convoluted as hell in best traditions of Micro$oft.Every time I want to watch a video on a big screen which is only 2 metres away from my computer with a Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter it fails to connect and I have to re-install wireless display adapter/drivers/wifi adapter/something/reboot 5 times and each time is unique!Basically you have to randomly add and delete device plug and unplug WiFi adapter just like you used to do in Windows 95 20 years ago.Plug and Play? No way!Even if you were able to connect it drops frames stutters hangs and drops connection.I keep it only for Windows 95-like experience when I feel nostalgic but probably I shall send it back soon life is too short to deal with such a crap.
4,dem Firmwareupdate (etwas umständlich) läuft der Adapter bis jetzt ohne Probleme. Manchmal kommt es nach längerem Gebrauch (mehrere Stunden) zu Fragmenten was aber nach Ein- und Ausschalten wieder weg ist.
5,Super ! Donner des conférences ou faire des formations équipé d'un projecteur vidéo avec une liaison wifi.... génial ! Il suffit de connecter le Microsoft Wireless Display et instantanément l'image est dupliquée sur grand écran ou sur un mur. Tellement satisfait que j'ai acheté un deuxième exemplaire pour équiper mon écran TV (prise hdmi et usb) ce qui me permet de voir mes vidéos et photos persos sur mon écran.
5,Nice! No extra word needed. Arrived in less then 24 hour! Do what its need to do! Tonight gona be a moovie night! Thank you so much! :D
3,Not for gaming.. I lose a lot of frame per second and it lags sometimes.. makes some AAA games unplayable at all..
5,Super wenn man dann doch mal etwas "komplexere" Arbeiten (wie z.B. die Steuererklärung) mit dem Surface Go durchführen will: Wireless Maus und Tastatur Tablet per Wireless Adapter mit dem Fernseher verbinden und gemütlich vom Sofa aus arbeiten...Installation und Verbinden hat ohne Probleme geklappt und mit der App von Microsoft konnte auch gleich ein Firmwareupdate installiert werden.
5,Für den Preis sehr gut. Ob in der Schule oder der Uni an der Arbeit keine lästigen Kabel mehr. Und nicht wie bei Apples TV ständig Anfragen auf dem Display bzgl. Kopplung.Etwa 10m Reichweite mit surface und laptop
5,Habe für meinen Partyraum eine Möglichkeit gesucht für Karaoke-Parties einen Fernseher relativ frei von Kabelverlegungen als Zweitbildschirm aufstellen zu können. Dafür ist der Wireless Display Adapter super geeignet. So kann ich auf dem Laptop die Karaoke-Videos mit Audioverbindung zur Musikanlage starten und auf dem Fernseher als zweiten Bildschirm kabellos das Video mit Textführung anzuzeigen. Als Programm nutze ich dafür den frei verfügbaren Videolan-Player.Funktioniert Klasse.
5,Ich verwende den Adapter in Verbindung mit einem Surface Pro 4 / Lumia 950 XL. Auf dem Surface wird der Adapter als Bildschirm erkannt und man kann damit arbeiten wie mit einem normalen Display. Auf dem Handy kann man zwischen Klonen (Bildschirm = Handybildschirm) oder Erweitert wählen wobei man dann Continuum auf diesem Display nutzen kann. Alles in allem ein super Produkt. Manchmal sind leichte Rukler festzustellen aber bei reiner Office-Verwendung oder Video schauen ist fast kein Unterschied zu einer Kabellösung feststellbar.
5,Die Funktionsweise des Wireless Display Adapter ist hervorragend. Ich nutze ihn um das Signal vom Notebook auf einen Monitor zu streamen.Mitgeliefert ist neben dem Kabel auch eine verlängerung sodass die beiden Ports (HDMI USB) nicht zwingend direkt nebeneinander liegen müssen.Das größte Problem ist einen Monitor zu finden der sowohl über einen HDMI als auch USB-Port verfügt. :-)P.S.: Rezensionen schreiben kostet mich viel Zeit. Ich mach das für Sie um Ihnen bei der Produktauswahl zu helfen. Daher klicken Sie bitte auf "hilfreich" für die Mühe die ich mir mit jeder Rezension mache.
1,I bought this to connect my Surface Pro 4 (Windows 10) to my LG HDTV despite reading a few reviews of people having issues with connection and assuming that they were simply a bit unfortunate in their experience. However I have had constant problems with connecting to my Surface.It has connected only twice for maybe an hour or so before disconnecting and since then I have not made a successful connection lasting more than a few seconds.I have tried resetting the adaptor installing the current firmware and made sure all my Windows updates are the latest but to no avail. Sadly I have now made the decision to return the item and now have ordered a hard wire cable instead.I hope Microsoft sorts this issue out and that everyone else has a bit better luck with their wireless adaptors!
5,I could set it up easily and connect my surface pro 3 to it by one click. It is easy to use ans very useful. You can duplicate or extend your screen for your work or watching movie. However it shows some delay while playing movie. But i have tested other wireless adapters from other brands and they are better. The technology is still growing.
4,Non compatible windows7.
4,leider synchronisiert er bei Windows-Anwendungen die Mouse-Symbole manchmal nicht.
5,Excellent bit of kit plug into TV switch to correct hdmi input go to 'project my screen' in settings on my lumia 1520 wait for msdisplay to appear tap on it and away you go. Previous to this I would need to download photos to pen to display on tv and video would have to be converted to new format no such problems now.
5,I Love this itemit works seamlessly with my Razer Laptop running Windows !0 and the set up was fantastic and easy - simply open the notifications bar then click connect!I haven't stopped using it especially as I can now dual screen or Extend it while I'm watching movies and playing games!
5,Fantastic device. Just plugged it in into my 10 year old Panasonic telly and it gives instructions on screen. First my phone Lumia 950XL connected and worked brilliantly as a continuum display with sound and fast response. Then my Lenovo Win10 laptop just found it and can use it as though it were a 2nd monitor plugged in. Can use it as duplicated or extended desktop. Exactly what I had hoped it would be.
5,Le produit est vraiment excellent. L’image est très bonne et la latence très raisonnable. Par ailleurs c’est très facile à utiliser avec un pc win10.Par contre j’ai du le commander chez un concurrent car malgré 3 tentatives Amazon Logistic n’as jamais réussi à me le livrer...
5,j'ai acheté ce module pour raccorder un vidéo projecteur avec quelques doute rapport à des commentaires contradictoire.pour ma part ce module fonctionne parfaitement connexion quasi instantanée fluidité très satisfaisante avec une distance supérieure à 10 mètres et pourvue d'obstacle.
5,Nach mehrmaligem Neustart des Adapters und erfolglosen Verbindungsversuchen funktionierte danach die Kopplung jedes mal einwandfrei.Auch eine einstündige Verbindung während eines Youtube-Videos funktionierte ohne Probleme.Dabei wurde auch keinerlei Ruckeln beobachtet.Die Verzögerung beim Bedienen des Surface Book ist zwar zu sehen hält sich aber sehr in Grenzen.Die Verbindung mit dem Microsoft Lumia 950 XL war ebenso problemlos möglich.Vor allem war ich überrascht dass Continuum auch über die Miracast-Verbindung möglich war.Die Bedienung über das 950XL als Maus-Ersatz ist genial.
4,Funktioniert wie es soll.
4,A good and better (?) alternative to Chromcast. No fuss to connect with either windows devices (notebook/mobiles) and Android gadgets. However it's a bit pricey I must admit.
3,NOT SUITABLE FOR STREAMING VIDEO. Works exactly as described connecting is a breeze! But this product has lag when streaming video it definetly misses frames particularly noticable during speech and action scenes.If its being used for presentations/pictures then its great.
4,Se cercate un apparecchio per il mirroring da cellulare a tv tramite miracast questo è l'unico che davvero funziona.Assurdo però che non si possa aggiornare se non si ha un pc con WiFi di ultima generazione
5,Top Produkt bei dem die Übertragung spielend einfach funktioniert.
4,Ottimo adattatore. Facile da usare e configurare. Trasmette senza problemi flussi video in FullHD. Non è adatto per chi vuole giocare. Ma per fare lo streaming di youtube e netflix è ottimo. Unico difetto il cavo usb per l'alimentazione molto corto se si ha tv un po' vecchie e non provviste di usb. Risolvibile con una prolunga usb da pochi €
1,Die Empfangsleistung war von Anfang an sehr bescheiden (3 m). Nach Umstellung auf Windows 11 mit einem neuen Tablett nicht mehr funktionsfähig. Warum gibt es kein Update? Gibt es wenigstens eine Kulanzregelung beim Erwerb eines aktuellen Gerätes?
3,an den mehreren Monitoren hat es nicht funktioniert. Es braucht offensichtlich sowohl ausreichend USB Power als auch einen HDMI Eingang der auf Empfang steht damit der Adapter überhaupt startet. Am Beamer für den es gedacht war funktioniert startet sich der Adapter aber wenn man manuell auf den richtigen HDMI Eingang schaltet
5,Die V1  von diesem Gerät war ja so eine Sache für sich. Die jetztige V2 läuft auch nach 8 Stunden ununterbrochene nutzung Perfket und die einbindung in Win10 ist auch super einfach. Und man hat so einfach und schnell einen 2. Monitor angeschlossen der auch gerne ein paar meter weiter steht
5,Utile pour projeter mon ordinateur sur videoprojecteur.  Plus besoin de câble HDMI et possibilité de projeter de nimporte où dans la pièce.Reconnu par mon ordinateur dans connections sans fil très rapidement
5,Parfait avec ma tablette Android. Beaucoup mieux qu'un EZCast AnyCast ou autre.Une fois branché ça marche de suite.La qualité est tout à fait satisfaisante.Si vous avez trouvé mon commentaire utile indiquez-le-moi en cliquant sur le bouton ci-dessous afin de continuer à me motiver et ça fait toujours plaisir de savoir qu'on est lu et utile pour les autres personnes.
5,Gute Verarbeitung. Schnelle Verbindung vom Smartphone zum Beamer. Auch neue Smartphones sind schnell einzubinden. Beim Huawei P10 nur auf Drahlosprojektion drücken und schon ist es verbunden. Nur USB Verbindung für Strom könnte länger sein dafür habe ich aber eine Verlängerung genutzt.
1,Il prodotto risulta visibile al pc ma non si riesce a connettere. Dovrebbe essere una cosa automatica ma nulla. Tra l'altro provato su un pc Hp nuovo con Windows 11. Peccato che Microsoft non riesca a vendere prodotti funzionanti!!!
3,Had problems with the first one that was sent but the second one has been fine.Using these wireless display adapters is still not as fluid as a direct cable attach but where it is the only realistic option it works sufficiently well.
3,Fonctionne très bien si votre émetteur : PC smartphones et autres tablettes sont compatible avec l'appli ( Affichage sans fil ) à télécharger du Windows store ou play store. Pas adapté à Apple.Pour ma part seuls un smartphone honor 6 et une tablette Samsung sont reconnus pas le moto G4 ni mon PC Asus de 6 ans !
1,Se queda en modo conectando y al final da error en Microsoft no saben decirme porque
3,Sur le papier la solution est terrible dans les faits les lagues sur une vidéo en streaming est insupportable pour faire une simple présentation powerpoint oui mais pour le reste je suis dubitatif
5,Il n'y a pas de V2 à proprement parlé. Je n'ai rien trouvé chez Microsoft. Mais il était bien en firmware 2.xxx.Concernant son fonctionnement. C'est le plus simple. Mais ne fonctionne que pour Windows et Windows mobile.Facile et efficace que demander d'autre ?
5,Funktioniert top! Die Reichweite ist bei mir sogar deutlich über den angegebenen 10 Metern. Wird verwendet zur Darstellung eines Monitoring systems verwandt und ist sehr zuverlässig.
4,A great gizmo. With Windows 10 or Android you can easily display your screen on your TV. Really impressive for presentations and demonstrations.
5,Funktioniert einwandfrei auch die Kommunikation bei Problemen hat hervorragend funktioniert. Toller Service tolles Produkt wenn auch nicht ganz günstig.
5,Fantastico prodotto Microsoft non delude mai. Come trasportare via wireless segnali audio/video dal PC (e non solo) al TVDevi avere porta HDMI+USB nel televisore.
5,Vorher andere Produkte in dem Preissegment getestet. Alle waren schlecht in der Qualität.Schnell und einfach zu bedienen. Kann ich nur empfehlen.
5,Fantastic display from my laptop to TV/monitor wirelessly.Easy setup.Works pretty good with Android phone windows.Does not work with iPhone or iPad.
2,Works well if you want to mirror your screen to a TV or monitor with a HDMI socket; but only when doing basic tasks like word processing or PowerPoint. Doesn't work well for watching videos... your better of using a chromecast instead.One advantage this has over a chromecast is that you don't need to be connected to a wifi network to mirror your mobile/tablet or laptop screenWas quite expensive for not many features I paid ~ £35Hope this helps you make the right decision
5,verwendete Geräte: TerraPad 1161 und Metz TVDie Inbetriebnahme war denkbar einfach: am TV-Gerät einstöpseln kurz warten am Pad über "Verbinden" aktivieren "Display-Adapter" anwählen und nach knapp 4 Sekunden war das Tabletbild auf dem PC.Qualität der Übertragung perfekt. Bilder gestochen scharf Ton laut und klar Videos ruckelfrei.Getesteter Abstand etwas mehr als 5m.Kauf bisher eine sinnvolle Investition....Nachtrag:Keine Verbindung zwischen und TV und Samsung S3 / S4 bzw. iPhon6 möglich.
5,Item was well packaged and quick delivery.Set up was a brease all that was needed was a quick update and it's good to go.A great addition to the home works well with no lag.Have also expanded its use in business.Clients are happy with the hardware and use it daily.
5,This works takes a while to get the surface to connect as instructions are poor but once you have done it it works very well.  Have used it to connect to several different screens in training sessions.  No wire to get in the way.  Expensive but worth it
5,Super 👍
5,... aber acht geben dass nicht gleichzeitig zu viel sonstiger Netzwerkverkehr die Bandbreite limitiert! Werden Updates oder Synchronisationsdaten mit z.B. Cloud-Diensten im größeren Umfang gleichzeitig geladen bzw. auch der Upload von erheblichen Daten durchgeführt dann ist die Bandbreite für die Bildübertragung so stark eingeschränkt dass selbst die Anmeldung am wireless display Adapter schief läuft. - daher Updates und Cloud-Dienste pausieren - dann funktioniert selbst die Videoübertragung. Auch Abmelden vom bevorzugten Wifi hilft - Internet geht dann aber nicht mehr.
4,Endlich ein Displayadapter der ohne Probleme von meinen verschiedenen Geräten erkannt wird und auch gut funktioniert. Einschränkungen gibt es bei Videos diese Funktion benötige ich aber nicht. Ich musste nichts extra installieren keine Werbung kein sonstiger Schnickschnack. Die pure Funktion. So soll es sein. Ist sein Geld wert.
2,Das Bild und der Ton ruckeln bei wiedergaben von HD-Filmen die bei mir auf meinem Surface Pro 4 direkt abliegen. Die Entfernung vom Schreibtisch zum Samsung TV sind bei mir ca. 2 Meter. In meiner Beobachtung im Task-Manager vom PC ist mir aufgefallen dass ab einer höheren Datenübertragung an den Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter Probleme bekommt. Er kann diese Datenmengen einfach nicht mehr verarbeiten und kommt seiner Aufgabe nicht hinterher. Bei Bildern Musik oder Präsentationen mit weniger Informationen-Daten ist er super und erfüllt voll seine Funktionen.Ich vergebe somit nur zwei Sterne da mir das Produkt nicht gefällt da ich schon gerne Filme flüssig schauen wollte.Alle andere Produkte die ich besitze sind Top.
5,Works a treat. I put off buying for a while because on point of principle I figured Microsoft Surface should be able to cast wirelessly to displays (as nearly all much cheaper Android devices do)...however sadly you can't display principles ;). Anyway this does exactly what it's supposed to do...
5,A great alternative to HDMI with no apparent loss in quality (of course in theory there will be but I'm not noticing any). On one occasion I had screen tearing between frames restarting the adapter solved this. Used with a surface pro 4 2 meters in front of the TV on a 5Ghz channel without contending signals.
4,La connexion est stable et fonctionne bien.La prise en main est facile et l'adaptateur fonction tout de suite un petit bémol impossible de faire la mise à jour et les paramètre avec Androïde.
4,Affichage sans fil sous Windows 10
5,Après avoir testé 4 différents dongles Chromecast etc. Enfin celui-ci fonctionne parfaitement avec ma surface pro 4. Aucune coupure l'image est propre et le son parfait. Et tellement plus facile à installer que les autres. La configuration de projection est aussi simple que lorsque l'on utilise un 2ème écran. Ravi.  Donc je recommande si vous avez Windows X.
5,Fonctionne parfaitement avec les produits Microsoft tel que Lumia 950 XL Lumia 650 Surface Pro 4 et surfacebook 4.Branchement facile : utiliser un port HDMI de la télé (HDMI MHL si vous avez car c'est adapté pour cette utilisation) et sur un port USB de la télé.une très légère perte de qualité suivant les appareils et les obstacles.
5,Haben uns im Büro anstatt des lästigen und klobigen HDMI Kabel für diese kabellose Alternative entschieden.Der Wireless Adapter steckt nun seit Monaten im Beamer an der Decke ohne Probleme oder Aussetzer.Auf den Endgeräten verwenden wir überall Windows10 und hier funktioniert die Übertragung mühelos ohne Zusatzsoftware.Auch das ein oder andere Video/Livestream wurde schon ohne Probleme übertragen.Primär jedoch für Powerpoint/Text - hierfür gibts die vollen 5Sterne!
5,Funktioniert super mit meinen Surface Book mit meinem Lumia aber auch mit meinen Samsung Android Tablets und Phones. Einrichtung und Betrieb sind auch sehr einfach.Wer nun aber erwartet dass er mit vielen Wänden dazwischen und/oder FullHD Videos ohne Ruckler und/oder Artefakte streamen kann der wird enttäuscht - aber dafür ist dieser Stick auch nicht gedacht. Er funktioniert aber deutlich schneller und einfacher als z.B. der Chromecast-Stick oder die vergleichbare Apple-Technik.
4,The product is working perfectly as it should the delivery is also quick but unfortunately it can get uncomfortably hot during the use.
5,I've used this product for around 2 years and found it excellent. Even now when I can connect wirelessly I'll often use this connector on HD films as it gives less drop out than WiFi. Good product at a reasonable price.
5,Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter überzeugt!Problemlose Übertragung vom Handy auf Monitor.
5,It is useful.
4,Erleichtert die Übertragung von Handybildern oder PC/Tablet auf den Fernseher/Beamer. Es braucht kein WLAN-Zugang wie andere Produkte dieser Art. Funktioniert in der Regel zuverlässig.
5,Ich habe den Adapter mit Windows 10 (Notebook) und Windows 10 mobile (Lumia 950 & Lumia 640) getestet und bin wirklich begeistert!Da ich das Gerät beruflich (Schule) nutze war mit wichtig dass schnell eine Verbindung aufgebaut werden kann und dass auch Videos etc. angezeigt werden können. Beides ist mit den o.g. Geräte ohne Probleme möglich.Nachdem ich bereits mehrere (günstige) Fehlkäufe zu verzeichnen hatte ist dies der erste alltagstaugliche Adapter.
5,Verbindung zum SP 4 absolut problemlos und wird schnell aufgebaut.  Nutze es für die Arbeit in der Schule um unter anderem Schülerergebnisse abfotografieren präsentieren und von überall im Raum bearbeiten zu können. Habe bisher bis zu einem Abstand von c.a. 10 Meter getestet. Gab keine nennenswerten Probleme bei der Übertragung.
4,nach dem das Packet endlich da war (die Zustellungsbestätigung erfolgte schon einen Tag vor der tatsächlichen Zustellung) konnte ich das Gerät in weniger als 10 min in Betrieb nehmen.
5,Easy to set up with my surface pro 4 and projects instantly without any lag. Easy for others to connect to as well although best used within a 10 metre range otherwise an element of lag but nothing too bad
5,Mirrors my laptop to the tv easy to set up enables sound and vision on the big screen unfortunately it does not work with my iPad but that’s  not what I bought it for just tried it so no biggy does what it says it does no bother
4,Attention : certains PC plus ou moins compatibles (mêmes récents).
5,Fonctionnement parfait sur un vidéo projecteur en salle de réunion. Plus de câbles qui pendent du plafond !..il est très facile de changer le nom du boitier pour lui donner le nom de la salle de réunion.Connexion des surfaces Pro directement et immédiatement.Excellent produit je recommande.Livraison à la date prévue nickel.
5,After trying so many other options to cast from phones tablets and pc's OUTWITH or IGNORING surrounding WiFi this is it. Streams HD content easliy and without glitches. Superb.
5,Exactly as described
5,Facile d utilisation  !Un petit decallage mais pas gênant pour film musique etc... Pour le jeux je peux pas en dire autant.Ne fonctionne pas avec les appareils Android et Apple. ( ou je suis un boulet je sais pas...)Pour un hdmi sans fil à ce prix là  ?  Franchement chapeau.
3,INstallation war einfach.aber die Anbindung an Mircosoft ist nicht wirkloich zuverlässig.Habe einen LG Monitor / TV  den ich nutzte um von einem Lenovo Laptop Bildschirminhalt zu übertragen.Bricht immer wieder ab dauert dann ewig bis erneut verbunden werden kann.Positiv : Ich habe kein Kabel rumliegen ;-)
4,Is working flawlessly with most of my devices. Am happy with the purchase.
5,Un peu cher mais très efficace et simple d'utilisation. Je peux même caster mon écran de téléphone sans ruiner la batterie
5,This is an excellent product straight out the box plugged into t.v and paired up seamlessly with Galaxy A5 2017. Picture quality is excellent and everything can be mirrored to t.v even showbox. The delivery was also awesome very very quick. Highly recommended........
2,+ wirklich besser als bei der ersten Version ist der Verbindungsaufbau und die Stabilität. Hatte dabei mit meinem Surface Pro 6 keine Probleme.ABER:- die Bildqualität finde ich nicht so gut (wäre aber hinnehmbar)- sowie dass das Bild ordentlich versetzt ist. Aber- absolut inakzeptabel ist das stocken und ruckeln des Bildes. Nicht einmal mehr der Mauszeiger fährt ruhig über den Bildschirm. Ein Video gucken oder Animationen und Folienübergänge bei Präsentationen sind nicht anschaubar.Das ist schon eine sehr schwache Technik die Microsoft hier "entwickelt" hat.
5,Lange habe ich danach gesucht: Surface und Notebook an meinem Philips koppeln ohne meterlange HDMI-Kabel durch das Wohnzimmer zu verlegen. Dieser Adapter ist einfach anzuschließen. Dann drücke man "Windows-P" und kopple es mit dem "drahtlosen Monitor". Und oh wunder: Es klappt. Es ist sogar besser als wenn man nur ein HDMI-Kabel zwischen den Geräten steckt.
4,Hält was es verspricht. Funktioniert ohne großen Aufwand. Der Preis ist zu hoch. Schade.
4,Benutze den Adapter mit einem Surface Book.Funktioniert damit wunderbar und fehlerfrei. Ebenso auch mit meinem Android Handy. Somit gibt es zur Funktion keine Negativen Anmerkungen.Jedoch muss ich den USB Anschluss Negativ bemerken der ist unnötig breit.
5,Dieser Adapter funktioniert mit jedem Notebook unter Windows 10.Es funktioniert auch mit jedem PC der Bluetooth hat da die Verbindungssuche über Bluetooth läuft.Unter Windows 10 einfach Verbinden und schon ist das Display (mit 1920x1080) über den Adapter auf einem TV oder Projektor zu sehen.
5,Easy to use great value for money.This is perfect for making meeting room projectors wireless.
2,Ich wollte mir mit dem Adapter Kabel sparen über die mein Hund ständig drüber stolpert. Leider musste ich das Teil am nächten Tag schon wieder  zurückschicken da es so für mich (jeden wahrscheinlich) unbrauchbar ist. Die Verbindung bricht ständig ab und der HDMI Stecker wird so heiß. dass man ihn kaum mehr angreifen kann. Den vielen schlechten Rezensionen zufolge werde ich es auch kein zweites Mal audprobieren da der Adapter auch nicht gerade billig ist sondern mich auf die Suche nach einer anderen Lösung machen. Wiracast können ja viele! ;)
4,Funktioniert einfach. bei Win 10 Geräten ohne wesentliche Probleme
2,Der MS Wireless Displayadapter ist gewöhnungsbedürftig – warum – ersten wird er richtig heiß im HDMI Port zweitens ist die Übertragung nicht gerade flink (AppleTV läuft besser ohne voreingenommen zu sein). Auch das aktuelle Firmware Update brachte nicht den gewünschten Erfolg.Das Prinzip ist aber geil einen weiteren Bildschirm OHNE nervige Kabel anzuschließen/zu vernetzen. Ich hoffe meine Lieblingsfirma Microsoft unternimmt noch etwas um das Ding besser zu machen. Es ist ja schon V2 (also die zweite Version) – Kaufempfehlung trotzdem weil es auch Spaß machen kann. (Funktioniert nicht mit Apple Geräten Samsung etc. JA)
5,Just Plug it in and it works.. Although I haven't figured out how to do firmware update
4,Does a good job this little gadget
4,Sometimes it takes time until it can connect the PC to TV but otherwise it's excellent.I've still not found why it doesn't connect in some (not very often) cases. It got better after firmware update.
5,J'utilise ce produit pour ma surface pro 3 ou mon Lumia 950 en mode continuum.Même principe qu'un câble hdmi mais sans fil vous pouvez dupliquer ou étendre votre écran.il capte jusqu'à 5 mètre suivant la configuration de la pièce.J'en étais très satisfait jusqu'à ce qu'on me le vole ...
5,Did the job for which it was intended
4,Bon produit quelques saccades mais assez rarementsur mon téléphone je ai du plein écran sur ma tv 140 et sur ma tablette 1 cadre noir autoursûrement à cause du ratio non 16.9
5,Völlig problemlose Inbetriebnahme. Macht was es soll.
5,Da ich eine Kabellose Möglichkeit gesucht habe meinen Laptop mit dem Beamer zu verbinden und gleichzeitig auch mein Smartphone mit Android war dieses Produkt mehr als hilfreich.Es funktioniert einwandfrei und man kann alles gut und schnell einrichten.
4,Fonctionne bien (fiable) un léger flou et temps de réponse par rapport au câble mais suffisant pour film sur Android ou double écran sur pc
4,Produit commandé et livré rapidement. Fonctionnement immédiat et performant. Dommage toutefois qu'il n'y ait pas d'adaptateur d'alimentation(qu'il faut donc acheter en plus)  car tous les téléviseurs ne possèdent pas de prise USB.
1,Ich habe den Adapter gekauft und ihn ausprobiert mit dem Handy lässt er sich über eine  Mirrow App steuern muss nicht die von Microsoft seinIch kann ihn aber nicht mit meinen PC verbinden. Ich habe es an 2 Bildschirmen ausprobiert aber der WIndows 10 PC ( Aktuelle Updates) TV und Router nur 1m entfernt lässt sich nicht verbinden.Also hält er nicht was versprochen wird.Und ja USB kabel war drin sonst hätte das mit dem Handy nicht geklapt.
5,Sehr gut und einfach einstellung
5,Easy to use
5,Sehr schneller Versand und hält was es verspricht. Alles in einem: TOP!
5,Es tener una pantalla adicional a tu portátil en cualquier lugar que exista una pantalla de TV. Ideal si estas organizando las vacaciones con tu esposa no tener que estar sobre el portátil o si estas viendo videos de You Tube con tus amigos o si bujas dibujos animados en internet para que los vea tu hija. En fin todo lo que ves en la pantalla de tu ordenador lo veras en tu TV. Recomendable
1,Zunächst funktionierte es ohne größere Probleme. Nach einiger Zeit war die Verbindung nicht mehr möglich. Auf der heutigen Suche nach Fehlern es eine Rebootendlosschleife ohne die Möglichkeit sich zu verbinden oder in die oberfläche zu gelangen. Scheint wohl ein Standardproblem zu sein soweit ich es bei der Suche nach einer Lösung feststellen konnte.. Microsoft-Support-Bot ist nicht hilfreich. Supportformular unbrauchbar da man wegen des Fehlgeschlagenen Captures oder was sonst der Fehler ist kein Versand der Nachricht möglich. Telefonnummer oder Mailadresse werden auch nach mehrfachem Fehlschlagen nicht angeboten und sind nicht direkt zu finden.
5,Genau was ich wollte
5,Sono rimasto molto soddisfatto del prodotto nessuna configurazione basta inserirlo nella presa hdmi + usb e il gioco è fatto.Comodo perchè posso trasmettere foto film e quant'altro sul vecchio televisore finalmente le figlie non tengono più impegnato il pc con il cavo hdmi collegato alla televisione.Con il lumia 950 la funzione continuum viene esaltata. Funziona benissimo anche con lumia 1520.A differenza di altre recensioni io non ho notato ritardi nella trasmissione e neppure impuntamenti.Lo consiglio .
5,Die erster Version des Miracast-Adapter von Microsoft wurde ja heftig kritisiert; zu Recht. Das ist auch der Grund warum ich auf die Variante 2.0 gewartet habe. Ich wurde nicht enttäuscht! Die Verarbeitung ist OK und die Verbindung mit dem Surface Pro klappt hervorragend. Aus bis zu 5 oder 6 Metern Entfernung habe ich keine Probleme mit eine latenzfreien Stabilen Verbindung. Auch die Darstellung von Videos klappt toll.
5,Took minutes to setup now I can connect my laptop (and karaoke) to my TV in seconds with absolutely no wires. No lag with sound and has never dropped out on me. Absolutely love it. Would highly recommend.
5,L'ho preso per via delle recensioni e devo dire che è stata una buona scelta.Collegato senza problemi a due TV (LG e Samsung) abbastanza datati come client ho provato un tablet Asus MemoPad 7 HD e un cellulare OnePlus 3 entrambi hanno funzionato subito con audio e video più che soddisfacenti.Può capitare di vedere qualche quadratino ogni tanto ma la semplicità e le possibilità offerte compensano alla grande.Consigliato per chiunque abbia un dispositivo compatibile Miracast
2,good - it's really compact and has a cute designbad - it's unusable for films better to buy something 4 times more expensive than have a useless piece of plastic
3,Utilizzo il sistema con un Notebook Sony con processore i7 (anche se ha qualche anno ancora abbastanza potente).Configurazione semplice seguendo le indicazioni ma il segnale arriva tardi sul monitor esterno. Se si segue sul Notebook si riesce ad utilizzare (il ritardo con cui arriva sul monitor è omogeneo) mentre se si segue (come per una presentazione) sul monitor esterno al movimento del mouse (o utilizzo della tastiera) corrisponde un movimento molto ritardato visualizzato
5,Ich habe mir den Adapter im April angeschafft und bin sehr zufrieden.Benutze ihn beruflich und privat.Ist jedes mal eine schöne Nummer beim Kunden. Eben angesteckt und schon habe ich den Beamer/Bildschirm für meine Präsentation gekapert.Bloß Filme in HD stocken ab und zu was bei kabelloser Übertragung aber nachvollziehbar ist.
2,Das Produkt ist tagesabhängig nutzbar oder eben auch nicht.Es gibt Tage da kann man Android oder Tablets via Miracast einfach mit dem Adapter verbinden und Streams (Netflix etc.) auf dem Fernseher anschauen ohne Probleme.Aber es gibt auch Zeiten in denen die Verbindung immer laggt und Filme schauen kaum möglich ist.Nach Jahren hab ich keine Losung diesbezüglich gefunden. Die Probleme scheinen willkührlich aufzutreten.Schade denn wenn es funktioniert ist das eine super kabellose Verbindungsmöglichkeit.
5,War nach der Lektüre der anderen Rezensionen skeptisch - doch zu meiner Verwunderung funktioniert der Adapter wunderbar - und zwar auf Anhieb. Selbst HD Videos werden ruckelfrei übertragen Tonübertraung kein Problem. So soll es sein!
2,Microsoft's implementation of MIRAcast hasn't been a resounding success. I like the fact that the protocol is built into Windows 10 but the reality is a hit-and-miss actuality. The software isn't particularly reliable dropouts and random disconnects are an occasional inconvenience. It's sensitive to interference (so tearing and screen artefacts are going to hit you if you're somewhere with lots of radio noise). It does the job but can let you down at the most frustrating moments.
5,Sehr gerne wieder
5,Unser Fernseher ist noch nicht so Smart um Bilder/ Videos vom Handy wiederzugeben.-> Adapter an Fernseher-USB (für Strom) und HDMI-IN angesteckt-> Funktioniert.
4,Far better range and less display lag when compared to the v1.
2,Love the concept just wish it worked. Initial difficulty updating firmware. Then PowerPoint etc fine. Unfortunately video quality wasn’t even watchable. Shame as using with a Microsoft surface book 2 so expected it to work despite other negative reviews. Tried on different TVs and monitors but same throughout. I also have Apple TV and airplay works fine on that from my Apple products. Shame Microsoft seems behind. Not sellers fault Microsoft please sort.
5,je l'utilise Pour mon PC et  téléphone ce qui me Permet de l'afficher sur mon Téléviseur qui me sert de deuxième Ecran.
3,Great device for casting to big screen but make sure your device i.e. pc/tablet has that capability. I made the mistake of not checking this out beforehand. All in all a great gadget.
5,Very effective and easy to use. No complicated setup required.
3,Recibido el producto nos extraña muchísimo que no venga con la caja original y este metido en una bolsa de plástico. Probado y funciona. En el caso de que no sea original por lo que hemos pagado y debido a la necesidad que tenemos de utilizarlo ruego que me envíen un adaptador original y a la llegada del mismo entregaríamos el que hemos recibido hoy.
1,Ich wollte nicht aber ich muss jetzt doch eine kurze Rezession schreiben.Ich habe mich fast 3 Jahre mit dem Teil rum geärgert. Habe alle erdenklichen Treiber aktualisiert Windows 10 stets aktuell gehalten - es hat nie richtig funktioniert !!! Ständige Abrüche Absturz des Rechners Ruckler usw. Und das bei Produkten eines Herstellers deshalb : Schrott ! Jetzt habe ich die Nerven verloren und den Fire Stick bestellt.Und siehe da es funktioniert so wie ich es mir schon lange gewünscht habe ! Perfekt ! Auch die ganz normale Bildschirmspiegelung ! Warum habe ich das nicht schon längst gemacht. Nie wieder Microsoft !
4,Works well but did not need it in the end
3,Performances en baisse...je trouve mais fonctionne assez simplement avec android ou Windows.Peut être à causse de mise à jour successives de l'OS Windows 10 une de mes machines(avec wifi N) n'est désormais plus compatible LMiracast alors qu'elle marchait avec la V1 du Display adapter...Des interférences c'est peut être lié à mon environnement font que l'image se fige de temps en temps...Bref impression mitigée mais ce produit dépanne bien mais ne remplace pas et de loin un bonne liaison filaire.
4,Übertragung Funktioniert nach 3 Versuch immer wieder Ton Aussetzer
5,Avec Windows 10 ça marche tout seul et répond parfaitement à mes attentes
3,Je suis déçue car il ne fonctionne pas. J’ai essayé avec 3 PC différents mais rien. On voit que ça essaye de se lancer mais rien.Au bureau j’utilise du wireless display dans différentes salles de réunion sans problème.En plus il coûte cher si au moins il fonctionnait ;(
5,Wir nutzen diesen Adapter um Bild und Ton wireless an einen 85" Sony Fernseher zu übertragen.Das klappt hervorragend selbst Videos werden ruckelfrei übertragen (Youtube). Die Montage ist einfach und selbsterklärend dass Verbinden mit dem SurfaceBook klappt problemlos... klare Kaufempfehlung!
5,Ist echt super und einfach. Überall wo ich es zeige sind alle erstaunt und kaufen sich gleich den Adapter. Mit iOS und Android geht es glaube ich aber nicht. Zumindest habe ich es nicht zum laufen b.
1,Funtionierte genau 2 x … wird heiss keine Verbindung mehr  nichts funktioniert mehr Sinnlos Zeit für Rechnerupdates und duzende Versuche mit Abkühlen anders versorgen …. hat alles nichts gebracht -  Ich hätte es wissen müssen. Genau so ein Müll wie die irreparablen Rechner dieses Unternehmens.Beschiss mit kleinem Geld - kostet sicherlich um 1 ..2 EUR in der Herstellung … und ich habe schon wieder mehr Geld in Zeit investiert als das Ding Wert ist.
4,Alles gut
5,Vor einem Jahr habe ich mir von Bestbean einen Miracast Adapter gekauft.Dieser hat immer Probleme bereitet die Verbindung ist immer wieder abgebrochen Video nur mit starken Artefakten .Jetzt der von Microsoft Lumia 930 keine Probleme alles ohne Ruckler auch bei Video Surface 4 pro genau so wie es sein soll.Alles wird sofort übertragen Bild Ton Und Video so soll es auch sein.
2,The quality of broadcasting is low and not sharp enough. Furthermore it reacts slowly that means latency is high. I returned the device. Expect more of Microsoft!
3,Das Teil ist schnell installiert in TV eingesteckt am Smartphone (habe 950XL) Continuum einschalten und verbinden. Die Wireless Display Adapter APP runterladen Firmware aktualisieren das war schon. Man kann auch einstellen ob es gespiegelt oder erweitert werden soll. Für Office Präsentationen ist es gut aber für Filme gucken oder Spiele spielen verzögert es zu doll.
5,Habe mittlerweile 2 im Einsatz.Eines Zuhause und eines im mobilen Einsatz. Alles top top. Qualität ist einfach Microsoft. Für das Surface die optimale Lösung.
5,Bought this to carry with my laptop when I need impromptu presentations. It is a dream. Works first time every time. It also great when I want to watch something on Kodi and can just stream it with this to my non-smart tv.
5,Der Adapter funktioniert sehr gut egal ob unter Windows oder Android. Manchmal kommt es zu Rucklern dann muss man die Verbindung noch mal neu aufbauen. Man sollte allerdings auf den Sendegeräten darauf achten das deren Wlan Adapter auch die entsprechnde Leistung hat um Wlan und Displayadapter zu betreiben.
1,This is absolut crap.Not only is the device completely unable to cope with a simple 24Ghz + 5Ghz connection but also when you are lucky enough that it finally connects god only knows why then a simple HD video is too much for this device. It breaks off stops lags .. wow this is a complete waste of money.One would think that a company such as windows would be ashamed to have something like this in their range of products... well no actually i take that back it fits acctually perfectly with their system of selling half finished products while getting payed via subscription with the promis of fixing all the bugs.
3,ok but no better than cheaper models found on amazon. some times has trouble to connect to my lap top which is brand new hp i7 envyseems to be a lot of lag to.
4,Speravo fosse più versatile visto il prezzo. Con il PC con sistema operativo Windows10 funziona correttamente. Per configurarlo bisogna andare sul centro notifiche --> proietta e cercare il dispositivo. Una volta trovato connetterlo.Per disconnettersi tornare in proietta e cliccare su disconnetti.
5,It synchronize immediately very good image quality and sound it heatup more than expected.
3,No me sirve
3,Koppeln hat immer schnell und einfach funktioniert und die Übertragung war stabil. Dann habe ich den Stick auf die neueste Firmware aktualisiert (wodurch er angeblich für das Anniversary-Update kompatibel gemacht wurde) und seitdem bekomme ich keine Verbindung mehr von meinem Surface Pro (1) zum Stick. :(Ich habe es mit 2 vers. Geräten getestet beides ohne Erfolg.
5,Conforme à mes attentes. Il n'y a qu'à brancher à la télé et opuvrir le screen miroring sur le portable samsung en l'occurrence et le portable est détecté sur la télé. Je peux visionner les films du portable sur la télé sans perte de définition ! parfait.
5,Super pratique pour le travail fini les problèmes de câble hdmi et pas de pilotes à installer!
5,it is a very convenient solution for surface if you only have usb connection left. the image sometimes gets a bit slow but otherwise is of superior quality. very happy.
4,C'est un outil ultra pratique mais attention repose sur le wifi et dans certaines conditions l'image n'est pas très fluide. Cela dépends des environnements.
4,Übertragung funktioniert einwandfrei. Muss nur auf meinem Surface4pro jedesmal die Verbindung 2x anfordern. Beim ersten Mal kommt immer Fehlermeldung. ( Kann auch mit meinem Gerät zusammenhängen)
5,Excellent sur Windows 10 attention version minimum windows 8.1 ! pour le faire fonctionner windows 7 et antérieur à proscrire
5,Utilisation simple & solution très utile lors de présentations PPT ou autre.Flux vidéo TB+++Très bon produit.
4,Does the job only after the firmware update.Would love jigjer res but that was not expected from this product.
4,Fonctionne impec avec ma tablette Android par contre a tendance a bugger et c'est un comble avec mon Windows phone !
5,Mein Galaxy Tab S2 ist leider nicht per Kabel an einen TV anschließbar und ein fire TV-Stick oder ein Chromecast brauchen immer ein extra W-lan. Wenn man unterwegs ist oder kein super highspeed w-lan hat funktioniert das aber nur sch**** und ist für unterwegs nun gar nicht möglichDer display adapter wird eingesteckt und funktioniert
5,Funktioniert bisher einwandfrei und erfüllt seinen Zweck als Wireless-Display-Adapter für mein Windows-gerät vollkommen.+ Plug-and-play+ Konfiguration einfach über Windowsapp möglich~ Preis ist nicht gering zahlt sich aber im Endeffekt aus
5,Très bon produit  mes films passent en 1080 p sans lague duplication du smartphone ou du pc portable très stabledonc plus de cordon hdmi entre le pc portable et la tv  je conseille pour ceux qui on le screen mirroring ou miracast sur leur smartphone .
5,Does the job of connecting a VR headset to a TV monitor
5,Rispetto a Chromecast ha un utilizzo estremamente più semplice non richiede nessuna app (a meno di voler aggiornare il firmware) si connette e trasmette PUNTO.A voler trovare un difetto è un po' lenta l'accensione ma la cosa non costituisce minimamente un problema.
3,Leider geht das mit dem einfach an den TV anschliessen und beim Laptop anschliessen nicht so leicht wie beworben da sind wir mit Handy ect. Heute evt. etwas verwöhnt aber Anwenderfreundlich ist das Teil leider nicht sorry...
1,Ce produit est simplement inutilisable: même avec le dernier firmware et l'appui de l'application microsoft Miracast il ne reste connecté au PC ou au smartphone que moins de quelques minutes que ce soit sur PC windows 10 (testé sur deux machines de marques différentes dont une professionnelle) ou sur LG G4 (Android 6.0) et ceci avec deux téléviseurs différents (Sony et Panasonic). Même sans connexion à un PC ou autre d'Adaptateur "plante" seul de façon cyclique et ne se remet en mode" d'attente de connexion" que durant quelques minutes avant de planter à nouveau tout seul... J'ai également essayé l'alimentation directe par un chargeur USB sans succès.Incroyable et décevant pour un produit Microsoft d'origine.
5,Im Zusammenspiel zwischen aktuellem MS Surface IV und einem LG LED funktioniert das Gerättadellos. Im HDMI Steckplatz des TV einstecken Eingangsquelle im TV einstellen im Surface die Verbindungsoption anklicken und schon ist das Bild da. Abstand bei mir ca. 6 m ohne jegliche Probleme.
5,Es ist einfach anzuschließen erfüllt seinen Zweck es ruckelt nur leider manchmal und eins musste ich schon ersetuen
2,I've been using this for a few years and it's driving me crazy. It doesn't connect half of the time and sometimes freezes out. At this point I have no idea if the problem is with the tablet/laptop hardware or Windows 8.1 bugs on the tablets the wireless access point or the Microsoft WiDi adapter but the end result is very annoying.
4,Fonctionne bien. L'absence de nécessité d'alimentation indépendante type chargeur est appréciable. Pratique fonctionnel.Je suis tout à fait satisfait. de cet achat.
3,Crash oftmals und bei manchen Apps funktioniert es nicht (Skype; sogar eine Microsoft App). Geht sonst recht gut für Bilder übertragen und sonstige Sachen. Das Handy muss halt kompatibel sein und darf nicht zu alt sein.
5,funktioniert sehr gut um beim Kunden schnell eine drahtlose Verbindung zum Display herzustellen. Wenn man am eigenen Gerät (Laptop oder Android-handy funktioniert) erst mal weiss wo man die Verbindung einstellt dann ist es eine Sache von Sekunden.
3,It's not exactly like connecting a HDMI cable but as a temporary way to connect a computer to a display without running any cable it works
5,Wie erwartet
2,Leider ist die Maus-Bewegung stark verzögert. Auch die Auflösung lässt sich auf breiteren Bildschirmen nicht anpassen.Maximal 1920p.Die Software ist katastrophal. Abstürzte und Software-Update erst möglich wenn der Laptop auch am Ladekabel hängt (Natürlich muss man sich diese Info aus den Kommentaren ziehen weil die Fehlermeldung das überhaupt nicht aussagt)
1,Nach drei Monate Einsatz:Umgebungsbedingungen:U1) Funkdistanz im Einsatzbereich: 3m50U2) Eigen- Wände/Gegenstände zwischen Sender und Empfänger: neinU3) Parallel betriebene Geräte: Microsoft USB-Maus und USB-Tastatur Bluetooth VerbindungU4) Microsoft Surface Book (Windows 10) immer up-to-date.Positive Eigenschaften:+ Ab und zu funktioniert die Verbindung. Mehr positives gibt es in meinem Fall nicht.Negative Eigenschaften:- Fast tägliche Verbindungsverlust- Bild und Ton frieren ein wenn Funk-Maus oder Tastatur bedient wird (alles Microsoft...)- Verbindung mit Microsoft Surface Book führt zu System-Crash (manuelle Neustart des Laptops notwendig)Gesamtfazit: "Liebe Microsoft-Entwickler: das ist ganz und gar nicht witzig."Kaufempfehlung: nein. Finger Weg.Zusammenspiel mit andere Microsoft-Produkte: mehr als schlecht. "Peinlich" würde es besser beschreiben.Meine Zufriedenheit: Rock bottom.
5,Gerät anstecken war vielleicht die komplizierteste Aktion. Danach mit Windows 10 Mobile verbunden funktioniert sofort tadellos und bietet in Zusammenarbeit mit Continuum ungeahnte neue Möglichkeiten. Ebenso die Verbindung mit meinem Windows 10 Laptop: sofort problemlos top Bildqualität.
3,It works well but it is ridiculous that you need to use a Windows PC to download an app to update the firmware on the thing.
2,Firstly very annoying it does not remember previous logged on devices meaning reconnecting every time and the pin number is so longs this takes too long.Second it will only stay logged in for about 30 minutes then repeat.Only any use for a static display or slowly changing. Forget video.
4,ho dato 4 stelle perche'a qualche probleminoma tuttavia funziona benenon e vero che si scollega speso io ci vedo le partite con l'applicazione serie A tim trasferendo il segnale da tel a tv.e si vede in 4k.la consiglio.bravi
3,Utile mais parfois l'image est floue avec l'ordinateur. Aucun problème avec le téléphone. La connexion est facile.
2,This item was a bit of a faff to set up and the quality was poor - lagged a lot from computer to screen.
4,A lot better than the 1st gen version.Fast enough to even stream sports from table to the television.Now I do not need cables anymore.
5,TopSurtout il permet de dupliquer l'écran de mon PC!Ce que ne fait pas le fire...
5,fonctionne très bien
3,Collego il mio s7 a tutti i televisori possibili in giro per il mondo e non ho mai avuto problemi sempre che ci sia una wi-fi stabile se volete far trasmettere qualcosa live.Il prezzo però è assurdo infatti mi sto guardando in giro per prendere altri oggetti simili ad 1/5 della cifra spesa!Ladruncoli!!! :-D
5,Fonctionne parfaitement si comme moi vous avez un soucis suite a une mise a jour du firmware il vous faudra réinstaller vos drivers carte wifi et Intel HD par la version la plus récente ainsi que désinstaller et réinstaller l utilitaire Microsoft display sur le store windows
5,répond à mes attentes plus besoin de cable hdmi et d'avoir un réseau haut debit pour diffuser des videos depuis un pc ou un portable avec une bonne qualité video et sonps : on peut utiliser mycanal avec le site internet de mycanal :)
5,Übertragung funktioniert egal ob von einem Handy Tablet oder Pc. Lediglich ab einer Entfernung von 3 Metern fängt das Bild an leicht zu stottern
3,Wer schnell und einfach seinen Laptop mit einem Bildschirm oder Beamer verbinden will kann dies unglaublich einfach tun. Bei PowerPoint-Folien sieht die Anzeige gut aus. Problematisch wird es bei Videos da hier das Bild etwas ruckelig ist. Somit kann man den Adapter nur schwer als Ersatz für HDMI oder DVI Kabel verwenden.
5,I use it with a projector and it just works beautifully.
5,Hat alles hervorragend geklappt!
5,Anders als bei Apple Airplay wird hier ein eigenes W-Lan zwischen Gerät und Empfänger aufgebaut. Dadurch gibt es deutlich weniger Bildruckler. Alles läuft sehr flüssig und geschmeidig. Für den Preis absolut zu empfehlen. Nutze es mit dem Surface Pro (2017) an einem Samsung-TV.
4,Fonctionnel  testé avec petite télé à 3 m. Bonne réception
5,Appareil simple d'utilisation fonction très bien si la télé est équipée de prise HDMI. Tout le contenu du téléphone ou tablette sur la télé génial pour NETFLIX.
5,Der Wireless Adapter wird genutzt um schnell eine Verbindung vom Handy zum Fernseher herzustellen. Das klappt  wunderbar ohne Probleme.
3,Goed om je bureaublad en powerpoints te delen maar meer ook niet. Videobeelden haperen en foto's worden kleuren niet goed weergegeven.
5,Fonctionne parfaitement avec un samsung S3 il suffit de le brancher sur la télé passer sur la source HDMI puis sur le téléphone activer le menu "Screen mirroring".Testé avec des vidéos Youtube aussi fonctionne bien (avec peut-être une petite perte de qualité de vidéo toutefois)
5,Funktioniert mit Windows 10 astrein. Vom Sofa spiel ich alles vom Notebook/Tablet auf den Beamer dank dieses Artikels - sogar mit Ton! Verzögetung sehr gering.Installation einfach - plug and play.
5,Installation hat problemlos funktioniert. Bild und Tonqualität sehr gut. Kann ich nur weiterempfehlen.
5,Sehr Praktisches Gadget um mal eben ohne Kabel das Bild zu übertragen. Nutze ich super gerne an den TV-Geräten in meinem Haus und an Präsentations-PCs bei mir im Unternehmen.
5,branchement simple ;configuration bien utilisation pas de problème ;un affichage parfait sur mon écran tv
5,macht was es soll problemlose Installation
1,Voller Vorfreude auf fehlende Kabelverbindung zwischen Laptop und TV hab ich das Paket erwartet.Okay... Ist ne B-Ware weil wohl schonmal Retouresendung aber dadurch bissl Geld gespart.Technisch sollte es trotzdem funktionieren. Sollte...Aber große Enttäuschung:Angeschlossen auf HDMI Kanal gestellt Verbindung herstellen..... Springt zurück zum Homescreen wo erklärt wird wie eine Verbindung hergestellt werden soll. Nochmals versucht... Fehler: Kann keine Verbindung herstellen!Also ab zur Problembehandlung... Alle 10 Vorschläge durchlaufen unter anderem Neuanschluss Reset drücken Treiber erneuern etc. sogar an anderen Laptop und TV probiert.Nix half.... "Frustrierend"Mein Fazit: für knapp 45 Euro (Neupreis: ca. 53 Euro) erwarte ich schon funktionierende Artikel und Technik. Totaler Fehlkauf. Schade. Geht's halt wieder Retoure.
5,Habe den Adapter erst am Samstag bestellt und schon heute (Montag) ist er angekommen.Hatte einige verschiedene Miracast Stick leider ohne Erfolg getestet. Dieser Adapter von Microsoft funktioniert genau so wie ich mir das vorgestellt habe. Bild und Ton wird übertragen und im Vergleich zu den anderen getesteten Geräten ohne Probleme - kein Hängen kein Abstürzen.Top vorbehaltlos zu empfehlen.
5,Très bon produit simple d'utilisation. Il remplace avantageusement le boitier continuum de Microsoft en suppriment les câbles. En utilisation prolongée. Je pose mon téléphone sur le chargeur sans fil et aucun problème. Je conseille de l'utiliser. Avec une souris et un clavier en Bluetooth.
1,Um den Screen meines Lenovo Yoga 900 mit Windows 10 und allen Updates auf einem TV darzustellen bestellte ich den Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter. Windows 10 dann sollte es doch mit dem "Original" von Microsoft funktionieren. Es wurde an unterschiedlichen TV von Samsung und LG getestet.Lieferung wie bei Amazon üblich schnell und zuverlässig. Aber das Produkt:Im Auslieferungszustand war die Verbindung stabil aber die Darstellung extrem verzögert. Videos u.a. von Youtube im Fullscreen waren ruckelnd verzerrt und der Ton verzögert und mit erheblichen Aussetzern.Ein Update funktionierte erst im 5. Anlauf danach war zwar die Qualität der Darstellung besser jedoch bricht jetzt permanent die Verbindung ab. So nicht zu gebrauchen und zurück gesendet.
5,Pour ceux qui se posent la question (comme moi avant d acheter ce produit ) : cela fonctionne parfaitement pour diffuser les films HD d 1 PC sur un vidéoprojecteur ... sans perte de qualité ! Parfait pour eviter le cable hdmi...
2,Einrichtung ging sehr einfach und schnell. Ebenfalls das Update über den Laptop einspielen war intuitiv.Bei Videos gibt es leider regelmäßig starke Störungen (stark verpixelt spaltenweise Aufbau von rechts nach links).
3,pas assez de description micro hdmi alors que hdmi normal demandé
5,AuspackenAnstecken am TVLaptop mit Windows 10 verbinden.Und schon ist der TV als Monitor für das Laptop verfügbar.Entweder als gespiegelter Bildschirm oder als erweiterter Bildschirm genauso als ob man ihn per Kabel mit dem TV verbunden hätte.So macht Technik einfach Spaß!
1,Ich habe diesen Adapter vor 3 Tagen erhalten- einmal kurz gut verwendet- am zweiten Tag schon ein ruckliges Bildund jetzt startet dieses Teil nicht mal mehr am Bildschirm bis die Verbindungsmöglichkeit kommt (und da meine ich noch nicht mal die Verbindungsmöglichkeit zwischen PC (Win 10) und Monitor.Wie gesagt hat alles wunderbar funktioniert aber leider nur 1 Mal.Info zu diesem Produkt bzw. Lösungsansätze gibt es auch nicht - was soll ich dazu sagen ...  bin leider sehr unzufrieden.
5,Klappt einfach super!
5,excellent product for the surface laptop
4,Bonne qualité d'affichage il est en plus très bien détecté par mon Galaxy Note 4.A acheter les yeux fermés
5,Apart for connecting problem it works a treat. The connecting problem is this: It never connects on the first attempt but always so far connects at the second attempt. Strange! but I have learned to accept this.
2,Das Teil funktioniert anfänglich ganz gut und lässt sich auch leicht verbinden. Bei längerem Video-Betrieb wird es jedoch sehr heiß fabriziert Störungen und Hänger und unterbricht die Verbindung. Beim zweiten Film hintereinander wird das schon ziemlich ärgerlich. Wenn diese Mängel beseitigt sind wäre es ganz praktisch da es auch ohne externem W-lan den Desktop ohne weitere Software einfach auf TV oder Beamer dupliziert.
5,Works great always connects. It is no the same as Chromcast but I onlu use it as a wireless connection so it is perfect for me. Chromcast always disconnects on me.
5,Svolge egregiamente il suo lavoro
1,Avevo necessità di proiettare in modalità wireless lo schermo del pc desktop windows 10 sul tv di casa ma non sono mai riuscito a farlo funzionare dopo averne provati 2. Ho acquistato anche una scheda wifi certificata WiDi la ASUS PCE-AC55BT: al momento del collegamento il dongle microsoft abbatteva sempre la connessione senza restituire alcun codice di errore. Non è un problema imputabile né alla distanza perché ho provato direttamente ad 1 metro di distanza né all'alimentazione usb per cui ho provato la porta usb del tv e 2 alimentatori usb per smartphone.Ho provato anche l'app dallo store microsoft "Adattatore wireless" che vedeva per un attimo il dongle e di cui proponeva anche l'aggiornamento firmware che falliva poiché la connessione wifi veniva abbattuta dal dongle.Non funzionava neanche il mirroring dal mio smartphone Android Sony Xperia T3 che dopo aver effettuato la connessione restituiva l'errore che il dispositivo microsoft non supportava l'HDCP!!!Per scrupolo ho formattato il pc reinstallato i driver della scheda video Sapphire Radeon R9 290X all'ultimo disponibile controllata la compatibilità al miracast tramite DxDiag ma non è servito a nulla.Ho dovuto restituire il prodotto a malincuore senza aver risolto il problema. Dovrò installare un cavo HDMI di circa 15 metri.Assolutamente sconsigliato da evitare.
3,Aufgrund der vielen positiven Rezensionen habe ich mir den Display Adapter bestellt. Aber alle Videos mit 720p ruckeln und haben Bildstörungen. Der PC und der Fernseher befinden sich in Nähe (35 m). Fazit: nicht ausgereifte Technik.
4,Der Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter hält was er verspricht. Er ist einfach in der Handhabung und erfüllt seinen Zweck. Danke!
5,wer die PowerPoint Referentenansicht sinnvoll nutzt kommt hier auf seine Kosten denn man kann den Bildschirm einfach erweitern und nicht nur duplizieren wie bei Chromecast ...
5,Rien a redire sur cette V2. Elle fonctionne parfaitement que ce soit avec un ordinateur sous Windows 10 Anniversary Windows 10 Windows 8/8.1 android 6.0.Pas de rupture de connexion  presque pas de lag plug and play.Bref un must have
4,Connexion avec PC Windows 10 et Smartphone & Tablette Android sans problème. Juste déçu par la définition sur un écran 24"
5,Absolutely brilliant and audio is high quality.  Bought this to use with my Surface and works very well.  Easy to setup with just a few mouse clicks.
5,More than satisfied!
5,Fonctionne parfaitement que ce soit avec un mobile Android (Galaxy s6 et S7) ou un PC disposant d'une bonne carte /antenne wifi./!\ ca fonctionne en wifi direct c'est à dire pas sur votre réseau wifi local.
5,On a profité de la promo.Produit fonctionne correctement.
5,Absolut traum Gerät habe so lang gewarter über es! Schnell und einfach einzurichten sehr gute Verarbeitung USB Verlängerung mit im Lieferumfang. Die coolste innovative Lösung für eine Displayerweiterung - von PC oder Surface spielen wir einfach Filme Fotos un Präsentationen. Sehr Empfält!
5,très facile à installer - un peu cher -
4,Très bien une petite perte de qualité d'image et une latence entre le clic et sa prise en compte a l'écran widi
5,Très facile d'utilisation ce câble permet une liaison facile avec l'appareil relié.
4,Simple and effective price stops 5 stars
2,HolaTenia buenas expectativas sobre este dispositivo de Microsoft mas teniendo un Lumia 1520 y un Tablet Lenovo Thinkpad ambos con Windows 10.Conecta perfectamente se actualizó el firmware con la App correspondiente disponible en la tienda de app's de Windows. Pero al reproducir cualquier contenido de video (en HD claro) da tirones y asaltos tanto desde el Lumia como desde la Tablet. Lo he probado con red de wifi 2.4 GHz y 5 GHz en dos televisores diferentes y nada. Me interesaba para reproducir contenido de Netflix y es sencillamente imposible salvo que no te importe ver saltitos y tirones que al menos a mi me pone de los nervios. Así que devolución y a probar con Chromecast.
3,Conforme à ce que j'attendais / Je recommande Pdts et vendeur ;-)
2,Ha funzionato per una settimana poi il PC non riusciva più a riconnettersi all'adattatore.Per cui reso al mittente
3,Gut eigentlich aber teuer und die framerate ist nicht so gut
4,ho acquistato questo prodotto per collecare il portatile con uno scermo più grande in questo caso una tv con presa usb e hdmi. funzione benissimo riesco a gestire il desktop sopra la tv.
5,Très facile a utiliser a partir d'Android.Cher; A acheter uniquement en promo
5,Il nostro acquisto è stato soprattutto per Netflix perchè volevo vedere le serie tv dalla televisione e nondal tablet. In effetti i nostri tablet (un mediacom e un samsung vecchiotto) non erano compatibili con l'apparecchioma per fortuna con il cellulare (samsung + recente)  funziona perfettamente. E si vede bene.Quindi unica cosa da verificare è la compatibilità col vostro dispositivo..
5,Auf den Beamer drahtlos übertragen in hervorragender Qualität - endlich zu einem vertretbaren Preis! Funktioniert prima!
3,Funktioniert bisher einwandfrei. Den Preis finde ich jedoch etwas überzogen. Aber ich muss es beruflich einsetzen... Leider war ein gewöhnlicher HDMI-Displayport Adapter nicht ausreichend.
2,Déçu par cet adaptateur. Je l'utilise pourtant avec un PC portable Windows 10 situé à quelques centimètres de ma télévision. Pourtant la connexion est longue et ne se fait parfois pas du premier coup. C'est donc laborieux.Par ailleurs la connexion modifie les couleurs d'affichage sur l'écran de mon PC Portable. C'est pas top.Enfin le son transmis via l'adaptateur est parfois saccadé. C'est embêtant.Conclusion je déconseille l'achat de cet adaptateur. Pour ma part je l'ai abandonné pour le remplacer par une simple liaison par un câble HDMI entre mon PC Portable et mon téléviseur.
5,Simple to use works well even for fast moving pcitures and videos. I have a google chromecast but no longer use it because this dispaly adapter has made it redundant.
3,Aufgrund größeren Lags nur brauchbar für PowerPoint jedoch nicht für Videos oder normale Programme.
5,It works great I got it for half price the original rrp so it's definitely value for money.
4,it has a lag
5,Fantastic when streaming to your TV  but still seems expensive . Be aware that not all Windows phones can use the mirror cast system though.
5,5 stars for seller unfortunately product is c**p works with very few selected MS products complete waste of time and would recommend buying google chromecast (which I did)easily over this.
5,Makes connecting to a display TV or monitor an easy process and works perfectly - at last no more wire to connect my PC to present!
5,Endlich ein Gerät das hält was es verspricht. Mit W10 und Android top. Kein ruckeln und der Ton ist synchron.
3,Comodo per trasmettere direttamente le immagini a video non  altrettanto i film. Poco chiaro l'aggiornamento dei driver.
1,Im Gegensatz zum zuerst gekauften Adapter (exakt dasselbe Produkt) der auf Anhieb funktionierte klappt bei diesem trotz zahlreicher Versuche an drei Fernsehern die Verbindung einfach nicht. Alles wird zwar korrekt angezeigt auf den Bildschirmen und dem Handy doch stets kommt die Meldung dass die Verbindung nicht aufgebaut werden konnte. Frustrierend!
5,It does exactly what it promises.  Extremely easy to install and use. It took about 10 minutes from opening the box to start using.
5,Wenn die Grafikkarte Miracast unterstützt ist das eine einfache Sache um Bilder oder Filme an einen Beamer zu übertragen. Aberman sollte sich vorher vergewissern dass die Grafikkarte geeignet ist denn sonst geht gar nichts.
5,Die Übertragung ist sehr gut. Bei manchen Fernsehern wird das Gesamtbild zu groß angezeigt man sieht die seitliche Leiste nicht um hoch oder runter zu scrollen. Wenn man eine Verlängerung nutzt muss man auf Qualität setzen. Mein Adapter übertrug zwar alles jedoch ohne Ton.
4,All ok
5,È funzionale come da aspettative
5,MS got it right with V2.Not sure why the laggy V1 was even released when it kept falling short of the mark.
3,Quiet good but not perfect. Looses signal from time to time and still shows some delay.
5,Utilisation avec un vidéoprojecteur et ordinateur ou smartphone. Fonctionnement très satisfaisant!
1,Funktioniert völlig reibungslos wenn es funktioniert. Und dies ist wohl vom Endgerät abhängig. Mit bestimmten Dell Latitude WIn10 Rechnern funktioniert es gar nicht...
3,Das Produkt macht bei mir Schwierigkeiten mit dem Surface Pro 4. Trotz aller Updates ist die Verbindung nicht stabil und manchmal gar nicht herzustellen.
5,Un tout petit peu compliqué au tout début à paramétrer mais très bien dans l'ensemble.Un petit regret... l'affichage doit être reconfiguré si le format de la source change.Une convention automatique aurait été la bienvenue.
5,Bei mir funktioniert alles mit einem Surface Book (Windows) und Windows 10 hervorragend. Die Einrichtung ist einfach Gerät anschließen App aus dem Store herunterladen und es funktioniert.
2,Pros: It doesn't have any lag and it's nice and novel/slick/clean having no wires between your device and the second screen.Cons: IT has a poor max screen resolution takes 10 attempts to connect it and then it keeps disconnecting.Conclusion: Nice gadget but get hard-wired connection if you want dependable high quality.
1,Die Verbindung aller ausprobierten Geräte mit dem Adapter hat einwandfrei funktioniert.Auch eine Firmwareaktualisierung des Adapters war möglich.Leider habe ich trotz Tests mit diversen Geräten (Smartphone notebook tablet) und Fernsehgeräten (4 Verschiedene) keine Ton- und Bildübertragung (egal welche Projektionsart ich auswählte) zustande bekommen.Unterschiedlichste Problemlösungen aus Internetforen blieben bei mir auch erfolglos.Der Fernsehbildschirm blieb meist schwarz. Zeimal gab es ein rot flackerndes Bild und einmal rauschende Geräusche.
5,Fonctionne très bien sur les différents appareils que j'ai pu tester (zenfone 2 zenfone max galaxy s4 acer w4-820)La seule application qui me pose problème et celle de SFR TV qui bloque la diffusion.
5,Super einfach zu bedienen - hält was es verspricht!
3,The temperature is pretty high and sometimes signal disruption.
5,Plug'n'play mal ohne Einschränkung in Verbindung mit einem Win10 Notebook zumindest
5,Permet d'afficher l'écran de l'ordinateur ou windows phone 10 directement sur un écran disposant d'une entrée HDMI. Le son est également transmis. Temps de retard très faible et configuration très simple.Fonctionne parfaitement avec mes PC ou tablette sous w10.
1,Trotz mehrfachen testen ist keine Verbindung mit dem Surface 7 möglich. Somit ist das Produkt leider unbrauchbar. Mich wundern die vielen positiven Bewertungen deshalb umso mehr...
5,Dongle am TV einstecken am Notebbok Ziel auswählen. Kein installieren von Apps Eingabe von Netzwerkschlüssel etc. Einstecken verbinden fertig. Keine Verzögerungen keine Abbrüche. Wenn das so bleibt 7 Sterne.
3,Die Verbindung geht nicht immer. Ist doch sehr instabil. Auch nachdem ich die Treiber aktualisiert habe läuft es nicht besser
5,Anstecken verbinden läuft. Perfekt für mich unter Win10.
5,Fonctionne parfaitement et recu en 24h bravo amazon et pas cher
5,Äußerst kompakt extrem leistungsfähig und absolut zuverlässig perfekt für Microsoft Windows 10. Die Bedienung ist kinderleicht und unkompliziert. Ich verwende den Display Adapter fürs PC-Gaming auf großem TV-Display und bin sehr begeistert. Daher gebe ich volle 5 von 5 Sternen.
5,Marche très bien le son passe bien l'image est fluide. Attention pour certaines tablettes ou smartphones il faut chercher un peu pour trouver le cast.Bon produit.
5,ParfaitPetit compact marche sans internet d'où la véritable utilité par rapport au Chromecast!Parfois un peu de latence mais honnêtement pour image c'est top et les vidéos passent globalement très très bien.
3,Muss leider zurück gehen: Android ab Version 7 funktioniert nicht mit dem Gerät :-(
5,Funktioniert sehr gut mit unserem Samsung Smart TV.
5,Der Adapter funktioniert super. Bilder als auch Videos werden ohne Probleme übertragen. Bevor vom Android Handy gesendet werden kann muss man eine App vom Play Store installieren !!!! Uneingeschränkte Kaufempfehlung.
5,Funktioniert einwandfrei unter Windows 10 und mit Android Geräten auf unterschiedlichen Fernsehern.
5,Utilisé dans le camping car (ordi>>télé smartphone>>télé); My Canal
5,Funktioniert top! Verbinde mein Surface Book 2 damit.
5,Spitzenprodukt funktioniert wie es soll
5,Per vedere il cell alla tv
5,Sofern Miracast unterstützt wird ist das ne tolle Sache. Aktuelle Android Geräte blocken jedoch andere Miracastgeräte außer google chromecast.
5,mit dem Wireless Display Adapter hat doch Microsoft wenigstens etwas vernünftiges gemacht wenn sie schon die Handy-Sparte versaut haben
5,Semplice da usare. La riproduzione del video del Lumia purtroppo a volte andava a scatti sulla TV. Credo però sia un problema di wi-fi. Ho il router in un'altra stanza e credo che lo schermo del Lumia venga riprodotto passando attraverso il router. C'è quindi una doppia trasmissione: Lumia > router > TV che assorbe banda.
5,Cet objet fait exactement ce que j'attendais ! Pas d'installation d'appli on le branche sur la télé et hop ! Le tour est joué ! J'y projette mon PC mon téléphone ma tablette... Bref que du bonheur !
5,Ein muss für alle die ihren Wide-Screen TV-als Wiedergabe für VIdeo Bilder Musik über den TV nutzen möchten geht super und ist ein Geheimtipp bei Bekannten und Freunden schnell mal ein paar Bilder oder Video in Großformat zu zeigen einfach Stick einstecken und los.
2,An sich funktioniert der MS WDA so wie er soll und überträgt mühelos Bildschirme von Laptop und Handy auf den Fernseher jedoch mit großer Latenz was z.B. Spielen (Airconsole und co.) unmöglich macht. Außerdem funktioniert das Verbinden nur sporadisch. Manchmal wird eine Verbindung ohne erkenntlichen Grund abgelehnt und ein ander mal funktioniert es wieder... *Nichts* ersetzt das gute alte (Kupfer-)kabel!
2,I own two laptops a heavy duty asus zenbook and a surface book. Surprisingly the adaptor does not work with my Microsoft laptop. Even more the diplay adaptor does not seem to have enough bandwidth to stream hd movies for the one laptop it works with.
5,Erleichtert enorm die Arbeit. Kein Kabelsalat mehr.Etwas zu teuer
5,cast des écrans windows et android sans être connecté au même réseau wifi !
3,I brought a v1 and a v2 - can't see any performance differences
2,Der anschluß ist idiotensicher. Kabel rein Fernseh auf HDMI stellen und Verbindung herstellen.. wunderbar.Jedoch leider ist die Verbindung nicht gerade gut. Bei normalen doppelten Bildschirm ist bereits eine 5sek Verzögerung drin.720p oder 1080p Videos gar nicht dran zu denken mit dem Adapter abzuspielen. Mit dem Adapter sollte man echt nur sachen wiedergeben die sich nicht schnell bewegen oder viel Datenfluß haben
5,Super produit et livraison à temps j'ai déjà une chromcast et le Wireless Display est complémentaire ! Je l'utilise avec ma Surface Book et je suis ravi ! Je recommande !
1,Nun habe ich auch Version 2 getestet und bin enttäuscht.Getestet mit Surface Pro 3 (erste Auslieferung) und Microsoft Lumia 950 (Continuum)Desktop:Selbst die Mausbewegung ist nicht flüssig. Videos egal welcher Qualität und egal ob über VLC oder Netflix werden nicht ruckelfrei wiedergegeben.Lumia:Ja das war mal ein kurzer Ausflug in die schöne neue Welt. Immer wieder ist die Verbindung abgebrochen flüssig war da garnichts.Fazit: Ich bestell mir einen neuen Mini-Display-Port zu HDMI Adapter (Wireless kann dies wohl doch nicht ersetzen) - und der wird auch nicht von Microsoft sein.Für mich ist es ein Rätsel wie dieser Konzern seine Kunden mit der Qualität seiner Peripheriegeräte einfach nur quält.
3,The product works ok but repeatedly drops the link necessitating frequent reconnections.
3,mais qui ne fonctionne pas sur tous les vidéo-projecteur
5,Verwende es um von meinem Desktop PC und von meinem Windows10-Handy Filme auf meinen Fernseher zu übertragen (DVD Netflix Amazon etc). Keine Probleme mit der Installation keine Probleme mit der Einrichtung keine Ruckler. Also alles Top.Blueray habe ich allerdings noch nicht versucht.
1,Adapter erfüllt nicht was er leisten soll. Seit Wochen kann ich keine einwandfreie Übertragung empfangen d.h. er schaltet nach unterschiedlicher Zeitspanne ( ca. 5 bis 30 Minuten ) komplett ab. Dann muss ich ihn wieder neu aktivieren das ist nicht Sinn der Sache. An einem Abend passiert das 5 - 6 mal. Ich bitte um Ihre Rücknahme und Rückerstattung des Kaufpreises. Mit freundlichen Grüßen  Helmut Axer  (Ich habe deswegen inzwischen einen separaten Monitor mit HDMI-Kabel bei Ihnen bestellt)
5,Einfach am Fernseher einstöpseln und los geht. Vorher müssen sich die Geräte noch koppeln aber dann arbeitet alles bestens und wie es soll. Habe einen Samsung Fernseher und ein Microsoft Surface pro 3. Bilder und Filme werden ohne ruckeln übertragen. Klasse!
5,Mit einem neuen Laptop hat es sofort beim Einschalten funktioniert. Bei einem ca. 3 Jahre alten Laptop mussten zuerst händisch viele Treiber aktualisiert werden aber seither funktioniert es auch damit problemlos.
1,Just didn't work
5,Funciona muy bien no tiene apenas lag ninguno nada que ver con la V1. Lo he probado con una Microsoft Surface Pro 4 con 16GB y un i7. Hay que tener en cuenta que él PC o el portátil debe ser dispositivo compatible WiDi Miracast. Es una combinación de tarjeta WiFi y gráfica. Funciona también navegando vía web.
5,Installation rapide. Display de vidéos film etc ok. Jeux trop de décalage.
2,Der Adapter liefert unabhängig von der "Eingangsauflösung" am HDMI Ausgang konstant 1080p. Dies wird dann zum Problem wenn man einen Beamer mit 1024x768 betreiben will da das Bild in 1900x1080 "gequetscht" und es entsteht um das eigentliche Bild ein dicker schwarzer Rand. Für diesen Zweck ist der Stick daher nur bedingt brauchbar.
2,Wollte den Wireless Adapter eigentlich nutzen um Videos von meinem Surface Pro 4 auf den Fernseher zu streamen. Leider ein totaler Reinfall. Das Bild ruckelt ohne Ende. Habe mich von den negativen Rezensionen nicht abschrecken lassen und wurde eines besseren Belehrt. Das Gerät ist heute gleich wieder Retour gegangen.
4,Thanks! :)
5,Un prodotto eccellente
5,Arrivée à temps pour Noel. Nous l'avons essayé sur un écran TV moderne + smartphone Windows phone (lumia 640XL). les films et les photos sont fluides. A tester avec des appareils ios et android.
1,Tried two of these adapters and could not get them to connect with two new Lumia 950 or a Galaxy TabS spent ours trying to get Microsoft support to no avail all they do is direct you to the self help website.... I have since find out of the Microsoft community that since the last software update to the adapter the adapter is no longer compatible with the Lumia 950!!!  After years of using Microsoft products they have now lost a customer.
5,Schnelle Lieferung und beeindruckende Qualität des Bildes. Sogar Filme laufen ohne große Verzögerung
5,Es lief alles wie beschrieben: Display Adapter in den Fernseher Tablet (Microsoft Surface) findet den Adapter beide verbinden sich und zack! ist das Bild auf dem Fernseher. Bei Windows 10 hilft es unter "Benachrichtigungen" auf "Verbinden" zu gehen dann kann das Ganze noch beschleunigt werden.
1,Usual nonsense with these kind of gadgets - they never work. I have done exactly as instructed by the website etc. it simply doesn't connect. I am sick and tired with having to write every five minutes to Microsoft about my fairly useless Surface 4 Pro and now this. My advice - get a cable - these wifi blue tooth add ons are always a pain. The Logitech keyboard I ordered for Surface 4 didn't connect either.Back to Mac!
3,taugt nicht viel
2,Ruckelt Bildqualität ist leider mies.. Für Präsentationen z.B Powerpointfolien bestimmt geeignet. Für Bewegtbild leider keine Chance. Da wird einem der Sinn des HDMI-Kalbels erst wieder bewusst.
5,Très bon produit. Se connecte très bien  avec ma tablette Samsung pour envoyer l'image sur ma télé sony.Je recommande ce produit.
2,Habe den Adapter an meinem Laptop verwendet. Auch nach dem Update konnte keine längere stabile Verbindung aufgebaut werden. Sobald ich den Laptop bewegt habe hat das Signal angefangen zu stocken. Der Laptop hatte dabei eine entfernung über 2m Meter zum Empfänger. Entfernungen von 5m in einer Wohnung waren nicht möglich. Da hat das Signal dauerhaft gestockt.
5,alles prima gelaufen
3,Tut was es soll aber eine richtig hässliche Auflösung. Filme in schöner Qualität kann man vergessen.Finde es nicht mehr so ganz Zeitgemäß
1,HDMI Stecker wird sehr warm im Betrieb. Verbindungen klappen nicht zuverlässig! Enttäuschend!
5,Con questo adattatore il portatile trasferisce il video sulla TV con immagini perfette! Funziona con Windows 10  per utenti medi  serve qualche conoscenza di base non proprio tutto automatico durante l'installazione. Io lo uso con pc lenovo e win 10. Comunicazione attraverso rete WiFi .
5,Einfach super
5,Działa bardzo dobrze. Tylko kibelek mógłby być trochę dłuższy.
5,Einfachste Installation und Nutzung mit meinem Laptop in weniger als 2 Minuten. Das nenne ich sehr gute Performance und Usability.
2,Bildübertagung unzureichend nicht ruckelfrei. Für den Verwendungszweck nicht geeignet. Daher Gerät zurück !
2,This is really not very good. I don't know if its the Surface or this widget but the picture on the screen is jerky and its a major mission to get the sound going to the tv each time too.
5,Super einfache Installation. Verbindung wird tadellos aufgebaut.
5,Hat der Adapter sein Display gefunden zeigt er das am Bildschirm / Beamer sofort an (eigenes Bild). Danach ist die Verbindung völlig unproblematisch. Als mobile Lösunge für unterwegs die ideale Lösung für Präsentationen etc.
5,Bonjour cet adaptateur est très efficace même au delà 6m en effet je l'utilise à plus de 10m sans aucun problème.
5,Rien à redire si ce n'est qu'il faut une prise USB pour faire fonctionner ce transmetteur. Une powerbank USB fait l'affaire pour les supports de diffusion qui n'ont pas ce port.
5,Super simple d'utilisation et installation. Fonctionne bien pour regarder des films/série ou vidéos en ligne.
4,Funziona molto bene e risponde perfettamente alle aspettative. Purtroppo alcuni servizi di video streaming non permettono la fruizione via Miracast (ancora non mi è ben chiaro il motivo).
2,Assez déçu du produit j ai demandé un remboursement. Je l ai acheté à la base pour projeter des vidéos de mon PC à la télé mais malgré que je sois en fibre optique il y a de la latence décallage image/son. À la rigueur ça peut etre bien pour des images ou musique seulement.
1,Leider ist das Gerät sehr unzuverlässig. Der Adapter ließ sich von Anfang an sehr schlecht verbinden. Für einen Reset musste man statt 10 Sekunden 30 Sekunden den Schalter halten und auch wurde das Ding mächtig warm. Nun kann ich seit einer Woche gar keine Verbindung mehr aufbauen und im Amazon Konto kann ich noch nichtmal Garantie oder Produktsupport anfordern. Ein Jahr sollte so ein Adapter schonmal durchhalten!
5,Essential for all kinds of displays. Makes presentations possible in difficult situations.
5,Plug and play - works like a dream.  No more 5m HDMI cables for me.
3,only works on WINDOWS 10
5,Adattatore utile per collegare in modalità wireless qualunque dispositivo Windows su TV non dotati di funzionalità mirroring. Il dispositivo in questione funziona egregiamente lo uso per collegare il mio surface alla TV e funziona perfettamente!
5,Simple et efficace
5,True plug and play
5,Connexion à la télé mise à jour paramétrage pour sécurité : et voilà. Simple facile et efficace.
4,Funciona bien pero lo devolví al darme cuenta que todas mis SamrtTV (LG) ya tenían de serie incluida esta función.
5,-
3,Verbunden mit dem Laptop funktioniert alles einwandfrei verbunden mit dem (Windows!)-Smartphon gibt es gelegentliches Ruckeln und und nicht synchrone Übertragung.
1,Dieses Gerät funktionierte von Anfang an nach dem Zufallsprinzip. Schon das bloße Verbinden mit dem Lumia 950xl oder dem Surface Pro 4 war ein Geduldsspiel so dass schon ein nötiges Update nicht möglich war. Irgendwann klappte es dann wieder mal ja mal nein. Nach einiger Zeit funktionierte der Adapter überhaupt nicht mehr auch nicht mit allen Tricks und Empfehlungen aus dem Netz. Schade aber ich habe ihn zurück geschickt und mich für eine Variante mit Kabel entschieden. Die kostet nicht mal halb so viel und funktioniert.
1,habe das gerät einige Monate schon funktioniert einwandfrei. Getestet mit Win 10 laptop Lenovo und beamer acer. Bei der Benutzung soll von Wärme geschützt werden da Bildübertragung verlangsamt sich.Nach Ablauf von 2-3 MOnaten seit dem Kauf funktioniert es nicht mehr so richtig. Die Verbindung mit dem Gerät bricht nach einige Minuten nach dem Start. Es läuft ein Video und dann friert sich das Bild und die Verbindung bricht ab. Keine auf der Micrsofot Webseite beschriebene Lösung hilft.Will das Gerät als defekt zurück senden weiß aber nicht wie.
5,Fonctionne très  bien. Image nickel. Aucun lag. Parfait pour prolonger l'écran de mon pc portable sur un un deuxième écran ou sur ma télé.
5,Installation simple et efficace.
5,Efficace et facile à installer
5,Super top installation super facile avec un prix top (pour info fnac 79€).
5,Ich benutze es sowohl zuhause als auch im Dienst. Arbeitet sehr Zuverlässung ohne Unterbrechungen. W-LAN Stream und Übertragung laufen ohne Probleme gleichzeitig.
5,Très facile d'utilisation et assez pratique un peu léger niveau réception du signal mais franchement cool
5,Works perfecly with MS Surface pro 4. There is no delay for youtube videos so for me it works perfectly.
5,bon produit pour projeter son pc sur écran
4,Molto veloce e fluido comprato per "proiettare" iptv da Smartphone o Surface sul televisore si comporta bene. Ps si scalda un po.
5,Works extremely well with my Microsoft 950XL. Immediate recognition then continuum version of Windows 10 mobile on TV screen.
2,Je l'ai acheté il y a quelques mois je m'en sers occasionnellement il est utile pour regarder rapidement un film sur sa TV en 20 secondes c'est prêt.Par contre j'ai remarqué que la qualité dépasse 720p le film rame... On voit clairement que les IPS sont bien inférieur à ce que ça devrait être... Alors je ne parle même pas d'un film en 1080p...
4,semplice e immediato da usare carichi l' app su window store "wireless display adapter"funziona benissimo ma non va con window in ambiente parallel con il mac
5,Value for money
5,Einfach top das teil.ausgepckt angeschlossn läuft.keine ruckler!mit tablett win 10 lumia950lumia 640 gekoppelt top!eindeutige kaufempfehlung.warehousededeal.top.ich kann negative bewertungen leider nicht nachvollziehen bei mir ist alles top.
1,I bought one of these so that I could be more mobile when delivering lessons than when connected to my display directly and it has been terrible since day one. Constant disconnects every five minutes or so something I never had when connected via a cable and no solution I have found online has worked including updating to the latest firmware. Not fit for purpose
2,Ma tabletteSurface Pro 4 se déconnecte régulièrement si je décide de regarder un mp4 sur l'écran de l'hôtel.  J'ai également utilisé mon Galaxy Tab S2 même constat si ce n'est qu'il a fallu installer un logiciel Miracast sous Android pour voir l'adaptateur. Entre un projecteur DLP et un PowerPoint c'est pratique mais d'un usage limité. Bref c'est très moyen.
1,Hat nicht funktioniert und wurde wieder zurückgesendet.
5,Der Artikel ist Top die Abwicklung war perfekt!
2,Verbindung konnte nicht gehalten werden. Permanent wurde die Übertragung beendet. Entfernung zum TV ca. 4 Meter...Update hat den Fehler nicht behoben.Ansich eine nette Idee aber für den Preis nicht akzeptabel!Habe das Teil wieder zurück geschickt.Danke an Amazon für den ausgezeichnetenRücksende-Service!
5,Alles bestens funktioniert einwandfrei sowohl bei Kunden in Präsentationen als auch auf Reisen im Hotel-Zimmer.
5,Alles super der Stick macht was er soll
5,Vom HP Elite zum Beamer: Fehlerlose Verbindung und einwandfreie Übertragung des Bildes. Stromversorgung kann vom USB-Eingang des Beamers abgegriffen werden.
5,Amazing product!
5,Expensive for what it is but does the job. No idea if the cheaper non-Microsoft would work as well.
5,Prima Lösung enfache Installation. Funktioniert leider nur Surfaces und nicht mit jedem anderen Laptop. Aber wir haben nur SF im Einsatz daher für den zweck top
5,Funktioniert wie es soll.
4,Le cuesta conectar si no te pones cerca al aparato pero una vez que conecta va de lujo. Estoy contento.
1,L'affichage sur le second écran est une catastrophe : impossible de faire un mouvement correct avec la souris (trop de latence) la qualité d'affichage est très mauvaise ... inutilisable tout simplement. J'ai pensé que c'était la distance puis j'ai rapproché l'ordinateur à moins d'un mètre du second écran et c'était pareil.De plus l'affichage du pc principal (i5-8400 et gtx 1060) est devenu moins fluide comme si d'un coup la carte graphique était d'un autre temps.Le seul point positif aurait été la facilité d'installation et de connexion si la qualité avait été correcte.
2,Worked well for audio transfer but lag rendered it fairly unusable when trying to watch a video; especially when trying to use the computer for other tasks at the same time.
5,gut
5,il prodotto funziona bene. usato con un tablet wi-fi e funziona senza problemi. Ho provato ad usarlo con un pc collegato via cavo ad un router e non c'è la possibilità di vedere il dispositivo; quindi credo chepurtroppo funzioni solo se il pc/tablet è collegato in wi-fi.
5,Rien à redire. On branche ça fonctionne. Je peux connecter ma surface pro 3 à la tv à un autre écran ou au vidéo projecteur. Tout cela sans fil 😉
5,Besteld door onze IT afdeling.
5,Sorte de chromecast indispensable avec une surface pro installation hyper rapide et le tout sans fil vraiment génial !
5,Kann ich nur weiter empfehlen
3,Connection via android sans problème mais incapable d'avoir une connection stable sur Windows 10. Autant garder la. Chrome cast
1,Ich habe mir den Adapter schicken lassen mit dem Gedanken ich habe für das Geld etwas gutes gekauft. Leider kann ich nur sagen dass es nicht der Fall war. Keine Ahnung was andere für Glück damit hatten ich jedenfalls nicht.Nachdem ich die neueste Software sogar installiert hatte dachte ich jetzt wird es besser.... nein. Die Reichweite von 2m manchmal war nicht störungsfrei. Mal kein Ton manchmal hängt die Übertragung..... Sorry das müssen die Techniker nochmal ran.....Da geht ja der Transmitter x - mal besser und !!!
4,Prodotto ricevuto nei tempi previsti.Intuitiva l'installazione e l'utilizzo fare attenzione ad eventuali raccomandazione a seconda del sistema operativo del PC in uso.
5,Was easy to set up and worked very well with my Windows 10 Surface Book after updating the firmware.
2,Not very impressive to be honest.Doesn't alway connect first time and cuts out occasionally when it can't handle it.
2,Der Adapter funktioniert. Allerdings  zum Video Streamen auf den TV nicht  geeignet. Das Bild hängt leider immer wieder kurz. Nicht dramatisch aber  doch störend. Außerdem wird der Adapter extrem  heiß ( nur mit Video getestet)
5,Fonctionne parfaitement sur Windows 10
5,As expected V2 seems good but had little use so far. Would recommend for screen mirroring and Continuum with 950XL
5,Sehr einfache Handhabung. Ausprobiert mit Samsung S5 Mini und auch Samsung Galaxy Tab2. Funktioniert nicht an jedem Beamer mit HDMI.
1,Geht nicht ohne einen Smart TV der TV braucht umgebiengt eine App zum koppeln für mich absolut unbrauchbar! Geld zum Fenster rausgehauen!
1,Couldnt get it to connect to any of the devices I have - which was disappointing. It was discoverable alright but the connection would just not hold
5,facilissimo da collegare dimensioni ridotte particolarmente indicato per chi viaggia peccato che alcune app (sky e netflix) non permettono l'uso del dispositivo
2,Acheté 2 fois ce produit. Il est super sauf que ...  ultra fragile les petites dents qui évitent qu'il tourne sur lui meme sont si petite et plastique qu'elles ne jouent plus leur role au bout de quelques mois. Quel dommage
5,Erfüllt sein Zweck mit guter Qualität schnelle Lieferung gerne 5*
4,congegno utile ma non indispensabile soprattutto per la non eccessiva distanza di operatività e soprattutto non è adattabile a tutti gli apparecchi
4,Buon prodotto anche se la connessione non è sempre stabile.ogni tanto si scollega dal telefono.io ho un lumia 950 e lo uso con continuum
5,Produit conforme fonctionne très bien sous Android avec un Huawei et un AsusRien à dire je le recommande sen problème
5,Einfach einstecken und loslegen (Anleitung wird im Surface angezeigt). Ist echt ein geniales Ding. Endlich weg mit dem Kabelsalat!Brauche noch ein Wort .. ;-)
5,Perfekt. Habe einen älteren Panasonic TV kabellos mit dem Notebook verbunden. Funktioniert wie beschrieben. Bild und Ton werden übertragen. Einstecken und loslegen. Läuft auch ohne Software.
5,Habe schon lange kein Gerät gekauft dass sich so einfach installieren ließ.Funktioniert mit Samsung Fernseher Samsung Tablett und Samsung Smartphone hervorragend.Am längsten hat das Einstöpseln gedauert.
1,Nach einem Software Update auf meinem Surface Book läßt sich der Adapter nicht mehr verbinden. Aussage Microsoft Support "Problem bekannt ist durch ein Update entstanden - Man wartet auf unbestimmte Zeit bis das Problem behoben ist Kein Timeframe". Bis dahin lief die Verbindung mehr schlecht als recht; Abbrüche Verbindungsqualität schwankt. Ich bin also nun stolzer Besitzer von 60 Euro Plastikmüll bitte Finger weg lassen und andere Lösung suchen.
5,wie beschrieben
5,nach anfänglichen schwierigkeiten problemlos und schnell. es war ein firmware-update erforderlich. für alles geeignet - filme  präsentationen und dokumente kein problem
5,Really easy to setup answers arrived in 5 working days
5,amazing - does exactly what it should. worked first time straight out of box.
5,Easy to connect windows10 laptop wirelessly
5,testé avec galaxy S8 et Tab A parfait et pratique pour projeter des dias lors de mes cours je recommande !
1,Positive:- NothingNegative:- This stick doesn't work with Microsoft software.My advise:Go for Google Chromecast which works flawless and is very cheap.
1,Product didn’t work as required. Sent it back and had a refund
1,Bin echt enttäuscht. Konnte mein laptop nicht damit verbinden also hab ich ihn wieder zurück geschickt.
5,Works and is easy to use!
5,Gerne wieder
5,Reçu hyper vite fait son travail couplet avec une surface pro 2017 sur un vieux Samsung me reste plus qu'à changer le téléviseur ☺️
5,So glad it works so glad cause my smart TVs not so smart.
5,this adapter is great  streams movies from pc and laptop with no problem
4,Buono per gli usi normali e per le mie esigenze. Per editing video o altro conviene scegliere altri prodotti similari più porenti
5,Easy to use with all my devices which include Windows android and ios.I can screen share and cast media on my big TV now!
5,Much more stable than V1...But lacks the HDMI extender.Which is a shame...
5,tut was es soll
1,Die Überschrift sagt es ja schon: Mit meinen Android-Tablet und Smartphone klappt der Stick ganz gut allerdings sollte man sich nicht mehr als 3m vom Adapter wegbewegen dann kann es zu Störungen kommen.Katasrophal ist hingegen die Benutzung mit meinem Surface Pro 4. Es kommt ständig zu Verbindungsabbrüchen es braucht bis zu 3 Anläufe ehe er überhaupt verbindet und je nachdem welches Programm man öffnet stürzt er auch komplett ab.Zudem kann ich keine Verbesserung zur ersten Version außer der kompakteren Bauart erkennen.Einfach nur noch peinlich Microsoft!
1,Below expectations picture quality is poor with lags and not reliable. There were very few moments I thought it could work but unfortunately it just couldn't. Maybe it's useful for static slides but with motion pictures it is just frustrating.
5,schnell und alles ok
5,geht ganz gut spart den Kabelsalat. War beim Rechner dabei ansonsten eigentlich zu teuer - kaufen würde ich es mir nicht; geschenkt ok
5,works great so easy to use no complaints
2,Blurry picture. Very disappointed.
1,Headline says it all really - unit kept resetting and was not found by any device trying to connect to it.  Completely useless.
1,Verbindung mit Smartphone konnte ich noch nicht testen. anfangs alles Gut. Aber nach kurzer Zeit ist der Bildschirm schwarz der Cursor ist da und lässt sich bewegen sonst nichts.Auch ein update kann nicht durchgeführt werdenErgebnis => Schrott
1,Leider funktioniert der Adapter äußerst unzuverlässig. Bei meinem ThinkPad mit Intel i7-7500U und Intel HD Graphics 620 kann der Adapter mit dem aktuellen Grafiktreiber keine Verbindung herstellen. Mit dem älteren Treiber funktioniert es. Die Übertragung ist nicht für bewegte Bilder geeignet. Filme laufen nicht flüssig und Bildfehler sind keine Seltenheit. Für unbewegte Bilder mag der Adapter geeignet sein.Für mich ist er so nicht zu gebrauchen.
5,io
5,Efficace et pas cher
5,Kaufempfehlung!
5,Conforme à la description
5,herausragendes Produkt! Problemlose Installation und super Performance. Sowohl alle Steckverbindungen als auch alle Kabel sind im Lieferumfang enthalten. Echt toll.
5,Le premier dongle fonctionnais mal.celui ci  hd  fonctionne tresbienPeu de temps de latence. Tres pratique  . Mobile tablette ordi sous win 10 tout fonctionneGenial
5,Funktioniert einwandfrei.. Easy einzurichten
5,Il n'y a rien à configurer : on le place sur la TV on allume on connecte et ça fonctionne (windows et android)
3,Attention compatibilité MiracastMon PC ne l'a pas mais mon lumia 640 l'a détecté. Une tentative de connexion et puis il ne l'a plus jamais détecté.Je sois encore essayer avec d'autres appareils.
5,Extrêmement simple d'utilisation !Permet de raccorder à ma TV ma Surface Pro mon Lumia 950 et ma tablette Nexus 7 d'un clic!
5,Super article simple a installer et a utiliser en revanche un peu cher selon moi
1,Trotz der durchaus durchwachsenen Rezensionen dieses Adapters entschied ich mich den Adapter auszuprobieren. Der Adapter hat mit einem Samsung TV und einem nagelneuen Surface Pro (2017) genau einmal eine Verbindung zwischen Surface und Samsung hergestellt. Danach verweigert der Adapter persistent seinen Dienst. Er wird schlicht nicht mehr erkannt vom Notebook. Der Display Adapter ist somit völlig unbrauchbar und wird zurückgesendet.
1,Ich wollte meinen Laptop Screen auf meinen TV spiegeln (mit Chromecast wird ja nur der Inhalt vom Chrome Browser gespiegelt.).Das spiegeln hat leider nicht funktioniert da scheinbar mein Laptop nicht kompatible mit diesem Display Adapter ist. Habe auch Software Updates gesucht aber ohne Erfolg.Deswegen habe ich Adapter wieder zurück geschickt
2,Le produit a fonctionné. Maintenant il ne fonctionne plus!
1,Verbindet schwer trotz Update. Verbindung trennt sich immer wieder und verbindet sich manchmal nicht mehr. Verzögerungen und wirklich zahlreiche Tonunterbrechungen.  Brauchbar nur mit sehr viel Geduld - wenn man arbeiten möchte ......Kabel legen.
1,Leider gehöre ich seit kurzem auch zu den leidtragenden Miracast-Besitzern.Der Adapter ist nicht mehr vom Notebook (win10) auffindbar er lässt sich auch nicht mehr reseten.Eine Rücksendung über amazon ist nicht möglich ich wurde weiter an den marktplace-Anbieter verwiesen.Dieser wiederrum schickt den Kunden weiter an Microsoft.Da habe ich mir nun 15 Stunden lang die Warteschleifen-Musik angehört.Immerhin habe ich jetzt eine Bearbeitungsnummer. Mal sehen......
5,Perfetto. Facile da montare e configurazione automatica
1,Das einzig positive ist dass die Verbindung sofort funktioniert.Der Rest ist eine Katastrophe! Ich hab ein Surface Pro 4 und dachte mir das wäre eine sinnvolle Erweiterung.Was ist die häufigste Bildschirmauflösung? Ich hätte mal auf HD getippt! Ohne Nachjustierung über die Windows App werden aber die Ränder abgeschnitten!Die Latenzzeiten sind ein Graus und beim Video abspielen hängt das Ding permanent hinterher!Fazit: Nicht ausgereift und nicht mal für Präsentationen zu verwenden.
5,Très simple d'installation il suffit de brancher.J'ai vu qu'il y avait des tutos sur youtube pour ce modèle si ça peut aider...
5,Package arrived on time. Clear instructions for set up and works a treat.
5,Did the job
5,arbeitet mit windows 10 perfekt zusammen
5,Hat alles ohne Probleme geklappt
3,aunque duplica la pantalla mi surface pro 4 i5 4GB Ram se vuelve muy lenta cuando intento ver videos. para el resto funciona bien
2,Utilizzando il miracast di Windows con il mio PC non ha senso questo prodotto per vedere se il vostro pc ha questa funzione WIN+K
2,It's a nice gimmick but it hardly ever seems to work.
5,very simple in use and video works great - no lag noticed. Tried FHD movies. Did try games so in that case I dont know
1,It didn’t work at all  i try everything with this and even though in a very close distance didn’t work and I return it
1,Doesn't work. Many hours wasted going through Microsoft troubleshooting. Link on MSoft site for hardware support only for US and Canada.You might get lucky and it will work out of the box otherwise prepare yourself for a wasted weekend.
5,Super
5,Getest en werkt perfect met samung S7.
5,Funktioniert super.
1,Ich verstehe nicht warum Microsoft so ein Gerät "entwickelt". In fast allen Smartv-Geräten sind schon eine "Verbindung"-App mit drin die aber beim streamen oder Videos völlig unbrauchbar sind da es nie flüssig läuft. Ok Smartv-Hersteller sind nicht daran interessiert dass man außerhalb ihren authorisierten Apps ihr Gerät zu gut nutzen kann... Microsofts Wireless Adapter V2 ist aber in der Hinsicht genauso schlecht: Für streamen und Videos unbrauchbar. Warum das denn? Deshalb habe ich es zurückgeschickt.
5,work 100%
5,Passt
5,Pour partager les vidéos du PC (youtube ou autre film) sur la télé c'est nickel et pas besoin de tirer de câbles à travers le salon.
1,Ne peut être mis à jour que sur un pc Windows avec une application du store. Je l'ai acheté pour ma tablette Android mais je ne peux le mettre à jour car mon vieux portable fait partie de la looooooongue liste des terminaux incompatibles avec ce produit car trop vieux.  Dommage car il fonctionne avec ma tablette mais avec un firmware de 2016 que je ne pourrais jamais mettre à jour...Bref pas top pour plein de raisons (performance sécurité etc.)
5,Funktioniert reibungslos
1,Das Display Adapter schaltet sich immer mal von alleine ab und der Beamer mit dem ich dem Adapter benutze schaltet sich in Schwarz und Weiß.Ich würde gerne das Adapter zurückgeben und mein Geld bekommen.
1,Ich habe mir den Adapter gekauft um mit meinem Surface im Unterricht kabellos mit dem Beamer zu arbeiten. Leider ließ sich der Adapter nicht einmal 10 Minuten ohne Verbindungsabbrüche betreiben auch wenn der Laptop in unmittelbarer Nähe zum Adapter steht. Schade die Idee ist ja super funktioniert nur leider überhaupt nicht.
5,Perfect
2,Doesn’t always work and needs to have had airplay
1,Wollte den Adapter für meinen Projektor verwenden. Leider ist es eher nur Zufall wenn der Adapter einmal funktioniert.Ich bekomme immer nur die selbe Meldung vom Windows 10 Info-Center: "Verbinden Sie das Gerät noch einmal." Reset des Adapters und mehrmaliger Neustart des Computers führten nicht zum Erfolg. Update ist aktuell.Muss leider vom Kauf dieses Gerätes abraten da es nicht so wirklich das tut was es eigentlich sollte.
5,war alles so wie beschriebeneinfache Installation und funktioniert primawürde es wieder kaufenwerde es gerne Freunden und Bekannten empfehlen
1,Comprato per vedere i film che acquisto o noleggio dall'app Film e Tv di Windows nel grande schermo del salotto. Completamente inutile! Con il PC mi dice che devo attivare la funzione HDCP per poter guardare video la funzione è attiva dal pannello di controllo nvidia quindi non so perché non funziona ma anche se funzionasse sarebbe inutile perché la latenza che c'è in ambito desktop è assurda il mouse si muove dopo secondi e la qualità video è penosa.Provo con il mio Windows 10 Mobile (Lumia 930) e la cosa migliora enormemente ma sempre non ci siamo. Quando guardo i film qualche scatto gli viene e la qualità video pure diminuisce abbastanza.Ho provato a collegare un cavo HDMI bello lungo dal mio PC alla TV e il paragone assolutamente non c'è qualità video ottima e nessuna latenza. A che dovrebbe servire questo inutile apparecchio? Costa pure 60€. Mah!!! Restituito meno male esiste amazon. Grazie!
1,Für Präsentationen gut geeignet aber nicht für Videostreaming. Es kommt immer wieder zu Rucklern und Tonaussetzern
5,Produkt wie beschrieben. Gute Nutzbarkeit. Keine Probleme.
5,Pour projeter le contenu de mon téléphone. Quand et où je veux.
1,Reçu le bon produit de la marque Microsoft.Cependant il est inutile. J’ai essayé de l’utiliser en partage d’écran avec une surface pro 6 mais de très long à réagir et en mode vidéo c’est une horreur
5,Funktioniert super.
5,Mit Surface pro 4 und Lumia 950 klappt es perfekt an Beamer und TV.Koppeln problemlos an die kurze Reichweite kann man sich gewöhnen.
5,Fonctionne parfaitement meme avec ecran haute resolution (1920*1080) avec video haute resolution a plusieurs metres de distance. Sur Windows 10 fonctionnement instantané et très simple.
5,Content. Bien
1,I really don't think this is a genuine Microsoft product. The packaging was cheap and the product just doesn't work very cleanly. Its very clunky during screen transitions  and it is 100% not of the quality that one would expect of a real Microsoft Product.
5,Da von Microsoft angeboten gibt es keinerlei Kompatibilitätsprobleme. Egal ob Surface-Tabletts oder Windows-Handys.Funzt einfach und problemlos wird erkannt event. Treiber installiert und fertig.
1,Trotz Firmwareupdate und Stromversorgung über ein Netzteil kann kein ruckelfreies Bild übertragen werden.Schade da bin ich mit dem klassischen HDMI Kabel besser bedient.
1,Bei Übetragung von Video Full HD Bilddarstellung in "Wellen". Die angezeigten Frames pro Sekunden schwanken sodass zeitweise Zeitlupe dann wieder schneller Vorlauf.Das ganze bei autonomer 300 Mbit WLAN Verbindung. Für Übertragung von Desktop ppt's und DiaShow ausreichend. Die Umsetzung des Videostreams auf HDMI scheint nicht gut gelöst. Da für Videoübertragung geordert leider wieder zurück. Alle anderen Komponenten zeigen über andere Wege keine Performanceprobleme.
5,Et sans installer quoi que ce soit. Sur ce coup...rien à ajouter: parfait
1,Worked for less than 6 months then died.Amazon app won't let me return it.
3,Por ahora no he conseguido hacerlo funcionar de manera estable. Además se le echa de menos un adaptador de corriente que permita utilizarlo en pantallas que tengan HDMI pero no USB (que las hay).
2,just what was needed
5,Does what it says on the box
1,Ich muss meine vorhergehende Rezension korrigieren. Nach dem einmaligen Funktionieren ist keine Verbindung mehr möglich. Leider. Geht zurück.
1,Habe aufgrund der guten Rezensionen diesen Adapter bestellt.Bevor ich ihn überhaupt verwenden konnte musste ich unzählige Windows Updates runter laden.Danach hat er auch nur teilweise funktioniert. Wenn ich mich verbunden haben hat das Bild geflackert und ab dem zweiten versuch hat es garnicht mehr funktioniert. Mit dem Smartphone (Galaxy Alpha) hat es auch nicht geklappt.Somit habe ich den Adapter wieder zurückgeschickt.
5,Great product works out of the box sends both video and audio. More features with the free windows app from Microsoft store.
5,petit efficace
2,surface pro 4 und der adapter sind zwar kompatibel aber es ist nicht möglich etwas zu streamen ohne artefakte am bildschirm. schade. werde ihn wieder zurücksenden.
1,Ce produit est tous simplement impossible à installer. Après avoir suivi les différentes instructions le device est passé en thaïlandais et il est donc impossible de savoir quel opération il faut effectué. Le device est visible depuis mon PC W10 mais il est strictement impossible de me connecter dessus. Je déconseille ce produit dont les pré-requis d'installation sont totalement obscur.
1,Hat am Anfang gut geklappt aber mittlerweile lässt sich mein Surface Pro fast NIE mehr damit verbinden egal mit welchem Tv.Habe alle möglichen Problembehandlungsschritte ausprobiert und manchmal klappt es nach einem Herumgetüftel von vielleicht 20+ Minuten.Meistens klappt es aber nicht weshalb dieser Adapter für mich komplett unbrauchbar ist!
1,have to log-off 3-4 times before it worked. Also hangs Windows when it failed.
5,Fonctionne très bien avec les Surface Book 2
2,Ok mais marche sur un PC sur 2 très dur à connecté et une forte latence... Je suis très décu si vous souhaitez regarder un film sur une TV depuis un PC windows 10 passez votre chemin
5,arrivato in anticipo. aperto con esso alla tv scaricato app windows adapter sull' pc ed partito alla grande ... you tubefilmgaming dall' pc alla smart tv . ottimo aquisto
1,Fonctionne quand cela veut.  Se déconnecte tout le temps malgré les innombrables tentatives !!!!pourtant je suis patient mais là j’ai craqué je l’ai mis à la poubelle !
1,Grosse galère pour pouvoir connecter l'adaptateur aucune réponse efficace de Microsoft. J'ai désactivé mon antivirus (AVG) et là ça marche... Enfin ça marche impossible de lire correctement une vidéo c'est saccadé... Pour le prix je pense qu'on peut s'attendre à beaucoup mieux. J'ai acheté un adaptateur chinois à 10€ qui lit beaucoup mieux les vidéos.L'adaptateur Microsoft est à éviter.....
5,Fonctionne très bien. Pas de perte de synchro comme avec d'autres produits moins chers. Compatible avec les téléphones Android. Prend très peu de place.
5,Niente a che vedere con il chromecast. Questo prodotto è decisamente migliore perché non occupa banda wi-fi. Permette la connessione ad internet con wi-fi del dispositivo connesso in contemporanea. Utilissimo e di utilizzo immediatoottimo prodotto
5,genau das was ich gesucht habe funktioniert einwandfrei Übertragung ohne ruckeln etc.Kann ich jedem empfehlen der eine stabile Kabellose Lösung sucht.
1,Bonjour je met se petit commentaire pour vous dire tout simplement que ce produite est tout simplement NUL on nous le décrit comme un miracast il n'est même pas capable de le faire avec un pc ! Et pis essayer des contacter Microsoft il ne savent même pas de quoi on parle aucun support dessus ! On ma même raccrocher au nez ! Totalement déçus ne pas acheter !
5,Très pratique pour projeter l’image de son pc avec un projecteur.
5,Ho comprato il prodotto per connettere il mio computer windows 10 al mio tv in sala senza cavi facilità di utilzzo e uso. Funziona anche per il mio tablet android.... imballo perfetto tempi di consegna ottimi.  Acquisto consigliato.
1,Mit meine Android Geräten ist die Verbindung kein Problem; brauch ich aber nicht und meine PCs verbinden nicht. Wahnsinn wenn man bedenkt das das Teil von Microsoft für Microsoft entwickelt wurde.
1,Using this with Surface 4 Pro tablet. However it connects ok but disconnects after about 20 seconds. Have tried Microsoft website for help but their automated answers do nothing. Very disappointing.
5,Superb exactly as ordered and worked straight outta the box 5*
5,Regarder les vidéos d'internet sur la TV.
1,Doesn't work properly lag not good quality and too expensive
5,pourquoi ne pas intégrer une batterie dans le dongle pour la charger via USB...sinon très facile à utiliser via SurfaceBook
1,Ich hatte bis vor kurzem das alte Modell da sich trotz Updates von Firmware und Windows mein Laptop beim Verbinden mit dem Adapter immer aufgehängt hat dachte ich dass ich vl das neuere Modell brauche.  Falsch gedacht.. Der Neue funktioniert noch weniger als der Alte.. Verbindung bricht immer nach zwei Sekunden sofort wieder ab
5,Prodotto molto utile per proiettare presentazioni su schermo TV il ritardo tra pc e schermo dove viene proiettato il pc è accettabile e non dà molto fastidio mentre la riproduzione dei video è abbastanza fluida.
5,Sono contento di avere scelto questo prodotto la spedizione è stata veramente immediata ero un po' scettico ma mi sono dovuto ricredere in quanto il prodotto funziona abbastanza bene ed i Microlag sono impercettibil . È il miglior miracast in commercio
5,Easy connection to Surface Pro 4
1,Non capisco come Microsoft possa vendere un accessorio del genere i video anche se in bassa risoluzione rallentano e si bloccano continuamente qualità pessima
1,I’m not happy with this adapter because it’s not working on apple devices such as iPhone.
1,Eigentlich könnte es so einfach sein. Nachdem sowohl das Surface als auch dieser Stick nicht wirklich günstig sind klappt die Verbindung trotzdem stabilem WLAN nicht. Weitere Versuche mit topaktuellen Dell-Notebooks schlugen auch fehl!Microsoft sollte wirklich mal bei Apple vorbeischauen denn dort funktioniert das Thema seit Jahren reibungslos.
1,This product does not work with systems with AMD processors. Hence please keep in mind before buying.If you find this review helpful in making a decision to buy Then please click 'I found this review helpful' button
5,Funtktioniert mit dem Lumia 730 (win 8.1) und 930 (win 10) tadellos. Bild und Ton werden übertragen. Der Verbindungsaufbau klappt einwandfrei.
1,Habe mir extra das neueste Model vom Microsoft Display Adapter gekauft weil ich dachte der passt bestimmt am Besten zu meinem neuen Surface 4 Pro. Aber weit gefehlt! Eine Verbindung ließ sich zwar ein Mal herstellen und dann nie wieder!Auf jeden Fall die Finger davon lassen. Der Vorgänger ist von Verbinden her um Längen besser!
5,Best way to play anything from a laptop wirelessly !! Perfect
1,Mit keinem meiner Windows 10 Systeme funktioniert dieser Adapter Ich selber habe Ahnung von Netzwerk Technik und Windows (MCITP EA) und dieser Adapter ist einfach "scheiße". Kein vergleich zum Chrome oder Apple TV er funktioniert einfach nicht.
1,An sich fand ich die Idee von kabelloser Bildübertragung echt klasse. Jedoch stockt das Bild dermaßen. Abhilfe verschafft nur die nahe Positionierung des Abspielmediums (Laptop) am Empfänger. Und dann kann man besser ein HDMI Kabel nutzen.(Zudem brauch das Abspielmedium WLAN um eine Verbindung herstellen zu können.)
5,ausgepackt am Fernseher angesteckt und vom Notebook sofort erkannt. Beste Qualität am Fernseher. So macht es Spaß etwas Neues einzusetzen.
5,Ottimo articolo arrivato prima della data prevista mi sono disperata un po' per capire come dovevo  togliere l'adattatore dalla custodia perchè avevo timore di danneggiarlo ma in seguito è stata una passeggiata connessione riuscita al primo tentativo.
1,Poor picture quality. Returned.
5,se connecte facilement sur un smartphone androïd (samsung S4) plus aléatoire avec un portable assus sous W 8.1. Très bien.
5,produit simple d'utilisation marche sans difficulté. très bonne fluidité
5,Simple d'utilisation juste à brancher les deux connecteurs (USB=Alim et HDMI=Sortie Video) sur la télé et suivre les instructions du livret pour projeter.
1,Does not work with any apple devices
5,Works perfectly with a Surface Pro. No stutter at all.
1,- instabile Verbindung mit permanenter Verbindungsabbrüche- Viel zu starke Verzögerung beim Übertragen Spiegeln des BildsMit dem Ergebnis dass ich doch lieber am direkt PC bleibe statt durch dieses Produkt den Fernseher zu nutzen
2,Article renvoyer. La connexion est très instables et l'ecran se deconnecte au bout de 10 minutes.
5,Fantástico producto. Funciona perfectamente y es facilísimo de instalar. Muy recomendable. Cumple lo prometido sin desagradables sorpresas calidad Microsoft. Bravo
5,El funcionamiento impecable no necesita configuraciones raras pero antes comprueba que tu pc puede soportar pantalla inalámbricaDespués probé el Chromecast y me gusta más además de ser compatible con cualquier pc
5,Fonctionne immédiatement quasiment sans réglage avec ma surface pro 3. Excellent produit très simple d'utilisation et très pratique.Je le recommande.
5,Fab - so easy to use
5,Thank you
1,Das schlechteste was ich seit langem gesehen hab. Mit verschiedenen Monitoren/Fernsehern und auf Sichtweite mit einem Surface Pro 3 nur schlimmstes Bild und jede Menge Bildstörungen. Echt schade um die verschenkte Stunde rumtesten geht direkt zurück an amazon.
1,Nach exakt zwei Jahren defekt. Kaum aus der Gewährleistung raus.
1,did not work on 4 pc 3 windows10 and 1 8.1save your money. Microsoft Help Does not Help
5,Funziona meglio delle aspettative il segnale si mantiene anche oltre i 10 metri e il ritardo è molto trascurabile. OK anche la riproduzione dei films
1,Big lag in displaying a video. Runs way too hot for conventional electronis gear.
5,Works great
5,Perfect.
2,J'ai utilisé ce produit pour connecter ma Surface pro 4 à la télé la connexion n'est pas très fluide et de temps en temps il y a des déconnexions.Vu le prix on est en droit de s'attendre à mieux.Je l'ai retourné à Amazon.
1,They regularly disconnect. Not reliable for commercial use.
5,Works brilliantly with our Panasonic TV and Surface
1,Ruckelt bei mir leider so sehr dass ich das Teil zurück geschickt habe. Hatte gehofft Videos auf den Fernseher spiegeln zu können. Das war leider nix.
1,Für ältere Laptops nicht geeignet!
5,Cool a utiliser... mais impossible de connecter au réseau déjà existant.. si quelqu'un a la solution je suis preneur. Merci
1,negativ:Kein Netzteil enthalten.Kann keine Verbindung aufbauen wurde aber gefunden.zusätzliche App notwendigfazit: leider enttäuschend Chinaclone könnenes besser. Geht also sofort zurück.
1,Poor connection and was not as good as it was supposed to be according to the publicity by Microsoft..!!Unfortunately I feel bad about falling for Microsoft again..!!!
2,Je l'ai acheté en espérant de pouvoir utiliser le TV du salon comme grand écran du PC portable. Malheureusement mon PC n'est pas compatible avec la technologie Miracast j'ai du rendre le produit. Impeccables Amazon et le vendeur qui m'a remboursé rapidement.
1,J'ai acheté cet adaptateur pour ma surface book. Cet adaptateur pour écran sans fil est un produit Microsoft et pourtant il n'est pas vu par ma Surface Book 2.  J'ai réalisé les étapes de correction proposées par Microsoft. Rien à faire. J'abandonne et retourne le produit.J'ai testé avec mon smartphone Sony et là ça fonctionne sans souci...
1,Le mode d'emploi sous Windows 10 est totalement incompréhensible.J'ai du faire appel à un informaticien. Après deux heures d'essai nous obtenons une connexion qui ne tient pas et se coupe  à tout moment.Bref extrêmement déçue je retourne le produit
2,Buenas. Pensé que funcionaría con mi Android y con linux pero no es así. Ojalá ofreciera mayor compatibilidad puesto que así no le puedo dar ningún uso.El producto seguramente esté bien pero a mí no me funciona. Un saludo.
1,it never worked
1,rubbish stopped my talktalk tv from working never  ever connected got so hot had to remove
5,Transfert pc sur écran 84”
1,Ho acquistato il prodotto avendo un Surface Pro 3 ed un monitor esterno HP da 22 pollici.Cercavo qualcosa che mi permettesse di non avere in mezzo alla scrivania dei cavi ma questo dispositivo non ha per nulla soddisfatto le mie esigenze.La qualità video è pessima tanto da far sembrare il monitor non un FullHD.Il delay è imbarazzante e rende fastidioso il passaggio del mouse che avviene a scatti.La riproduzione di un video è impossibile in quanto fuori sincro.tanto piccolo non troppo economico e soprattutto non adatto.Ho effettuato anche tutti gli aggiornamenti consigliati dall'applicazione dedicata ma la situazione non è per niente migliorata anzi.Peccato meglio tornare al cavo tradizionale.
1,Auflösung kann nicht geändert werden somit unbrauchbar für mich. Selbst wenn man in Windows die Auflösung ändert bleibt das input Signal am Monitor bei 1080p
1,ich habe knapp 50€ für ein hochwertiges produkt gezahlt und erwarte mir auch eine entsprechende verpackung inkl betriebsanleitung und KEIN GEBRAUCHTES TEIL MIT GEBRAUCHSSPUREN!danke
1,Il prodotto in se funziona ma non e' specificato come fare ad avere un pc che supporti la rete miracast.Vi troverete pc o notebook pagato l ompossibile ma di 3 4annni che non si adattano a meno che non cambiate o scheda madre o scheda videoin primis scheda di rete wifi che se quella non e' compatibile siete messi male.Lasciate perdere l USB wifi tanto nessuno vi sapra dire se compatibile.Invecie pc piu recenti mediocri che vanno una meraviglia ci sono  ma di logica di perche' loro si non c'e'.Occhio prima di acquistare informatevi non basta attaccarlo alla tv e via.
1,Wenn der PC kein Miracast unterstützt kann man diesen Adapter nicht nutzen
1,Verzögerung zwischen PC und Monitor ist für meinen Geschmack zu groß = Ghost Mouse
2,Bel objet mais pas terrible à l'utilisation. Peut être dédié à un modèle de Pc précis.Attention ceetains flux vidéo ne peuvent pas être déportés sur l'écran étendu.
5,tres bon produit. rien a redire
5,Works perfectly easy to use with Windows 10
1,Ich habe ein Microsoft Surface Pro und es verbindet nicht. Absoluter Schrott wenn es schon mit den eigenen Produkten nicht funktioniert.
5,Does what it's meant to
5,Proietto il dekstop del mio pc portatile asus con windows 8 sul tv senza problemi. Quello che cercato arrivato in tempo. consigliatissimo per tutti professionisti e non.
5,works well
1,Funktioniert nicht zurück gesendet !
1,Same as V1 too laggy and unreliable. Returned for refund.
5,Dopo qualche problema con il Lumia 920 va molto meglio con il 950XL
1,Suffers from interference making it impossible to watch anything at times plus overheats way too much
5,Works a treat
1,Tried this on Surface Pro 3. Poor connection and very difficult to get connected.Extremely frustrating.
1,Waste of money.  Not a patch on chrome cast
1,Did not work with Windows 10 Asus tablet but did work with Windows 10 phone. Returned
1,Has delayed playback is not compatible with any device not worth the money!
2,Disconnessione continua e fluidità pessima. Molto lag nonostante l'utilizzo di un surface pro 3. Pessimo e non consiglio l'acquisto. chiederò il rimborso
1,Windows stürtzt mit blauem Bildschirm ab beim Versuch der Verbindung! Keine Empfehlung. Warum ist das so schwer? Daher Rückgabe erforderlich.
5,Fondamentale per chi ha prodotti Microsoft tipo il surface o i lumia facile da installare e facile da connettere ci si può anche divertire con il Continuum con un lag sopportabile da provare
5,Non so cosa scrivere perchè è perfetto immagini pulite e definite senza il minimo lag. Funziona alla grande ma non per giocare perchè il ritardo di segnale può creare problemi.
5,Brilliant worked first  and every time.
5,TRÈS BIEN
5,Tamaño
1,Malgré le fait que mon PC soit théoriquement compatible miracast (validation sous DxDiag) Microsoft omet de signaler que son adaptateur est incompatible avec la marque de cartes graphiques la plus répandue du monde : Nvidia et donc les cartes graphiques GEFORCE.renvoi à amazon
5,Il migliore di tutti...affidabile efficiente non ti molla mai ..vedo anche film..gaming ..ci faccio tutto e si connette in un attimo
5,Great.Works easy and good.
5,Conferma che già sapevo e si eliminano avi e si ha la libertà per presentazioni ottimo prodottocomplimenti a mamma microsoft.
2,La connexion lague dés que vous voulez lire un film en HD... J'ai connecté une Surface 3 à une TV Pionner de 50'...
1,Firmware Update nicht möglichBricht nach wenigen Sekunden ab - SchrottAnsonsten funktioniert es so halbwegs - habe trotzdem immer wieder Abbrüche bei Anschluss an einen Beamer
1,Buono solo per visualizzare le slide di Powerpoint su un televisore se già si prova a riprodurre un filmato su youtube in modalità duplicazione dopo 2 minuti l'audio gracchia e il video va a scatti. E come sorgente del flusso video parliamo di un Microsoft Surface Pro 3 ad una distanza inferiore ad 1 metro dal televisore con l'Adattatore wireless installato.Veramente vi sconsiglo assolutamente l'acquisto se dovete farne un uso diverso dal proiettare immagini statiche come delle slide. E questa è la versione 2 non oso immaginare la 1!
5,Performs as described.
1,Il ne fonctionne pas sur mon PC Asus de 2012 sous Windows 10il ne détecte pasPar contre il fonctionne sur le PC de mon voisin mais au bout de 30 minutes l'image saccade même après redémarrage du PC de plus il chauffe beaucoup. Je veux bien un remboursement s'il vous plait !
5,A
5,funziona perfettamente con windows 10 e smart tv samsung
2,Funziona abbastanza bene ma Sky go e premiumplay non si possono in alcun modo vedere. Inoltre pensavo che la fluidità fosse migliore
5,This works really well
5,Fonctionne parfaitement et facilement.
1,L'ho preso per utilizzarlo con il mio LUMIA 950 purtroppo però l'app di Microsoft non funziona e risultava non connesso. Parlato con il servizio clienti Microsoft cercata una soluzione alla fine mi dicono di aspettare un aggiornamento dell' app. Aspetterò nel frattempo l'ho reso ed Amazon come sempre impeccabile nella consegna e gestione del reso.
1,Das Gerät ist nur gut wenn man seinen Fernseher als zweites Display verwenden möchte. Video Streaming ruckelt extrem und ist somit unbrauchbar. Schade!
1,J'ai un pc très récent qui s'est avéré non compatible. Windows 10 ne donne aucun détail sur ce qui le rend non compatible (la carte graphique la carte wifi le processeur?) c'est très mal fichu.J'ai aussi un tablette android compatible. Elle se connecte puis se déconnecte instantanément.Nullissime.
1,fonctionnement très aléatoire connexion difficile quel que soit l'appareilje l'ai retourné
5,Works exactly as expected.
5,ho testato con il mio Lumia 950 xl ok.Non funziona con tutti i pc anche se hai windows 10.... dipende dalla scheda grafica.Ciao
1,Un coup ça marche un coup ça marche pas Bref !!!!! une belle merde avec un PC PORTABLE.Par contre il fonctionne très bien avec une tablette.Au vu des commentaire en général sur le net il est déconseiller pour PC WIN 10. Merci MICROSOFT :(
5,au top
1,El emparejamiento es fácil y la calidad de imagen proyectada y sonido muy buenos pero hay un problema que me va a hacer devolverlo y es que se pierde la conexión a internet por lo cual solo sirve para proyectar información contenida en ficheros alojados en el propio ordenador. he intentado recabar información sobre si puede resolverse este punto en el foro de microsoft y en el distribuidor pero nadie me ha dado una respuesta.
5,brilliant
5,excelente devidamente embalado
5,Works as advertised
5,miracast da non confondere con standard chromecastmiracast segue perifiche pc con hardware wifi Intel sui pc o per alcuni telefoni che usano o dispongono della funzione monitor esterno o wireless
5,Good gadget - wide application
5,Works well.
1,adattatore assolutamente inutile. La qualità dell'immagine trasmessa è pessima rispetto a quella che si otterrebbe rispetto ad un comune cavo HDMI ( a parità di periferiche utilizzate nella connessione ovviamente ). anche i colori e la risoluzione calano fortemente di qualità. Ogni volta che volete collegare il vostro pc alla Tv-Monitor dovrete fare ripetuti tentativi. Provato con Windows 10.Inutile meglio avere tra le scatole il cavo HDMI
1,Projeter film du pc vers la télé image saccadée pour la hd et l'appareil surchauffe énormément
1,Ho provato a trasmettere filmati in standard definition il segnale video non è fluido si vedono evidenti perdite di frame anche con i dispositivi vicini. Di frequente si sconnette da solo e occasionalmente si è bloccato del tutto anche dopo aver aggiornato il firmware. Provato con diversi dispositivi sia in ricezione che in trasmissione ma il risiltato non cambiava. Dopo tutte le prove del caso l'ho dovuto rendere.
5,Ottimo in tutti i sensi! Funziona anche senza wifi. Un attimo a configurarlo accenderlo connetterlo alla TV e proiettare lo schermo del cellulare sul TV! Consigliatissimo!
1,....schrott...funktioniert nicht....
1,Matériel chinois estampillé Microsoft mais ne fonctionnant pas retour depuis 6 mois toujours pas remboursé
5,Excellent
1,Frechheit! Nur Ärger mit dem Stick. Funktion eine Katastrophe mit Surface 4. Unglaublich Microsoft eben! Ruckelt nur und hängt ständig egal bei welchem Gerät!
5,TOP QUALITY
1,Mon téléphone était compatible ma carte wifi également donc je me suis lancé.Mais malheureusement il faut également avoir un chipset graphique compatible également !J'avais un Intel HD Graphics 3000 et il faut au minimum du Intel HD Graphics 4000.
1,ne fonctionne pas avec mes téléphones Android récents ne fonctionne pas avec mon desktop (clé USB wifi utilisé) mais fonctionne avec un laptop Windows 10... franchement compatibilité très décevante.
1,équipé d'un samsung A5 2017 sous Android l'appairage avec la TV n'a jamais fonctionné bien que visible sur le portable.Je vais enclencher un retour.
5,Il cavo microsoft utilissimo per utilizzare un qualsiasi televisore come monitor per vedere film e quant'altro. Amazon veloce e puntuale come al solito.
1,Fonctionne très mal je ne l'utilise plus. Acheter un chromecast
5,Works perfectly.
5,adattatore perfetto però avviso bisogna scaricare un programma sull'apparecchio tipo tablet cui si vuole collegare per il resto tutto bene
5,very good
5,Cavetto molto utile per collegate la TV al PC. Lo consiglio a tutti. Bell' oggetto di massima utilità e  comodità.
5,Messo sulla tv samsung di casa....ottimo risultato per lavoro e intrattenimento....consiglio sicuramente.Ogni tanto soffre di qualche perdita di segnale ma tutto sopportabile.
1,Ça chauffe trop rapidement puis ça saccade.On obtient de bien meilleurs résultats avec un cordon relié au moniteur en direct.
1,Il ne voulait pas fonctionner sur windows 8 du coup j'ai mis à jour mon pc vers windows 10 et ça ne fonctionne toujours pas...et je me retrouve avec ce système d'exploitation tout pourri.Merci l'arnaque.
5,Incredibilmente efficiente! Peccato sia poco pubblicizzato da Microsoft perché funziona benissimo e da' un grande valore aggiunto.Lo consiglio sicuramente a tutti!
1,Difficile à installer et pas compatible avec tout
1,Ne fonctionne plus depuis la dernière mise a jour de Windows 10 (impossible de se connecter.)Le problème est connu mais actuellement sans solution.
1,Je ne suis parvenu à aucun résultat sur les appareils Android 5 et 6 sur lesquels j'ai essayé de faire fonctionner ce produit. Que du temps perdu et une grosse déception en ce qui me concerne.
1,Si el producto funciona funciona muy mala y después conectar  un equipo al Miracast adaptador no se realiza una conexión estable o la conexión irrumpe después unos segundos.
1,Fonctionne quand il a envie. Faut faire un reset assez souvent puis il re-fonctionne. Technologie pas au point testé avec plusieurs téléphones Samsung et un Motorola : ça marche par intermittence.Je l'ai renvoyé pour remboursement.
1,Surface pro 4 - wireless display v2même à 1 metre ma surface voit l'appareil pourtant j'ai toujours une erreur de connection :/
1,non funziona e io ho window 10 e 4 televisori Samsung non si connette col il mio pc hp 8g di ram
1,Sans intérêt quand on connaît chromecast qui est plus facile à installer et à utiliser. Je suis déçu de l'achat. Dommage
1,Según pone en la descripción del producto tendría que funcionar en Windows 8.1 pero no me funcionó tras haber intentado de todo.
4,Clé microsoft wireless miracastCette clé permet de déporter l'affichage du pc ou de la tablette sur une tv en connectant la clé sur un port hdmi de la tv.Ceci fonctionne parfaitement dès lors que le matériel est compatible miracast. C'est le cas des matériels récents. Pour moi cela fonctionne avec un smartphone nokia 635 et une tablette lenovo A8-50. En revanche rien à faire avec un pc asus de 2014. Les versions de windows supportées sont 8 et 10.L'image est nickel et le son également.J'ai testé avec youtube mycanal ou kodi avec des films tout est propre rien à dire.En résumé bon produit si on a du matériel compatible miracast.Une précision sur android j'ai du installer l'application wireless display finder et tout est ok.
5,Livré dans un joli packaging très sobre cet adaptateur se monte facilement sur une TV pour peu qu'elle possède une prise HDMI de disponible et une prise USB pas trop loin pour l'alimenter. En effet contrairement à son homologue chez Google/Android cet adaptateur ne dispose pas d'une alimentation pouvant se brancher au secteur.Branché facilement sur une TV Sony l'image est splendide.Ma tablette sous Windows 10 trouve rapidement l'adaptateur miracast et me propose de me connecter dessus. La dupplication d'écran est très rapide mais elle a quand même un léger temps de latence. Mois efficace que son homologue AirPlay sur iOS avec une AppleTV.Il faut installer sur Windows l'application Affichage sans fil si on veut pouvoir modifier les paramètres de l'adaptateur et mettre à jour le firmware.Par défaut la langue choisie est l'anglais il y a également la possibilité de repositionner les bords de l'écran si ils étaient coupés je n'ai pas ce problème. On peut également ajouter un code de sécurité mais pour la maison ca ne fait pas trop de sens au pire les voisins diffuseront sur ma TV des trucs rigolos ... Ça peut même être drôle :)Le firmware micros-programme installé est à jour et ne nécessite donc pas un upgrade.On peut également modifier son nom intéressant si on possède plusieurs écrans et miracast.Facile à poser simple à configurer détection automatique c'est du tout bon !
4,Cette clé se connecte sur la prise hdmi de la télévision et sur la prise USB de la télévision. En effet c’est via la prise usb que l’adaptateur s’alimente (il n’y a pas de transformateur fourni).L’adaptateur en lui même est très compact et il ne possède qu’un bouton à l’arrière pour faire un reset de lui même.Pour se connecter via Windows 10 il suffit de se rendre sur notification (en bas à droite sur la barre des tâches) puis de cliquer sur connecter.Personnellement j’ai du entrer un code (celui ci s’affiche sur la TV et il faut le taper sur le PC).L’image est correcte (cela dépend de votre TV) mais il y a un léger décalage entre l’image et les actions que l’on effectue.Après usage j’ai trouvé que l’adaptateur était légèrement chaud. Cet adaptateur est pratique mais un peu déroutant lors de la première utilisation surtout pour les personnes qui ne s'y connaissent pas trop en informatique.
4,Je l'utilise pour diffuser les images et les vidéos de mon PC portable (windows 8.1) sur ma TV.Installation immédiate sans difficulté.J'utilise VLC et tout fonctionne très bien.
5,Works perfectly! Very easy to use... worth it.
5,does what it's supposed to do
2,Al parecer hay varios modelos de este aparato este es el 03 y hay otro que es el 014 no se la diferencia pero se que este es peor le cuesta más conectar y se ve peor voy a proceder a devolverlo y buscar el otro modelo
5,Clée pour caster supportant la technologie miracast. Pour avoir testé un certain nombre de solution niveau pro il n'y a pas mieux que cette clée : Débit élevé son image et l'on peut caster en natif depuis tout pc équipé de windows 10.Rien à installer...bref la super solution nous en avons mis 4 au bureaux en complément de 2 apple Tv.Si vous voulez un support stable  n'hésitez pas. Bien mieux qu'une chromecast pour un usage pro de partage d'écran en réunion.
5,Tablet und Handy lassen sich unkompliziert auf Beamer und Fernseher duplizieren.
5,Super einfaches Teil aber zum guten Preis und mit sehr guter Qualität. Super einfache Handhabung.
