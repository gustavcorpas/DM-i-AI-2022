5,This to connects my Royole Moon to my laptop and it works great. Plug and play! Picture is beautiful and crisp. Runs full 60hz as said I and completely satisfied l!!!!!!!
5,I plug this into my macbook and Sony A6600 while I live stream and its never let me down. Great quality.
5,HDMI adapter for Raspberry Pi 4 went bad causing erratic video output. This replacement cable restored video stability and the fabric covering should help it's long term reliability.
5,works great.
5,I needed a longer cable and found theseIt works for my GoPro and my action cams!I would strongly suggest if you want to do multi vie on your live streams!
3,This cable seems very well built but when I hooked it up to my Sony a6000 micro-HDMI port the signal kept getting disconnected if the cable's micro-HDMI connector was moved or touched at all.  Since I don't have this problem at all with any of my other micro-HDMI cables I have to assume that a problem exists either with this cable or some combination of port size cable tolerance mismatching between this cable and my camera.  In either case I had to return it.
5,Sirver para su fusion semira el marial resitible
5,Bought this for my game consoles to connect to my Samsung Freestyle projector after a couple adapters chapped out on me.  You get excellent video quality like Bluray or 4K really can't tell difference but it's great all the same.  Definitely recommend it.
5,Works well with no issues currently.
5,It took 3 returns for me to find a compatible cable to connect my prehistoric HP monitor with my strangely incompatible ASUS VivoBook Flip 14. Works perfectly! Too bad my remote workspace didn't allow a second monitor. All that drama and couldn't use it for my last work project. Still happy to have a second monitor.
5,This is a nice quality cable and a good way to deal with what is one of the worst digital video connectors (Micro HDMI) in use. Micro HDMI connectors are too mechanically weak and fragile to deal with the weight of multi-conductor cables suitable for HDMI signal transmission.  Unlike Micro HDMI to HDMI female pigtail adapters this doesn't add the weight of a male/female full-size connectors to the cable so it's better but it's still a good idea to make sure that you provide appropriate strain relief to avoid damage.
5,Woks as designed can't yet attest to durability other than to say... It feels decent.
5,I like the material and build.  It's like a goose neck lamp you can bend it and it will stay in place.  No issues pleased with it..
5,I bought this for our camping trips.  So far so good.  You will not be disappointed ðŸ¤ 
5,Awesome works great fit and price.
5,it works
5,Product is very good.  The price was reasonable and it is very durable.Would recommend this product for anyone needing a micro hdmi cable.
5,This cable work fine and seems to be very well made
2,First one broke in a day or two. I bought a second one but next time Iâ€™ll look into other brands for durability. I used it to connect my ps5 to my projector. The hdmi end broke off tho so yeah.
5,It works and looks like a solid cable.
5,Purchased for Raspberry Pi because old cable broke. No issues with the new cable.
5,I like it
4,Perfect for my Leica Q
4,Didn't produce the expected outcome though.  Maybe the fault of the camera
5,Needed this in a pinch for my laptop screen to connect to a tv. Works great fits in the ports great no issues.
3,When I first plug it in the screen takes a long time to register that it is plugged into the computer. Didn't have this issue with my previous wire set up. Once the screen finally gets the signal it shows the screen in a strange cascading effect for up to 20-30 seconds before it looks normal. Once it is normal everything is fine but if I walk away and the screen goes to sleep I have to repeat the process again.
5,Es una compra excelente tal ves algo rÃ­gido para sientas cosas pero se siente bien
5,I needed a cord for my GoPro to connect to my iMac this cord does the job.
5,After buying a cheaper cable and having nothing but static lines on my monitor after a few weeks of use.  I went for a higher quality cable (this one).  So far this cable is operating as expected no static lines no problems of any kind.
5,This cable was really manufactured to last longer seems to me a heavy duty one the quality of the picture and sound from my laptop to my UHD TV is remarkable
5,I bought this for a Raspberry Pi 4.  My monitor is only 1080P not 4K but on first boot the Pi set the resolution correctly and the image quality is great.  The cable seems well made and is flexible enough to route around the desk.
5,Used it to output 4K via HDMI into a KeeQii 4K capture card for the Sony ZV-1 to use as a webcam. Worked as I had hoped and I was getting 4K quality out to OBS.I cannot speak to the durability yet but at the moment it's holding up just fine for at least 30 minutes of continuous output.
4,Cable itself seems durable and well built but connecting GoPro to the large 4K tv was very disappointing. I decided to stick with the SD card transfer to my laptop instead.
5,These cables feel like you could tow a car with them. They perform very well at 4K resolution too. I have several of them and I am slowly replacing my old cheap HDMI cables with these. I doubt they will ever get replaced until some new tech makes them obsolete.
5,I purchased this HDMI cable to connect my GoPro to my computer for some video capture. Works great for that task.In terms of thickness itâ€™s right on the edge of being too thick without being too thick. Itâ€™s bendable and can be directed but itâ€™s also firm enough where it doesnâ€™t just dangle onto the desk. It strikes that balance perfectly for my preferences.
5,Using for a Retropie setup.  Works as expected and the jacket doesn't interfere with plugging in.
5,The cable material appears quite rugged and should be durable. Worth the extra few bucks.
5,This cable is heavy duty and seems like it should last.  I am only using it for 1080p because my camera eventually overheats on 4k... but that's no fault of the cable.
5,I donâ€™t know durability.
5,I use this for my Sling Studio setup and it works great
5,Works like an HDMI cable. I bought this for use with my raspberry pi and it works great. I didn't test wether it works with 4k however so I can't attest to that.
4,Anything marked with "Honestech" means you don't get the driver you need to download online
5,We use this cable to patch out of a GoPro camera to send to hdmi to SDI converter then to our switcher.  Works perfectly.
4,Stays in place (previous one didn't and lost connection if the laptop was shaken a tiny bit).
5,The product appears very durable and the packaging is nice. As described! It was available at my local Amazon warehouse and delivered the very same day I ordered.
4,Kind of cheaply made and started to fray.  The casing of the input was also loose and coming apart a bit.
5,Connected perfectly to my monitor and really makes the picture look good I expected a cheap thin cable but what I got was a nice thick braided cable for everyday use and havent had any issues yet !
5,Great product fast delivery
5,Using it to connect an rpi4 to a TV it works great.
5,This seems to be a pretty good cable. Itâ€™s is a little stiff but hoping that will give over time. But works well and got a clear signal so all is good.
5,This item works fine just plug it and use it. I like the built material.
5,I use it to connect an Apple MacBook Pro (USB C) to a Blackmagic ATEM Mini (HDMI). The picture came up right away and looked perfect.
5,Love this works on my Mac book pro 2019 and Iâ€™m able to connect my Sony dsc hx80 to my laptop an monitor
5,Looks and feels like it will last a long time.  Feels like a quality piece of gear.
5,This cable works as described
5,Love these they get tons of use and havenâ€™t had any issues
5,Great quality durable cable used to play my go-pro movies to our TV. Works great!
5,Itâ€™s a nice long and tough cord. No complaints.
5,This product works great and I recommend anyone who.needs a micro hdmi to.hdmi to buy this product. Very sturdy and tips have plastic covers for protection A+++
5,Thanks
5,Itâ€™s a cable. It works like itâ€™s supposed to. :)
5,Nice heavy construction with Velcro cable tie included.
5,No issues
5,Lenovo Yoga laptop to 4K flat screen flawless transmission. Well made.
5,I ordered this to connect my video camera to a monitor and its perfect.
5,It seems like a great cord. Unfortunately it isn't what I thought it was so I need to exchange it for correct item.
5,Very thick enough to resit the use. This products work as great.
5,Works great for my 2560x1440 monitor. seems well made. Cable is flexible.  feels high quality and the color is nice.
5,un cable perfecto para monitorear desde la cÃ¡mara es perfecto y buena construcciÃ³n
5,El cable se siente duradero es flexible pero duro y una longitud buena.
5,Well made.  It should last a long time.
2,The cable is great & along with the quality. However if you're planning on using this for your video setup using a cage w/ an HDMI clamp the micro side of the cable to thick to fit through the cage so unfortunately for me I can't use this cable.
5,Works great for connecting the GoPro Hero 5 Black to a tv for veiwing media or as a monitor.
5,Oh man! Itâ€™s a cord!
5,Works flawlessly and feels high quality. Great buy!
5,I bought it to watch on tv the videos of my GoPro 8 and it works perfectly.
1,My wife used this at home for making videos. It never left our house it wasnâ€™t pulled ran over etc. but it only lasted a few months before it stopped working completely. WOULD NOT buy again.
5,No issues works Great!!
5,i can't say anything about durability yet but it looks strong
5,quality product
5,Its ok for now
5,Is nice product
5,It was a great cable it just was the wrong size for my camera!
5,Great product and very fast delivery
2,The cable overall is solid and durable. However when I was looking for a cable for my Nikon camera the housing of the cable was too bulky and would hit the side where cables and other devices would plugin on my camera. Unfortunately if you are shopping for a cable for Nikon I would not choose this one. You will not be able to connect it.
5,Bueno
5,Product seems to be high quality and performs well
5,Using for camera hookup. Works great. Very durable construction.
5,Love it and works great
1,I got it and did not work.
5,Works exactly as advertised
1,Didn't take long for the D connector to break off in my GoPro.  This cable is cheap and not durable. I guess you get what you pay for.
2,cable worked for a month and then died. Not worth it.
1,The first cord arrived already broken. I exchanged it for another one which broke within a month. If the wind blows too hard this cord will kick the bucket. 100% failure rate don't buy it don't waste your time.
1,Would not buy.  It broke while pulling out of my camera. I didnâ€™t yank or use excessive force to remove it it just bent and I cannot use it anymore. Definitely not durable whatsoever.
1,If I accidentally bump the cable then the video stops working.It happens on both ends of the cable.
1,bought this to connect my laptop to my monitor and it does not work
1,the cable did not fit the laptop computer so sent it back for a refund. It wasn't the fault of the manufacturer that it didn't fit.
1,these cables are not durable broke and left a piece on  my camera hdmi port
3,I never had issues with this until yesterday a year after purchase it snapped and the HDMI portion was stuck inside my laptop. Decent cable but not built to last
1,Stopped working after a couple of uses. The micro end got loose wiggles around and loses connection.
1,will not buy again
1,Came broken out of box
5,Using this cable with 3D video goggles (Avegant Glyph) and it's been working great. The connectors are sturdy and have aged well.
4,This thing is an absolute UNIT! I got this for my Raspberry Pi4 and not only does it work perfectly but the material is super tough! This is probably the thickest braided cable I own now and I expect it to last forever because of that. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the full size end of the cable can be a bit large for TVs or monitors with tight HDMI ports close together but other than that this thing is great and for the price I would highly recommend.
4,This is a perfect accessory for the Raspberry Pi 4 and is well priced.  I deducted one star because others have reported durability problems I hope that it is a good long-term purchase for me.  It seems to be a great value.
5,I'm not sure what use case the manufacturer had in mind for this cable but anything short of apocalyptic will be just fine.This cable is very heavy duty and over-engineered for its practical applications and that's great.The braiding on the cable is strong and durable. The cable itself is heavy and stiff but not so much as to be an issue.The connector housing on the MicroHDMI side is a good size and allows me to also charge my action camera (the ports are right next to each other and a lot of Micro cables I've tried block the charging port) while it's connected to HDMI.
5,This cable is like Rambo. It works even when bent. My monitor fell and it bent the small end of this cable that is connected to the camera. You can see the bend and can bend it back and forth. The cable still works like there is nothing wrong with it. Amazing quality! I use this to connect my Panasonic G7 to an Atomos Assassin for external recording. Even with it bent there is no drop frames or disconnection at all.
5,It has very durable quality because I use a gopro and I unplug it and replug it every single day to stream and it works amazing!!! It is very fast and can handle all my needs!
5,These Oldboytech Micro HDMI to HDMI Cable works great on for my DSLR.They look good and works with issues.The cables seem well made and durable.No flickering issues like I've had with some other cables.These cables look good feels durable  and does what it's supposed to do with no issues as it should.
5,It works what more do you need? There's not much one could say in reviewing a computer cable other than it works well and as intended.It shipped quickly and in a well-padded envelope.It worked well with no issues and the cable is a good quality with plated connectors. I would expect this cable to last a long time given it's outward appearance of quality.Definitely recommendable!
5,I use the 4K Micro HDMI to HDMI Cable Adapter for connecting my Nikon camera to an external video monitor. Works well so far. The cable is made of good quality braided materials with an included cable tie for securing the cable. Picture quality is nice and sharp.
5,I am using this to connect a Raspberry Pi 4 running Retro Pie to my TCL 4k tv and it works great.  It is a little bit cleaner of a setup than using a micro HDMI to HDMI adapter.  I like the braided shielding and it seems very sturdy.
5,I have a PC with a capture card that requires micro HDMI in and out so this cable does the job perfectly for my 4k captures.  So far I've seen no issues with picture quality so I am satisfied!  The cable itself feels well made and durable as well.
5,Got this for a Canon M50 to go through a capture card so I can record video direct to a laptop. Cable works great and feels great. Feels like it will hold up awhile but time will tell. For now definitely recommend!
5,I USE WITH SONY NEX7 TO COMPUTER MONITOR
2,This cable worked just fine for about 3 weeks; I used it to connect my laptop to an external monitor. Now however it has stopped working and my laptop can no longer detect an HDMI device connected by this cable. I only used this for a 1080p display so I can't speak to its 4k performance but while it worked picture quality was perfect.
5,I connected the lap top to a monitor .
5,Works good!
5,Great!
5,Works fine micro HDMI to HDMI cable adapter
5,excellent
5,It seems to be a good cable
3,Does not work with GoPro Hero 3
5,Works great
5,Good quality cable that allows me to view photos and 4K videos directly from my Canon R6 camera to my OLED tv. It just works. Not sure how durable the mini-HDMI port is on the Canon but the cable looks fairly durable (time will tell).
5,I ordered it for my android phone but it didnâ€™t fit at all. Seems to be for cameras and other devices.
5,I started video streaming with my Sony ZV-1 and it works perfectly! The size of the endpoint is pretty small so I can connect the USB to charge it at the same time. full HD and 4k video support Long and durable its been a couple days and it have worked perfectly.
4,I use this to connect Sony camcorder to the laptop- to use the camcorder as webcam.
5,I bought this cable so I can connect my external monitor (Andycine) to my Sony a6400 camera and it worked well.Highly recommend.
5,Got this for the Pi4 - did the job - can't say much more than that. :)
5,This is a very nice high-quality cable and it works great. I especially like the aluminum shell covering the ends. The cable itself is fairly stiff and has a slight memory. You can bend it into the general shape you want but also straighten it out with little effort. I'm very happy with the cable and will consider this brand for my future cabling needs.
5,Great for connecting your camera to your computer or tv  well made
5,The hardware was just what I needed and it was delivered in a relatively decent amount of time given the fact that we have been experiencing supply-chain issues.
5,No problem plugging the cable into my Raspberry Pi 4.
1,It did not work with my Lenovo laptop.
5,Excellent addition the Raspberry Pi 4. Truly supports 4k 60hz in our living room. Much nicer than using an adapter.
5,Cable works great is very good quality comes with Velcro strap and an anti-static storage bag. :-)
5,Use these as part of my studio set up to connect several cameras.  They work great good solid connections no impact to video.
5,**Great Buy** **Great price** Packaged very well.. Works great. I have had this for a month now and NO PROBLEMS. I love it.. Just what I needed. Thank you.
5,I liked the durability and quality in this cable. It made the whole experience great and easy!

5,Cable quality is amazing and worked for what I needed.
5,for the price it actually works and is quite durable. would recommend to a friend.... if I had any... I'll just tell my mom about it
4,I can see now
5,My old cord had a short. Provides excellent picture and sound quality.
5,Works good with a lenovo laptop running ubuntu. Recommend this cable. Build quality is good.
5,It's nice looking and good in length nicely packaged
5,It's a cable and it works well.  Tough to write a review with a lot of detail but this little cable does what it is supposed to do with a good picture.  It seems like it will last a while.  Good purchase.
5,Had it for a couple months now works perfectly with my Elgato cam link 4K and my Canon m200 no problems what so ever no frame drops
5,Nice looking and feels solid and well made (hopefully)!
