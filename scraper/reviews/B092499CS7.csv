5,I bought this phone for using at the old brick farmhouse I was moving into. I am really impressed with the sound and the range. Much better than using my cell phone and trying not to loose my signal! I am using this with an additional handset and a Magic Jack. Finally I can walk around in the house and not worry my call will be dropped.
5,My decision to purchase this phone was off the Q&A and it was confirmed it was a VTECH manufacture.  I've been using the more creative option/colors provided by VTECH on their phones for a couple of decades.  I did a VTECH search on amazon only to find less attractive options than this AT&T model!  The phone set becomes a part of your decor and should be pleasant to view as well as functional IMO.The phone has all sorts of built-in features like robo call blocking - and it works.  I see the call list and every day it shows numbers that tried to reach me and the phone didn't ring.Of course you program your own settings but it's basic.  In fact I never had to read the instructions.I have the rose gold & ivory version and it's beautiful.  For those wanting more masculine or deeper tone obviously there is the wood grain and black version.I had no trouble with the set-up and I have the main set in one room and the other phone at the other end of the house so I'm much less likely to miss calls.The volume and the speaker settings are also great.  I wish they had a greater number of ring options as I didn't care for any of the alternatives so I settled for the default standard ring.
4,I like the look and that it's pink but the answering feature is difficult will ask several question to the caller and I can't seem to take it off and my return window is closed.
4,I love the design I like the phone wish the speaker phone was more clear and louder. You'd thing with all the advances we've made in last 10 years with tiny speakers we could get one in a phone that works perfect nupe still not there yet lol....it' still a good phone and worth the money. I like the "block caller" button"!
5,The AT&T phones work just fine. We like the 5-set configuration and the signal strength is good over each handset.The best feature is the Call Blocker. Where we used to get 5 to 10 or more spam calls a day we no longer get spam calls. And it was easy to program who could call and who to add to the block list.
5,i love this phone.  love the smart call block.
5,Rose gold
5,Number buttons aren't all workingnow.
4,I cannot dial out on this phone.  I can receive calls and they get screened okay.  Those calls that I accept I can converse with the phoning party.  However when I dial a number it doesn't go out.  I get a busy tone.  I'm not certain if this is the purpose of this phone.  Has anyone experienced this type of issue?Update -- AT&T support got back to me quickly and suggested that I check the DIAL MODE setting.  It should be TOUCH-TONE and not PULSE.  If the phone sounds like an old rotary phone dialing then check that.
5,Brought it for a gift and she loves it!
5,We purchased this for my mother-in-law!  Not only does it look good but it works perfectly.  Numbers are large enough for her to see everything!
4,The phone is fine but I'm 85 haired-over stove in smelling musty and I've got The Thumps. If the piccolo player in the Third Movement of Tchaikovsky's 4th is takin' care of bidness I have to accept it on faith. But that's just me.The phone/answering machine has lotsa neat features with a huge capacity for Blocked Calls for when the guy from Calcutta wants to give me a refund on a purchase that I never made.My problem is this: I wanted a wireless headset but the recommendation from Amazon a TL8900 won't register. Subsequently I spent a percentage of my life jousting with AT&T Customer Support an oxymoron right up there with Military Intelligence and Jumbo Shrimp. Neither the manufacturer or websites could recommend a product that was on AT&T's Compatibility List for the CL82267.Bottom Line: The phone is a good buy and the problem with insufficient volume is mine 'cause I spent 40 years hanging around jet engines. That there's no compatible wireless headset however is inexcusable. So if you call me you'll have to speak up.
5,all good
5,The sound is good but volume is not at all good like they said it was in the listing. Volume is pitiful. Speaker volume is just as bad.
5,Easy to use and works well
5,Was getting at least 50 telemarketer calls a day. With this phone we don’t get hardly anything
4,Does not seem to have handset locator I need that in my house
5,It was just as described. but i didn’t pay good attention to the description so my bad
4,Smart Call Blocking has been great!  Here is the thing I wondered about but now I know the answer - if you have other phones besides the AT&T phones they do ring once because the AT&T first ring is to start the screening process I set up to ask them to state the name and press #.  That doesn't bother me because the other phones are either set to ringer off or very low ringer except for the basement phone which I don't hear unless I am in the basement.  Most of the calls are for senior medicare plans and I don't understand why since Medicare plans are only selected once a year.Call quality is good though I have noticed some small issues that were not there with the VTech phones (same manufacturer by the way).Blocked calls do show up on the recent calls list which is nice so I can review to make sure they aren't someone I want to hear from that I hadn't added to the allow list.  The only thing is that it shows the name and not the number only that it was blocked call - maybe there is a way to add the number information - but I do have other caller id info on other phones to check and this has not been a problem.Setting up the phone was fairly easy to do.  I have not looked at the online manual yet only the manual that came with the phone - that manual is sufficient to get things up and running.Before I purchased I read reviews and one mentioned how bright the charge lights are - I think they are a bit too bright also.  A setting for brightness for these lights would be a nice to have feature in the future such as night mode.The answering machine works fine though I need to do some more reading on how to delete a message after playing without deleting all messages.  Not really a problem as I don't save messages anyway at this time but I miss the options using my phone company voicemail which I may go back to using upon further investigation.  I used a cell phone that I haven't put in the allow list and will check to see how the blocking works (If you don't use the screening process with name and # the phone hangs up - say your name and press # and the phone rings and gives the option to answer or send to answering machine or if you don't go through those options the call goes to the answering machine).As others have stated these phones are really worth not receiving robocalls and scam calls and unwanted telemarketing calls all day long.
5,Very happy with the phone the sound was on point with my expectations. Very happy how the phone looks on my desk.
5,Old set was wearing out and this one has an extra phone and blocker!
4,We needed a lot of phones and I tried using 2 other sets but they didn't work together. This one was no more expensive and is working really well. The sound quality is great and the features are really comprehensive.I took away 1 star because of set-up and instructions. If you buy it know that you need to put each extension handset on the home base to activate it. Finding that tidbit is not easy in the instructions - which sent me online to the 97 page (!!!)  complete instruction booklet.  Also know that erasing a letter is not as intuitive as you may think it is and finding that out is another adventure. On the upside it makes you read a whole lot of the 97 page tome so you know that the phone can do a lot you may never want. lol.Once you get through the set up and have your most common numbers entered it's easy. The call screening is fabulous and it's easy to put someone into the directory once they've gone through it so you don't have to enter everyone right away.
4,Needed to upgrade our system. Love the extra handsets in this bundle. Large numbers that lights up orange. Negative: phone is slick (plastic housing) I have dropped several times. Display is very dim the information needs to be brighter for easy read. When you pick up the handset off the charger the number/talk/end does not lite up like our Panasonic we had. The different tunes could use a update. Other than that it’s a good phone.
4,Replaced an older Vtech cordless phone set (2 handsets)  with the ATT CL82257 (2 handset system)  and an ATT CL80107 accessory handset.Below are our initial impressions.Instructions. Found the instructions to be a bit much.  Starting off with the default settings for now.Base Buttons.  Have a soft feel to them.  They don’t feel as substantial as the harder buttons on our old Vtech base.  It may just take some getting used to…Sound Quality.  It’s okaaaaaay from listening to our recorded greeting and listening to other people on the phone but I really was expecting it to be more clear/crisp.  People that we  talked to  said our voices are coming through loud and clear though.Accessory Handset.  Was very easy to register the handset to go with the set we bought (Note - if you purchase an accessory handset you have to put the handset on the BASE not the handset charger in order for it to register/sync).We haven’t had any “Spam Likely” or Telemarketers call yet for us to try out the Call Block button… Can’t believe we are actually looking forward to one of those annoying calls to try it out.  (the situation is sort of like the dog who waits on the postal delivery person to insert the mail through the front door mail slot  so he can go at it….  ** LOL** ) We are excited that there is a 1000 name and number call block directory if we need it.  Note - The reason we are not taking advantage of the Smart Call Block configurations  is because we do get automated calls from places and we are not certain if they always come from the same number or same outbound phone trunk…  Once we learn more we may go with a different configuration.
4,Overall this phone is good. However. the battery cover slides off too easy. It will pop off while using or when simply picking it up.
4,Not happy about adjustment of sound.  For me incoming calls are not loud enough when talking.  But the call blocking feature is fantastic.  I receive no spam calls.  The system reviews the call before its processed.  I have only received calls on my contact list.  This is great even though I have call blocking setup with the state.  Something changed because I was averaging 6 -9 unwanted calls a week if not more.  Now I don't receive any.  This is the best system for blocking unwanted calls.  Style I also like.
5,Bought to replace grandmas phones in her house. She only uses landline and lives alone with dementia memory loss so we need a reliable phone. V tech worked well and had nice big buttons but they were getting old and acting weird. Bought this one and have a total of 3 handsets. Big buttons and the call block and big screen are major plus. Announcing calls is great too. It clearly says the name of who is calling which is great because I don’t think she reads the caller ID and spammers call a lot. No issues with connections or sound or anything so far. If used within the specs I think these will work best if you’re situation is similar or even I you are just younger looking for a landline.
5,I use NomoRobo DoNotCall.gov (useless) and any tool that will help avoid the constant calls.  This was the most effective and works well with NomoRobo for your landline.  The options for customers looking to buy a system like this are limited and only Panasonic or ATT seem interested in developing these products.PROS:Call screening feature has eliminated all of the robocallers.  The only ones that make it past screening are human callers willing to go through the brief screening process (Press 1 and say your name).CONS:Older users may not appreciate the call screen functions but you can add them to your phone directory to bypass any screening processVolume controls could be better - not for those with hearing challenges
4,I replaced an older Vtech cordless phone. As with most people I started getting tired of getting robocalls and telemarketers and would get 8-10 calls per day. I saw this one and decided to buy it based on the good reviews. I'm not disappointed with the purchase. I bought the rose gold/white color because I liked the color combo and was a nice change from the usual black/silver color we always had. However the biggest feature that I liked most was that it had a 1000 number call block capacity. This was way higher than the normal 150 to 250 number capacity the other phones had. I've had this phone for 2 months now and have already entered 156 calls on the blocked list. I know it will go much higher in the coming months. The menus on this phone also seem to be a little quicker than on the Vtech. I have taken the phone outside in the back yard and have had no problem with the transmission. Some people have mentioned the stability of the handsets on the base falling over and not very secure. I have not found this to be much of an issue. The home base has a small support area that sticks up behind the handset that keeps the handset fairly secure. The remote base doesn't have this feature so the handset sits a little less secure but as I mentioned it has never fallen off the base. I suppose if the base is bumped a little it will fall out. The reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the voice synthesizer. You would think after all these years phone manufacturers could program a much clearer voice into the phones. Also I have the voice call identifier feature on so I can hear who is calling me without having to get up and look at the screen. The problem with this feature is that words are not always pronounced correctly. It pronounces words as they are spelled not as they should be pronounced. This can leave you scratching your head and you end up having to look at the screen anyway. Some words are abbreviated or shortened due to lack of screen space and the pronunciation it gives can be humorous but also no help. The overall sound volume is not quite as high as it was on the Vtech but is acceptable. Hopefully this review will help you make an informed decision and in my opinion this phone overall is very nice and is a keeper.
4,Does the job
4,I still have not programmed all the ways to block calls. After several attempts I decided to  ot use any of the blocking alternatives but voice mail is not recorded on the handsets and there is no indication that a voice mail message has been left. This may be my programming. This is the third time I have tried to install a phone in our new apartment They are all either too complication or they don't work but I do not want to start the process again so we're keeping.
4,Attractive phone easy set up. Clear instructions. Many features
5,I was very hesitant to buy these for several reasons: 1. I was trying to stick to under $90 and 2. I had purchased At&T phones (assuming they would be the best) many years ago and was rather disappointed. Features I love!1. LOCATOR: And as a bonus when you use locator you can turn off the phones you do find. With my last set it didn’t have this option so I would put it out side not good if I already left one outside and of course the main base always rang so if the other phone was anywhere near it like stuffed in the sofa we couldn’t hear it.2. Call BLOCK! Main reason I purchased this unit. While a little confusing to set up I love that you can add a call to the block directory while on the call.3. Intercom: We use this often to page the kid or while hubby is in the basement and I need to figure out which electrical breaker I should shut off.4. Lighted key pad: My house is a bit dark so this is a bonus.5. Choose ring tone: Love this they have several different sounds you can choose from. I found one that sounds very much like a video game we played in the 80’s. Just makes life more fun.6. Large viewing screen: found the screen much larger and easier to read than most.7. Clarity: There is no more break up on the line when I go to rooms further from the base a major bonus!I have only had them a short time but everything is super to access on the key pad compared to many other phones. There is even a ‘talk’ button on the side that I think goes to intercom haven’t gotten that far in the manual yet.Only two cons: phone by itself doesn’t stand up well on a table or counter bit off balance. The charging bases are super light and tend to fall off table if not placed correctly. I have one sitting on the windowsill and had to tape it down because of kitty’s tail even swipes it the unit falls. But to me these issues are totally irrelevant for what an awesome phone system this is!  PS I never use the answering machines that come with these.
3,When people on the other end say "Hey are you on speaker phone by any chance" that is when you know yo bought a cheap phone. Those days should be behind us but AT&T products are just fine but they are not AHEAD OF THE TIMES or AMAZING/OUTSTANDING by any means. Please purchase yourself and see what I am referring to. Again it sounds fine for me but when 3 people ask you if I am away from my phone that is not a good sign.
4,I love the color the reason I picked this phone It is a good buy with great features.
4,Sound quality is fair but not great. You must have a caller ID feature from your phone service for the caller announce feat to work. This was not clear in the advertised features.
5,This phone system is beautiful. It works great. Each handset comes with a rechargeable battery and a charging cradle that plugs into an outlet. You only need one phone jack for the base phone which is much easier than needing a jack for each handset too.I can't say enough about how awesome the Call Block feature is. Even if you miss pressing the button while the call is coming in you can still block the numbers from the phone menu.I have not changed the equaliser sound profile because it sounds great right out of the box for me. I turned the volume all the way up which is what I do with every phone and the other caller is loud and clear. My voice must sound okay to callers because my mother has stopped saying "Hello? Lisa? I can't hear you. Are you there?" which is why I bought a new phone in the first place. Lol.My mother bought the same system in black because now that she is working from home due to covid her meetings are over the phone. Her voice sounds great when we talk. The batteries must be long lasting because her meetings can last for hours and she hasn't complained about running out of battery power. That is why she bought a new phone - her old system couldn't last long enough even with new batteries put in and switching out handsets during the meetings.The displays are big and bright. Hanging the base does not seem like an attractive option. It would hang the same way it sits on the counter so it would be sticking out from the wall instead of flush against it. That is absolutely not a deal breaker. You are never going to find a phone system that has 100% of the features you want. The primary concern should always be how well it works.
4,Is somewhat difficult to get to screen I want and set up of ring time is hard to change.
4,This phone set is easy to install and easy to use. The sound quality isn't as sharp as we were led to believe however we manage fine. Not crazy about the color but the price was right and our choices for a phone set of 5 were limited.
5,Love this set.  Now I have phones in every area that I need them so I won't rush to answer ever again.  Rose gold is so pretty and the numbers are nice and big.  And it does so much.  Love it!
4,We needed several phones as we have a few levels to my home. The sound is clear the ring is fine I wish these phones had some weight to them.  The base goes flying too often when I pick up the receiver so I took some weak tape and taped the base down w/ it. It's fine now.  I wish the speaker on the phone was a lot louder. You can't always hold a phone so when you lay it down & put it on speaker it's not that powerful it's just ok.  They're beautiful to look at the price isn't bad but all in all they could stand some improvements.
5,We really like the phone.  It's big enough to see everything clearly.  Sound is good and it talks.  Had to return a VTech because it didn't speak.  I have had many of their phones and was generally satisfied but they didn't make it clear that the phone didn't say who was calling then they made me pay to return it...$21.00!  Never again.  This phone is great.  Does what I want and look really good.  The only thing I am not thrilled with is the blocking feature.  You must block as the phone rings and not after.  So if you get a crank call you cannot block it after the machine picks up.
5,My old Panasonic set finally gave up the ghost. This order was filled within the day of the order. Somehow I got the order in just before close-out (approx 3PM) and it was pulled shipped and delivered by 8PM that night. I had expected one day delivery not same day delivery but this was just fine with me. Good job Amazon warehouse crew and delivery driver! It works like a dream and the battery life is at least triple the battery life of the old system I had.
5,I was barraged daily with robo calls & telemarketers.  My phone was literally ringing all day long & it was driving me crazy. Since my old phone didn’t have a ringer off feature I ended up hiding the phone so I wouldn’t hear it.  That’s when I knew I needed a new phone with a call blocker feature. After reading the reviews on several models I choose this AT&T model.  It was incredibly easy to set up. I choose the option that blocked any number that wasn’t in my directory. Took some time to set up the directory but it was well worth it. Peace at last! This phone is attractive and a great price. I really like AT&T phones. This phone has great sound quality. I’m not using the answering machine feature because I have AT&T voice mail.
4,We had older Panasonic handsets which worked fine but finally gave up. The att handsets are a welcome change. With that said it is difficult to remember all inputs and commands these phones have. Got them for the call block feature but found we don't have caller ID And that is about $12.00 extra if we wanted to add that. Ugh no..the bill is already to high. All in all the ergonomics of these handsets could improve a bit. The call volume is just a tad to low but ok
5,Makes and receives great calls ringer does turn off call screening excellent call blocking on the phone itself along with many other features that are great on a home phone.
5,My neighbor who is being treated for Liver Cancer was in need of a new phone.  I have had a number of AT&T phones and was confident in purchasing this phone for her present. She loves it.
4,I needed a call-blocking phone that allowed more than the paltry 50-call limit of most phones. this one as you've read blocks 1000! You need to read the instructions well in order to understand how to set it up but once you do it becomes a joy to get unwanted calls as the phone deals with them instead of you.the sound quality is good and it seems sturdy and durable.my only complaint is they have the usual paltry small directory capacity--only 25 numbers; doesn't make sense when you must have numbers in the directory or allow list in order for them not to be blocked.also it's hard to find the "allow" list in order to edit it.but I do recommend this phone as a good spam-blocking phoneupdate oct 2020:the phone still works well but I am revising my 'sound quality" estimate. I actually don't use the handsets for speaking on the phone-I use my other phone as this one tends to have a sort of "hollow" or strange sound effect and somewhat of an "echo" or something. It's annoying for me however this is the handset my husband chooses to use as it's loud enough for his hard hearing so it's a trade-off.Also i discovered that when I'm on a call with someone (on any handset) since we have "call waiting" when a call comes in both of us on the call hear the announcer announcing to the other caller the blurb that everyone (that's not on the allow list or directory) and it's so loud it interrupts our communications and then continues to repeat that announcement---=argggh=so I had to discontinue my call-waiting feature. That's a bummer I guess.But at least the phone is still humming away; that's good.
5,I had another phone the same make probably 12 to 15 years didn't have a problem with it bought a battery to replace the old battery which was cheap but with the teller marketers I wanted a button I could push to block incoming calls plus I can see this when a little bit better I guess the other one being so older the lights were going out on it as well but I guess I've had this same brand of phone for 20 years now two different ones but that's good if your battery goes down on your phone you can order a cheap battery that goes in the phone to replace it you don't need to buy a new one by the way my friend spent $50 on a new phone I spent three or four dollars on the battery just a brief FYI there
4,I ordered this not knowing it had white on it also...that's hard to keep clean and yellows over time so I'm returning it for a black one. Haven't tried it out yet.
3,Having to charge them often and poor reception
4,We ordered the rose with five handsets.  Overall it's a great phone.  The features are easy to use for the most part; the volume on the speaker phone is good (note:  test it on an actual call not just the dial tone -- it's much louder on a call) but the best feature is call blocking.  Fantastic!Set up is fairly easy except for call blocking which has so many ways to go it can be frustrating.What I did:I set it up on #3 to allow all calls and put on the answering machine.  As unwanted calls came in I picked up quickly and hit the "Call block" button.  It asks "Block and end?"  and you just hit the menu button.  Done!After we've been out I check the Caller ID log for unknown calls.  "Review" scroll down to "Block Directory" hit menu button edit if you need to and hit menu again.  Call blocked!On unwanted calls that make it to the answering machine that's easy -- while the message is playing hit "Block" on the handset.  Done!You can mute/set ring volume on each individual handset which is a great feature.We love this set.  I'll update as we learn more features.  The best advice I can give is don't be afraid to punch the buttons to learn how to use the features.  It's the easiest way -- the book is best for reference and just getting started.
5,This phone works well!!
5,Easy to install!
4,hard to read the time and date  too small volume is not that loud I need to constantly put on the speaker phone  actually liked my other set ( Panasonic with big large main phone screen better) this is ok but don't think I would get these again actually I ordered these because they had 5 handsets not 4 like I had.
4,It is so hard to find a good landline phones these days. Most are cheep junk. This is a nice looking phone and okay quality. I would buy it again. I just wish it was better quality. It feels lite. I don't use the blocking feature or the answering machine. It does advise of new voice messages. I was worried it wouldn't. It is hard to program.  Again not a bad buy as long as you realize it isn't like they made them 20 years ago.
4,We have only had these phones for about one month but have been happy with them so far. We decided to get the rose gold model to go with the colors in our kitchen. They are very pretty but I was disappointed that they came with black cords instead of white. Nothing on these phones is black do the cords really look bad! I know I can purchase white ir even pink cords but I shouldn’t have to do this. The included cords should match the phones!
4,We do like these phones very much - BUT I can’t seem to get an answer to one problem I have.  When you’re on a call and realize you want to block call you hit Call Block.  Immediately a message comes up “do you want to block this call?”.  IDK how to answer YES and the message won’t go away unless you hang up.  If anyone knows the answer help!  Otherwise these are very good phones - no other problems - and wood design is very attractive.
5,Best ever phone.  No more phone ringing all day.  This to me is a must have!
4,I replaced an old At&t phone because the  speaker went bad.  Cannot rate the battery life because I haven’t had it that long also not sure what is meant by lock feature so I can’t rate that. However I do like the call screening as of now I do not get any telemarketing calls.  The feature I don’t like and my reason for 3 stars only is because the volume is not as high as on my old phone and us seniors need more volume. Also as some others pointed out the phone and it’s base r not to sturdy.  So if u can live with the flaws the phone is okay.
5,Nice looking phone set with easy to use features. Best thing is the peace and quiet now from no more robo calls. Setup was fairly easy with good instructions.I have it so anyone in the directory will ring right through otherwise caller has to press # to be put through. So robo calls will never push # hence the end of robo calls. If a human call you don’t want gets through you can block it with a press of a button.Answering machine is fine with good quality playback. Battery life to be determined but so far so good. Overall very pleased with the set and the smart call blocking is the best feature.
5,Phone hs now stopped working for no reason for the 4th time since I bought item do not buy phones
3,As a business we get a lot of spam calls and bought this phone because it said that it had a spam call blocker well we still get the spam calls and the block feature is on.No difference to what we had before.  Misinformation.
4,Attractive phone set works very well so far. Audio quality is very good. Probably I will only use a qtr of the features.
5,I cannot believe how easy it was to set up these phones.  Very easy step by step instructions. I could not judge the battery life because I just received the phone but I can say everything else is a five star.
3,I like the color don't like not having more volume.  Don't like having other people's phone #'s left in the phone tells me it is not new but refurbished
3,Hard for my parents with hearing aids to hear - particularly the speaker phone.
4,So far it’s good. Still learning how to maneuver it.
5,As with many seniors readability and tactile sensitivity have become challenging. Our old wireless landline system was very hard to read and the buttons were losing their functionality. This AT&T CL82557 DECT 6.0 is the answer to assuage these issues. The display is larger and brighter. The legibility of the text is greatly improved owing to font style and size. The keypad buttons are larger and more well defined with distinct tactile feedback greatly reassuring that the button was engaged. In addition the pleasant gold and white coloring is rather pleasing compared to past black and silver schemes.
5,I was looking for my new phone to say the name of the person/company calling. This phone does that and more. I am so happy that it scans my calls for robot calls. Calls made by pharmacies go through as there is a feature where you add the company name in the accept name. It doesn't matter if the pharmacy calls with different numbers as long it has “CVS or Walgreens” it bypasses the screening and goes through. Calls that are not made by humans can be blocked or go directly to your answer machine without ringing. If a person is calling and has no name or telephone number and it appears as “private” the system asks them to press # and tell me their name. Then the machine passes the call and the phone rings and says the person's name. If you want to answer you pick up or if you want to block or send directly to voicemail from here until the end of time by pressing v or b the phone helps you by taking you step by step instructions on each call in the beginning so you can learn.
5,Everything was shipped well and it works to my approval.
5,It is a good unit.  The ability to talk from one phone to another is a plus.  We have several people in our home and everyone has a phone and can communicate with the button on the handset to all of the phones or select the one they want.  The clarity is very good as well.
4,no problem with it everything is A OK
4,The phones work great with too many features.  It is not initially intuitive how to use the features but working with the phone a short time you get to understand how to access and use the features.  I found the Smart Call Blocker to be useless unless you want the phone to really screen all of your calls.  I thought it would be nice to have but it can be inconvenient for your family and friends.  I wanted to turn it on to its lowest level but I found the manual didn't quite describe how the feature actually worked.  So I just turned the feature off.  Normally wall mounts are covered by the phone but not this one.  I have a vertical wall mount and with this phone the wall mount sticks out to the right and it sits very high on the wall.  It was unusable and unattractive so my phone sits on the counter.  Even with these negatives I would buy these phones again.
3,Purchased this phone for my mom - It continuously mutes mid-conversation very annoying - Not sure if it is the provider my mom uses (Spectrum) or the phone - so I give it 3 stars.
3,One handset stopped working immediately the sound quality on the other is bad. You could probably do better than this.
5,Replacing a phone set I've had for years by the same company. It just uup and died recently. They are/were from AT&T. Lasted a good long time but electronics do break down after use!  This time I only got 2 handsets instead of 3. They work well and are aethetically pleasing.  So far no complaints.
4,Do like like the annoying voice that comes on when the phone starts ringing hard to understand. Is there a way to turn it off or change the voice?
5,Purchased the 5-handset version in mid April 2021.  We quickly set the Call Block function to require an unknown caller to press the "#" key to continue.  Since then our mealtime and evenings have been quiet and peaceful.  Some live nuisance callers follow the instructions and get through but they are easily disposed of by adding them immediately to the Block List via the "Call Block" button.  All this is worth the price of admission.The handsets themselves are attractive in the rose color.  We've found the sound quality on the handsets to be very good.  The number of active messages left by callers is indicated on the base station screen and listening them is intuitive.  Adding entries to the directory is simple.  But we miss having a larger directory for our contact list (it's limited to just 50 far too few for most people) so that's a minus.  Overall though our experience with this phone set is excellent and we're sorry we didn't get it sooner.
5,Brought this phone for my mom. It useto to be one headset in the house to where she is elderly and had to walk up and down the stairs. Now there is two and she can have one by her bedside. She loves there is a speaker and to block unwanted calls. She loves the color and the buttons are big as well as the screen. This was a great gift for her and I would recommend to anyone.
5,I bought this set for my small office.  I like that the numbers are big and I don't have to strain to see them.  I like the color - very trendy and cute for my office.  I may wind up buying a set for the house too.
1,Terrible. This more recent model of the one I had for 20 years is nowhere near the quality I had come to expect with regard to the speakerphone sound quality or volume. You can control the volume easily but the top end of the volume range is not very good. I find that I want to keep turning it up but it won't go any louder. So if you are sitting it on a counter or desk while walking around the room you’ll find you can't hear the conversation very well or the person on the phone can't hear you very well. The range between the handset and base is not as long either so don't go too far or you will drop the call or begin to get static or interference. The other very disappointing thing so far is that you have to turn it away from you to hear people when on speakerphone because the largest speaker is on the back. So you have to keep turning it away then toward you again every time you want to speak. If you are often using the mute button during conference calls where you are talking a lot you end up needing to hold it in your hand to turn it back and forth to hear the conversation then turn it back again to unmute and speak then mute again and turn back away again to hear. This may sound like just an inconvenience but when you're on hours and hours of conference calls each day it is very annoying.  It also doesn't stand up very well so you can easily knock it over when you’re on speakerphone which creates a loud noise in the callers ear so suggest muting the phone or just keep holding it. Not ideal for working at home if you multi-task during calls or when you need your hands free to use your keyboard or other device. Other features are nice like large buttons but the colored numbers look weird. Black would have been easier to see and looked better. The "rose gold" is actually more of a shiny pink so keep that into consideration if you want the phones to blend in to your decor. The display is larger which is very helpful and having multiple handsets makes finding the phone much easier. It took a while to figure out all of the things I liked and disliked so now I'm past the return date and can't get my money back or exchange it for another phone. I wish I had figured out all of this sooner. It wasn't inexpensive so I'm stuck with them for a while unfortunately.
5,Beautiful.  Blends well with my oak desk.  I like it
5,I am hard of hearing and was very surprised at how well I can hear people on this phone.  We are very satisfied.  I started to give this phone a 5 star rating because the ringer is not as loud as I need and besides changing the ring tone it would be helpful for a louder ring but decided the phone is worth a 6 star rating.  We are elderly and really like our new phone.
5,Call blocker feature for spam calls is great
3,Se escucha muy poco
4,I found it complicated to set up. But its not something I do everyday.
4,needed a bigger print phone.  like the call blocking
5,I love these phones. I've been putting up with old phones that barely worked for a long time and then I got these. I got the 5 phone set so I have phones all over my house now. The buttons are large and so is the display so it is easy to read. Not to mention they are very pretty. I love the rose gold! There are many options for call blocking so you need to pick the one that is right for you. The first one I used I noticed my phone never rang. I guess it was doing it's job. I am very happy with this purchase. I would recommend.
5,These phones are great for anyone needing large numbers on phone to see and announcements of who’s calling however the sound of who is calling is not very clear. Meaning the voice announcement gives a half announcement of who is calling. Other than that the phones are great and pretty colors. They also have spam blocking but I haven’t used that feature yet so I can’t comment on that. Over all I’m very pleased with the phones.
5,Perfect item for Mom. It reminded her of her old one that was twenty years old.
5,Recommend
2,I bought the phone for its rose color and smart call blocking features.  The color is as gorgeous as I hoped (note: there is also a black one).  The smart call blocking has already deterred one spam caller successfully (I just happened to look at it when it was screening -- which the screen indicated -- and the call never came through though it was registered on caller ID).  I did have one call ring through that was not in the directory or allow list and screening did not kick in -- and I can't understand why.  I ran any test I could think of to explain it (i.e. maybe the person just hit pound without saying his name - nope not that).  Somehow the caller just got around it.  I found the phone fairly easy to setup; the only instructions I read were for the smart call blocking to understand all of its options.  It's imperfections...I'm annoyed by the bright red charge light on every handset - it often catches my eye and thus is distracting.  I had to turn the handset in the bedroom to avoid seeing it while I try to fall asleep.  It's also not perfect because it doesn't have a belt clip and max volume doesn't seem as loud as my previous Panasonic.  It is easy to use and has all the base functions I wanted plus the upgrade with smart call blocking.Update: I removed 2 stars because the people I call complain about not being able to hear me the call breaking up etc.  Call quality seems greatly affected when I'm around other electronics (TV fridge etc.).  That's disappointing because I do still like the call screening feature even though it's not perfect.  However I did find that the call screening still works even if I have other phones connected.  So I guess I could put two phones in every room - one to announce a screened caller and the other to talk on.
4,Home use 2 locations.  Caller ID voice very poor turned it off.Large screen easy to read. Lighted large key board also shows up very well.Not easy to program but with some  effort and time can be done.
4,From one thing I do not like is that I hear my message every time a caller goes to leave their message... Unless there's a setting that I haven't found yet to stop that from happening...
2,After owning this phone for a few weeks I have to revise my review.  The first thing that happened was people I was talking to complained that i kept cutting out and it happened to almost every phone call. The second thing is that I accidentally blocked one of my friends and following the directions in the booklet I tried to get her unblocked. I have tried now for two weeks but the phone will not let me unblock her.  The third thing is that the caller ID does not seem to recognize the callers and I get "unavailable" but the number is someone who calls regularly. This happens too frequently for me to forgive. I depend on the caller ID to be correct so that I know when to answer the phone and when to ignore an unknown number or name. Being a senior I must get a couple dozen scam calls a day so I don't answer the phone unless it is a number or name I know. The next thing is trivial but annoying. The voice that announces who's calling is really grating and irritates me. I am so dissatisfied with this phone I want to return it in exchange for a phone that works properly.
4,The phone system has a lot of features! The only thing I dislike is when you have messages and you are in bed you have to get up to clear your messages because it makes a beeping sound until you clear it.
5,Easy to use
5,This sticks so well. Great for my project.
5,I received these phones yesterday and not be technically "with it" at my age decided to take things one step at a time.  I found the booklet easy to follow the directions and thought I would begin by updating the directory.  It took me a time or two to catch on but within no time I was putting in contacts with no trouble.  Although I still haven't done away with my old phone I plugged in the base just out of curiosity and during this time my sister called. I put her on speaker phone and she commented that it sounded very clear.  At this point I have not done away with my old phone and won't until I know the ins and outs of this new AT&T but I know this senior is going to be very satisfied. I would recommend this phone highly.
4,so far they have worked good long range good well lite when using them and perfect amont of phones in package for every room
4,Phone works good. Clear voice and signal. Too many menu options for the simplest things. I like it and will keep it.
3,The phones came in but there wasn't an instruction Manual.  Please send me an instruction manual.Thank you
3,Phones look nice easy to use.My problem was there was a lot of static and occasional bleed over from someone else. Tried another phone ( Daughter ) no problems with that
5,Found a phone that knocks out spam and I'm still thinking something is wrong because I'm not getting all the crazy calls.  When a spam call comes in the phone does not ring but it shows that a call was missed.  Helpful that I programmed all my important numbers in so they won't get excluded and go through the spamming process.  This is the best and a peace of mind for a couple of months now I've had in a long long time!
3,the phone is cumber son and difficult to use the special features are too much for me. i should have bought the Panasonic which i know is a better phone. maybe next time I will.
5,Great phones but the Call Block feature is priceless with today’s robocalls! This feature alone makes the purchase completely worth it! They have great battery life and the sound is awesome.
4,Really like this phone. Can add as many other phones to this as I want. Quality of hearing and sound is very good and I come across very clear
4,Screen was larger than many and easier to read.
5,Like that when you delete on one phone it clears both.
