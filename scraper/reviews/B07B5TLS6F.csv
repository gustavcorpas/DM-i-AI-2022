5,I specifically purchased this outlet to accommodate multiple devices with large plugs. I could only accommodate 2 devices with 2" plugs using a standard strip. Due to the layout of the receptacles on the strip I was able to power many more devices with large plugs. The only flaw is the lack of a power indicator light on the strip itself.
5,I use this for my fish tank and all the extras that have to be plugged in with it. The flat plug is a great addition to this.
5,This is a 15 foot braided cord six-outlet surge-protected grounded extension cord. It does what it advertises.
5,It was fine
5,This protector has a good amount of joules and there's no light (so you don't have to cover it).  I have several of these and never had a problem.
5,I bought 2 of these and am pleased with my purchase. I like the 2 ft cord since I don't have all the unwanted cord length to wrap up.Some reviews said they were poor quality. They seem sturdy to me. Heavy duty cord and plug solid plastic casing.Some reviews complained about the reset switch. It doesn't indicate On or Off but it's pretty obvious if you plug it in and your device doesn't work that it's Off. Just flip the switch and get on with your life. LOL
5,Great product
5,Important to protect against overload of electrical outlets at home or office very important tool.
5,Great for multiple items to be plugged in and work.
5,The cord length was perfect and the flat plus worked really well in a tight space.
5,No need for an extended cord. Sits nicely behind my sleep number bed without extra bulk.
5,Good
4,Worked perfectly for my application.
5,Fit my plugs perfectly. Does not cover the reset button and doesn't get in the way of the other outlet.
5,It works
5,Just what I needed working good.\
5,This worked prefectly to get the tv/gaming cords up and out of reach. The plug is flat making it difficult for baby to pull on or dislodge as opposed to one jutting out of the wall that you can grip and pull.
4,No light indicator for on or off amd ot jus feels really light and cheap fragile etc.. but it worked after i plugged it in so..
4,Works just fine. No issues. I’m just glad it’s hidden behind a dresser and no one will see it. It came all scratched up probably from poor packaging on Amazon’s part. Wish they had boxed it instead of bagging it.
5,Excellent. Arrived on time. No issues. Great product. Recommend it
5,We needed a simple surge-protecting power strip to consolidate all the power cords on our outdoor TV.  This one was the perfect choice for a great price.
3,Works as intended. Only issue is the cord is stiff and dosent sit flat but on its side.
5,Very resistant
5,I wanted a short cord right angle plug and power switch on a cheap power strip. This one fit the bill. The braided cord looks nice though the rest is just the usual cheap plastic so the braiding is kind of overkill. The rest fit what I was looking for and I figure if it's a GE-branded unit it probably really did go through the safety testing that the box claimed.
5,The cord is delightfully long and well insulated. The surge protector feels dang solid too; like it’s going to last. The protection rating is obnoxiously high and can protect like 3 TVs from a lower surge but please don’t stress your outlets like that that would be silly.There is an off/on switch on the side that the pictures here on Amazon don’t show. Good buy works for what I needed it for if I need another one for something I’ll probably buy this again.
5,The cord needs to be longer
3,Bueno  básico y economico
4,See the title. Nothing special. 4 stars is good. 5 would be spectacular. No complaints. I do like that the switch is on the side so those big warts don’t turn it off.
5,Was perfect length for what I needed and had no issues with the cord breaking or working. There is an on and off switch on the side for those who bought this and have trouble and didn’t see it.
4,Wish I had paid a little more and gotten one with a switch light.
4,Construction seems flimsy - all plastic.  To be expected at this price point I suppose.  Time will tell if it's durable.
4,I needed a power strip that plugged in from the side so the couch could be pushed closer to the wall. This one worked fine.
5,Love the cord length and the black color
5,I have been replacing nearly every power strip I own with these flat plug power strips. It allows furniture and the like to be placed so much closer to the wall. I haven't had a problem out of any of the strips I have bought so far.
3,I purchased the "GE UltraPro 6 Outlet Surge Protector 2 Ft" with a very specific application in mind.It seems a nice GE product.  I have had it for only a couple of days so no time to really get a sense of it's long- term quality of operation.  The reasons I gave it three stars rather than five are these:1. There is no indicator light to show whether it is on or off.  And to exacerbate that confusion the switch has no marking or indication as to which is the "on" position or the "off".  Surprisingly a huge irritation.2. I purchased the two foot length because that length conveniently reaches most wall sockets and places the power strip section nicely on the floor ... exactly what I was looking for.  However like most flat plug cords the cord itself is directed down and to the right from the plug.  The cord is relatively stiff and therefor by its rigidity dictates the position of the power strip's position on the floor.  It seem that the designers never really tested the product in this fashion because due to the position of the flat plug and the significant stiffness of the cord itself the power switch lays nice and flat on the carpet but FACE DOWN.  So to plug anything into the power strip the short cord must be twisted fairly aggressively 180 degrees to position the power strip to be oriented face up.  Even so the stiffness of the sturdy cord causes the surge protector to slowly migrate back to the face down position even when plugs have been inserted.  Extremely irritating.For these two very irritating glitches I would not buy another nor recommend this product.
4,brand TV
5,Fits flat against the wall.  Perfect for space behind tall dressers.
5,We need this type of plug angle for our camper. Works well
5,Simply read the description and look at the pictures to see if this is good for you.  I wanted a flat plug and a short/sturdy cord so I'm happy.  The rest is the basic power strip.Regarding some of the negative reviews...- Rotating plugs sound nice but I've had several of them go bad.  If you want that feature go buy a different product.  From the pictures I could see it would plug in where I needed it.- The wire is a bit stiff 14 gauge I think but I'm glad it's not some cheap flimsy wire.
5,Good price!
3,Works fine but the switch is indented so it is a little difficult to switch and there is no light to tell you it is turned on.  The cord is more flexible than a standard cord which allows it to bend better.
5,it’s short and i was so confused on how to turn it on because usually it’s on the front but the switch was on the side
5,Sturdy. The right size for what I wanted. I just wish it was black or brown.
5,This cord gets the job done while looking newer and eat it was about time I replaced all of my previous cords
5,Just what I wanted... the cord is flat and fits in my limited space
5,Works great and cord length was perfect for my needs
5,Like this product. Use it in a mini charging station I built.
5,I needed a surge protector but had limited space this worked perfectly
5,It was exactly as advertised...the cord was the length I wanted the plug was the angle I wanted it was the color I wanted and the price was low.What's not to like?
5,It was a tough decision on which surge protector to get when I decided I needed an additional one but decided on this one because of the flat plug length of the cord and its size.  Thus far I have not been disappointed some of the mixed reviews its received on Amazon.  Its usage is fairly light as it is mostly used as a convenient power strip for a lamp and cell phone since the nearest power outlet is behind the mattress of my bed and I was looking for a surge protector with a flat plug so that the mattress could be as close to the wall as possible.  As at least one of the other reviews points out - and as you can see by one of the pictures of the packaging that I took confirms - it is actually made by JASCO and not GE but it comes with a $100000 equipment warranty and the surge protector itself is covered by a lifetime warranty so who cares since GE is willing to put its name on it.  Nevertheless I have no regrets in buying this surge protector and would buy it again if I needed another and everything else about it made it the right choice.
3,I've noticed lately that power strips that say they have a FLAT plug are just angling the poles at such a weird angle that it's not always very helpful.  Often times it's obstructive.Could there be a right and left angle to these flat plugs in the future?Well for now we didn't like this item so we're returning it to get a rotating plug much better
5,In this day and age it's actually kind of tough to find a simple surge protector without bells and whistles like USB charging ethernet passthrough remote control Alexa etc. I just wanted something that provides surge protection and a 6ft cord so I could put my wifi router and gateway up on a shelf. This product does the job admirably.Braided cord is a bonus. I've actually run the cable up my closet wall and it blends in nicely with the white paint better than if it were a regular rubber-sheathed wire. I'd especially recommend this for any application where there may be motion like a standing desk for example. A rubber cable can easily snag and tear something if it gets caught on any corners but a braided cable will slide.
5,It keeps my cords in one place
5,none
5,I like the length and it turns off and on at side.
5,This allowed me to put my file cabinet closer to the wall.  The cord was sturdy and functional.
5,My electric bed was raising up against the plugs in the wall and they were showing wear. This 90 degree surge protector was a perfect problem solver.
5,This was great exactly what I needed and good quality.
5,We were looking for something semi short so that we would add more outlet sockets for our TV items in a small area with minimal extra cable. This arrived with scuff marks on the exposed areas of the cable so I was worried it might have been used but it was zip tied into the packaging as normal. We tested it out and after 1 month of use its held up very well! We use at least 3 of the outlets at any given time for a laptop charger a lamp a small Marshall speaker and sometimes a printer and oil diffuser. No power loss no shortages and no trouble with the outlet strip switching off. Highly recommend!
4,Works well but I have a speaker plugged into it that makes noise every time I turn the fan on also plugged into it. Some type of grounding issue perhaps.
5,This strip is perfect for my needs.
3,No on off switch
5,
5,In the photo you see the GE power strip (2 foot cord version) at the top and another brand at the bottom. The GE design allows the use of a large AC/DC converter/transformer plug that you see on some electronics because of it’s flat top and the on/off switch on the side. This is a big advantage over traditional designs.With the GE power strip there is no indicator light to tell you if the power strip is on or off. I like that because when I turn the lights off at night I am tired of seeing all the indicator lights shining red or blue.
5,8 ft cord length a big plus well made
5,I had a generic multi-plug adapter literally melt a year ago I don't take any chances anymore. This one seems to be built of a heavier than usual plastic. I think it's a higher quality item than the budget cheap ones I've seen here. And I have expensive components and I'd rather trust a name brand than some generic junk again. Buy a cheap one at your own peril guys...
5,Basic power strip with flat plug/cord to easily tuck behind furniture.
5,Served my requirement
5,I needed a multi-outlet surge suppressor with a shorter cord to help reduce the jumble of cords emerging from behind my entertainment center. My previous suppressor was huge and had a heavy and unnecessarily long thick cord.
4,Works
5,I specifically purchased this one because it has a flat plug and I’m able to push my furniture all the way back up against the wall. Everything plugs and easily and works like a charm
4,This is a good basic short-cord power strip  but I am disappointed that it has no indicator light to show if it is on or off. This is important to me since I want to shut it off when not in use and it's much easier when you have the visual indicator.
5,This surge protector is great for plugs behind furniture. I needed something very low profile. After lots of searching this was the lowest profile plug I could find on amazon. The plug protrudes from the wall only .75 inches and allows you to push furniture right up next to it. I also really like that the cord that comes out of the plug is offset. Instead of coming straight down it curves to the right. I lay the actually surge protector on the floor to the right of the plug and everything works great. GE is a trusted brand and I have no complaints!
5,great buy
5,great buy
4,It's a little lightweight but it works fine.
5,Looks good and works well! I'm very satisfied with this product. I cannot stay with other brands for power strips! haha
5,I used Christmas tree lights. 6 ft. Cord length was good in this case because tree was close to an electrical plug.
5,Quality product. Seems well built.  Plug is thick and sturdy. Cord is thick and put together nicely.  The housing is nice rounded quality plastic and the outlets are tactile when plugging in appliances.  My only complaint is the on/off switch or no light indicating the protector is on/off. The switch is not labeled other than a raised line on one end of the toggle switch. Once you find out which is on and which is off you just have to remember if the line pressed is on or off. Minor detail.Product works perfectly and I would recommend it.
3,Over all seems like a good surge protector but it's got the most cheesy switch which is hard to use......
5,This was the perfect cord for my room. I like how sturdy the cord is - you can shape it in a straight/wavy line pretty easy; it does not fall over. Happy with this high quality product.
5,I bought this particular surge protection outlet strip because it was designed for wall mounting. It was a snap to mount to the base board using two screws. The screws don't come with the strip. One of the things I like most about this product besides it's wall mounting capability is its built in on-off-reset toggle switch which allows me to turn off all my electronics using one switch. Appears to be well built.
4,Cord length sturdiness and value for money 😃
5,Works as intended while looking good in any room and keeps me at ease knowing whatever I plug into it will be safe as well. Works so well I have three of them in different lengths which was very nice to have a good array of options for length. The flat plug is excellent for getting furniture as close to the wall as possible while also avoiding a dangerous frayed cable from being bent the wrong way for too long.
4,Works as it should so far.
2,Purchased this to supply my kids workstation for online schooling with juice. For the last several months we’ve only had 2 things plugged in (1 monitor & 1 mini pc tower) and for this purpose it works.Fast forward to this weekend when we moved both kids’ workstations closer to the router to get a better signal. Since we only needed 1 surge protector for both setups we chose this one since it was newer. Plugged in 1 workstation (1 monitor 1 pc); works. Plugged in second workstation (1 monitor 1 pc); still working. So at this point we have a total of 2 monitors & 2 PCs and everything seemingly powers on but Then my daughter wanted her phone charger at her desk and as soon as I plugged it in one of the monitors powered down. It then wouldn’t power back on until the phone charger was unplugged. Luckily it was the monitor & not one of the PCs. Needless to say we’ll be keeping an eye on this surge protector.Had this tripped on excessive pull it would be one thing but to do nothing makes me a bit worried. We haven’t experienced an issue with our other surge protector which have the same amount of outlets so we may switch back to one of them to be on the safe side.
5,I bought this for the flat plug. It's plugged into an outlet behind my bed. Before this I had just a regular power strip but the bed would make it come loose. Since it's used to charge phones smart watches etc. I needed to to stay plugged in. Will definitely recommend! Would prefer all flat plugs on my power strips. Maybe I'll replace all my old ones one day.
4,Very thick and stiff cord.  Cord emerges from the plug pointing to the right and that is pretty much where you will have to place the surge protector because the cord is so reluctant to bend where you want it to go.  Has an on/off switch.  Can be mounted to a wall or structure but you will need your own screws.  There is no on/off light.
5,Perfect for what I need
5,excelente calidad a muy buen precio
3,Cord is extremely short
5,I liked this product because I use it on my microwave and it stays safe with the surge protection
5,This power strip was exactly what I needed for power next to my bed.  The flat plug in allows me to have my night table up against the wall.  The cord is flexible so I can place it right next to the night table and plug in an alarm clock reading light and an electric blanket and still have outlets open if something else is needed.
4,Dirty stained and scratched upon receipt. I would've rather went to the store and purchased them versus the convenience of having them delivered to me.
3,I purchased this with the plan to hang it on the wall with just enough cord to reach the plug.  The problem is that it hangs upside down with the cord at the bottom.
5,Made well and a good value.
5,I got this because I needed a power strip with a flat profile plug. And the plug had to be offset so it wouldn't block the other outlet. On Both counts it works well. Sure it's made in China and sure even though it's labeled "GE" it is really only licenced by "GE" and made by another company. No big deal.
5,I really needed low profile plugs to put behind a bed and a dresser and these were one of the few options available honestly. Figured GE was a good enough brand to make a decent product with a good warranty. 100k warranty apparently on plugged in devices decent cord length priced on the cheaper side. I tested all 6 outlets on each and they all work. I might pick up another two pack in case I end up needing more.
5,surge protectors good for the price sturdy fit's flat against wall happy with purchase
3,Good
5,Thick braided cord. Cord looks "vintage". Black and white braided.
5,I am using it for past 2 years and happy.
5,angled plug
5,Exactly what I wanted.
5,Nicely compact. Why don’t all plugs come angled and able to stay clear of the neighboring outlet/plug/cord? Electric cords are the last bastion of electronic progress left too long ignored. Decoratively they are nightmares. They only disappear in magazine shots. If scientists and engineers can make a 512gigabite storage device smaller than a woman’s pinky nail- why haven’t cords gotten less obtrusive thinner and a more invisible color like some thin nearly opaque lamp cords all expandable in length or retractable within devices with flatter right angled “block no socket” plug ends?
5,The outlet strips I used before had the switches on top.  My cats would walk on them and turn them off killing the TV cable box and more.  When the cable box loses power it takes several minutes to reboot.  These strips have the switch on the side and the cats can't accidentally turn them off.  Works well for my purpose.
2,I've had this for a year and it just died on me in the middle of the night. It's been sitting behind my desk since I bought it with speakers phone charger and baby monitor plugged into it. I replaced it with a 20 year old Ace power strip that still works. This is the first power strip I've ever had stop working and it only lasted a year. Very poor quality
4,It didn’t protect from my massive surge of man juice. Thankfully the switch turned off but my surge protector was still ruined. It charged decently but I still really need to prevent my man juice from destroying my electronics. I am too sad and my tears (man juice) overpower this surge protector .
5,We purchased this when we needed a few more cords plugged in in our living room. Mostly chargers because the wall outlets are behind some furniture and the charger cord lengths are not long enough for that situation. This works well for what we needed. The on/off switch on it is terrific so when it's not in use we don't need to crawl behind our furniture to unplug- simply flip the switch! We are happy customers :) great product for the price
4,I really like the amount of outlets and considering i came from an 8 slot surge protector to this one when it only had two working makes me really happy for the amount of money i paid. Mainly used for my computer's power but i have two charger cables hooked up to an adapter and it charges them mighty fast with my computer running at the same time. The material could be a bit more durable feeling but i've kicked it a few times and no cracks or indents whatsoever so i'm fine with it 13/15 stars for this is good all things considered in terms of value.
5,The cord is a good length I didn't need it go stretch too far so I have some slack which is good. It's used for phone chargers and a Nintendo Switch charger and it works well. Everything gets adequate power and fast chargers still power up fast so it's not lacking there. Overall it works great.
5,Quality is great and just what I needed for the space
4,lt works well. I like the flat against the wall. Will make sure I get that type from now on. I do wish it had a little more space between the sockets. But they are always too close to use all sockets at the same time.
5,I purchased these for my classroom to provide more outlets for students to charge their devices during class. They are holding up well to constant plugging in and unplugging at the end of the period.  Would definitely recommend!
5,This did exactly what I needed. The flat head was a huge help and the power strip works as advertised. My only complaints might be that the cord is very stiff to bend behind furniture and the button is on the side rather than the top making it so that the power strip has to be installed one way up. Both very minor issues especially for the price and performance.
5,All outlets work great and the sleek black design “disappears” into decor. It’s an economical design upgrade and organizer for previous 3-way outlet plugs and I recommend it. I’m buying more!!
5,Very good.
5,The cord is a little bit short with this one but it looks great and has 6 outlets that work perfectly for something like a TV and the other systems that would need to be plugged into it. Does what you need it to and can mount on wall if you buy the proper modifications for it which is a huge advantage.
5,Very nice power strip and I love the angled cord that takes up less space from the wall. Tucks away well behind a dresser or desk and provides several outlets for plugging in devices.
5,I really love the braided cable which not only looks better than the regular rubber but also ends up being more flexible and sturdy than the rubber version. If you are willing to spend a couple of dollars extra I highly recommend this over the non-braided cable version.
4,I wish the plug angled to the left rather than the right.  Also would be nice to have an indicator light but I knew those things before i bought it.  Since some of the cord was going to be permanently visible I wanted something with a braided cover which looks better than a standard cord.
4,Works as expected and meets the description.  I wish the power switch was easier to access it's quite tucked away and does not light up to signal its state or the device health
5,I REALLY LIKE THE 6FT DESIGNER BRAIDED EXTENSION CORD. IT IS EASY TO USE AND NOT BULKY LIKE A LOT OF THE CORDS. I CAN KEEP IT PLUGGED IN BECAUSE IT HAS AN ON OFF SWITCH WHICH IS VERY CONVENIENT FOR USE. VERY SATISFIED WITH THIS PURCHASE.
3,Length is okbut on off switch seems loose.
5,Perfect size for what I needed - ordered because of its cord length.  Keeps it neat and out of the way.  Not much to it except for what is important - plugs.  Used a command strip to keep it in place.
5,My husband installed it over the counter so can use my electrical appliances safely.
5,Power bar works great.  Exactly what I needed.
5,This is the best cheap surge protector on the market. You may want a few of those near 1’ extension cords if you have things with wall warts and want to use all the outlets.And yes I know a stripper was not supposed to be included but mark this as helpful if it made you smile :)
4,Good product! But I think it can add more usb.
5,Ignore the cable cluster! It does the job good. It's a surge protector not much else to add Cheers!
5,This is a great power surge to use. I bought this specifically for the flat-head so I could put it behind a couch. It works as intended and I would recommend this product to my friends. If you already have surge protectors there's a cables that convert them to flat-head plugs just make sure they're UL certified and you'll be set.
4,I like it but I didn't order the correct cord length.  I will be ordering more.
5,I bought this to replace an old surge protector in my kitchen. The cord is the perfect length to reach an area where I need to plug in my coffee pot & can opener. I will purchase again should the need arise.
4,The only thing I don't like about it is there's no light on it to indicate it's on. Otherwise perfect!
5,One of the hazards of working from home during Covid lockdown was tripping over electric cords from laptops monitors and PC accessories around my makeshift desk. This helped reduce the peripheral aisle clutter to a single cord.
5,With the off switch you can keep your gizmoes from using unnecessary electricity.  And a plus is getting rid of those useless lights that stay on all the time. The cord is short but since we use it in the kitchen that is what we were looking for.
4,The cord is pretty stiff. I had to work it a lot to make it more pliable. The length is great and the quality seems good to.
5,Helped getting things hooked up
5,The strip is well designed and assembled. The flat plug was perfect for my need on a UPS socket so it does not point the cable up. The two feet length was actual a bit longer than needed because I needed the strip lying close to the UPS so it had to be bent half its length. But for most customers two feet is good enough. So for anyone who needs a sort power strip with a flat plug this is the unit you need to buy.
5,Works fine. Good price
3,I needed a power strip for an aquarium pump light and heater. Also needed to be able to plug-in 2 other items. This looks like it would be great but unfortunately the outlets are so close together that it makes it very difficult to plug everything in. I ended up needing to skip one outlet and was barely able to use the other five. I’m a little bit worried because one plug is not quite plugged in flash because it’s practically overlapping the one just above it. There should be a little bit more space between them! Otherwise it seems to be working fine I’ve only had it set up for about five days.
5,This is just what I needed for my computer set up.  I am able to plug in my desktop router and printer into this power strip.  It's makes for a convenient neat and safe environment in the office.  Can't ask for more!
4,Good product. I like the fact that the switch is on the side. However it doesn’t have a light to check the power status. In addition the outlets are all too closed to one another which is annoying when you plug in fast chargers for phone and laptops like the MacBook pro.
5,I needed it for its flat plug in prpperties.  So far it's worked!
4,The power strip was good except for 1 problem. There seems to be a loose part inside the power strip. Power strip however still works and it is nice and flushed against the wall.
4,Cord length is excellent.Value for money not good.Thickness is good.
5,It is a very solid product. Definitely worth the money.
5,I purchase this power strip because I was looking for a plug that had a low profile since it was going behind my bed’s headboard. It worked out perfectly and the product works as intended.
2,After I purchased I read another review which echoes two problems with this.1. The outlets are VERY close together. Even more so than on regular power strips. I don’t see why—there is plenty of space to spread them out like is done on other power strips but they’re not.2. The mounting holes are upside down so that it is not possible to mount on the wall as shown in the picture.  How hard would it have been to form two sets of mounting holes? I’ve had other power strips that have multiple mounting holes in different orientations. If you are simply laying this on the floor it won’t matter. If you expect to mount on a wall you will have to mount it upside down with the cord at the bottom. That is the only option provided.This is simply a bad/sloppy design and I just printed a return label.
5,Used the two I purchased to replace some REALLY old surge suppressors. The lights were flickering on both which from what I understand means they are sketchy for protection. Have been running for moths now and work great!
5,Works very well to provide power to a few small devices. The recessed plug is a nice touch allowing you to tuck it behind furniture or to help with cable management. Love the fact that the power button is recessed to help avoid accidents.
5,I needed a surge protector with a short cord.  This one is great.  I have a plug that is a few inches away from a window sill.  The cord I had was on the floor because the cord was so long.  This one fits on the window sill and hides all those ugly cords with a piece of furniture in front of the window.  I plan to purchase more.  It is very sturdy.
4,It's good quality I have mine hung up on the wall - I really appreciated the holes for that. The flat plug is really nice as mine is behind my dresser.
5,Great buy great product .Plan on buying it againWhen I need one.
4,Nice compact surge protector. Braided cord is fancy looking but don’t expect the length of 2 feet long(it’s just over a foot and a half including the plug) nor the flexibility of an actual braided cable. If I had to take a guess it’s just for looks.
4,Get what you pay for some times. First impression is it seems like its cheap and old stock. Definitely not mint  but now that its hidden and I am using it I am happy so I will give it a 4.
4,The only reason this product didn't get five stars from me was because it lacks a visible pilot light. That is a light which is visible when power is supplied.
5,These are great basic power strips - cord length is as advertised the plug is offset to not block the other outlet and best of all it has no annoying LED lights on it - perfect for a bedroom.
5,I have an oddly placed outlet it’s located midway of the wall and is behind my headboard...making it extremely difficult to use. I ordered this surge protector because of the flat plug and it’s perfect! It’s just the right size to allow the headboard to be where I need and have everything plugged in.
5,I wanted a black surge protector so it wouldn't stick out like a sore thumb; this strip plug filled the bill nicely.
5,Pretty simple item it either works or not. It worked.
4,Good deal for the price. Little hard get plugs to go in all way not sure of will get easier later. Get what you pay for I guess.  Sure more expensive ones probably protect items plug in better.
5,Love the flatness of the plug in so my furniture can be closer to the wall. I use this with my extension box covers and it's PERFECT in all of the bedrooms!
4,NA
5,Cumple con lo ofertado lo recomiendo
5,Works great nice sturdy design Low profile wall plug is a must and much safer than the old ones.
4,Good product finally suits my need of fitting into a small space under a bar. Works nice and flush with the flat plug.Only issue is the switch really wish it wasn't on the side. There's a big empty spot on the face where it should be like every other power strip.
5,The apartment I moved into has a couple of electrical outlets that don't work - or work with light switches that confuse and confound me. I have two of these cords and they are perfect for my needs.
5,I was looking for an 'outlet extension'.  this is great because it plugs into standard outlet and then mounts to your wall or baseboard.
5,Works well for the my use but seems a little cheap I wouldn't want to be moving it alot.
5,Good length and so far works perfectly all without sticking far from the outlet
3,The cord is too short & it comes out of the side of the plug so I'm kinda out of luck here since the things I need to plug in are to the right but the short cord goes to the left. Idk why they didn't make it come out of the middle of the top/bottom or have the plug rotate. Or at least make it a flexible cord? Don't buy this. Keep looking.
3,In the event that the protection capacity is exceeded by a power surge or the protection components expire the power will be permanently shut down to the outlets.... At this time the surge protector has reached end of life and must be replaced.
3,Great
4,exactly what I was looking for it is in use right now and very pleased with the purchase.
5,I originally received a power cord thar didn't work no power to it at all. Requested a replacement and it works great!
5,If you get one of these definitely get at least a 6 footer. The only reason I grabbed it was for the cord length not the quality of protection. This is great for the price!
3,It is affordable but the main drawback is the button that tells you if it is on or off does not light up.
5,Works as expected has little hook things to hang up. Needed another surge protector in another part of my house. I knew exactly where to come back to.
5,I'm on my second one now but that's due to the first one having done it's job; it "broke" because my blow-dryer shorted while plugged into it. It has been a literal life-saver. lol
5,This is an excellent basic surge protector. The flat plug and short line keeps it neatly placed near the outlet. The braided cord is a game changer. The flexibility allows it to lay flat. I would highly recommend this surge protector based on its quality and design.
5,I use as a traveling power strip to charge my laptop and peripherals.  Does well!
5,Purchased this item to help with the cord cluttering in my room and it helps so much! Haven't had any issues at all and it is very cumbersome and does the job! Highly recommend!
5,Works fine no issues and for a good price.
5,I bought this because the part that plugged into the wall was flat and I needed it to fit into a tight spot.  It fits and I have not had any issues with it.  Would recommend!
5,We have a double bathroom sink with only one outlet so this works great for plugging in our toothbrushes and such. I live the flat cord too since the outlet is right on the side of my sink and a cord sticking out would be seriously in the way.
4,Power switch located on the side of the strip instead of on top edge. Inconvenient. Also not lighted so no visible sign of power on.  Keeping it to use in another location.
5,Was worried based on reviews but works and has no issues
5,When my apartment shuttered power this was a life saver during that blackout to prevent my PC from getting toasted.  10/10
5,Loved how sleek and flat it is. It saves so much space and is really inconspicuous. I just wish I chose a longer cord option
5,Just what I needed
4,Very well built for outdoor use. Pretty heavy. Quality material.
5,Works greatNarrow enough to fit in our hidden mantle compartment seamlessly
5,I am glad that I got this! It is definitely just a normal surge protector but a great price.
4,Looks good.  really like the shorter cord.  Like that it has surge protector capabilities.
5,The flat plugs are great for limited space areas behind furniture and also look better on open walls than standard straight out plugs.
5,We bought this for the outlet behind our couch since the couch goes right up against the wall and it works very well and we don’t have to worry about bending a cord !
5,Great product for the price and the cord is not too long so it fits in perfectly between my office furniture without a lot of extra cord to hide
5,Wanted a flat end charger to our behind my dresser to plug my electronics into and not have a gap behind it. My mirror needs to be flush against the wall so it won’t sway in earth quakes and this allowed me to plug everything in and move it back to avoid they swaying. I will only buy the flat plug ones now because they are wonderful behind couches entertainment centers and head boards too.
4,I like that it lays flat again the wall so I don't have to worry about damaging the plug. The cord was a little shorter than I expected. It's definitely a plug meant for indoors.
5,No frills power cord but arrived quickly and worked perfectly.  I even went back and bought a second one with a different cord length for another place in the house
4,Works well and can be wall mounted which is good
5,Good power strip.  A lot of different plugs and long enough to connect to the power source
5,Love it - it fits just perfect.  Long enough to do the job w/o a lot of cord to deal with.
5,this is a well constructed item the cord was long and heavy. I'm confident it will be able to run my cooler.
4,Works fine.
5,Pretty standard power strip.  I liked the low profile plug.  It seems pretty well built however I've only been using it for a month so not sure on longevity.  I'd like to see dust covers for unused outlets.  However you get what you pay for and this was a pretty inexpensive power strip.
5,Seems to be a good power strip. What I really like is that it has an on/off switch that does not have a glowing light. I think they are different though depending on which cord length you order. Having a bedroom free of all glowing lights & LEDs is important if you want to sleep better and have a restful environment. There’s nothing worse than all those glowing lights they put on most electronics nowadays.
5,Super thin clean and inexpensive have a Razer Siren Mini and Logitech Pro X headset connected and works with no issues
5,I like it a lot
5,It's a simple design and that's what I liked about it. Itd be preferable if the chord was longer but I still like it a lot.
5,Cord isn't too long or short love the flat plug so it doesn't stick out far from wall
5,So tired trying to get behind bookcases or desks. Just arrive promptly and works perfectly
5,Very good quality and I like that this does not have a light that shows it is on.  The flat head plug is great for using behind furniture so you can push it closer to the wall.
5,Good surge protector! The cord length is perfect! (not too long and not too short). And the base is actually pretty small. Making it easy to hide.
5,This is the cleanest simple power strip. It fits in to the area i need with the perfect cord length.
5,It's a power strip does what it's supposed to do.  The cord is short maybe 2 feet max.  It's fine where I have it.  I do like the flat plug so it tucks behind furniture easily.
5,I needed a cleaner and shorter cable for my surge protector and this was it. The flat plug is the most important part.The only issue I have is the power switch on it is a little ambiguous but if it's working I'm not touching it anyway so I can ignore it.
5,I like the way it was constructed. It look like it would last a lifetime
4,Good product
5,Exactly what I was looking for. Flat socket saved on space between furniture. Provides plenty of outlets.
4,Perfect condition and works the only thing I would like is if it came with something to attach it to a wall which obviously would cost more.
5,Hi have looked a long time to get a power strip with a long cord to reach across different areas of the house. This one fits the bill perfectly I think it’s a winner!
5,I like how many outlets there are on it but i hate the length of the cord
5,Hands down the best surge protector for the money.  It’s so hard to find flat plug surge protectors at a decent value.  GE products have always served me well. I have about ten of these surge protectors throughout my home and wouldn’t hesitate to purchase more if I need more.
5,Cord length is short sturdy  good value.
5,This power strip works as advertised. I bought this to plug into the powered wall in my bedroom which is otherwise covered by my bed which sits flush. The plug is low-profile enough to accomplish this and the cord length is just long enough to provide the necessary reach under the bed without being obstructive.
4,I recommend this product. Very good value for price
5,It’s an outlet expander. Nothing fancy here. I like the white color of it though; it’s bright.
5,I bought it to send to Africa. Looks great and packaged well.
5,Looking for something slim and not bulky this surge  protector is great and so compact
5,They’re pretty cheaply made but they do the job. I have noticed it can be sticky plugging some things in and needs a little force.
5,I liked it cause I could plug it behind my dresser with out having that big bulge in the back.
5,I like the cord. It looks nicer than most.
5,This product functions as intended material feels and looks cheap but the low price is worth it.
3,I had a power surge.  The protector would not work.  Thought it was broke but it just needed to be reset.  The gray reset button is on the side.  I did not see it at first.  Left a negative review but had to change it.
4,Quality wise plug is nice. What I did not like about it is the plug covers up the other outlet Or would not fit with another plug
5,This strip has been working without issue for a while now! Would buy again. However it only has two-prong outlets but it works for me.
5,I love this! The power strip seems well made and it’s also very low priced. I bought 3 of them and I use them every day!
3,This "flat plug" was not very effective as that it is still a bit bulky and the cord thickness makes it not very flexible and pliable. The cord length could have been a bit longer but that's my mistake for not measuring/ understanding well enough. I ended up buying another one for the space but can use this elsewhere no problem.
5,It is perfect for what I needed it for. I guess it would be perfect for traveling since it is not too bulky. The length of the cord is perfect for me.
5,Pulled it in as soon as i got it and it was in perfect condition and it was really nice packaging!
5,First of all thank you for putting the mounting holes in the correct direction! I'm still not understanding why people put the mounting holes going in the opposite direction on other power strips!
4,Seems a little bit cheaply made thought it would have a light on the switch for on and off and the switch is loose like it’s going to break .  The cord is extra extra heavy duty .  It will work and due for now.
5,Works like it should and flat plug hugs the wall.
5,I like the item. It works well and was economical.
5,I thought it was a 2pack
4,This cord is madd short the price is great but the super short cord makes me sad!
5,It works
5,bought it plugged it in and still using it today
5,Perfect fir my needs. Not too long or too bulky.  Fit my small area perfectly.
5,We needed a compact power strip to use with our tech center for charging our phones etc.  This sits on a very visible counter and we didn't want to see a long bulky cord and ugly power strip.  This product suited us nicely.  The flat plug and braided cord were a surprising bonus!
5,Perfect for protecting my WFH home office from our Covid-kittens who love to chew on cords!
5,Nice short cord and flat plug allows for it to fit behind furniture. I also like that it doesn’t have a flickering red light on/off switch
5,It's a surge protector.  Not sure what else you may be wondering but I can plug it into the wall and plug other things into it and surprise they are powered.  No frills but no complaints.  Does its job.
5,The surge protector plug doesn't stick out or cover the bottom outlet which is why I got it. It's perfect.
3,Standard cord.  Works as expected
5,First one they sent me didn't work so they sent me a replacement right away. That one works and has been working for several months now. Thank you
5,A multi-plug is just a multi-plug right? Idk they’re usually ugly and bulky though but this one looks fly. Got a short cord length that keeps tidy and i like how the plug lays flat against the wall.
5,This surge protector was perfect for my needs.  The color size and short cord is exactly what I was looking for to use in my office area.
5,This product was just what I was looking for. I needed to run an extension cord along my bathroom tile/ wall line so flexibility was very important. This fills the bill. Plug is flat but my one wish is that the plug was able to rotate but other than that it is a very good purchase
5,good quality
5,Fantastic product. I love the surge protector and how bulky the wiring is. I use this outlet with confidence. The shortness of this product is no joke.
5,This is exactly what I needed for a power strip behind my entertainment center. Nice and flush to the wall.
5,Only 600-ish joules.Sadly description said nothing.Oh well not worth returning for the price...just don’t use for higher end electronics
2,This item was supposed to be new but arrived really dirty. It has so much dirt on it the packaging is ripped and it looks like it’s been used. Pretty disappointing. Gross.
4,A good flat plug power strip. One thing to look out for is the fact the cord comes out at an angle down to the right. One spot I wanted to use it made this impossible.
5,THESE HELP MY FURNITURE TO SIT CLOSER TO THE WALL MAKING FOR A MORE ATTRACTIVE APPEARANCE
3,Notice in the picture that the cord on the flat plug end points down and the cord on the power strip end points up. However the mounting holes on the back of the power strip make the cord point down. This makes all the plug holes upside down. Not a big deal if you plug in a round plug. However if you plug in a flat plug or a power unit the cord will point up. Just careless design.
5,Lays flat short length and easy to hide.
5,This line of surge protectors look good have flat plugs and come in various lengths.  Love them and have bought many.
5,Works well
5,It does the job with no problems. What more could one ask? The power cord plug is a flat version which is really a nice feature
5,Great for getting into places a regular cord won't go.
5,Works great the flat head fits nicely behind the bookshelf
4,I needed  basic extention for electric items and this is what I received.  Nothing fancy work ok not 'pretty' nor does it have a light showings on/off condition. I got what i paid for.
5,Note that the cord was really short. I didn't pay attention when I bought it and I wish it was longer!
5,Excellent! Thank you. LORD Bless
5,This is a solid surge protector. We are using it for our treadmill and it works well.
5,I mean it's a surge protector right?What could be so special about it?But with its flat angled plug and braided cord this thing just looks cool
5,This Extension was just what I needed.  Has an on off switch. Love it.
5,This surge protector is perfect for fitting behind objects that are covering the wall outlet. The 90 degree plug is angled perfectly and allows for my freezer in the garage to sit close to the wall and its not pinching the cord.
5,I needed a power cord that was a surge protector and this works wonderfully it is still working even a year later.
5,This is a good and sturdy power strip. Good choice.
5,Perfect. Exactly what we needed for behind the bed.
4,GE stated that the 40532 surge protector had an indicator light “The surge protector has a protected indicator light which shows the protection components are working. “Either mine is defective or this is a miss quote on GE description.
2,The cord is really short and there is no switch to turn everything off so in order to shut things off you have to individually unplug them. Not ideal when you’re using this under a desk.
5,Price
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Feels sturdy/durable enough. Good price for money also flat plug is very decently thick to hide behind my furniture. All cables gone from my night stand. Same for my wife. Enough plugs to connect iPhone Apple Watch AirPods night lamp and speaker.
5,I love the flat plug.
5,Neatly fits on desk side. Color is perfect. Length is perfect.
5,I don't write many reviews but I really needed a flat power cord to fit in a cramped space and I didn't want to spend $15 at Home Depot for it. This cord is working very well and fits perfectly.
5,Great for what i needed. I needed an extension cord to go behind my bed for phone chargers and it worked perfectly. It allows my bed frame to sit as close to the wall as possible without scratching it while also giving room to plug things in.
5,Awesome product!
3,It came in the new packaging but the item looks clearly used. Gunk on the bottom side dust everywhere a stray hair scuff marks on the cord. If I didn't know better I would've thought someone pulled it out from behind their TV. Oh well at least it was cheap and will remain hidden behind some furniture. At least all the outlets work.
5,Excellent quality with surge protection built in. Nice flat angled plug and compact. Better price than many basic extension outlets.
5,Bought this for the entertainment center and the angled plug.  Our old one kept creeping out of the power outlet.  It only goes one way though which was the correct way for us.
5,If you need a super short cord to hide behind your T.V. This is the surge protector for you! If you don’t feel like reaching behind your T.V. And to the side of the surge protector to turn it on/off every time this isn’t the surge protector for you.
5,Definitely a high quality item at an affordable price
4,Arrived just as indicated. Very good product.
5,I am using it for my phonelift chair and lamp. works great
4,Not what I was expecting. There is an on/off switch on the side that is recessed. But it works.
5,It came on time and it works great.
5,Good power strip. I wish the cord went down instead of to the side though.
5,arrived quick as usual product works perfect
5,Worked out great short enough to work.
5,Love the white allows the cord to be less obvious.  Gives a more cleaner look.
5,Arrived quickly and it worked as expected. The black looks nice and doesn’t stand out.  I would recommend.
5,I bought this to replace one that I had for two years. I like the extended bit so I can plug my MacBook charger into without having to use the long extension. Works very well.
5,It does as expected.
5,Turns one outlet into five outlets four feet from the wall.
2,The strip doesn't actually lay flat against the floor because the cord points upward out of the plug and has to curve its way down to the floor.
5,Worked perfect to plug my game into
3,This works okay but you can't tell if the thing is on or off unless there's something plugged in to it that isn't running.  The on/off switch feels lose and cheaply made.  I'm thinking the "GE" that made this isn't THE GE that made most of my household appliances.
4,great charging station
4,Wanted a power strip for behind a desk with a short cord. Well made with firmly tight connector for plugs.
5,Great price with timely delivery.
4,ok
5,I would buy this again if I needed one.
5,Just what I needed
4,I liked the flat head that allowed me to use it with my desk in a tight space.
5,Works as it should no problems
5,I needed a more flush mount power strip and this fits the bill nicely!
4,It works
5,Perfect item!  Nice long 8 foot cord!
5,Great product!
5,Ya no lo envío 😃 me gustó mucho gracias
5,The only reason I bought these surge protectors is because of their flat plug design which has been a godsend for our bedroom that has plugs behind our bed.
5,It like it a lot
5,I love how it fits against the wall. We can push our dresser all the way back now. Awesome experience. Received it lightening fast
5,I have three of these now. They are great. Perfect for behind furniture.
5,Works exactly as described.
2,Doesn't allow our Sony BRAVIO TV to plug completely in any of the sockets. Other electrical items are OK.
3,Decent strip but… Does not stay upright and sockets too close together with a huge unused part.
5,low profile. Just what we needed to access the outlet behind furniture.
5,Quality is good. I wish the cord length would have been longer but I knew it was only 2' before I bought it.
5,Most strips have lights. I find them too bright for a bedroom. It's like having a nightlight. This strip is basic and NO light.
5,I use for an outlet directly behind my bed. This plug allows me to plug it in and still have my bed pushed all the way up against the wall. I highly recommend.
4,Good product
5,This is a good power strip and surge protector. My internet tech said so himself. Great product.
5,I really like this power strip. The Angled plug is a great feature for a plug that is behind a desk. Im very satisfied with it. Plus it comes with a surge warranty for my electronics so thats a nice plus
5,Very nice. Good quality I was impressed when it came. It works and is long enough to go behind my bed and come out the other side.
5,Great product
5,Great product - power switch is semi-hidden on the side but that also makes it hard to turn off by accident (like stepping on it as happens with other power strips where the switch is on the top).
5,just needed a longer cord and this one works fine.
5,Size we needed to reach plug in wall behind furniture and also to give us more plugs
5,it does the job.
5,Purchased this to use hidden behind appliances on our coffee bar.  Perfect length;  just long enough to get from the outlet to the counter with a little extra to get it tucked away.
5,So many times a power strip is needed but using it makes it necessary to place furniture further from the wall than wanted - problem is now solved.  With choice of color & cord length I'll be replacing many more power strips with flat plug power strips - PLUS they have surge protection.
5,Works great  no problems
5,Exactly what I needed
5,outlets themselves are snug--replaced my Belkin with this because the Belkin outlets were loose plugs were always falling out of them
5,Exactly what I needed in an extension cord.  The plug was flat for extra space and 6 spaces for plugs.
5,Works just fine
5,Works fine good price fast delivery!
5,Not a lot to write about it's a power strip. It has the flat face'd plug so it fits nicely behind my dresser and the cord is long enough to reach behind the TV stand in my bedroom. Cord is a good thick gauge and plastic seems to be good and sturdy.
5,This was just what I needed.  Love the flat plug.
5,I purchased an item from another listing that said "surge protector" in the description but it was actually just a power strip. This one has packaging to indicate it is a surge protector and it is name brand and UL certified.
5,Good quality. Seems very safe has not overloaded.
5,Works great
5,Great cord length love the flat against the wall plug.
5,This cord was well built  had a side connection for plug in this worked very well for using behind Couch and power cord not hitting back of couch.
5,Never take it traveling
5,The braided cord is not as much of an eyesore as a regular extension cord. Would buy again!
5,It does its job and im happy otherwise its a 1
5,Simple and clean design. Seems to work as described. Would buy again.
5,Works as expected.
5,What else can I say?
3,Plug lays flat but on an angle instead of vertical which messes with the outlet next to it (a four prong outlet). Also the cord is braided fabric not really practical for floor or kitchen countertop. Ok. Just not well designed. I like to say it was not designed by a 'woman'. We use these products around the house and know what can be kept clean easily what works well around appliances. Kind of disappointing this one.
5,More outlets being protected.
5,Buen producto.
5,A power strip perfect for narrow spaces such as behind a dresser (which is what I’m using it for) that efficiently serves its purpose.
5,BOUGHT FOR MY ELDERLY PARENTSPLUG IS FLAT SO IS EASY TO PLUG INTO FLOOR OUTLET
5,With the short cord this is my lead power cord for plugs in my power station box in my bathroom.  The usb piggybacks from it.
5,Perfect for what I needed. The cord length is 2 feet and is very durable.
5,I love it. I bought this for the fish tanks we have . The outlet is below the table the three tanks are on. The wire goes up mount directly behind tanks on wall.Looks great no wires hanging etc.  I will buy another for stereo set up.
5,I’ve had this product for a few months now and it handles the heavy load I put it through very well. Money well spent I definitely recommend!
3,Didn’t realize the plug part doesn’t rotate (can’t tell from photos or description); the cord is fixed at angle so if you need to plug to go a different direction it causes an issue.
5,I bought this specifically for the flatness of the plug area. Before I had a challenge putting furniture right against the wall. That is no longer an issue for me as with this product I am able to push furniture right against the wall without damaging the extension. A 5 star for me!
5,Would be nice is the connections were stable and flat.
4,I wish the cord was alittle longer but other than that it's a great product.
5,The cord was just right length for what I needed it for.
5,Exactly what I needed. It doesn’t not have an on/off switch but I knew that when I purchased.
4,Needed a flat plug to use it behind a desk. good value for money.
5,i like the braided nylon and black look. i needed to replace power strips and it was a nice opportunity to get something that was aesthetically pleasing as well as functional.
5,Fits perfectly for our girls’ bunk beds and all their gadgets. Sleek and functional.
4,It's a power strip so not a whole lot going on we'll see how it goes so far so good.
5,It works just fine👍🏼
4,No lite to see if the switch is in the on or off position.
5,It works and sits flat against the wall that's pretty much all I can say I feel that the price is a little high for only one if they may be charged $2 more and gave you two I think it would be a better buy.
3,Cord a little short. Otherwise works as expected.
5,Excellent! Thank you. LORD Bless
5,I was specifically looking for a short (2 ft.) corded 6 outlet power strip with a flat mount plug. This fit the bill perfectly.
5,Product as described.
5,Making  the other hookups  useful and helpful to engaging .
5,Great job. I love it.
5,Very durable product
5,Good quality and plug in fits perfect behind my couch.
4,This is a perfectly serviceable power strip but contrary to the title there is no USB charger on model 40532. It is simply a 6 outlet power strip with surge protection.
3,Plus is really thick.  Better to buy a flat plug model to fit behind furniture
5,Perfect for what we needed! A flat plug on a power strip! Well made and looks nice!
4,Does its job nothing fancy.
5,The surge protector does its job well and looks great.  The cord is pliable and lays much better than the traditional rubberized versions.  The switch is inconspicuous and difficult to accidentally hit.
5,This is going to work fine and the flexible cord is very nice.
5,Thumbs up
5,Works great!
3,I needed it for my phone chargers. However it’s a little short and randomly turns off which is weird. It doesn’t stay in place. And it feels super cheap..
5,I needed a power cord with a flat plug because it goes behind the bed and I don't want the bed 2 inches from the wall.  It's just as advertised and has worked just as expected.
5,Perfect size fits right under the cabinets.
1,This was the first surge protector I have ever seen with NO light indicators to show on/off no symbols of any kind no logo and just looked counterfeit. As an idiot I plugged in an adapter from my external hard drive and it fried it!  I could not believe that happened. I should have not ignored the red flags. I am really pissed about that and would sue if I could. This item is a fire hazard and should be taken off the market ASAP! Listen to these 1 Star reviews they will save you from a bad experience. I can't believe I didn't read the reviews on this one. I returned it as there could have been a more catastrophic result.
5,Nice long cord with a nice flat wall plug.
5,I wanted to organize the wires around my vanity table specifically for my garment steamer and makeup mirror and I didn't want anything on the floor. We mounted this to the wall underneath the table and the white power strip blends right in with my white walls!
5,Good product and price
5,High quality
5,Wish the plug head would turn. Cord only goes one direction from the outlet
5,exactly what I needed
5,Works fine
5,Great short power strip.
5,The 90 degree plug is absolutely perfect and doesn't block the other outlet.  Not much else to say other than it does what it is supposed to and is a great value.
5,I liked everything but the length could be a tiny bit longer
5,Works great and is sturdy
5,It’s a power cord. It provides power to the things you plug into it. It hasn’t burned my house down. What more could you possibly want?
5,Very basic and functional surge protector. The right angle plug comes in handy. Build quality is basic and the plastic looks cheap but still a good product
2,Buy a better one.
5,Takes up very little space and very easy to hide. A great buy for the price as well.
5,I love these flat plugs.  You can use them anywhere and not worry about bending the cord.
5,Works as can be expected. No issues.
4,Very good basic powers strips
3,Needed a 3ft surge protector with multiple plugs this item was the only one i can get before my internet installation appointment. Don't like this rigid cord hard to maneuver but all 5 plug works guess that is the important part.
4,The cord bends in a really awkward direction and is kind of stiff but other than that it's been working well
5,Great
5,Awesome in price and simplicity. Received mine the next day!
5,Perfect low profile power strip for what I needed. Adds plenty of outlets in a tight spot
5,It’s really good might have to buy a bigger one i have sooo many things to plug in but this works great
5,Great quality ... Quick delivery ... Item is outstanding ... Fantastic Transaction.....
5,Just what I needed for my bedroom.  I do not like any lights in my bedroom when I sleep.  This worked well.
5,Been through a few different brands of these and found this one to be not only the most reliable but affordable. Love the flat plug.
5,It's a power strip alright.
5,Works great! Love the flat plug
4,Good price with 6 ports
1,After using this item for 4+ months plugging it in and unplugging became hard to do and eventually bad contact was made and some of the plug-ins would not work. This item is put together very cheaply and is not made of a sustainable quality. I would not repurchase this product at any price.
5,Nice multi outlet surge. Great for a bedroom.
5,I bought many different kinds of power strip but the 90-degree design is the best.  Save space and can fit into tight places like behind the furniture or frig.
5,Works as can be expected. No issues.
2,Cord is shorter than I expected. Although the main issue was it can't have too many plugged in as the other devices won't work. My speakers won't work when my computer is plugged in. I tried with a different cord and it works. It must have a limited amount of electric supply it can take from the outlet. Moved it to bedside and just used it as an extension for my chargers for it to be useful as it can't power up devices at the same time.
5,Good
5,GE makes some great products.
5,Does exactly what it’s supposed to. Seems well made. So far so good!
5,Nice quality. Works well.
5,Works great
5,It made a great accessory for a charging station.
5,Love the flat outlet head doesn’t make furniture stick out.
5,Cord is a little stiff but in a sturdy good-quality way. Totally happy with this and it’s working as intended.
5,Just what I needed.
5,As far as few-feature power strips go this one does the job I expected. The flat plug was the real hero here as this strip was purchased to go in an outlet behind my couch. There isn't much else to say it's a low-feature power strip
5,Works great looks great no problems at all.
5,Good product. Worth the money.
5,Definitely flat and fits behind my couch. But due to the placement of the outlet I should have gotten a longer cord. Not a big deal.
5,Good product for the price.
5,This is a quality product at a price that is less than the ones I looked at in stores.
5,It works and has the perfect length of cord . Shazam
5,Works  great like the flat plug part as I can push furniture against it with no worries of damage to the cord
3,I thought that since this was a "fabric cord" it would be more flexible that a traditional power strip cord. It turns out to be a traditional stiff power cord with a fabric sleeve over it just to make it look pretty.
5,Good extender for a good price
2,I ordered the item and when it FINALLY arrived it arrived broken.
4,Works well for what I am using it for
5,Got this for my kids' bedroom length as described and like that it has no power indicator light.
4,Muy bueno
5,The cord is really sturdy and doesn't get tangled long enough that we can have multiple things plugged in and moved around the room if necessary.  Great power strip for the money!
5,As advertised
5,Great product! Especially for the price and protects perfectly against surges. If you need a surge protector this is a must buy.
3,2 of the outlets are very difficult to insert a plug into.
2,
5,Good price for solid product
5,Love the flat plug.
5,Was as described FLAT
5,Great!
5,Just as described. Glad I wasn't scared off by a few 1 star reviews
5,Wanted a power strip with a flat plug for behind the headboard was glad to find a GE and one with a longer cord.
5,Works
3,Thought it was all black. They dont mention the botttom is gray. Also was a bit pricey for just a surge protector. Bought it cause it was supposed to be all black ans have a flat head that connects to wall.
5,This power strip works great. The cord is plenty long enough. No complaints with this product
4,Works as expected
5,It is a good sturdy strip. The flat plug fits well. No issues at all. Will probably but another.
5,Love the flat end cord plug on this.  Just a basic surge protector with the flat plug.
5,Pretty simple - fits my needs perfectly. Seems well made and has an on/off switch which I wasn't anticipating. Full disclosure I didn't really read deeply into the product description. :-)
5,👌
5,Cord length was a major plus for me. Also the plug itself is flush with the wall so I was able to use the outlet behind my bed frame.
5,Good quality for the price. Wanted a flat plug that was thin on a 6 outlet power strip. There were thinner plugs out there but I couldn’t find one on a 6 outlet power strip.
5,Gave as a gift and it was well received.
5,As described at a great price
5,Shocked at the quality and high end packaging. Feels authentic but can’t be absolutely certain
5,Perfect for the tight space where needed. Seems to be good quality. So far so good!
5,Good power strip
5,Good quality
5,Love this!
5,Good value
5,It’s black so it’s a little more hidden. And it had plugs added bonus.
5,Perfect for my application in media room to power multiple components. Flat plug was a necessity behind storage cubes/ottoman. Has a thick cord that does not tangle. Very high quality.
5,I love the flat plug it makes the power strip easy to place behind furniture and not have it stick out awkwardly. :)
5,Used on our cruise. Made it easy to plug in several items at the same time. Could just flip the switch when we weren’t using the things plugged in. Perfect for a cruise.
5,Does its job. And does its job with dedication and pride. Inspirational really.
5,Nice surge protector
5,Just what I wanted.
4,Met our need
5,Works great so far. Love the flat plug that made it so I can put furniture against it
5,👌
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I didn't post my first purchase video yesterday thinking it was a fluke with the prongs being damaged. I received the replacement today and it is defective too! The internal wires are exposed! How can these be new??
5,We always get these power strips. Have 5 or 6 and had no problem so far.
5,Certainly works! I use every single plug it comes with and it works seamlessly!
5,wish the cord was a ittle longer is all
3,Good
5,Slim and work well.
5,Works great for behind furniture.
5,We needed a power strip up put behind some furniture that didn't have the big plug. This was just the right one to do the job.
5,looks good
5,Sleek minimalist and it works. Nothing fancy but I didn't want anything fancy so it's great.
5,Good quality cord it's the second one I've bought.
5,I needed a flat plug power bar for Christmas tree lights. Works just as I hoped!
5,This is by far the best one I have ever had.
5,Worked as described.
5,gives you room for furniture to be closer to wall
5,Is well made  sleek and connects our entertainment centerto a distant outlet .
5,Will buy again when I need another flat plug power strip.
3,The plug isn’t as flat as I was hoping but it’s ok.
5,I like the power strip. I bought it because it has the flush head so that I can push my bed into it without any damage.
5,As expected. Works like it should.
5,i needed a short cord to plug in the computer and stuff. perfect!
5,Well Made and durable.
5,It fits perfectly behind furniture. No more worries about broken cords.
2,It’s a surge protector without any kind of visual indication whether it is on or off - no light or even a label.  There is nothing “pro” about this device.  I have never seen a surge without a light in the past 20 years.  It’s going back to amazon for being a terrible design.
5,Perfect product no issues
5,Just needed a flush plug. This was the cheeper route
1,These over priced extension cords offer no indication off nor on which didn't matter because they let electricity power my computer and modem no matter which position the switch was in. The cords themselves the included instructions and a search on their website also showed nothing indicating which way to toggle on nor off. When I contacted them through email they responded pretty quickly (which is why they deserve one star) saying that the cords were defective and should be returned with the original receipt and copies of communication. I can't print the receipt because I don't have (nor need) a printer and I can't print"all records" of the emails because it was through their website which didn't offer a way to print my communication. I don't want any consumer to buy and start using these without knowing they will not protect their electronics.
5,Just a good solid extension cord made by GE nice that it doesn't have a glowing power button!
5,Just what I needed
5,Does it’s job. I used this one because the outlet was behind a dresser and I needed a flat plug
5,Good product
4,These are all alike. The cord is not terribly flexible.
5,Good to plug behind  Furniture
5,Works great!
1,This would be a good power strip except for the design of the plug. When it is plugged in the power cord--which is quite thick- doesn't come out of the bottom. It curves at 45 degrees to the right. If that's what you need fine. I wanted to plug this into a 6-outlet plug that had its outlets on the side. I literally could not plug this in where I wanted. The power cord hit the wall. Since my outlet was behind a 6' bookshelf filled with books and fragile bottles on the bottom shelf moving it was not easy.  I have no idea what goofy bird decided to make this plug asymmetrical. Even in an ordinary plug you would lose about 6" of cord if you had to curve it around to the left. The cord should have gone straight down or the plug should have been adjustable so it could be turned in the desired direction.
5,Solid product. Vertically Mountable not Tamper proof if you really care.
5,Why are all plugs not like this? Would recommend.
5,Simple seems to be good build quality NO LED is amazing and the reassessed side switch is a major plus!
5,this is great for our conference room but I got one for the house and one for my IT portable bag. It is durable and does exactly what you expect. Thanks!
5,The reason I choose this item is because I can use my appliances charge my phone and laptop at the same time.
5,I bought it beside it has a flat plug it works.
4,It is a power strip
5,I will be purchasing 4 more of these. Great deal
5,Been using this for over a month now and it’s working good ! We have space heater  humidifier and phone charger attached to it with no issues.
5,Works perfectly and looks discreet. We bought two!
3,I thought that 2 ft would work for what I needed it for but it did not. This size will only work if you literally just need more sockets right next to the wall socket.
4,Good price for a good power strip
5,Excellent quality surprised it was such a good price!
5,Great for behind the dresser so we can push everything closer to the wall. Just what we needed to hide the cords but still be efficient!
5,Best way to go when you have more than two.
5,It has a 90° plug that works perfectly
1,Plugged it in and added 2 cords to it...both items don't even turn on.  Wanted to get a cheap surge protector and got one that doesn't work.
5,Perfect size for next to my bed and lays flat behind my headboard.
5,Not alot to say....quality power strip that exceeded my expectations
5,👍
5,Great Item
5,It works.Also no annoying switch light which is nice since I like it very dark at night.
5,Good quality
4,no tiene conexiones a USB deberian rectificar la descripcion
5,Fit flush behind my couch which is flat to the wall. Low profile is perfect and makes it in detectable.
5,The flat connection is very useful for tight spaces.I would like to have all my power strips with this same style.
4,No light telling it’s on otherwise works fine
5,the wire if SUPER strong and it's lightweight which makes it extremely easy to hang up it works perfectly.
5,Love the flat plug so my furniture sits more flush to the wall!
5,We used this surge protector for our kitchen counter. Cord length is just right plugs are sturdy and well made. Feels like quality.
5,Pretty cheap (meaning inexpensive) considering that it comes in a pack of two.
5,Cord a bit short but overall good quality. Works great.
5,We ended up buying multiple it’s so nice to regain the floor space and be able to push the furniture flush to the wall.
5,I ordered the power strip too short but am making do
5,Good quality and color.
5,Fits my needs and functions. Had a lightening storm today with a power surge...worked like a champ my TV isn't fried!
5,Did exactly what I needed it to. Keep more cords organized with a flat plug to fit flush behind my bed.
5,Great for under table cord mess hiding
5,Just what I ordered works great.
5,Doing it's job.  Needed a slim body and a small cord to add to our bathroom outlet.  Works great so far.
5,Works just as described and was exactly what I was looking for
3,The cord on mine was NOT 2 feet long. Returning the item. Other than that it seems like good quality
3,The plug is not flat. It still sticks out over an inch from the outlet. Was hoping for something slimmer.
5,No complains as the extension cord is exactly as described.Arrived on time and in perfect condition.
2,For the size of the plugs you are given the cord is not nearly long enough and makes it a chore to try to connect anything when you are trying to hook it up to a plug in a difficult location. Don't even buy this- get a longer version!
1,The slightest...and I mean slightest touch or nudge would cause the switch to flip and shut off this surge protector. At first i thought maybe it’s my outlet. It did it in every outlet in my house. Just to prove a point I took it to work and tried it there as well with the same issue. Tired of waking up in the middle of the night because the power was cut to my cpap machine because the cat jumped on the bed and nudged the surge protector I dumped this piece of junk in the trash.
5,It serves it's perpose well. The flat wall plug is perfect for being able to push furnitue completely against the wall
5,Flat plug minimalist design inexpensive. Pretty much exactly what a power strip should be.
5,Great price for a good surge protector/power strip.
5,Perfect for what we needed! It is made of good quality material.
5,It's been working well. The plug is sleek and quite flat. The materials used feel premium and I expect them to last.
4,Works just as expected
5,Awesome flushed and doesn't stick out like the others..
5,Loved it exactly what I wanted!
5,Perfect for all items requiring connection.
2,The surge protection doesn't work. It worked great for a long time but that was because there hadn't been a close enough lighting strike to test it yet. My Wii and my wifi router got fried this morning because of a power surge.
5,The cord did it’s job.
5,Good deal
5,This is my 2nd time purchasing this power cord. It's a great buy.
5,Worked great! Just what I was looking for
5,This arrived and I got just what I expected. It's very solid and good quality worth the fifteen dollars.
4,Awesome 90 degree plug.
5,It works. Seems fine. I like that it doesn’t have a light.
5,Flat plug awesomeness and very practical.
3,Adequate but pretty light duty switch
5,Item is nice and low profile fits perfect under/behind my IKEA BESTA TV unit!
5,The surge protector has worked very well and product was as described. Good price too.
5,There is not much to talk about this Surge protection Strip...It works as it meant to be so far
5,Works great no problems
5,Solid GE product
5,Great price for a durable cord
5,What can I say other than it's awesome and just what i needed.  No more bulky plugs behind the Desk.
5,Worked perfect to use behind a desk
5,It works... Not much else to say
5,👍🏻
5,Perfect cord--flat and angled. Good price!
5,The power strip works and plugged in to the wall. Looking forward to using you all again.
4,Doesn’t have USB ports as advertised
2,This power strip is just okay. I purchased a couple other strips a few months earlier that where Amazon Basics brand that where much nicer I'd recommend those over this GE power strip.
5,I don't know why anyone makes a surge protector without a flat plug anymore. GE brand can't go wrong.
5,Fit behind a cabinet very well
5,Just what I needed for additional outlets.
5,It's strong and durable. Plus the power toggle switch is much more convenient on the side.
5,Great quality!
3,Turns off while I'm doing computer work and I have to restart it. Cord is short and bulky.
5,Perfect for everyday use.
5,Works so far
5,Works well and I haven't had any issues with it since I purchased it.
5,Yep. It’s a cord
5,Bought this because the plug is flat so my bed doesnt bend it out of the wall
5,Just as described!
2,These strips work ok The plugs don't line up well and I have to work with each plug every time I plug something in. Just made too cheaply.
5,The low profile outlet is perfect for squeezing between my desk and the wall.
5,Great product. Works awesome behind furniture
5,great price compare to others love the color too!
2,3The cord itself is only 29.5”. I was expecting it to be 3 ft. The whole thing including the power strip and the plug is 40”. I don’t know what the point of describing it as 36”. I needed 3 ft cord so this did not work for my project. I’ll find some other place to put it. I haven’t yet.
5,Needed a surge protector with a flat plug to for behind a desk this works great.
5,Love the flat style.  You can plug in behind furniture and don’t have to leave as much clearance.
5,This works as expected !!
5,You cannot have too many outlets on vacation and this covered us well.
5,Just what I needed
2,I too found that 2 of the 6 outlets would not accept a plug (no matter how hard I forced).  Fortunately I only needed 4 outlets so I decided to keep the item rather than bother to return it.  Overall it does feel somewhat cheaply manufactured.  It does however work as expected for the purpose for which it was purchased.
5,It great long and fit small places.
3,One of the plugs messed up from the inside within a month with light use
5,It does what a power strip should do.
2,Flimsy. Size of the plug is hard to take in and out of wall outlet. Angle of the flat plug is not taking into account of the fact that some wall outlets are installed sideways.
5,Good product
5,Love length.  Also will not buy outlets without flat plug which this has.
5,Nice sleek design.
5,I should buy more flat plugs like this. Space saver and can put behind furniture
5,Exactly as pictured.
1,Bought this outlet a while ago and had been using it for my coffee corner. Until lately one day I smelled some smoke and found this outlet itself is burning inside and the plastic cover has bended!! Can’t imagine what could have happened if nobody was home that day
5,So far so good!
5,Very durable and good for the price
1,Bought a few of these and had problems with every one of them. You could use a plugin in one spot but you couldn't fit any other plug ins if you had one in already a it would shift the rest of them of them out of place. Totally defeats the purpose of buying a surge protector with 6 plugins when you can only use one of them.  And half the time it wouldn't turn on.  Don't waste your money.
5,Good product
2,I like the woven cord but the plastic is cheap and the design is weak.  If you want to mount the surge protector vertically the plugs are upside down from m\y perspectvie and this is especially problematic if you are plugging in adapters..  My bad for not studying the picture better. The design would be much better if the plugs were turned 90 degrees to accommodate adapters better.
5,Exactly what I needed.
5,Great product fits behind my couch with out damaging the leather.
5,Perfect bend at the socket. Fits nicely where I needed it to
2,This power strip's power switch is neither lighted or marked in any way to indicate when power is switched ON or OFF.
5,Does well what it supposed to do
2,This item was very scuffed up.  I cannot use it where I intended because it would be visible.  I choose this cord because it was flat and looked nice.  Very disappointed!
5,Low profile  plug a good fit behind bookcase.
5,Works great
5,Exactly what they say they are.
5,Simple works great
5,Good quality product. Local stores offer cheap junk without the flat plug.
5,Gets the job done
5,seems good quality works well
5,This product worked as stated and is made if great quality.
1,Loved the fact of size fit and outlet count.  Was excited about the color and styling.  However the outlet failed to be explained properly found no reviews to indicate it would not work for some use cases and until putting into use I didn't know it would not work for my case (small pet water fountain small ink jet printer occasional use Keurig).  I CANNOT RECOMMEND for anything shy of phone and tablet charging!  Nothing and I mean NOTHING else works on this strip!Coffee pot - Nope!printer by itself - Nope!Portable battery for phone/tablet- Nope!Phone charge - yepTablet charge - yepUSELESS - yepWhat a waste of money.
5,works great.  the design lets you push your cabinets close to the wall
5,Works exactly as needed
5,Love this power strip. Very good for going behind furniture.
5,works good
5,Very high-quality product delivered quickly to my home. Thank you so much!
3,I was looking for a surge protector to use for multi-outlets and this was perfect.
5,Exactly as described. Feels high quality compared to no name strips.
5,Good
5,Awesome
5,What you see is what you get type of item. It performs better than the companies stock...
5,Perfect nice long chord
1,device did not give an output power it looked new didnt have anything wrong with the switch or anything. my guees it was just cheap! would not buy again
5,Cant go wrong with GE.
5,Love this product
5,Perfect. Sturdy. Strong.
5,Perfect cord length for location where I need it.
5,Exactly as described works well.
5,Nothing fancy but appears to be a good product for a reasonable price.
5,Works great item as described. No complaints.
5,Perfect
5,So far so good.
5,Ok
5,Perfect!!!!
5,This is exactly what I ordered and will be put to use.
2,The outlets are to close together. The outlets are upside down when hanging. You can't add wide plugs if you do you will lose a outlet. I didn't study the picture not very useful in my opinion.
5,It's nice
5,Good
5,Perfect option to connect multiple electronics to a outlet behind a furniture.
5,Great! Just as advertised.
5,Works as expected. Not much else to say.
5,Works great for my needs
1,Cheap material and only one outlet allowed the plug to go in all the way. I could even force the others to go in all the way.
5,Does greatNo issues!
5,I'm very happy with my cord. It's perfect!
1,Bought twoNeither worked
2,Pretty much like any other power strip. The cord is too stiff. I thought that since this was a fabric covered cord that it would be considerably more flexible. It is not. It's the same old cord used on every other power strip with a woven fabric cover on it.
1,I purchased this thinking I was going to get a quality brand new product. I have also been quite loyal to GE products as they have always done well for me. More specifically I was looking for a flat plug to go behind a bed. I’m not even going to open the package and find out if this works or not. This is scratched scuffed and dirty. I will be turning this product immediately.
5,What a great surge protector!
1,Charred and burnt literally after one year of use. Photo taken Nov 2021 bought in Oct 2020. Photo shows melting blackening and cracking on the plug luckily caught before caused more damage. Left my outlet looking about the same. 👎 Move on dont buy. Save yourself the trouble and worry buy a nicer one.
5,Basic but works.
1,Missed the boat on this one GE. Plugs too close together. Could use a USB socket or 2 and how about the wire not be exposed? Also whats the deal with all the empty black space - I am thinking that is exactly where the USB could go. Anyways the length was perfect I must say. I need something to tuck behind a desk. I have 6 things that need to be plugged in and there is no way around it. (Cell phone charger lamp Computer cord Router Modem and Garage Door thingy).  ;)  Hopefully next design will be a bit better. Back it goes!
5,Love that it has a flat head for the plug
5,Just what I needed
1,The point of a flat plug on a surge protector is to be able to push up furniture against it. These are NOT FLAT. They might just out just as much as a normal plug. On top of that the "flat" piece does not rotate so it's stuck in one direction. As if that couldn't get more irritating the cord is also not flexible at all. Not even a little. So try weaving these anywhere and you'll be granted lots of frustration. These would only be useful for one alignment of outlet and even then they are so rigid.Pay more for something better. These are absolute garbage.
5,A nice surge suppressor
5,It does what it said it would do.
5,Great product
5,Clean simple design and works well!
5,Exactly what I needed fits perfectly.
5,Great
5,Works good
5,Good product.
5,Works as expected.  Good quality.
5,Just what I wanted
5,Perfecto
5,Works great
5,Great product. Simple. Does what it promises.
3,Some of the outlets feel kind of “loose” when you plug something up.
1,Got this GE surge protector today and the switch on it did not work. Now I have to go through all the hassle of returning it! I recommend keep looking!
5,Works perfect for what I needed.
5,also being black it hides well in the darker areas.
5,Love the flat plug.
5,It is what it is
1,I bought this last April but have only been using it for about 3 months and it stopped working. I have another one from a different brand and have been using it for over a year it’s fine. Won’t buy again
5,Sturdy & good quality
5,*
1,You wouldn't think you would have to check a power strip to make sure it had an on/off switch and light. It is an essential part of what a power strip is. Thus you may push the switch to the  "off" position and prevent electric current from reaching any of the devices which are attached to the power strip. And the absence of light emitted from the current indicator informs you as such. This item does not have a switch or light. Must have a new crop of brilliant engineers over at G. E.
3,I've purchased flatter to the wall power strip. Works fine tho.
5,Works exactly as intended
5,Good product
5,Good buy
5,Exactly what we needed!
5,Work well
2,Like the flat plug at the end of the cord and the short cord options but one out of the two strips I ordered had defective outlets (2 of the 6 would not take plugs that work fine everywhere else).
5,The brand.
5,alright
5,It’s a power strip.
5,Product as expected
5,It's fine - no issues
1,Just horrible they sending you an item without even checking if it's working I wasted my time by thinking it's my other items are broken then I realized this 2 is completely trash. Would have been nice for them to check first before sending so customers don't waste their times to send them back then wait for the money so on and so on horrible
5,Great
5,Exactly what I need.
5,Works well good purchase.
2,After 6 month toggle it off and... Never turned back on.
5,good product
5,Flat against the wall
1,I bought this to use for cords connected to a white surge protector so that that the color wouldn’t stand out so much.  I waited a few months before I hooked it up which is my fault because this protector is garbage and I can’t get my money back or exchange.
3,Not very sturdy. No light to let you know it’s on.
5,As expected
5,Excellent
5,What I expected.
1,It lasted exactly 2 months to the day go figure almost cost me an entire crop it decided that on a 29 degree night it was going to shut off my grow lights well within the ratings pullled the pile of deuce apart and the horrible little capacitor in it went belly up no surges no expiring events I have a monster power center next to it and not a hiccup from that. Just low quality happy meals internals too bad as I trusted GE.
5,Perfect fit
5,It’s definitely flush
5,Works perfectly!
5,Nice and flat.
5,Good
5,What I needed
5,It’s a power strip
5,Great
5,Worksgreat
5,Good short surge suppressor.
5,Love the flat plug!
1,My TV no longer works after a nearby lighting strike. The protector was only a few months old.Other products in the house were protected by different products that were tripped during the storm and still work.Amazons response was they were sorry the product didn’t work but there was nothing they could do about the tv. Very disappointed as the tv is less than 2 years old.I would give 0 starts if it would let me.
5,good
1,DO NOT ORDER - NOT GE QUALITY - I ordered a 6' and a 3'. These is nothing indicating "on" or "off" and the directions are no help. No matter which way the switches were set power was going to my equipment. I emailed customer service they said the cords were defective and that I should return them with the receipt. Guess what I didn't get? Yep. A receipt.
2,One of the recepticles isn’t good - doesn’t accept the plug. I hoped a GE product to prove that America is big again... as it looks they may still need to learn from the Japanese... ;)
1,Stopped working after just 2 weeks of use. Only Two of the 6 outlets were in use at the time with everyday items. Poor.
5,Perfect for tight spaces
5,As expected
5,Works well
1,Installed behind some drawers to plug in countertop appliances. Stupid thing doesn’t work and I’m outside my return window.
1,It caused a surge and ruined my electronics!
5,🔵😊👍👍👍😊🔵
1,I've had this for about 6 months first it kept needing to be rest constantly and now it stop working all together.
2,You basically have to use your entire body weight to plug anything into the thing. Should be listed more as a workout product than an electrical accessory
2,Not enough spacing between sockets. As good as having just 3.
5,I love it. Great value
1,The product doesn't work. I plugged it into multiple different outlets and tried to plug in multiple different products and none of them would turn on. It doesn't make sense to ship back a $10 item so this was a waste of time and money.
1,What a piece of crap! I bought because of the GE name unknowing its was licensed to a crappy Chinese manufacturer.It takes a lot of effort yo insert the “tangs” of the plug into the slots and am unable to get dome to work. Will be returning!
1,Ordered 2 at different times trying to get white but only the part with the sockets is white. The cord is a dingy off-white yellowish dirty color. If the cord is going to be visible I would not purchase.
1,Absolutely terrible quality. Won’t work
1,Right out of the box you could hear something rattling around inside the unit.  Plugs would only go in to the outlets partially and resisted being fully seated.  This is a complete piece of junk and I returned it immediately.  GE should be ashamed to license their name to whoever makes this.
2,Ordered 2. One of them had something loose rattling around -- not something I would trust with electrical appliances!
1,I bought two of these to setup my desk for WAH and the both came used. They were both scratched up and the twist ties were obviously reused.
1,This product looked great and worked well for a month or two...today I went to use it again and poof...it no longer works.  I've tried everything and it's a 'no go'.  Thought it was a good value when I purchased it but not for 2 months use.
1,Ordered 2. 1 works great 👍. 1 came with a lose something inside rattling around. Within 3 weeks died. Return window closed. Garbage can it goes.Check em right as you get em. If they rattle send em back mine worked for a few weeks.
1,One of the plugs stopped working after 5 months of use.  Used for my TV and related equipment.  Wouldn’t buy this again due to poor quality.
1,The only reason I ordered this was for the flat wall part and it didn’t even have that feature when it arrived. Terrible job all around.
1,Worked two days and then just stopped. I checked if there is a short circuit problem or GFCI problem but there was nothing. Returned it right away and don’t recommend it.
1,It didn’t work at all  have to return it
1,This power strip is not safe if you tap it the strip will shut off cheaply made product
1,This strip has no light to indicate it is being protected. I is advertised as having an indicator light. I emailed company and they said it was an error and would correct description. How do I know if it is still protected?
1,Two of the outlets completely unusable.  Couldn't even force in the plug if i wanted to.  Even if i could I would not have felt safe leaving it in.
1,Very disappointed the return window is passed. Only had the power surge for 2 months and it suddenly stopped working when only using 2 of the 6 outlets..
1,Was very unhappy as the outlets didn’t work at all. I thought I had an electrical problem and plugged it in to many sockets. Had to return the product.
1,Frustrated. This product is made by some random company called Jasco. But they licensed the GE name.
1,This thing barely worked. I plugged in some LED lights to it...literally three LED lights and they barely worked. Not sure what is wrong with it.
1,Did not work out of the box. Not worth dealing with a return at this price point.
1,This overheated and melted in my outlet. I used only a few times an hr at a time. I kept it turned off otherwise.
1,Power cord was defective and did not work. I had to get a new one at a hardware store and it worked just fine.
1,So the little metal things inside the holes have moved around and now three prongs are useless as you cant get the plug in.  I've only had this a short while and it already broken. Cheaply made. Look elsewhere.
1,One of the 6 outlets does not work. Return window had closed before we installed this strip. No response from GE email support.
1,Seriously someone pulled this put of their plug in and sent it to us. This is ridiculous. Clearly not even the same product and it is dirty! Looks like someone opened the box and replaced.
1,You get a flimsy power strip that barely allows the plugs to fit properly. The on/off power switch on the side nearly broke when I pressed it. Spend some more money and you'll hopefully get something more sturdy.
1,Stopped working after just a few hours
1,Poor Quality. I bought a name brand thinking I would be getting a good quality product and it was very cheap and very chintzy. I never used it because I was worried about it being safe.
1,The item was too small & it didn't work. I didn't return it in time
1,the outlets on this power strip are very difficult to plug in to. also they only engage the plug about 3/16". that is a very poor and weak connection. I won't risk the fire hazard and returned the power strips for a refund.
1,This is an object that needs to do only one thing: fit plugs. And it doesn't. They constantly fall out you can't fully jam them in. Very poor manufacturing no wonder they only sell online.
1,I bought two of these and both of them give me a very hard time while trying to plug plugs into them. Not happy but waited too long to request a return.
1,The cord is so stiff when you plug it in the outlets are upside down.😕
1,Poor quality I was expecting more than what I got. This item looked like it came from the dollar tree.
1,It only works when turned sideways. That is not a sufficient level of function.
1,I opened it and didn’t work at all; big waste of money
1,No charge coming from this outlet. Wasted money.
1,Plugs turned such that one electronics adapter takes up half the power strip.  Sure it's inexpensive relative to other choices. But who makes such a stupid design decision
1,The cord when positioned a certain way does not power the outlets on the strip. I assume it’s a manufacturing error. Regardless I paid for a power strip which does not work
1,The cord is so short this is practically useless.
1,One of the prongs were bent the were what appeared to be small burn marks in 3 places. Scared to plug it up. Returned it.
1,I ordered the white surge protector and received an almost beige surge protector. It looks nothing like the picture. Also as others have said it isn’t made by GE.
1,Broke within 3 months DO NOT BUY
1,Completely disappointed and not what was needed. Product came timely but not in fact a surge protector and not able to use for intended use. Such a waste
1,Good
1,Liked the plug but the power strip is cheapily made.
1,It broke after 3 months. It does not come with a warranty and I can not return it. Its in the garbage. Not even made by GE. Lame.
1,I ordered this in mid/late June and now it’s the first week of September and it no longer works.
1,Poor quality didn't work properly
1,it didn’t work from the start
1,It broke almost immediately.
1,Cheaply made! It’s just past the return window. And we’ve noticed they shut off if wiggled. And these are supposedly a GE product?
1,Hums and clicks after 3 months. I think there is a short.
1,My package was delivered opened. Sometimes opened my package
1,We ended up tossing it in the trash. wasn't even worth trying to get our money back. it's cheap cause it's cheap. find a better brand.
1,Don't buy it. It just didn't work
1,I purchased 2 of these one works as expected and the other one did not...gonna open it up and see if I can find the issue...
1,I keep this plugged into my wall. One day it just randomly stopped working and is completely useless now.
1,Just received it today and found the plug pin got seriously bent. Are you kidding?
1,This power strip is cheap and now it's dead in less than 3 months!
1,Didn't use right away and once I plugged it in it didn't work and I was unable to return or get replacement
1,Nothing would turn on when plugged in didn't matter which way the flip switch was.
1,Plugged it into a working outlet and did not work.
1,Plugged it in did not work. Checked all outlets and tried with various plugs.
1,Trash.  Nothing plugs in all the way it’s made cheaply.
1,Cord placement coming out of plug made this useless for my purpose. Might work for others.
1,Don't work
1,One of the plugs doesn’t work poor quality don’t buy it.
1,What a waste. Ordered this because it was a flat plug what arrived was not flat.
1,This power strip is cheaply made. It shorts out.
1,Dead out of the box.  And didn't test it until the return window was closed.
1,Cannot tell by looking at it if it’s on or off. No light.
1,I had this since April 12st and it already broke but I didn't even us it till 2 weeks ago
1,Died after 1 month
1,One power surge and it's not resetable. It's trash.No value here...
1,Stopped working
1,Terrible item you have to force plugs into them not safe
1,Did not work no power. I think the switch was faulty.
1,Stopped working after two weeks
1,Arrived used/dirty
1,Be careful - one of the sizes is not flat plug
4,This is a good basic surge protector with 6 outlets. GE claims that this has a "power filter" that "provides a cleaner sound and picture experience". I don't have an oscilloscope to test this claim but I'm skeptical that there's any circuitry in this compact power strip that could make much of a difference to the cleanliness of the power. Another claim on the back of the box is that it has "Automatic shutdown technology" that "stops power to devices when surge protection expires". I don't really know what this means. Does it mean at some point in the future the power strip will be useless because the surge protection has "expired"? Or does it just mean that you have to reset the unit if there is a surge? I have no idea.The best thing about this is the low-profile plug that can fit into an outlet behind a sofa for example without sticking out very far from the wall. The plug is about 3/4" deep without the prongs.If you're looking for a good basic surge protector this seems like a fine choice. It doesn't have any bells and whistles like a status indicator LED or rotating plug but it does its job.This is branded with the GE logo but it's made under license for GE by Jasco. It is of course made in China.
1,cord is much too short
1,Trash
1,not so flat
1,Outlets are flimsy
4,In general I like this surge protector.  Its flat plug hugs the wall as much as possible leading the cord away and down from the outlet and the surge protector/power outlet portion lies as it should on the floor.  The only drawbacks are that the three-pronged flat plug is uni-directional — that is you can’t adjust the direction that the cable lies — and the outlets are a little too closely placed to take power packs without blocking one or more of the other outlets.  If you have only regular plugs you should be fine.Of course until you have a power surge you can’t be sure that a surge protector will actually protect the electronics plugged into it.  For that reason I always try to purchase a known brand instead of cheaping out on something that I’ve never heard of before.  I trust GE based on past experience.— Debbie Lee Wesselmann
4,There’s not a whole lot to say about this surge protector. It’s compact the on/off button is on the side the cord is 4 ft long which is fine for situations where you just need extra outlets rather than needing the extra reach and very conveniently the plug is flat so that you can put this behind furniture without it sticking out too much. It’s nice that there is a damage protection warranty although I’ve never actually used one of these and don’t know how many hoops they will make you jump through if you file a claim. I took one star off because the product description on Amazon states that it has an indicator light but the one i received doesn’t seem to have one unless it’s meant to turn on when the surge suppressor function has been activated.
4,This review is for the 6 outlet model. It’s a basic but good surge protector. The plug is “flat” compared to a regular surge protector and while it’s still a bit on the bulky side it’s much easier to plug into outlets behind furniture. The cord is on the right side of the plug so it needs to be looped under the plug if you need the surge protector to come out on the left side of furniture.The picture is of the power switch. I did not even know it had a power switch until it arrived. It’s a pretty basic switch there is no light to tell if it’s on or off just a raised plastic bump on the ‘on’ side of the switch.
4,Even with six outlets this surge protector is very compact and small. The one I have does not have any USB ports. It can accommodate six small plugs but if it is one of those block chargers that will block another outlet. Because it is so compact it also serves as a travel surge protector. Of course you don’t know the protection performance until you get a surge and I have not had that in the small testing period. As of now at  $13 it is reasonably priced.
5,Come in multiple lengths....Color was  what I was looking for!!
5,I liked the ease of installing onto a wall and the number of outlets for it’s use was sufficient.
4,This is a basic strip surge protector. It has 6 outlets. There's no USB outlets on it. It also does not have an on and off switch like some of the protectors do. The cord is longer than some of the others that I own. This makes it nice if you need to plug it in behind a piece of furniture and still have access to the outlets. It works well.
5,Works
5,I have a lot of electronic equipment and the GE Power Strip Surge Protector is exactly what I needed.  I particularly love that it has USB ports for quick charging!  Love that feature!  And this surge protector comes with a 4 foot long cord which makes it even better to use and can move a little bit aways from the wall.  I already have it plugged in and using it but most of all I really like the USB ports on the protector.  Great feature!
5,I live in the Tampa region of Florida where we received more lightning strikes than anywhere else on earth over the course of a year.  As such it is absolutely vital to have good surge protection on all electronic items in the house.  This particular surge protector offered great functionality and durability for the money.  It has done its job well and kept my devices protected even during several power outages over the last two years.  Highly recommended!
5,Ok
5,Not a whole lot to comment on.  This one is well-built and a good value for the money.  Happy to find one in black.  The cord ended up being a bit short for our needs but that isn't a fault of the manufacturer.
5,This is a nice basic and reliable surge protector. It is compact and fits really well in my desk area where a bulkier strip would not work due to the shape of my desk. I like the flat profile plug too as it allows me to get closer to the wall. Overall I am pleased with this product.
5,GE surge protector that seems quality made. Heavy and thick cord. Works great. I like the flat plug so that it can go behind furniture easier. I do not like that there is no indicator light that it is getting power. There is an on/off switch.
5,I'm currently writing this while sitting at my computer. That computer is plugged into this very power strip. It's working well so far. No issues or problems. We even had a power outage the other day and when the power came back on everything with my computer was fine! I'll credit this at least partially for that. Plus it's always good to have a few extra outlets!
5,I use this to power everything on my bedside table.  The flat plug works behind the bed without needing th embed to be pulled away from the wall.  It Works  as expected and is a good value for the money.
5,Very basic strip no USB ports or fancy lights telling you if the outlet you plugged into is grounded just an old fashioned strip. There is no way for me to test if it really stops on a surge but it seems a simple fuse mechanism and that's good enough.
5,I use a lot of power strips and they range from so so to high quality. This one falls somewhere in the middle to high quality. I especially appreciate the flat plug it really makes life easier when you have an outlet behind a piece of furniture. Stock up
5,Works great. We needed something with a flat plug that could fit behind a desk that was close and flush to a wall and this did the job. Otherwise it's a pretty standard power strip/surge protector but it get the job done.
5,Seems like it works well but as I cannot force a surge I can't really test it though as it's from GE I'm assuming its high quality. Nothing outwardly wrong with it.
5,Very thin a simple. No extra ports power strip.  I never use those hook ups for phone or internet or coaxial cable.
3,This is a standard surge protector / 6 outlet strip. Slim and sturdy. Flat plug fits easily behind furniture. We are using it for our router & modem. We have had no issues thus far since putting it into use in June.The version we received does not have the USB ports - so if that's what you want be sure to look for it when ordering.My husband notes: “Surge protector” is a marketing term most people have little understanding of. It’s not the same as “lightning protection” so be sure to educate yourself on the difference if you are looking for protection from this type of hazard. Consumer grade surge protectors generally do not provide lightning protection they simply provide an enhanced layer of protection against the minor variations in your house current that result from activities and flaws along the power company’s distribution network. Lightning protection is a whole other class of insurance and very expensive compared to “surge” protection.I would expect to pay around the current price of $13.
4,Really like this.  Streamline and effective. The flat plug is nice to fit in tight spaces.  Also states has a $100000 equipment guarantee per the packet.  Made in China.
3,why does the description say protect your electronics and charge your portable devices? This item doesn't have USB ports just regular 110 which need "wall warts" or "bricks" to get the voltage down to 12v. these things take up room and this is just a normal run-of-the-mill power strip. no extra spacing between outlets. no special outlets. nothing special really except for the description which apparently allows them to charge more for it. Save your money and just buy an "amazon basics" power stip - or SPLURGE and get one that actually has USB ports.
1,The power strip is really low quality. It would be worth spending the extra couple of dollars to get the Belkin power strip!
3,It's a power strip....Decent length cord but I hate that most power strips plug holes are so close together. Even though there are 6 you can really only use 3. It's 3 plugs I didn't have before so I'll take it and it's not too expensive but if I were paying full price I would probably opt for the more expensive ones that are set up better.
3,This product works well enough.  The flat plug makes it less obtrusive.  Theres not much else to say its your typical relatively inexpensive power strip.If I were to be picky I would look for one with spaced out outlets and outlets flipped 90 degrees for those larger wall warts.
2,DANGEROUS CATCH FIRE
1,Deceptive title indicates the cord is 15 feet long. But the description says only 2 feet which is what would seem to be depicted in the photo. Fix the product title!
1,Who lists joules as a main specification? Loooooooool
1,Kept blowing a fuse
5,Needed a surge protector and researched till I found one which seems to be the best. In has experienced 2 blackouts appears it did it’s job and nothing was affected. Thank God!  Toss all extension plugs and replace with this surge protector. My son lost use of all his kitchen appliances and such from a black out. Surge to buy best gor the money surge protector and you will be happy you did.
5,Was looking for a small two plug surge protector but could not find any so opted for this six plug GE model.  Compact and appears to be well made even though with GE name made in China.  Would not mind paying a little more for US made but just too hard to find.Short cord will allow for hiding unit behind tv and for additional plug for Fire device.
5,I own a very old house where the outlets are sparse and in odd places. I often have to cover them with furniture so this was exactly what I was looking for. The flat plug is so smart! You can push your furniture right up to it without having to worry about bending the cord!
1,Defective on arrival. Tried plugging into multiple outlets (that work) and using different equipment but this didn't work. Very disappointing as this is the 2nd item recently from Amazon that has arrived defective. Frustrating.
5,I have one of these power strips attached to just about every outlet in my apartment.  I can only use half of each outlet because the top half of each outlet is controlled by a wall switch (very poor design).  This power strip allows me to extend the number of items I can plug into the one usable outlet I have left.
5,Works good.Looks good.
5,Works great. I plugged six Christmas village houses into it and then plugged it into an Amazon smart plug. That way I could schedule the houses to turn on and off without having to do anything.
5,Its a multiplug its probably protecting i dont have much to say about it its working fine no problems so far wanted a cheap flat plug multiplug and found it.
5,Can't go wrong with a flat plug! So much easier for tight spaces. Nice price too!
5,I bought this power strip to use for my home coffee bar and it’s perfect! I love the flat outlet plug and the fact that the strip isn’t as bulky as they used to be.
5,Installed in my garage addition and plugged a water pump bike charger and garage door opener in...hopefully it will protect me against the next surge that took out my previous opener.
5,The switch is on the side. I really like the design. Oftentimes I would bump the switch and turn everything off. This strip solve the problem. I wish it was  angled left tough because all my electricity items are on the left wish they get the different options for me.
5,Used it for a TV it worked out perfectly.
4,Exactly what I needed thank you. Itsnot perfect but it works fine. Im not sure how long it will last but so for so good. It's at a good price for the money your spending.
5,Great product...only thing that could make it better would be to have the ability to have the cord on a swivel so the strip could be above OR below the outlet
5,Low-profile flat plug short cord - all the things I needed. I bought 2 and am very pleased.
1,The metal pins on the plugs were severely bent on arrival. Either this is bad shipping or poor product quality. Kinda sucks that this happens at all.
5,The power strip has a short cord which suited my needs.  Works as expected.
5,Works for my charging station for battery operated tools. Dewalt and black and decker items.
5,Works fine
5,Great Quality Surge Protector. is a very fast charge. the flat plug works perfectly behind shelves.
5,Perfect for where I needed it and a good price like that it can hang on the wall.
5,Nice and slim for under my Fish tank table hiding it is super easy! Great protection!
5,Excellent quality plug fits flat behind furniture.
5,This works great for me Thanks
5,I needed a short cord for my small office space. This cord works perfectly
5,Plugins fit nice and snug cord is very thick and the plastic is durable and quality is great
5,Great surge protector for the money. We have these mounted up behind TVs.
5,Great product
5,does the job at a fair price
5,satisfied
5,Super high quality
5,Served the purpose
5,Good product. Quick delivery.
5,Works fine
5,Happy all around served the purpose and working well.
5,Great and stylish
5,We always trust GE.
5,Excellent and exactly as described! Great buy so I bought two!
5,Good product
5,Perfect for bathroom!
5,Great product for the price.  Took care of what I needed for my kids room. Everything is plugged in nicely and securely. Plug stays snug in outlet doesn't hang or fallout. Definitely will buy another one soon.
5,Doesn’t take a lot ofspace
5,Good if you need a flexible extension cord but make sure you measure.
5,Works as expected
5,Fits behind bed perfectly!
5,Great value and good quality.
5,Great Product!!
5,Just what I wanted.
5,Just what I wanted. And it will blend very well with my décor
5,Does exactly what it needs to. No issues.
4,It works fine.
5,Works great
5,It's a very handy power strip for a low price. The flat plug is a must since I have furniture in front of my outlets so this fit the job nicely. Not the sturdiest construction out of all of the power strips I've used in my day but it's definitely not something that'll just break on you. For the price it's very hard to beat the value you're getting with this.
5,Shes a beaut Clark
5,Braided flexible cord is great flush mounted side switch is convenient and doesn’t get accidentally flipped. Black and grey color is great!
5,What I wanted
5,Producto de calidad en los materiales
1,No power to any device in any outlet. Had to exchange. Opted for one with a power light as the exchange so this time i can easily check
5,Cord length is good. I just needed to expand the number of sockets available.
5,Works well
4,As described and fully met expectations.  No problems.
5,I like its look function simplicity and modern design and braided cord!
5,Good quality UL listed power strip. Wish I would have gotten longer cord though (my fault).
4,I like everything about it except it has no light to indicate if it is on or off. My fault for not noticing this. The key product plugged into it voids their warranty if no light. I can’t imagine why but it is what they say. Expensive treadmill.
5,Works great!
5,I picked a great product in this surge protector. It looks good and fits in the small area I needed it to go. I am very happy with it.
5,product works exactly as advertised would buy again
5,Surge protector arrived as promised provides extra connections as needed.  On/off switch especially appreciated since we are now told that up to 1/4 of household power consumption goes to apparatus that continues to draw power during off use standby mode.
3,The cord is not flexible and the flat plug does not rotate. It is in a fixed position.
5,Nice.
5,Great item for the price.
5,Bought this to bring to wherever I sleep over - work vacation or even just a day trip. Gonna bring this also when I fly to other places so I won’t worry about charging multiple gadgets when there’s only one outlet.
5,👍
5,Works great with my new furniture
5,Exactly what you see
5,I need a power strip with maximum of 6 outlets and a cord length around 2ft.  this was a perfect match
5,Serves the purpose for several gadgets.
5,Great cord perfect length heavy cord very happy
5,I installed an outlet behind my wall mount tv. However traditional cord configuration wouldn’t allow it to be plugged in. This plug in in very slim allowing me to plug in and relocate strip to location allowing traditional plugs. Also cord is short at 2’ which worked great for my application and not having to zip tie and hide the excess.
5,Well it is actually but it's better. Not a cheapo. Great value extremely well made cool wall plug and now I'm confident my electronics are better protected. Approved.
2,Get the longer cord
5,I like the low profile plug it fits well behind the furniture.  I was able to buy just the cord length I needed. Pet peeve but not work a star docking the outlets are too close together.  There is a big empty space at the start of the strip maybe it is needed for the inner workings but if they had spaced out the outlets better or some were rotated 90 degrees I could actually use all six of the outlets.
5,Works as expected
5,I’m disabled and have stuff that needs to plug in. This is perfect and if I do ever go anywhere I can take his and not inconvenience my host with phone chargers heating pads etc. just a back up but it’s fine.
5,Fine surge protector
5,Thanks for the quick ship...  The GE Power Strip Surge Protector 6 Outlets Flat Plug 4 Ft Power Cord Wall Mount Black 37051  is just what I was lookingk for.. Great price too!
5,plugs in lots and no surges
5,Perfect fit for my WFH setup. The plug that goes into the wall was flat enough to still have my desk (almost) flush to the wall and I was able to put the strip right against the leg of the desk so I can plug in phone/tablet chargers easily.
5,Solid power strip.  Solidly made. And a nice light blue light to let you know that the power strip is on.
1,Its trash broke in less than a month
4,For this price point it's OK.  For me the orientation of the plugs is good because it accommodates the wide flat transformers for my razor and a couple of IKEA lights.  However knocked off a star for:- Lack of a pre-measured template to help install screws for the hanger slots.- Hanger slots for only one direction as shown in my picture.- Very stiff power cord.- Lack of pilot light in on/off switch.
5,Perfect for what I need it for. Can’t complain
2,Maybe I read too many descriptions of choices that I didn't notice that this surge protector had no indicator light. I didn't realize how much it is handy to look down/over and see that it is on or off.
5,Worked great for me had a outlet behind a bed and couldn't plug anything in it due to the bed.  So the flat surface made the outlet useful again.
5,Looks neat and is well made.
4,Works
5,Needed a couple more outlets on our kitchen countertop so I decided a power strip was the best option. This GE surge protector has a 2 foot cord which was ideal for how it was going to be used.It easily mounted on the wall with the two keyhole slots on the back of the surge protector. The cord has a flat right angle plug that protrudes out of the outlet by about 7/8”. The body of the unit is about 10” long x 1 1/4” wide x 1 1/4” deep. It does have a switch on the side of the body (see photo at top left of unit).
5,Purchased because it has no annoying and energy wasting vampire light has a short cord and has a flat plug. Happy with purchase.
5,They say once you go flat you never go back. The truth is that I am the proud owner of 3 of these surge protectors. The flat plug is my favorite feature and to me allows for cleaner lines from the outlet. The benefit of a flat cord is that is doesn't protrude from the outlet at a 90 degree angle. The surge protector itself I think is also a simple clean design. The switch is easily accessed along the side. The 1060 joules offered should be sufficient for my laptop and monitor.
1,Arrived damaged.
5,Good size like flat plug braided cord is nice
5,Length of the cord is why I bought it. Other surge protectors cords were too short. I like the fabric covered cord. One thing and I guess it’s true with all surge protectors once this device detects a surge of electricity it will no longer work. It will have to be replaced.
5,This is a great surge protector. The only thing I wish I had done differently was purchased one with built-in USB ports so I didn’t have to use adapters but otherwise I love it
5,Exactly what I wanted
5,This is the best surger I have bought.U love the flat end you plug in instead of that type that seems to be a hump that can be for me an issue when things are too close to it. I am also pleased with the extra length much needed to reach the plug in outlet. Works fine plan to replace another in time to prop under cabinets so I can put lights under them for night. Good buy no regrets or issues
5,Quality. No surprises.
5,Fue ideal para el espacio que tenía aunque no es muy larga me quedó perfecta.
5,It works.
5,It is exactly what I wanted which was an extension cord of this length in a white color so it doesn't stand out too much and with a flat plug to help keep the cord close to the wall - this cord fits all of these requirements well.
5,Time will tell but this should outlast the PC its attached to!
5,Meets my needs.
4,Great product! Wish there were options for the direction of the end (goes off towards the right when plugged into the wall needs a cord the goes off towards the left when plugged in)
4,I love the sturdy design especially if you have dogs that would chew through wires if they got the chance. The length of the cord is great. BUTWhen you plug something into the sockets on the bar they do not fit snug. I also don’t like the design of the power bars  plug. It’s hard to maneuver bc it’s a square and since it’s three prong you can obviously only plug it in one way! I it works though but if you move the bar too much the plugs become lose. Almost Amazon but not quite what I’d expected!
5,No complaints came in quick works exactly the way it should. No reason to not give 5 stars
5,Nothing special works as it should. Durable material.
5,Needed more outlets off my UPS. Short cord made it easier to make this happen. Nice that it doesn't have a power light. Unit can be wall mounted but did not require this. The flush power plug makes a bigger difference if space is a concern.
5,Muy buen producto llego rápido y los materiales se ven de calidad yo tengo el de 6 outlets en donde tengo tele chrome cast cafetera y calefactor conectados y funciona a la perfección se apaga automáticamente si la carga llegara a ser demasiado alta
5,Va perfecto ya van varios que compro para algunas zonas de la casa que requieren una protección pero que no tienen espacio o requieren un regulador. Ya dependerá del precio que lo encuentres ya que fluctúa bastante.
5,Excelente para colocar detrás de los muebles sin que la clavija estorbe ayuda mucho a reducir espacios. El cable es bastante grueso pero hay que revisar bien la longitud que necesitan pues el largo mencionado incluye las entradas y no solo el cable.
5,Esta marca realiza artículos de extrema calidad este en lo personal es muy elegante y funcional.  Lo recomiendo ampliamente.
5,necesitaba una regleta con protector de sobre voltaje para la cocina y esta resultó bastante buena recomendable
5,Excelente para su costo tengo varios aparatos conectados y no se calienta o se apaga por sobre carga. Muy bien hasta el momento.
5,El multicontacto está a buen precio y no hemos tenido problema con el aparato
5,La distancia del cable facilita su acomodo en el mueble de TV
5,Tengo aproximadamente tres meses usando el producto y no he tenido ninguna queja funciona a la perfección y el tipo de enchufe no se maltrata si queda atrás de un mueble por ser plano.
5,Muy buen material y funciona adecuadamente
5,Funciona perfecto. La clavija plana puede ahorrar espacio.
5,Tal como lo anuncian ayuda mucho en espacios pequeños
5,El acabado no es lo mejor  pero funciona al 100
5,Funciona bien
5,Muy buena calidad
4,Se ve de buena calidad en cuanto a materiales el cable y clavija se ven y sienten súper resistentes. A los enchufes me costó un poco de trabajo conectar algunos aparatos por que están muy apretados no sé si se puedan llegar a romper al tratar de conectar algo si no se rompen creo que es bueno ya que no se desconectan fácilmente las clavijas conectadas. La clavija del multicontactos está muy bien pero hay que considerar que hay una dirección hacia la que el cable puede ir muy fácilmente pero en la dirección opuesta será muy difícil y tendrá que torcerse el cable completamente. Aún así creo que es un buen producto un poco caro pero parece que si lo vale. Si falla pronto actualizaré la reseña
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Lo recomiendo mucho anteriormente me había comprado un tipo de ext con enchufe plano (quería algo para detrás de mi buró) al final me salió más caro y no me funcionó.Este me gusto porque el enchufe que va a la pared es plano igualmente que la regleta.Quería un multicontacto para el cargador del mi despertador y el del iPhone (que son muy gordos) después compré el Google mini sin saber que el enchufe es completamente circular (supongo par que lo pongas solo en la pared) y sin pensarlo me sirvió lo plano del multicontacto lo puse del otro lado dejé libre un contacto adicional.Si no hubiera sido completamente plano con una luz como los demás no me hubiera funcionado.Aunque estéticamente es muy simple es muy práctico en la caja dice que te protege tus artículos de sobrecargas si viene algo muy fuerte por seguridad deja de funcionar y se apaga y tendrás que tirarlo y comprar otro (espero eso no pase).Dentro tiene una garantía para esto (obviamente con muchas cláusulas) no se si esto sea aplicable en Mexico.P.D. Viene una leyenda que el uso de este aparato puede provocar cancer pero no siendo médico o electricista no se a que se refiere o cuál es la exposición para algo así…
5,Most surge protectors have an LED-lit button which is good for some things but I wanted one that did not draw attention to itself. This one fits the bill. The design is nice a simple aesthetic. and the flat plug is very useful especially with the angled cord so that the other outlet is still useable. Good product I recommend.
3,Good quality but the circuit switch is more internal then external there's no light indicater the cord and plug are on a bad angle makes it difficult to plug in any large plugs for tech/electronics that needs to permanently stay on and you might want to get 3ft. or more. There good i use them so electronics are not wasting electricity in stand- by and not skyrocketing my hydro bill. Face facts comical Notorious extortion.
5,I really liked this so much that I got 2 more. It is simple and works really well. Has no issues with all plugs using it at the same time. The mat black colour works really work and blends in well with our rooms
3,El enchufe queda del lado contrario que los enchufes en la regleta por lo que al usarlo de tiene que torcer el cable y por lo ancho y resistente del mismo tiende a regresar a su posición normal esto lo hace difícil de poner bien en el suelo o en una pared
4,Es practico y la clavija plana ayuda a ahorra espacio en traseros de muebles contra la pared pero podria ser un poco mas corta la tira de contactos
5,Perfectly long cable from my outlet to my desk. Made of good material for the price your paying.Pros: No lights on the switch so not annoying during the night. Good price for performance.Cons: None as of right now.
5,Muy útil para conectar en lugares difíciles
4,Je voulais un produit de qualité et fiable. Et c'est ce que j'ai acheté.
5,Aunque el cable no es muy largo es justo lo q necesitaba para poder conectar el refrigerador y poder pegarlo mas a la pared. Ahora mi electrodomestico esta protegido y tengo un poco mas de espacio en la cocina
5,Perfect for my boyfriends room and all his plug ins
5,This is a great power strip but the cord is too thick so it keeps flopping about.
3,SOLO NO ME GUSTO LO RIGIDO O DURO DEL CORDON...!
5,Excelente calidad vs precio
5,Diseño normal y precio accecible es justo lonque esperas por lo que pagas
5,Exactement comme je désirais aucun problème avec le produit et la livraison était rapide.
5,Justo lo que esperaba
5,es una excelente extension igual a la reseña del producto
5,El diseño es muy bonito y el cable revestido es muy elegante
4,TV
5,A1
1,Cómo se ve en la foto es lo más que entra un enchufe
5,You get what buy. Okay product. Felt like i paid too much for it though
4,Bien la calidad del producto y la rapidez de la entrega. El único de talle es que el producto venía sucio como con una mancha de comida como si hubiera sido usado antes.
5,Considero que el precio está un pelín elevado (496 pesos mexicanos en mi caso) así que sería bueno rebajar un poco el precioen cuanto a la resistencia es bastante buenoya que es bastante amplio y ancho.
5,Super resistente y funciona bien. Lo único que no me gusta es que no puedo conectarla más que de una forma y se dobla raro
1,Item arrived on time even earlier than estimationIt just doesnt work. I have tested on different electric outlets and then I used a different cord with the same setting and things work. so definitely it's this cord that doesnt work. very disappointed. wasted time on waiting for delivery now wasting more time to repacke and dropping this off at UPS
4,Es comodo por su conexión plana para espacios reducidos
5,Me gustó mucho el tipo de conexión plana por que is contactos están detrás de la cama y otros conectores se doblaban adicional el trenzado que tiene es muy lindo yo compré 2 de diferentes largos que se adaptan a las necesidades de mi casa.
4,Me gustó el producto ya que se ve de buen material y resistente pero el cable es algo corto y eso limita que tan lejos pueden estar tus productos conectados.
3,Perfect for the home office
5,Nice long cord
5,Exactly the length I wanted + the company is "GE". No need for hesitation to buy this quality product.
5,Works perfectly.
5,Nothing to review flushed plug saves space Constrution could have been better the power switch seems flimsy but have helium products at home and they usually survives the test of time.
2,Very difficult to insert plugs fully into this power bar. It took a lot of force.  Spacing on receptacles is very close together. Fine for lamp cords but large molded 3 prong cords will be a very tight fit.
3,x
5,good
5,Es un producto de alta calidad y el mejor diseño que encontrarás ya que es simple o si lo prefieres hay una versión con forro trenzado pero esta excelente y su resistencia de uso también.
5,-works good-has a 90 degree plug-does have a power on light
5,Está muy sencillo pero bastante bien y práctico
4,The cord seems very surable and is provided by a reputable brand (GE) and so far it has worked and came in the appropriate packaging. Although it is pretty short (as stated only 2 feet) it is great and practical!
