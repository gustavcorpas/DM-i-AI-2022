4,I loved how comfortable this mouse was in my hand but the click was a little too loud to me. I gave it to my husband and he likes it! Great deal for the price.
5,Great value and ease of use just plug in the receiver and within seconds I had a great little mouse.
5,Love how it fits my palm.  the 2 side buttons are a bonus
4,I have to wait to get monitor working w/mouse
5,This one fits hand nicely. Nicely priced.
5,Works well no complaints easy to use and feels good
5,This works as represented.  Several reviewers have commented on the fact the mouse turns off and requires a click to restart.  This is probably a battery saving feature and easily invoked without consequence by the right button.
5,I thought this would would die on me in a matter of weeks but wow was I proven wrong. I have taken this mouse everywhere with me as I like to use it with my laptop. I used to take some care for it since I thought it was a fragile product but for the past few months I have been cramming it in my bag when I travel and every time the mouse functions the same as before. Honestly would recommend this to anyone wanting to buy such a cheap mouse.
5,I wanted to use the mouse before writing a review.  It was dirt cheap.  It works great.  What more can I say.  If you need a mouse buy one of these.
5,very good. reliable. worked right away when usb installed.
5,Needed a cheap wireless mouse for a new laptop this fits my hand good battery life is good and it works great.
5,This mouse has worked very well.  It comfortable in the hand because it has good height to it.  I had some more expensive mice where the scroll wheel kept breaking so far works perfectly on this one.  If you are looking for a basic wireless mouse this works great.
4,A-+
5,Don't let the price make you think twice. What a steal! Excellent feel light weight hooks right  up to laptop no worries. Love love love.
5,Looks good haven't used yet
4,Wireless mouse works.
5,Mouse really has a nice feel. Very comfortable. A++++
4,Plug it in turn it on and it works perfectly.
5,The mouse is smooth and very helpful with my arthritic hand.
5,I love the feel of this mouse and for the price its a great deal!
5,I liked the price!
5,It’s designed with hand comfort in mind
5,Muy practico y facil de usar.
3,It could just be me but the mouse doesn't fit into my hand very well.  Also it goes into some kind of sleep mode which you have to wake up instead of just being able to use as soon as you set down with mouse in hand.
5,Very comfortable and well working mouse.
3,It drains the batteries quickly even with always turning it off. Boxing is poor quality came in crushed but delivery was good
3,New mouse doesn't scroll can't find an update driver for it. Running windows 10 all other buttons work wheel button works but scrolling doesn't. User manual says to contact if there are any questions but doesn't offer a contact email or telephone number.Not being able to scroll makes the mouse pretty useless for my needs. I'll update review if I get a response as the user manual says they respond within 24 hours (yet don't offer a method of contacting)
5,This mouse was easy to set up. Just put batteries in put USB plug into your laptop and it connects automatically. Very easy to use and comfortable in your hand.
5,big enough for my hand! Hooks up super easy!
5,Easy to install gave it 5 stars. My first mouse when arrive was broken but seller sent me a replacement out the next day!!!! Just got it this afternoon So far so good!
5,Easy to use.
5,👎
5,This mouse is amazing so far! There are extra things it can do but it is a good price for a mouse that works this well!
4,Like Bigly!See previous reviews.
3,It won't work if even a little low.  I put brand new Duracell batteries in and I have had to replace them now 3 times.
3,The mouse worked pretty well at first and the wake up click to start after sleep mode is flawless. I have had recurring issues with the mouse cursor stuttering while traversing the screen. This issue has become increasingly severe and I cannot give out five stars. I regret that I cannot recommend this product for most users. A power user/gamer probably wouldn't buy this mouse anyway.Follow up: The seller contacted me to offer support on the product issues I was having. I had already solved the issues by buying a more expensive mouse that hasn't had any lag or stutter at all. Due to the sellers willingness to make my experience with the product right I have bumped up the overall rating by 1 star.
5,This wireless mouse is fantastic! Loved it so much I got one for my office and my home office. I have small hands and this fit great. Don't use the side buttons (by the thumb) but the main wheel fits my middle finger just fine. I guess if you're a lefty you can try something brand new lol!
4,I like how it fits in my hand once in awhile the courser jumps. Makes it hard to play my games
5,This thing works like a champ. Doesn't suck the battery quickly. Great range. I've yet to find a problem with it and the price is amazing.
5,Works like a charm
5,Works well.  No issues.  Remarkable value.
5,Saw my boyfriend eyeing this so I got it for him as a surprise and he loves it. He’s on his computer all day doing graphic design and so far he’s said it’s very comfortable.
5,I use this mouse with my work laptop and it works great. Click the mouse to wake it up and you're good to go
5,I just started working from home and I wanted to find a mouse that was ergonomic but inexpensive. This is it!! I’m so surprised that at such a good price it’s this good. It’s comfortable light weight and I’ve had no problems with it being wireless. Hope this helps :)
5,Cheap and works great
5,This is a really comfortable mouse. Much better than many more expansive ones. The smoothness of the pointer movement is a little off but not at all impact normal office usage. Definitely worth the money!
5,Bought because it was less than $10 and had next day shipping.  Works well and i have had no issues with it.
5,No dislikes great for the money I spent. Nice to handle and easy to use and set up
2,Honestly I haven't bothered to return it to go thru that hassle but each time my laptop turns itself off the wireless mouse quits. I slap it briskly against my palm or thigh; it restarts just fine and runs fine until the laptop itself turns off (from being left idle). There's no blame to Amazon or the seller since I haven't notified either one that this unit has a battery problem.
5,This Mouse goes far beyond what I expected feels great in the hand very responsive and quick No loss of signal and I am about 30 ft away from the reciever. I would call this a Diamond in the rough. Very Happy  :-)
5,Its work like my old big brand $50 mouse. 5 stars all the way !!
2,too sensitive to surface variation rarely moves cursor directly; real pain to use I actually threw this in the garbage and went back to my old broken mouse. it also forces the wrist into a tight bend which seems counterintuitive from CTS. I absolutely regret this purchase 100%.
5,So if I don’t write a review… do what?
5,I put batteries in and turned it on after inserting the usb drive in my laptop and it works perfect for me
2,I have 10.5 hands.  This is a touch small barely.  Since I use it mainly for light navigation it's no big deal.  Much better deal than large LLC mouses at 2 to 3 times more in price.  It turns itself off though.  Which is stupid.  You have to click it to reactivate it.  If you double click by accident then you've clicked on something on a webpage and have to hit the back button.  It's really a stupid irritating feature.
5,It rolls smoothly and doesn't feel bulky in your hand
5,Once you get Past the Ergonomic Design that Us beginners to Gaming Mouses have that causes numerous mistaken Button Clicks this Mouse Works Great. I would Recommend it!
5,it is the best mouse for its price in my opinion buy it now
5,works well
2,Mouse is pretty good but it goes to sleep after just a few minutes of inactivity and is difficult to wake up. Also sometimes the cursor jumps around the screen and it is difficult to control. I bought this for the low cost but you know the old adage - you get what you pay for. Caveat emptor
5,Very comfortable to use and works well for my uses.
3,The wheel was a bit weird
2,Good overall but NOT good for active use. The mouse goes into sleep after inactivity for even less than 5 min.  And wakes up after a click moving the mouse does not activate.  So it is pretty hard to use it as don't know which window it might close on top annoying that when we want to do something and moving the mouseit's actually not moving and we need to click to get it to activate.
5,Works great
2,Mouse is small and fits the hand awkward. Might be better suited for petite hands.
2,Purchased on July 07 dead as a door nail on Aug.17. Tried to revive with new batteries changed usb dongle to different computer port. Also installed on other computer; remains DOA.
1,What I truly truly dislike the fact that I spent good money on this and I have one that is wireless also and it just requires one battery that's it this one on the other hand died after 2 weeks yes what I do with the mouse is a lot of clicking and working but I've never had one last only two weeks worst purchase ever and my children told me not to buy this one to keep looking but I said no I know what I'm doing apparently not but I won't be fooled again.
5,Para mi laptop
5,THIS MOUSE FITS IN YOUR HAND PERFECTLY AND IS REALLY SMOOTH.
5,Nice
1,I really liked the comfort of this mouse. Unfortunately on the 31 day of owning the mouse it stopped working. I thought the batteries were dead so I changed them and it still does not work. The light flashes when I put new batteries in it but then immediately goes off.  The batteries have been checked and they are new. It was a little strange that it would always go to sleep if I didnt use it constantly but if I would click the cursor would appear.
1,This mouse died in 6 weeks. Tried new batteries nothing. Totally shot. The red optical light illuminates for 1 second then goes off. It was also terrible before that. It would only wake up from sleep mode by pressing buttons not by moving the mouse. It wasn't comfortable to hold either. Save your money. This thing isn't worth a nickel.
1,I purchased this mouse and it is just awful! I tried to send it back and it was the day after my cut off. FYI Amazon now has a 30 day money back guarantee day 31 after purchased. I used Amazon for convenience and ease I have stopped.
1,I sent it back first time because it didn't work.  They sent another and it didn't work. I really think they sent the same one back. But I didn't get another I had my money put back in account. Very disappointed.
1,I try this on multiple devices and the left click did not work. The plastic feels light and cheap. Overall this was a waste of money and I hate to think about standing in line to return it
1,The worst mouse ever made I would never recommend this to anyone elseDo Not Buy this
1,Tried numerous batteries this thing just kept shutting off. You get what you pay for. Buy something else
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Not even two weeks and it’s already malfunctioning and shorting out. I’m in school & I needed a mouse because the mouse pad on my laptop isn’t stable I purchased this for an alternative to that issue & it shorts out right before I take a quiz. A total waste of money.
1,The mouse stopped working after about a week.
1,I'm returning the second one today!  it works for a few hours out of the box then it's a dead brick.  Tested the batteries they are good!  Did all but rip the thing open!  Do not buy this product!
1,Great Mouse.  Great price.  Quick delivery.  Highly reccommend
1,The role works so slow and I have to click 4-5 times to select anything.
1,I needed a 2nd mouse for my work from home job sadly this item didn’t work so I’m returning.
1,
1,Stopped working after using twice.
1,Did not have USB
1,Force to select one star. Bad quality. Not working after 1 months. Returning period closed can't return.
1,crapped out after 1 week
1,Waste of money
1,No USB receiver for a wireless mouse. That sure ain't going to work...
1,Not working at all.
1,This mouse lasted a total of 5 hours use. It stopped working all together.
1,One day after using and the light stop working so I am unable to use the items even though i put brand new batteries in.
1,Cursor jumps all over the place spending more time fighting to control the cursor than doing actual work
1,Within 2 months stopped working g
1,Wouldn't work at all. As soon as we got it we tried it out and it wouldn't work.
4,This mouse is pretty good if you're on a budget and just want something that's fully functional. It works great is light-weight and ergonomically friendly. You can tell that it's made of cheaper material and probably wouldn't withstand a major drop from the desk onto hardwood -- but it's cheap enough to make up for those flaws.So if you're in the market for a cheap mouse without any bells and whistles -- but is also highly functional and reliable then I suggest this mouse to you. If you're needing something for gaming or you're very rough on your pc peripherals then probably look else-where.
5,Not much to say here. It works great and looks like the picture!
5,At this point unless you are spending A LOT of money on a mouse they are pretty generic and rather binary - they work or they don't.I was expecting a simple mouse that worked but this YABBOQ mouse really surprised me in a couple of ways.  First it is larger than most inexpensive mice.  I've got large hands and this mouse fits well in my hand with the buttons comfortable to use and reach.Using it on a few different machines the mouse worked fine without the need to add drivers on Windows 10 Windows 11 and an old Linux OS running on a Raspberry Pi.One of my complaints about OTHER mice is that the dongles either don't have a storage spot in the mouse (rare but it is has happened)  or that the dongle itself doesn't have any markings on it making it hard to tie back to the mouse.  Neither is an issue here - the dongle fits in a slot under the battery door cover so it is easy to keep in a secure place and the dongle itself has a clear marking of YABBOQ on the end of the dongle which is visible when in a USB plug. As the mouse itself has the brand name across the front AND on the bottom keeping the dongle and the mouse together is simple.Battery life after a month is a non-issue.  The mouse uses two AAA batteries and has a battery saving function.For a rather generic product I like that the brand name is on the dongle and twice on the mouse.  I say this becuase it indicates to me that the company wants to build a brand name and is proud of the product they have made - making it easy to identify the manufacturer in the event you have an issue.  Thankfully I have no issues with this mouse and it is working as expected and feels better in my hand than I expected.
5,I got this to replace a name brand mouse the wheel stopped working. I plugged it in and my VivoBook took to it right away. I have had no issues with "pointer jumps" on the screen. It wakes up my laptop everytime. My finger are completely on the ergonomic buttons with no accidental clicks. Paired with my gel mouse pad  I have found wrist comfort!!!!
3,It just feels too weird in my hand. I keep accidentally trying to use it like a regular mouse. Just not for me.
5,This mouse has a really great and ergonomic shape. It fits comfortably in my hand and is a joy to use. I was skeptical about the quality because of how cheap the price was but so far it’s holding up fine
5,good  good  good
5,I desperately needed one and I bought it a little skeptical but it’s worth it
5,Had absolutely no issues with this mouse. Simple set up no struggles at all!
5,I do like the ergonomic feel of this mouse it fits comfortably in my hand. It also moves smoothly across the mouse pad. Battery life is still questionable since I’ve only had it a few days but so far so good. Will update if anything changes!
5,Although this YABBOQ Computer Wireless Mouse is bigger than what I am used to it is SO ergonomic!! My hand fits right around and into it.Easy to use zips right along doesn't get hung up. It is substantial -- not too light not heavy.For the low price it is Fantastic. I plan on getting 2 more-- one for my other laptop and one for my work desktop.The ON Off button is small and lightweight so I am careful when I turn it on or off.
5,Needed a mouse for my laptop. The built in mouse is finicky and freezes from time to time. At first I thought it was missing the USB but it's cleverly hidden inside the battery compartment (see photo 2). No lag. Very accurate. This was easy to setup. Just plug n play. Very happy with this purchase!
1,Roller wheel never worked.Would not stay locked for pointing and regularly cut off with new batteries installed.This mouse has a mind of it's own!
1,This is going into the garbage.  It's far inferior to my Logitech wireless mouse I bought a long time ago.  If you don't use it for awhile it shuts down and the only way I can get it working again is to unplug the small receiver from the USB port and plug it back in.  Unnecessary.  It feels cheap in my hand.  No good.  Tossing it.
1,I was super excited about this product until I realized there was no usb in that is supposed to come with for me to connect it.
5,Easy to use.  Just plug in and use. Feels comfortable and slides smooth.
4,This is an cheap (price) mouse you can get for $5 bucks. The value is really good for what it is. The Mouse is made from hard plastic and functions properly. The only problem is made for smaller hands and large hands is not very comfortable.
5,I use it as a test mouse on computers I am working on and as a spare. No issues and I like the ergonomic feel!
5,Muy Practico y comodo cumple las expectativas
5,Easy to install and love how I can surf the internet fast  delivery was fast
5,The item was packed securely. Easy to put together and install the usb. The USB however was tight to start with. It now installs and removes as a normal usb connection should. So far so good. We'll see how it works or not in the coming days and months.
5,This mouse is an excellent product. It shuts off when not in use to save the battery. This causes it to hesitate when put back in use. You get use to that pretty quickly. I recommend this mouse and the cost is very reasonable.
4,Just received yesterday but this is a cool mouse.  Love the shape and how it feels in my hand.  I am able to actually 'rest' my wrist as apposed to having my hand up if ya know what I mean.  I didn't realize how uncomfortable my past mouse was now that I have this one. And it's sturdy with a little weight on it. I like the scroll feature too. Longevity? Don't know yet.  But even if it just lasts a year the price is right and I'd buy it again because of the way it's feels and how it's behaving.
5,Works great on r wrist and hands.  Just remember to shut it off after ever use.  Otherwise you'll have to recharge it a lot
5,Love it so much
5,This is a really nice mouse.  It's smooth moving and very responsive.
5,works as its suppose to and at a super nice price
5,great price good product
5,great deal love amazon
5,I bought this because I wanted a spare mouse. I didn't need anything expensive.
5,Just great perfect fit for my hand no strain amazing value
5,Great value for the money
5,Feels good on the hand
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                               Ergonómico de buen material liviano la duración de la batería depende de las pilas que le coloque dentro buen desempeño al enlazarse al computador
5,Like how it’s wireless
5,Feels and works super good. It’s a match for my chrome book.
1,Should of known a cheap mouse would only last a few days.  I tried fresh batteries 2 times and it still wouldn't stay on.
5,this is alot of review for mice
5,No complaints works fine runs on aaa batteries
5,It's standard size and accurate!
5,it is good to help with my carpal syndrome. i don't have any pain.
5,Ergonomic with excellent ability to get the job done 👍
