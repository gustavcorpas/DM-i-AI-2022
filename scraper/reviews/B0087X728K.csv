5,This thermal paste got my friends PS4 working like new again.
5,Easy to use
5,USED BEFORE AND IS STILL GREAT
5,no more shut downs from heat
5,I've been using Arctic silver 5 for over 12 years now. I've never had a single issue. This stuff is absolutely perfect. Yeah it's a little expensive but it's worth everything. It doesn't have a bunch of gimmick to it. It's got actual silver in it to help be more conductive for heat
5,I have tried other Thermal Interface Materials (TIM) and I went back to Artic Silver 5 thermal compound.  It is simply the best and I have gotten the best results with it for many years.  The product is ideal for CPUs Northbridge Southbridge and GPU components that are heat sinked.  I have used it on desktop computers laptops servers and Xbox 360's.When using the product a little dab will do the trick.  If you use too much it will squeeze out from under the heat sink and make a big mess.  The proper amount is about 1 ½ to 2 times the size of a grain of rice.  If you look on the internet there are several guides on how to use the product including photos.  Sometimes on a large CPU I spread the compound in a very thin and even layer with and old credit card like tool.  On one rough heat sink assembly I had to work a drop of the compound into the surface with a credit card and this filled in the micro abrasions in the surface and improved the temperature drop by 4 degrees C. The key is that you want a thin and even layer of the compound on the entire top surface of the CPU so that all the micro flaws in the surfaces of the CPU and the heat sink are filled with the silver in the product to provide maximum thermal conductance of heat away from the CPU and into the heat sink assembly.  Do not use to much compound people tend to use too much or not enough and the science is to do it just right!Before you apply the compound clean all the surfaces and make sure they have no oil finger prints or dust on them.  Make sure you have removed the old thermal compound from the surfaces.  Some old compounds get rock hard and can be difficult to clean.  I have used Goo Gone and it is by far the best cleaning solution I have ever used.  Don't use too much and clean only the CPU and heat sink.  Then wipe all surfaces dry and wipe again with an alcohol swab and a Q tip if necessary to clean up the old compound.  Then give it a final wipe with ¼ of a coffee filter as they are fiber free paper and you should have a clean surface.  These surfaces must be absolutely clean and even the oil from a fingerprint that you can't see can cause a problem.Mount your heat sink and I like the aftermarket heat sink fan assemblies or water cooled blocks as they install with screws and you can make sure that the heat sink is firm and tight with the CPU.  The factory supplied heat sinks with push pins bother me as I have seen many people swear they are tight and they are not.  You will not get ideal cooling unless you do a professional job of installing these key components and you may damage your CPU.The Artic Silver 5 compound has an aging time of around 200 hours and the temperature will improve by about 2 to 5 degrees after the aging process is done.  To properly age the compound you should use your computer until it heats up (about one or two hours) and then shut it down and let it cool off and use it again.  Do this multiple times.  This heat and cool procedure sets the compound up properly and improves the thermal interface.  Good luck and have fun!
5,I'm pretty much a "noob" and hobbyist when it comes to tinkering with computer hardware ... I stumbled into it after replacing a few laptops ... I had these old laptops sitting around and started futzing around with them just to see if I could figure out how to take them apart and get them running nice again ... to have a few working spares that I could then use as notebooks multi-media players etc. ... basically backups to use in situations where I don't want to have to upgrade old software/peripherals or risk damage to my newer "main" laptop.Anyway my second laptop ever was a Compaq Presario 700 series with an AMD Mobile Duron processor (I know ... Stone Age right?).  My kids used it for awhile after me and they basically thrashed it.  It needed a new hard drive keypad AC jack ... fortunately I was able to find all the parts I needed online cheap enough to justify the repair effort.  The heat transfer plate on the AMD processor is pretty small not even half a postage stamp and it's mated with a fairly large plate-type heat sink assembly that spreads the heat across the plate and discharges it from a fan attached to the assembly at the left side of the laptop.Back when I was using the Compaq more frequently I recall that it ran pretty warm most of the time and I remember that the fan was on a lot when programs were running at 2 or 3 speeds e.g. low medium high.  Well the repairs required that I strip the whole thing down to the motherboard and ... gasp ... remove the heatsink.  Knowing that I would have to put new thermal compound between the CPU and heatsink when I re-assembled it I poked around the 'net and saw all the good reviews on Arctic Silver 5 and ordered a tube.  I carefully cleaned all the old compound off the CPU and heatsink (it took awhile to soften up and remove all the old compound using isopropyl alcohol and cotton swabs ... be patient ... it's worth it) "tinned" the clean heatsink surface with the faintest smudge of Arctic Silver (this helps to fill in microscopic pits and valleys on the mating surface) and then applied a thin even layer of Arctic Silver over the whole heat transfer plate on the CPU re-secured the heat sink to the CPU and then finished the rest of the re-assembly.When I first started running some music and DVD's (they put a continuous load of about 50-60% on this particular CPU) I was waiting for the fan to start blowing as it always did before.  To my surprise it didn't.  It took so long in fact for the fan to come on at all that I started to think I might have broken it or forgot to re-connect it when I put the thing back together.  This is certainly no scientific or exact "before and after" measurement but I'll be darned if the heat sink on this laptop isn't working better now than it EVER did before even when the computer was new.  It's not even getting hot enough to make the fan go on "high" when I'm playing a DVD on the laptop.  The only way I can explain it is that the new thermal compound is doing that much better a job of getting the heat off the CPU and into the heatsink than whatever compound the OEM used.  This stuff is brilliant.  I totally agree with all the rave reviews ... if you properly clean all the old compound off your CPU and heatsink and carefully follow the instructions for applying this stuff you WILL get substantially better results from your computer's "stock" cooling system unless of course your OEM also used Artic Silver!
5,This brought my Ryzen 9 5900x temps down by almost 10 degrees in both idle and at load (Gaming). I use a Corsair H100i AIO. Highly recommended!
5,Product totally works! Below is my experience:Anybody ever go through an issue with their Xbox One X or Playstation 4 Pro sounding like a jet engine that’s about to take off and then all of a sudden crashes on you without warning? I had that issue with my Xbox One X that I got on release day years ago. I’m not sure if my Xbox was a part of a bad batch or not buuttt... It kept dying on me mid game or just right after whenever it started up. Caused me so many headaches had me saying things like “Whiskey Tango Hotel” and “I’M ABOUT TO DESTROY YOU!” This went on for the longest like around mid 2019 and it got worse and worse and WORSE. By the time it became almost unbearable like July 2020 I remembered about the new Xbox coming out. I was like “Alrighty... I’ll wait.” I figured I grin and bear it and play Fortnite (Of all the games that one smh) till Xbox Series X came out cause you know... Halo Infinite was going to be a release title (Then it got delayed and I cried myself to sleep the night I found out; Sad Times) Enough was enough. I had this thermal paste for months and I was going to use it to fix my xbox. After a very tense hour of taking it apart cleaning it applying this bad boy onto the chip and reassembling it I then had to RUN AN ERRAND OUT OF TOWN AND COULDN’T PLAY IT FOR HOURS!!! *Ahem* While I was running said errand I told my brother to play on it and give it a run for it’s money. Then I came home... (At like 8pm) I played Tifanfall 2 Doom Eternal Halo 5 Gears 5 Apex SW BF 2 till something-o’clock in the morning!!! THE XBOX LIVED!!!! THE THERMAL PASTE SAVED IT FROM BECOMING A FATA** PAPER WEIGHT!!!! I was so ecstatic!!! After all the troubles the poor Xbox and I went through this thermal paste brought it back to peak condition and my heart soared once more!!!To sum it all up... This product is great! Five stars for sure! No issues ever since the fix!
5,I decided on this thermal paste after a recommendation from a friend. I used this on my first PC build and it seems to be working as intended in helping to keep my CPU cool. There is also plenty left for future builds if needed. Definitely a great low priced option for thermal paste.
5,I have been using Arctic Silver paste for many years. I’ve always found the quality of this product to be very good and in many computer builds it does a very good job at lowering CPU and chips at temperatures. I can highly recommend this over cheaper alternatives that while they may advertise to be similar I have always found this to be just a little higher quality for not much extra money. It takes such a small amount of this paste that even a small tube will last for a very long time. Can highly recommend.
5,Tried and true arctic silver 5.  I have this stuff in a PC I built over a decade ago.
5,The previous reviews and five star rating from over 3000+ people speak for itself. My 2009 Macbook Pro was no longer displaying anything on the screen and the logic board was the culprit. Over many heating and cooling cycles the soldering joints holding things together develop fractures. This resulted in my fans kicking on hard almost constantly for about a year prior to failure. If your logic board has failed go to your favorite search engine and look up "baking logic board" and you'll get a ton of information on how to go about trying a last ditch effort to resurrect your computer/laptop.1. Remove your heat sink/cooler and clean thoroughly with isopropyl alcohol (I used 70% alcohol and it seems to work just fine). You'll also want to thoroughly clean your CPU and the immediate surrounding area of old thermal compound. Old compound can crack and become hard so try not to spread it too far from where it was previously. When the alcohol hits the old compound it'll thin out and become a huge mess so try and contain it! Once you think you have everything clean clean it again and possibly another time. You want to make sure you have a 100% oil free and clean surface on both the CPU and heatsink. When you think it's clean enough give it a wipe with a clean microfiber or coffee filter.2. Apply thermal paste is one of the most subjective things about it. How much what shape whether or not to spread it across the CPU etc. The size of the CPU on a Macbook Pro is relatively small and I put a the equivalent of a swollen grain of rice dead center of the CPU. If you've ever played with silica gel balls it was about that size. I didn't spread it with a credit card or do anything other than apply in the center. When you spread it out over the top of the CPU you run the risk of getting air bubbles gaps in coverage and spillover. Many videos will suggest different things but I thing a circular dot in the middle provides your best coverage. It's difficult to get it right and I had to do it twice the first time but haven't had any issues since.3. Install the heatsink evenly and in one movement DO NOT lift it once it touches the compound as that'll result in bubbles/gaps. Once in place begin tightening everything down evenly and put the rest of your computer back together.4. Once everything is together run your computer through multiple heating and cooling cycles to "age" the compound and have it seat properly. This will ensure you get an even bond between the heatsink and CPU for maximum thermal transfer from the CPU to the heatsink.It took me two tries to get the correct amount right but since then I've been running with these paste on for almost eight months and have seen no issues. The fans rarely kick on hard and if they do it is under a lot of load. I wish I picked this up as soon as I noticed my fans constantly running as it could have saved my logic board from failure.
5,Thank God for Youtube and the Saints that make how to videos. I simply took my fan off my computer tower put in a pea sized amount of this Thermal Paste and it dropped the heat by 10 degrees . My computer works so fast now Im really enjoying this . Arctic Silver 5 AS5-3.5G Thermal Paste is a Godsend. Thank You !.
5,Not all thermal greases are the same. If you're custom-building a rig Arctic Silver 5 should be just as essential to that build as the motherboard.I've used Arctic Silver 5 on more builds than I can count but it really speaks for itself when I take OEM systems out of service and replace the stock thermal grease with Arctic Silver 5. I have a Lenovo ThinkCentre Tiny with a Haswell-based i3 CPU that I use as a music server. I love the Tiny systems but their size means they run hot. Before I replaced the stock grease the i3 in that system was running at 177 degrees Fahrenheit (81 degrees Celsius) when it was barely over 50% load and the hard drive usually stayed around 135 degrees Fahrenheit (57 degrees Celsius). After Arctic Silver 5 the same CPU never breaks 123 degrees Fahrenheit (51 degrees Celsius) at full load and with the excess CPU heat gone the hard drive runs at around 91 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius).I won't get too much into the details of my custom-build main rig but the Ivy Bridge i7 combined with Arctic Silver 5 and a Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO has never broke 105 degrees Fahrenheit (41 degrees Celsius) while it was maxed out during any of the 1080p video rendering jobs I've had in front of me. It also never broke that during the initial extended burn-in testing I performed when I built the system back in June 2012.All this may not mean much to anyone and there might be people out there who think thermal grease is unimportant. Arctic Silver 5 proves that assumption wrong. By using Arctic Silver 5 your CPU temps will be lower. When your CPU temps are lower less heat is generated inside the case. When you have less heat your hard drives and graphics cards run a little cooler. This means you won't have to deal with parts overheating; ergo your investment will last longer.All you need to make that happen? An $8 tube of thermal grease. Honestly when you've spent as much as you have on your rig $8 is nothing. Think of how much you spent just to buy your graphics card and CPU. Now compare that to the $8 you'll spend to buy Arctic Silver 5.While you're buying that Arctic Silver 5 also think of buying an aftermarket CPU cooler too. Arctic Silver 5 is only half the battle in keeping your rig running smoothly--and let's face it: there's not a single Intel or AMD stock cooler that will keep your chip cool. There's always been a contentious debate between air and liquid cooling but whatever you choose will work better than what came in the box with your chip.I've bought a lot of Arctic Silver 5 in my time and I'll gladly keep buying it as long as it works as well as it does. No other thermal grease I've used--from greases included in the box with aftermarket coolers to the stuff Radio Shack used to sell--has dissipated heat more effectively.
5,I used it to coat a Ford TFI ignition module to transfer heat to the heat sink. It worked well.
5,Be me 13 years ago. Built a brand new firebreather. Top of the line PC (for a college nerd anyway). Playing WoW at top graphics. I'm questing as a Tauren in Thunderbluff on top of one of those plateus (just hearthed back). Do you know why I remember this so vivedly? Because my PC froze for the last time. I learned a hard lesson: always apply a small pea-sized bit of paste and ensure it covers most if not all of the CPU backing without billowing over.I hadn't covered enough of the CPU so it overheated. The CPU had fried because the temperature shutdowns we have today weren't as robust. Huge bummer.Fast forward to a month ago (August 2018). Have about a year old custom PC. PC freezes during a stress test just after overclocking the CPU. First mistake: I used a stress test that tests the CPU and GPU so it makes it difficult to determine if it's due to the CPU overclock the motherboard or just the GPU failing (which has happened to me a few times. Learn from this mistake and use Prime95). I just think it's a bad CPU overclock. I set the CPU back to normal settings. The PC still freezes periodically (maybe once every hour?) It drives me insane for a few weeks of troubleshooting cleaning out my case reseating the graphics card in the other PCI-e slot reformatting etc. I can't pinpoint what it is without $200 technician software. No thanks.I order a new PSU thinking maybe I screwed up voltages and fried my power supply (over $100) and I order this thermal paste. Thermal paste arrives first. I very thoroughly clean the CPU of any year-old thermal paste with coffee filters/Q-tips and 91% isopropyl alcohol re-seat and apply the small pea-sized bit of paste to the CPU.The PC hasn't frozen since. What did I learn? Make sure your thermal paste is thorough but not too thorough (lesson learned 2004). What was my most recent lesson? Remove and reapply at least once a year even if the paste says it lasts multiple years. I had ARCTIC MX-4 on the CPU for a year and it said it is supposed to last for at least 8 years. With how dry it was (a layer was dry and really hard to remove from the CPU) I respectfully disagree. You could end up spending $6 versus hundreds (2018). The learning never ends.Remember less is more but also make sure you cover the whole thing. It's a thin line. Watch the Youtube vids I didn't have back in 2004. They help a ton.
5,I can only compare to the thermal compound that comes with the Cooler Master 212 Hyper. Use   Belkin Anti-Static Wrist Band with Adjustable Grounding         for static protection. Apply grain size dot on processor and used inside of zip-lock plastic bag to smooth out to cover processor evenly apply more depending on spread. It's better the start out with less then add as needed. End of story.First I have an Ivy league MOB and processor (Asrock Z77 Intel i7 3770) so your temps may very. I also have the Storm Enforcer case with a top fan. I downloaded Core Temp from alpcu(dot)com so I could see my 4 cores on my system tray (bottom of screen). Before switch my CPU had 27303034-37C running mediaplayer radio surfing the web and editing with Photoshop. Yes idle doesn't tell you anything.Switched to Arctic Silver. Dropped 5C was running at 25-2728-3026-2928-30.While rewriting this review I've kept Adobe Flash with a lot of symbels and animation on repeat and running Media player radio with speakers at half volume.

5,I don’t know how much input I can add with this paste having overwhelmingly positive results but I’ll try my best. I own a “custom” MSI GT80S Titan and a long while back I tore the thing apart because something went wrong with it. At the time I had no thermal paste and I didn’t know that you need to replace the paste every time you detach the heat sink from the thing it’s attached to. So I just put it back together with the broken-up paste and used it. It worked; it’s not like it overheated or anything but the fans kicked up to full gear almost immediately on every intense application.Recently more things went wrong with the laptop (trust me this isn’t a retail copy from MSI so don’t blame them) and I purchased this thermal paste. I did so because at this point I realized that it needed to be replaced. I opened up my system for the nth time and proceeded to replace it. The previous paste was applied… generously. Whoever did it clearly didn’t realize that most of the time less is more when it comes to paste. There was so much excess that I needed to scrape much of it off of the chip itself because it overflowed like crazy. The CPU was the worst; I swear they used a whole tube on the CPU alone. With research I learned that a small pea-sized dot in the center is sufficient. After I cleaned all of the previous paste off I did so and I placed the coolers back in their spots.I don’t have any pre and post temperature readings but I already notice a difference. For example pre-pasting my thermals while gaming were up there. When I launched a game like GTA V both of my fans kicked on instantly to full blast. After this paste they don’t do that. It takes about five minutes of actual game time (before they’d turn on in the menu) before I hear them. Even then they rarely ever get to full blast and if they do it’s only for a little bit. I’m actually really surprised that thermal paste can make such a difference. I do have one thermal measurement actually and it’s that both my GPU and CPU reached 85 Celsius under full load via the Fire Strike benchmark. That’s commendable for a laptop.I’m honestly surprised at how well this Arctic Silver works. I won’t be using any other brands in the future even if this stuff is quite expensive for the tiny amount you receive.
5,I bought this because of the great reviews. My desk top computers fan was working very hard and I could hear it all of the time. Opening the computer I found the fan and heatsinks were full of dust. I pulled the fan out to clean and reinstalling it I needed to replace the old thermal paste. So I cleaned the old dried out paste completely added this new thermal paste put it back together and my computer is as quiet as it was new! When doing this I grounded myself to prevent any electrical static. I did NOT use a vacuum cleaner inside. Vacuums can also cause static electricity. I was careful and took my time and noted which screws go where.
5,Thermal Compound Heat Transfer Your Cooler and CPU. This Item is often overlooked or as a after thought. First Off this is one of the most important items when you build Gaming Computers and Servers with multi quad 4 CPUs I have never had a heat related failure using this product. This Thermal Compound has proved itself in our computer Lab. We test and toss clean CPU Clean Your Cooler Seating Area or base of your heat sink. Second off is a clean machine. We Add On to all air intake fans filters   BGEARS 120mm Fan Filter With Washable Filter        . We buy only from Amazon why they are at the top of our charts on Vendors. Thank you Amazon. www.amazon.com also their customer support is beyond reproach. We lap our CPU or Heat Sink if needed so that the contact area will be in full contact with your heat sink. A Intake fan filter to us is worth its weight in platium. Thermal compound is the life of any machine. I have had machines come in fo some type of service like a upgrade on a video card    GeForce 9500 GT 1024 meg that will support hybrid computing [[ASIN:B001EA6ZA4 SPARKLE SFPX95GT1024U2H GeForce 9500 GT 1GB GDDR2 PCI-EXPRESS 2.0 HDTV S-Video Graphics Card         This Video card is another Gem that is over looked because no one knows who sparkle is It is G Force with a Sparkle sticker on it. Before we started putting fan filters we get a machine in that looks like the Heat sink and computer insides have grown hair including cobwebs The Only Thing that Saved that computer....Is this thermal compound again Amazon gives us the ability to have 5 stars. From our Tests From cobwebed All the customer wanted was a simple ram upgrade. Not from heat related failure The cobwebs and General goop the heat sink attracts and still the Thermal compound still worked 30 stars with the cooler burnt goop on it proving it works then putting it on the test table and temps are just a few degrees above normal. Only thing that saved this coomputer was the Thermal Compound between the Main processor and the heat sink. I have just about tested all thermal compounds I can get my hands on and for the few dollars Artic Silver 5 works and holds it Heat conduction Properties Longer than most Again since this is a regular customer intake fan filters were added to this machine at no cost. Another Over looked Gem. And Very Dollar efficient Item from Amazon
5,This isn't the highest end product on the market but it's at the high end of what I'd call the mainstream thermal pastes. Thermal paste is designed to prevent tiny air gaps that insulate and prevent heat transfer between a hot item (in this case usually a CPU or GPU) and another item (in this case usually a heat sink).  These gaps are caused by tiny pits in materials and imperfection in the flatness of the materials.  Remember you don't want any more than is necessary to fill the tiny air gaps caused by these tiny imperfections because it's good but not as good a conductor as the solid aluminum or copper in your heat sink. I could write out the heat transfer equations but think of thermal conductivity this way with regard to computers and heat sinks:Copper > Aluminum > AS5 Thermal Paste >>>> Air. The idea is only to avoid the air but generally to avoid things further to the right in favor of things further to the left so you want to fill in the air gaps and no more.This tiny little tube is enough for multiple applications.  From the Arctic Silver product web page:“Coverage Area:A 3.5 gram syringe contains enough compound to cover at least 15 to 25 small CPU cores or 6 to 10 large CPU cores or 2 to 5 heat plates. At a layer 0.003" thick the 3.5 gram syringe will cover approximately 16 square inches.”.003” is about the thickness of a #15 bond piece of paper.  We aren’t talking more than enough to look like a film.  Prep the surface by cleaning everything carefully with alcohol or the   ArctiClean Kit         spread it extremely thin just creating a film and it will do its job once the two surfaces are pressed together by the mounting clamps.I have seen it lose its effectiveness.  This could be due to vibration and shock from relocation because the paste sets up over time and becomes extremely viscous maybe even hard.  If you suddenly feel like your fan is spinning up more a year or two down the road it's probably dust but if you clean out the dust bunnies and it still seems like everything is running hotter and noisier it's time to disassemble clean and prep the surfaces carefully and reapply.
5,This is a really good product. But it does serve a specific purpose compared to other TIMs I would say niche but is common enough where that might not apply.It's important to note that this product is severely over-hyped especially with novice or newer system builders. First time I used it was nearing 10 years ago and I've found different TIMs serve different purposes.If you're looking for a TIM for the sole purpose of reducing your temperatures this is not the TIM to get. It's been at least 5 years or so since this has been the case in the case of temperature reduction Arctic Silver 5 is outdated. I would suggest to check system builder forums for which ones are best for reducing temperatures to find a product that will work for you but my personal favorites for reducing temperatures are Cool Laboratory Ultra/Pro for a metal TIM and Phobya HeGrease for a non-conductive TIM. Both of those 2 and many others can get temperatures of near 10 degrees Celsius lower than Arctic Silver 5.So what is Arctic Silver 5 good for? What is its niche you may be asking? As I said it does have its place even being somewhat outdated.-What Arctic Silver 5 is good for is being above average for the pre-applied(stock) TIMs that come with some CPUs and more importantly-For being one of the most "durable" TIMs and the most "durable" that I've personally used. With a lot of the newer TIMs you will ideally want to replace them every 6 months - 1 year which for some applications like adding TIM to a dozen mosfets or GPU might not sound appealing or maybe you just never want to re-apply TIM on your CPU again unless you have too.-OEM builders that have clients that request a aftermarket TIM applied to parts(that don't request a specific brand).-Someone making a system for a friend or family member that isn't very hardware-knowhow you can just apply it and know it should be good for years.With Arctic Silver 5 if you apply if properly it can last in a semi-paste state without hardening or cracking for years. And I can personally attest to an old system I used it on which I replaced the Arctic Silver 5 TIM after 4.5 years and it was still paste-like and not dried up.
3,I used to use AS5 in the mid 2000s back in the Athlon64 days so I bought another tube recently on a whim since it was cheap.  It was applied immediately on a 5800x (using NH-C14S) and a 5900x (NH-D14) but it felt like the temps were a bit too high for these coolers.  I replaced the paste with MX-4 paste and the temps dropped 3-4 immediately and didn't seem to spike up as quickly.This obviously isn't the most scientific study and the AS5 wasn't given more than a few weeks to cure but I don't think this is the best option in 2022.  I'll keep it around for testing purposes and will rely on something else for long term use.5 stars for ease of application 2 stars for clean up.  This stuff feels wayyy greasier than I remember and caused some trouble trying to get it off of the processors.
5,What is there to say… this paste reigns supreme and has been around forever now.Expect cooler temps compared to most brands. It is a little pricey compared to others for good reason.
4,There have been so many mixed reviews on this thermal paste that I am starting to think that it doesn't really make a difference if you don't apply it correctly. As far as thermal paste goes this is high quality it isn't the best but it is a good mid-grade overclocking thermal paste that last a long time.How to apply THIS thermal past:1.) Put a half-pea size in the middle. (a little goes a long way)2.) But the heat sink over and twist it back and forth carefully a few mm to cover.At this point you can practice this method by lifting the Heat Sink to see how much you put if it goes over the edges of the chip congrats! You just put waaaaayyy too much. Either way if you are satisfied what how it looks (it doesn't have to be perfect around 70-80% coverage should do) CLEAN OFF AND REAPPLY3.) When attaching heat sink MAKE SURE NOT TO LET IT LIFT OFF. That would creat air pockets which allow heat.4.) Turn on CPU and overclock it a bit hot to spread evenly for about an hour or so. If it runs hotter than it previously was when idle you did it wrong.5.) Don't overclock right away the container says 200 hour set in time. I would say give it a few days then it should be at 100%.Pros:-It's High Quality Thermal Paste-Lasts a while (both the tube and the compound itself)-15 or so applications tube depending on what you are using it for-Cheap-lazier method of applicationCons:-Not the best of the best-200 hours set in time (over-estimated to ensure potential)-Different application method than most thermal compounds that requires a bit of practiceDon't expect to get much results other than a max of ~5C or so. If you do get anywhere near or more than that you just needed to get some new compound or dusted of the fans/heat sink.I used this for all my CPUs GPUs PS3 and XBOX. Works for almost anything based off computer design but make sure to follow manufacturer's recommendation when possible (may not be great for everything).
5,I've been building PC's for a local computer shop (everything from high end water cooled gaming rigs budget builds cheap email boxes linux rigs servers parts bin rigs and everything in between) myself (usually nicely spec'd budget gaming rigs and home media servers) and family (modest "future proofed" and parts bin builds) for about a decade.I've used a lot of different thermal pastes including the pads that come on stock coolers pastes that come with aftermarket coolers glues ceramics copper silver some weird white stuff lots!The Arctic Silver 5 has in my experience consistently lowered temps and helped to get the most out of any cooler I've purchased for myself someone else or a clean out of an older machine.I'm really impressed by the features AS5 has up it's sleeve.Pros:-It's performant. Even on chips that I've uncovered from "custom builds" from others where the CPU heat spreader is scratched or a stock cooler has a poor finish AS5 seems to improve performance ALWAYS. Even if it's one degree or keeps the temp down an extra minute or so on a failing part it works very very well.-It cleans up very easily even after being caked on for years. (A bit of isopropyl alcohol goes a long way!)-It keeps a long time. I've found tubes of AS5 in tool sleeves that I've lost for a year or two and had no issue using the AS5 in the tube. Most other included thermal paste/greases I've used will harden or get gummy.Cons:-It seems to not be available locally. If you need to run out to a local supply shop I've usually only found other products so I make sure to have some on hand.-It's the same price per tube as much bigger tubes of others. I still think that due to how well it performs it's worth buying more often.Bottom line:-If you're installing a new CPU cooler building a new PC have overheating issues are cleaning out an older machine give AS5 a shot. It's a very good performing product and for a few bucks it's often the saving grace that can restore PC/hardware performance.
5,I recently had a stretch of bad luck with a CPU I had built.  The system was a dream right up until the heavy video card sagged the PCI slot bracket right out of the board and caused catastrophic damage to the CPU and motherboard.  I attempted to replace the mother board via RMA with the vendor but received boards that were Dead on Arrival for other reasons.After receiving defective replacement 4 boards I opted to buy from another company and received a working board and am once again happily geeking out with my rebuilt PC.  While going through the repeat RMA processes the CPU and the cooling block needed to have fresh thermal paste reapplied each time.  This was simply due to the length of time sending and receiving items was taking.  I picked up Arctic Silver 5 AS5-3.5G Thermal Paste off of Amazon and was very pleased with my purchase. Here is why:The delivery was fast and the product was undamaged. The size of the product is such that it can be reapplied several times too without exhausting the container quickly.  The product was very thick but it spread well across surface of the chip and block.  It had a tackiness / stickiness to it that made it hold the cooling block and the CPU together very well.  Temps on the system read very good which is a combination of things such as the cooling unit the air flow demand on the system and of course the paste... I have no doubt this paste is doing it job well in keeping things cool.I have bought this paste serval times now and will continue to do so as we build and rebuild systems for the nerdy members of my family.  I'd recommend the product to anyone looking to build a PC be it for a business or as a home system.  The economy of the item is great.  You get several applications and the cost is fantastically low.  Finally buying this item through amazon as with many other item makes repeat purchases and returns easy to do.
4,Simply put the CPU I was going to use it on wasn't possible due to a number of circumstances involving a dead motherboard trying to replace it and giving up for alternative solutions. As such next time I can actually use it I'll a better review then but I'd say this still is a solid thing to get to ensure quality cooling no matter what.
5,I was terrible in Chemistry/Physics/even Math in high school--but I 'killed' the ACT composite without studying due to my comprehension skills.  Back then PCs just weren't even real computers yet (I'm 43 that was 1986). So when I learned I loved working on/using computers I felt 'challenged' until I had some successes then really got into building my own HTPCs.  Now I do it all sorts of computer repairs so I know good stuff.This is good stuff.My reason for mentioning chemistry is that I can't imagine the 'how' but the end result is that Arctic Silver's 'formula' whatever it looks like 'up close' (I'd guess an atomic microscope would do it justice) it does a better job than any 'white-paste' substitutes (just what they are).For anybody balking at the 'price-tag' here just download the (absolute) freeware called 'Speedfan' and test your current PC's internal temps as is then open it up (or have somebody else do it and watch what they do) and replace that nasty old cooling 'sealant' (I call it it sets up so bad from its own heat)...then put it all back together run 'Speedfan' again and watch your PCs internal temps fall drastically.I'm the cheapest person I know--I'm so cheap I'm the guy who picks up actual furniture and uses it himself (coming soon to your neighborhood!)...HOWEVER...when it matters you gotta think with 35 uses per tube this stuff it worth every penny.  Just think of saving 35 PCs with it and you'll begin to 'see the light'.It's awesome--'Silver 5' being the '5 different' kinds of actual Ag molecules in it is great and all but the stuff just does a better job sealing AND passing temperatures through what it's sealing too!If your 'PC Geek' 'Tech' or whatever does NOT use this find somebody who does and start using them for all your repairs.  If I sound like a sellout...I am.But I'm the guy with a 100% success record kick-butt HTPCs and still cheap enough that the only household furnishings I brag over are the ones I find on the side of the road.Really.  I'll stop now.
5,I have been building and repairing computer systems since 1992. In all of that time I have used many different thermal compounds. I even remember the rash of the all white stuff back in the late 1990's. Seriously however in all of that time I have never found a better solution for CPU heat dissipation than Artic Silver #5. I use it on all repairs even if there were no complaints about CPU temperatures. I change the thermal compound to Artic Silver #5 as a matter of preventive maintenance. This goes for very high end and heavily overclocked new systems. I have found that it works wonders on Laptop computers on both the CPU  and Graphic chips. As I stated before I have used all of the different thermal compounds through the years and when I first used Artic Silver #5 it quickly became the only thermal compound I will use. It works very efficiently on air cooled as well as water cooled systems. As a matter of action on new builds I am only using water cooling I always remove the default compound that comes preinstalled and replace it with Artic Silver # 5. On the high end water cooling systems many times you have a choice of whatever compound you choose to use for me it is always Artic Silver #5. Do not miss out on Artic Clean  #1 Thermal Material Remover and #2 Thermal Surface Purifier. You WILL NEVER GO BACK to 91% Isopropyl Alcohol to clean heat sink surfaces and processor surfaces and prepare those surfaces for new compound.  Absolutely no cons for this product . If you have the choice of ant thermal compound made always choose Artic Silver. I has a long term ability to get better and improve temperatures even further as it sets in over time. In most of my bench mark tests with Intel and AMD test rigs Artic Silver always has lower temperatures over other thermal compounds. It maintains the ability to keep temperatures stable even as voltages to processor are raised (within reason voltage changes). Just my humble opinions. Aloha from Maui
5,I've been using Arctic Silver for many years now and it remains the best of the best.  Why change brands when something works this well?  Something that I have not seen reviewed about this paste however is the shelf-life after you have used it once/twice/a few times and then don't open it again for a year or two.  I just re-opened mine after a year and it was as great as the day I first opened it.My current processor (i5-4670K) idles at 35 C with an EVO Plus cooler on it in push configuration.  Under moderately overclocked 100% load with Intel Burn Test I stayed at a steady 60 C.Pro Tip- DO NOT make rows or lines or X's or O's or squares or triangles any other nonsense when applying this compound to your processor.  You aren't Bob Ross.  Don't use a credit card or business card OR YOUR FINGERS don't try to spread it out don't watch any "Pro's" on Youtube.  Using more won't cool it more- to the contrary.Use the KISS method (that would be Keep It Simple Stupid)- Just push out a tiny bit onto a rag/napkin to get it going and ensure there are no air bubbles/pockets and then place a SLIGHTLY SMALLER THAN A PEA-SIZED AMOUNT on the center of the processor.  The only reason you even need this stuff is to fill in the microscopic imperfections in the surfaces that make contact with each other (namely the processor and your heat sink which hopefully is aftermarket) that occurs during mass-production.Install your heat sink and be done with it.The only thing you will accomplish if you attempt to spread it out or any other tomfoolery is causing damage to your very expensive chip board or both.  You will create air pockets by attempting this.The pressure from the heat sink in conjunction with the heat generated once it is powered up will be more than enough to ensure ample coverage over the cores.
5,I have used this thermal paste on a few computer builds now and it always works fantastically. One of the best parts is it does come in a resealable tube so if you're not using it all at once you can easily close it back up for use later and it won't go bad.This along with a Vetroo V5 keeps my 10700k at great temperatures which is great for such a high power use and hot processor. Artic silver has never failed me in a computer that I have built.I also used this to repasted the CPU and GPU in my Dell XPS 9560 which drastically brought down the temperatures. Dell seems to not use the best thermal paste in laptops and upgrading with some quality Artic Silver can only help.Lastly the best part about this thermal paste is the price. There is no need to spend $15-20 for some premium thermal paste brands because this will do the exact same thing with no noticeable differences. Highly recommend this whenever thermal paste is needed.
5,Paid $6.90 on September 10 2021.Used it on i7 10700K and i7 12700K with Corsair H60 and Arctic Freezer II 280 respectively. Got about 5 uses out of it so far (had some mounting issues and had to reapply thermal paste) and there seems to be more remaining in the tube. Worth the price I paid for it.
4,Bought this to replace the thermal paste on few macbooks pro we have for work. It helped with the temperature and definitely seems to keep things cooler.
5,This is my second order of Arctic Silver.  I try to replace my thermal paste annually and each time I use this brand I see an immediate lowering of my CPU temperatures.  Easy to apply and never dries out in the tube from what I can tell.
5,So I'd been having overheat issues on my nettop for awhile now.  The system would run slow and the fan would get VERY loud. I like to have several tabs open and move from tabs to tabs often.  But it just seemed to take forever. I was going to go ahead and buy another computer.  I went to a local repair shop and I forget what the price would be to repair but there was no way I was going to pay that.Then I searched overheat issues and seemed like my issue was that some parts may need thermal paste. I forget the names of the components as I am a dummy when it comes to pc stuff.  Anyways I went back to the repair place and asked the guy how much to just put a drop of the thermal paste at the spot I needed.  He said $15.  I was like WHAT??  Also he sold thermal paste just like this for $15.  I just gave him a look and he looked at me like "you want me to do it for free?"  No I didn't.  But I had told him I would just give him the piece that needed to be pasted so it wasn't like he had to uninstall anything.  I don't mind paying if someone has to put in real work so I though $5 would be fair.ANYWAYS I looked on youtube and there are several videos on how to paste this correctly otherwise you could mess things up.  As soon as I finished pasting the components I turned it on and it was like new again.  Well maybe not like new but 10 times better than before.here is the video I used youtube dot com /watch?v=r2MEAnZ3swQ
5,i tend to clean my pc  almost every 6 months & use this to keep my cpu & gpu cool. it works.
5,I usually purchase processor and heatsink combinations and I usually just use the pre-pasted thermal compound already on the heatsink. Unfortunately this go around my motherboard was bad and had to take apart the heatsink and processor combination. This left a slightly used uneven textured thermal compound on both the heatsink and processor.I have known of Arctic Silver for a very long time but this is the first time I've used it. I purchased this and followed the instructions online for priming and applying to both processor and heatsink. For my purposes I was using a Corsair H55 LC heatsink and an i5 LGA1151 processor. It instructs you to remove previous residue with coffee filter and high strength isopropyl alcohol. Then using a plastic card (i used a plastic razor blade) apply a small dab on the heatsink and spread evenly with plastic applicator to fill micro holes in heatsink. This i guess is sort of to smooth out and make sure there are minimal pores on the heatsink.For the i5 processor the instructions were to place a line of thermal paste the length of a quarter on the center of the processor. After doing so you can apply the heatsink which will spread the paste evenly.I'll be honest It scares me to apply thermal paste as i can see it not getting applied right and my CPU overheats. But after running a few benchmark tests I can say that i did a pretty good job and the core temp is not spiking but rather stays constant 30-35ish on idle.Overall I would recommend this for reapplication or just as a beginning application of thermal paste. I have not tested any other aftermarket brands so i really cant say any temp comparisons.
5,Used this when I replaced a graphics card in my late 2013 Mac Pro that had failed(old paste had dried hard and was useless) so I decided to redo it on both cards the temps on the cards was 120 degrees Fahrenheit max under load and in the mid 90s at idle.(The one working card showed triple digits at idle before and the other never showed as it had overheated and died)Needless to say I did all my other macs afterwards.Worth it!I’ll also be using it on any new builds I do.
5,This is one of the best products for the money. Never lets me down. Time tested.
5,I literally didn’t have any idea the tube would have more compound for the price I paid. Thank you Amazon
5,Good thermal paste. Just make sure that it doesn't get on the circuit as it's conductive.
4,Arctic Silver 5 is a medium priced thermal compound that works fairly well & is easy to apply.  It used to be king-of-the-hill but there are a couple of other brands that provide better thermal conduction.  The best is using solder but that is a difficult & permanent solution.  The next best is thermal adhesive (which is easier to apply but also permanent) or liquid metal type (which can be difficult to spread can be corrosive to some metals can be difficult to remove and are usually electrically conductive) then there are products like GC-2 which are easier to spread and are not permanent or electrically conductive/corrosive but are still fairly expensive.  Then there is Arctic Silver 5 which is still fairly good at heat transfer very easy to spread non permanent and non-electrically conductive at a fair price.  If you don't need the extra 5 degrees C cooling capability of the expensive high-end thermal compounds then AS5 might be a good choice for you.  If you are new to using thermal compound I recommend applying a small drop about the size of a large grain of rice (you will need less than you think) in the center of the processor's heat spreader place the heat sink squarely on top of the heat spreader and clamp down.  I like to give the heat sink a slight twist back & forth once or twice to help spread the compound a bit thinner.  You want the compound to be as thin as possible while still covering the entire contact area between the processor & heat sink.  By using a small drop of compound at the center of the processor & allowing it to spread when pressed against the heat sinc this will essentially prevent any air bubbles from forming between the 2.
5,This is the best thermal compound on the market. I've been using it for more than 8 years now and this is just  the second one I bought (if you use it properly 3.5 grams will last for about 25-30 CPU's) and just can't believe the diference in temperature when you change the stock paste for this magic little compound. Expect abount 8° less at full load 3-5° less at idle. I actually got 10° less at load and 2° less at idle (i have a small case that's not well ventilated (Lian Li PC-V351r) that's why the idle temps are so far from the load ones) using a Scythe BIG shuriken rev b on an AMD A6 5400k that's a little furnace (stock cooler and paste saw temperatures around 95° at load).The proper way to use this is the following:1.- Clean with rubbing or isopropyl alcohol ANY trace of the old paste until you have a shiny CPU and cooler (it must look like when it was new).2.- Apply a SMALL -rice grain sized and shaped- quantity of paste in the middle of your CPU/GPU3.- Install your cooler. The pressure that your cooler exerts will evenly distribute the paste (the paste's function is filling the air pockets between the CPU and the cooler so you don't need that much the cover the entire area) so there's no need to distribute it using your finger or anything of the like.If you like your PC you MUST use this paste on it. Your electronics will last longer because of the lower temperature and your fan will make less noise because of the better heat transfer between the CPU and the cooler.
5,Nice compound. Lowers my temps a decent amount compared to that really cheap Chinese stuff.What happened was I used the AMD compound that came on my FX-8350 cooler. Temps are fine max out at about 55 Celsius. However that fan is loud for my tastes so I'll be replacing it with a better cooler. I'll test this and maybe report temps back here...My laptop was a different story. I've got this old Gateway M-1624 with an AMD Turion 64x2 TL-60. The thing is HOT. My fan went out and I couldn't start the laptop so I replaced it. The fan came with that cheap stuff and it lowered temperatures significantly next to whatever foil sink concoction was going on inside the laptop... Originally would get to about 90 Celcius at times!! Especially during hot summer! With the other compound it seems to max at low 80's typically running 75-80 Celsius...However just to test it out I removed the cheap stuff and applied some of this! It runs significantly cooler now! Seems to max at high 70's but normal temps seem to be 70-75 Celsius. The massive heat from this laptop is certainly a result of the hot processor but it showed increased performance over the original cooling solution that was built into the laptop. It was also cooler than the cheap stuff that I put on to replace the stock setup.I think it's a good cheap solution for overall better cooling and I do suggest you try it out if cheaper stuff isn't working or you just need something to cool down your CPU in general. It's certainly working well for my hellish laptop. It'll most likely do the job for yours.
4,Still a great product even after decades of usage by millions. So great you have knock off syringes out in circulation.
5,I work for a computer repair shop. We use a lot of thermal paste. When we're doing a permanent installation of a CPU my techs ask for "the good stuff." AKA this. We have a handful of other brands we keep around when we're installing CPU's for diagnostics or in shop use but when it comes to sending it out into the big blue yonder in a customer's hands we use Arctic Silver. We've seen first hand that it is more effective at initial application and it lasts longer before needing to be reapplied. Highly recommend. [I know this review is glowing but it's not sponsored at all; I just happened to be ordering another tube and felt like using words.]
5,This is still the best thermal paste. Yes it  has been out for a long time but the reason is that it just works  and works well.
4,Not the best thermal paste on the market but decent price and does the job adequately.
