5,Finally! I have been searching for a simple baby monitor. Nothing fancy. Just the ability to see what baby is doing. This meets my needs perfectly. I like the VOX aspect - which turns the screen on when baby makes noise. The screen remains dark at night so it does not keep us awake (it’s bright) but if baby starts to cry the screen and audio come on which wakes us up. Perfect. If I want to see what she is doing all I have to do is push the button or I can leave screen on all the time. Lots of choices easy to set up no fees or aps to download. Simple and effective! I highly recommend this product!
5,I haven't used this monitor for that long but I'm satisfied with it so far. I ordered a camera mount that attaches to the crib for better placement of it. I like that it's secure and doesn't use wifi.
5,This Baby Monitor Works Great!The Picture is very clear. Night vision is also very clear. I've gotten a clear view on the monitor either way. With no interruptions or dropouts of any kind.The Audio sounds clean with very little to or no interference & can be turned up pretty loud as well (if needed).Couldn't be more happy with this purchase. Highly recommended!
5,Picked this monitor up for my 4 month old. I always base it on reviews. So far I like the size of it. Camera view is good. Only thing that’s too small for my liking is the cross pad to move camera. It’s all one button so it’s hard to push the corners. Overall happy with my purchase.EDIT : Figured out there’s a way to use the rest of the buttons to move camera around. My mistake! Review update to 5 Stars! Satisfied with my purchase! Exactly what I needed. Something to keep an eye on my little one while she sleeps without using wifi.
5,I bought this monitor to help us monitor our mother who after 93 years was failing healthwise. The video was clear and the audio adequate and the battery on the monitor lasted throughout the night. It works.
5,We are pretty happy with it the only thing is the music on it is too short the only way to Leo it going is to run a loop of all songs
5,This camera monitor works well set up easily and seems to have decent battery life when charged. I haven’t used it a great deal but when I have it’s been great. The night vision works well the panning is smooth. I will say the “zoom” is less than what I expected but overall I am pleased for the money the value.
4,It is really cool that it can turn and go up and down remotely giving you full view of the room. I would have given 5 stars but the night vision function it too sensitive and in the early morning the room is far to dark to see with the monitor but it still turns of the night vision
5,I am super excited to get this unit. I loved it so much that I gave it to daughter to watch her two dogs. This is a great little unit with an easy to use display. Both the screen and camera come with there own independent 5 volts charging wall adapters. The camera and monitor can both be used while charging which is great feature in itself. The monitor and camera last more than 12hrs each on a full charge when running on the built in battery. It takes about four hours to fully charge both units. The camera allows for easy pan tilt and zoom. The camera picture quality is above average for a camera this size. You can set the camera to play one of the user selected lullaby's. The camera comes with a temperature sensor built in with alarm function. The monitor has a handy feeding alert that can be set by the user. My favorite function is the ability to talk and listen both ways through the camera and the monitor. This unit does not need home WI-FI so great for privacy working range is pretty good. Strongly recommend to others.
5,For the money you cannot beat this. The picture quality isn’t the best but it’s good enough for the price! I love that it has different sensitivity levels for the noise and that it doesn’t need wifi because ours is hit or miss! I love this!
5,Creo que es la mejor compra que hice hasta el momento. Funciona súper bien buena imagen buen sonido práctico fácil de conectar súper buen precio (lo compre en oferta relámpago) y además tienes posibilidad de conectar con más cámaras sin necesitar internet. Puedo hacer mis cosas en casa sin tener esa sensación de que mi bebé se despertó. Simplemente reviso el monitor y listo. Realmente me simplifico la vida caóticamente hermosa que llevo como mamá de 4 hijas.
5,So far so good! It’s a great monitor to keep an eye on my little guy in his play room and we take it with us when we travel. I love the zoom and pan feature.
5,This is the perfect monitor for watching over my senior mother to ensure her safety.  The camera auto sets for day and night vision without effort. Love this monitor.
3,So this baby monitor is fine- but for the price I ultimately returned it for a vtech one that I already have (needed a second). I personally don’t need the camera to move I just need to see my little one in his crib so that feature was lost on me. The picture quality is good the night vision is good as long as it’s not pointed near a window while the sun is still going down. My issues with it are small but ultimately made me return it.1) the screen is so bright. I take care of my son at night and my husband works early so checking on the baby was like turning on the tv. It has brightness settings and the lowest one was too high for me.2) the camera is really zoomed in and doesn’t allow you to zoom out.3) the ports for cables on both units (camera and monitor) pretty much suck. One gust of wind would knock them out just a hair and suddenly you’re no longer working. Which is frustrating when-4) battery life on the monitor is about five hours. Not nearly enough to last all night. That was determined in about 1hr and 15min when I’d lost 1 out of 4 bars so maybe the last bar hangs on longer or something I didn’t actually time it but it’s not super long. My other baby monitor lasts like 20.At the end of the day it worked great and if I hadn’t tried anything else I may not have noticed these things but that’s just me experience. Also I got it for around $50 on a sale. Hope that helps!
4,Wonderful everyone should purchase this product. It has been a game charger in our family. I love that you can take the monitor with you. It is better than our previous monitor. Our previous monitor had issues with connecting to other people phones.
5,The camera is really nice. I love that I can move it to find the baby in her crib as she moves around a lot. I like it has music.It does have a weird noise that it keeps making like it stops sound and has a static noise for a second or 3.
4,The monitor itself is great and easy to install I just wish that it had a better range of motion for the camera. I had to replace our previous one with this product and the camera doesn’t go down as far as the one we had before so I had to rearrange some things in our son’s room to have a good view of his crib. But overall I am satisfied based on the price.
4,It’s great to keep an eye out for my Infant when she’s asleep. But the battery dies pretty fast. I’m glad the wire is long enough to reach the outlets. Overall it’s still pretty good for the price.
4,Just opened it and got it set up. Everything seems great. Monitor is nicely sized. Night vision quality could be better but for the price I can’t complain. Easy to operate. Sound is great and daytime video quality is great. Wish it had an antenna but still pretty good without it. Camera pan/tilt is also a great feature. I would recommend this product.
5,It works really well for what we need it for.  I wish the Lullaby function only worked in the room.  I don’t need to hear the music on the monitor
4,We bought this monitor because the more expensive/fancier one that streams to our phones has always been unreliable (sound and/or picture cutting out grainy image quality connectivity issues). This monitor does everything and more! I especially love that I can rotate the camera from the monitor. Great purchase.
5,Lo único es que la cámara debe estar siempre conectada. No es inalámbrica y eso no es lo ideal. La visión es buena aunque no excelente para el precio muy buena.
5,Just set up the unit but so far seems like it will work well.  Will come back and edit review after using it for a couple weeks.
4,I’m excited to use this camera. I gave it 4 stars because it turned on and is already beating the vetch one I bought prior in that department. Maybe 5 stars once it is charged and I can use it! Stay tuned!
4,So far it's been great keeps me connected to me baby while doing things around the house knowing g I can hear or see him anytime
4,This product is really nice honestly. The camera quality is one of the nicest I've seen. My only issue is the zoom if the actual camera. I wasn't able to see my child's entire crib. If it could zoom out a little more it would be the best monitor I've tried.
4,I was surprised how clear the picture was sound quality was good as well.Only issue was when it plays the lullaby is you hear it on the monitor as well (maybe I just don't know how to work it) but thats was just 1 thing I did not like.
4,It’s awesome for the price I wish it was possible to zoom out and the controls were a little more simple battery life on the monitor is not the best but doesn’t change the fact that it is a good product.
5,Product neatly packaged and has great quality for its price. Glad I chose this product versus a more expensive product. Looking forward to getting it set up after baby is born.
4,Arrived promptly. Looks good. I have not yet tried the monitor but look forward to using it right away. It will be perfect for our home I like that it does not need to connect to Wi-Fi or a phone.
