4,Sometimes these things are tricky to install but so far this one works.  For the price i will buy it again.
5,I've always used these for my phones and they're amazing! Holds up fantastic!!! I've never had a cracked phone screen under this temperd glass! Phone flew out of my jeep even and still no Crack lol
5,Easy to put on and provides good screen protection without impairing phone usage.
4,Durable. Long lasting. Properties just as described.
4,Not worth the hassle. Get tempered glass
5,Had this screen protector on for a while now it just saved my phone. Dropped it face down and thankfully only the protector shattered screen isn’t damaged. Only thing is I wish it also covered the front camera since i sustained minor cosmetic scratches (prior to the fall). Other than that awesome cheap investment.
5,I just now replaced my screen protector after installing the first one 9 months ago!! Something I touch and use every single day…and you get 3. Definitely worth the price and by far the best screen protector on the market!! Had to come back and leave a review I’m so impressed.
5,The screen protector for the iPhone mini 13 was super easy to install. I installed the protector on a brand new phone that wasn't setup and had not been touched at all. I removed the factory display protector wiped it with a microfiber dust cloth just to make sure nothing was on the device. I then placed the installation guide on top of the phone. Removed the adhesive side of the protector film and placed it on the phone lining it up easily. It went on very smoothly without any issues. I smoothed out the few bubbles on the device with the cloth and a bubble tool which I already had and it was ready to use.Simple cheap pain free installation and it appears to be a high quality tempered glass screen protector thus far.
4,The frame provided goes around the phone and makes these very easy to place precisely
5,I’ve had this for a couple weeks now and it feels great and has held up well. It was also very easy to install. The only thing is it can be a bit difficult to read the screen when wearing polarized sunglasses as it has quite a bit of glare in this situation. That is a nitpick though and other than that they are great!
3,Product was easy to get on by following the instructions. 2 of them would not adhere in the top right of the screen for some reason.
5,I've only had the current protector on for a few weeks but I've already taken it to the beach on hikes and all kinds of places that probably would have scratched the softer screen material. It's holding up very well. AND it's super easy to install. Mine is slightly crooked which was my own fault but because of the plastic guide it covers the actual screen itself despite my error.I'd highly recommend.
5,I suck at installing screen protectors so I always end up with dust particles in there but it saves my phone screen every time and that’s what matters!
5,I was really surprised how easy it was putting the screen on. Took less than 5 minutes and with no bubbles. Pack came with 3 screens 3 wipes and plastic  cover guide. Glad I brought these.
5,I've always opted to not use screen protectors or cases because I like the way my phone feels without them. I decided to give this one a try and I barely notice it on the screen. It was easy to install I just wish I hadn't allowed myself to be pulled away in the middle of installation. I had cleaned the screen got pulled away and then I installed the screen protector a minute later and there was already dust underneath. Installing the screen protector immediately after cleaning the screen prevents that from happening but oh well. Fortunately there are three protectors so I am still able to have a dust free screen.
5,The screen protector is pretty great. I’m constantly dropping my phone but this plus my otter box over it total protection. Every 4-6 months I’ll notice a crack normally a large one and at that point I just switch out the protector. The application is super easy and takes about 10 minutes to do it properly. No bubbles and good adhesive. Yes I have to change it out every now and then but better the protector than the screen itself! 10/10 will repurchase when I use my 3rd.
5,Easy to put use. Love it
5,Feels sturdy and similar to all other tempered glass screen protectors I’ve used. Cut out is perfectly aligned but does leave quite an unprotected gap over the front facing camera. However I don’t see it being a big issue and love this product.What sets this product apart is the price and the application. It’s a fantastic design and value. It has 3 sets of screen protectors. It comes with a little plastic applicator. You put it on top of your phone and it acts like a bumper so that you can install the screen protector in exactly the right place in just one try. Each protector also comes with cleaning supplies to prevent dust during application. Will only be buying this brand from now on for this feature.
5,Love it
5,Had phone on bike mount & while riding it fell off & hit ground face down. Protector was completely cracked but once I peeled it off glass was still perfect. See photo. The case I have is a wallet case.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 See videothe protector is on my phone and installation was easy thanks to the alignment tray AmFilm includes. they also include so much packaging and so many screen wipes it’s nigh impossible to tell where the screen protector itself is inside their packaging. In a market so concerned with user experience this seems odd.Will update if the protector is anything other than standard. It has rounded edges extends to but not underneath my Apple leather case whe has no bubbles so far.There is some misalignment around the camera/sensor cutout but screen is protector led and cameras are uncovered.
5,Good thank you
4,The case is attractive and easy to install. It did not include a cover to protect the glass front of the phone so I purchased that separately. I was able to attach a pocket to the back so I can store my drivers license and charge cards.
4,Product came in a timely manner and was exactly what was advertised. Very durable!
5,I have used several different sizes of amFilm screen protectors on family phones over many years. They always provide good functional protection and last (for me) for years. Installation of these things is always tricky but the directions provided and method used for installation make it about as easy as it can be. Recommended.
5,Installation was easy and the fit was perfect. The quality is right up there. No complaints! Great value!
5,Very good
5,Easy install
4,Its thin- I'm used to an otterbox so this is very different but functional. I don't think I'll have anywhere near the protection in the event of a drop but that remains to be seen. It was hard to get out of the package and I pulled on it pretty hard and now theres a bit of a stretched area on the bottom but thats on me. Careful when you take it out of the packaging.
5,The installation guide that fit around the phone is amazing. This is the first screen protector I've bought that had this guide and I'll never buy a screen proctor without one again. It perfectly aligns the screen protector to the phone. No issue with bubble either.
4,I had a hard time installing the first one even after following the instructions to the tee. It didn’t sit right and I ended up with two huge bubbles. I readjusted it but that was a big mistake and I had to throw it away. This is why I love that this set came with 3. The second one fits like a charm—only 2 tiny bubbles on the edge. I can live with that.
3,I couldn’t install this successfully without bubbles unfortunately. Had to get a different brand however it did stick (even with the bubbles) and hold very well! If you’re more talented at installation they might work.
5,Doubted the front piece would work with my cover but it did.  installation a breeze with great directions and a handy plastic "guide"  Also adheres with NO bubbles.  About the best thing I've ever bought from AMZ!
4,The fact that it comes with three screen protectors for the price is solid. If you mess up once you have two other tries. Luckily the application process is easy as there’s a plastic guide that you put over the phone. Took off a star because I applied last night and already have a small scratch.
5,This glass screen was fairly easy to install and sealed well however when I installed my phone case over it I got a couple bubbles between the screen and phone face.  It's not the screen's issue as it lays flat when I didn't have the case on it and when I remove the case the screen protector lays flat again.  Not a big deal.  I'm overall very satisfied with this purchase.
5,I bought the amFilm protectors multiple times and have used them on multiple iPhone 13 Minis. The installation worked seamlessly in all cases. I followed the instructions and always do it near a bowl filled with hot water to avoid dust particles in the air. Not sure if it really helps but it doesn't hurt. I haven't had any major drops so don't have real protection experience besides normal daily use. So far I cannot complain and would buy them again if needed.
5,A must have for your device and a great value. Follow the instructions carefully make sure the screen is clean and you will have two extra screen protectors in reserve - you know for next time you drop your phone! The guide frame that's now included makes installation much easier than previous versions.
5,I only had my phone for one week when I took it on a very rocky hike. I dropped it face down on a jagged rock. The screen cracked down the middle. My heart sunk…until I took off this screen protector and found my phone screen still in perfect condition.  This screen protector did its job perfectly.
4,This product did meet my expectations
5,It did what I expected it to do and get my money’s worth
5,Very simple installation and a quality product. It fit my iPhone 13 mini like a glove. Very pleased.
5,I work in construction every day and this screen protector holds up beautifully paired with an otterbox. I also recommend camera screen protector.
5,Very durable! I drop my phone all the time 😂
5,And really inexpensive!  You get 3 of them for less than $6.  I remember paying $20 for one sticker-type thing they put on at the mobile phone store.  This is better cheaper and easier.  5 Stars
5,Extremely easy to install!! Just follow directions. I’ve used this brand before on other phones. It’s a great brand and definitely protects your screen. I’m impressed that it came with a alignment tool which made it so much easier to install!!
5,Very easy install system not available with other products.  When applied it feels looks and appears as if it solid glass.  Excellent product that we have on six different units.  Will definitely buy again if needed.
5,Bought this product last week; and the protector was very easy to install fits perfectly and works just as well as if there was nothing there. Actually it's better because it cuts down on fingerprints substantially! They even provide cleansing cloths to prep the screen for installation. Really can't believe the quality and quantity for the price. So far so great...
5,This was by far the easiest installation I've ever experienced with a screen protector. The tray snapped easily onto the phone the screen protector fit perfectly into place and it was super easy to press out any bubbles. I would absolutely recommend this product.One caveat: the product details say that it's resistant to fingerprints. I am not finding that to be the case but that's a small issue in my opinion. Definitely not worth passing on this product because otherwise it's awesome.
5,Love the guide for this and it sealed down so nicely.  No bubbles or issues after applied.  Use this phone to take pics for medical files. So in and out of my lab coat pocket frequently.  No issues at all. Look no more..you got iphone mini 13 this is the perfect shield for your phone
5,This seems like it will be a good screen saver. It was easy to put on and looks crystal clear. Can’t speak to its longevity but so far so good.
5,Good screen protector
4,This is a nice clear protector with no frills.
5,best yet - easy install using the enclosed guide/template that fits over phone screen taking the guesswork & anxiety out of placing the glass over the screen - this product makes getting it right the first time a breeze - also the precise placement is a big help eliminating trapped bubbles -
5,Very easy to install. would recommend!
5,Sturdy easy to put on price is right. Can't beat these protectors.
5,Excellent fit. Compatible with Apple’s silicone case. No image distortion; you’ll forget it exists.
5,Easy to apply it adheres so perfectly that I just put over my screen. Fits perfectly with my iphone case and for my iphone size (13 mini). Very happy with my purchase.
5,I’ve been buying this brand for a while and I know the protector works well.  I just got this for an iPhone 13 mini and the fit is perfect.  These kits now come with a little frame that helps you center the protector during application and it makes the process even easier.  Their customer service has been great in the past too.  I’ve recommended this brand to everyone I know.
5,I drop my phone a lot usually in a parking lot.  No cracks or chips ever.
5,What can I say?  They fit. They do the trick.
5,Easy to install 3 pack is nice fairly priced.
5,I had no problem with the installation and I’m very happy with the end product. Protector has been in use daily on my device for a couple of months now and I don’t see any problems whatsoever
5,Includes a plastic frame as a guide into which the phone fits. Makes applying the protective cover a breeze.
5,Exactly as described. Easy to use and great value.
3,Works well
5,I liked everything about the itemsI purchased! Very easy directions to follow!
5,Great quality product at a reasonable price
1,This is a reputable company that sells so many different screen protectors and you would think that their product quality is high.Well it is not.The ease of putting setting is great but the quality of the product is very poor. When you press your finger to slide on the screen the feeling is odd and jarring. It felt so uncomfortable that I thought it must be my hand and that I need to wash it. But I have continued to use the screen and my fingers are clean and still the texture is jarring and wildly uncomfortable.I would avoid this product at all cost and find something else in the market more suitable and more comfortable texture.
3,I received the products today and two of the three screens were damaged. They had large pieces of lint on the sticky side before I even peeled the first layer off to apply. I was very disappointed. I’d look for other listing before buying this again.
5,I loved the way I was able to get the glass on my phone perfectly and it doesn’t scratch easy it’s very protective yes I will purchase this from now on on my phone.
5,Easy to install  affordable and does the job great
5,It does what it supposed to do and is priced well.  There’s 0 reason to spend more on anything else
5,Quick & Easy to Install
5,I love that it brings 3 screen protectors.
5,Great product don’t buy one on the store when you get a new phone.
3,The installation was very easy and I didn't have any bubbles.  However the cutout for the top sensors is too small.  You can see where the black area of the sensors extends lower than the cutout for the sensors.  This is minor but it should line up with the sensor block.  I would probably buy a different brand if I buy more in the future.
5,Have owned this case for over a month now. Seems very good quality. Easy installation. Dropped once from about 2 feet no damage.
5,It's a great product and has saved my other phones on several occasions from cracks and chips.
3,The only reason I am not giving this product a 5 star review is that two of the three screen protectors has a small amount of link on the sticky back.  The first one went on beautifully with no issues but the other two had issues.  I was very careful to follow all the steps included.  I especially liked the tray/frame to help guide the placement.
5,i’ve dropped my phone multiple times while have this screen protector and there’s not even a scratch! very good product!
5,Installing the screen protector is so simple. Place the guide on your phone then align the protector with the guide and drop it onto your phone. Installation could not be more simple. And alignment more perfect.
5,Fits as designed. Nice accessory pack to help screen prep. 3rd time buying
5,Easy to install!
5,Great screen protector. It may crack but phone screen does not.
5,Screen protector is really good. It is tough and crystal clear. Laying it onto the screen was simple and easy. Also there is no lag or difference noticed in screen response after putting the screen protector. Awesome product
5,Excellent product high quality and very easy to install.
5,Easy to use fast shipping
5,Product arrived when promised. It was very easy to install.
5,Is doing the job very good so far
5,One of the best screen protectors in the market.
5,I will continue to buy from this company going forward. Great product!
5,Money well.spend
5,Glad I watched/read instructions which were easy to accomplish. 3 pack frustrating when only need one but cost reasonable.
5,Really easy to install great price. Can’t beat it and provides great peace of mind.
5,Comes with installation instructions wet wipes dry wipes dust removal stickers microfiber clothand an installation tray. Went on perfect and looks invisible
5,The alignment frame makes it very easy to get the screen protector on in the correct place.
5,very good
5,Product quality and design is exceptional for the price.
5,Combined this product with another installation tray I had and it worked great first time with no hassle.  great product
5,Installation was a breeze
5,Got the job done ✅
5,Excellent
5,Great fit and it could not have been any easier
5,Fit the 13 mini just right
5,Fit perfect
2,Normally I'm not bad at installing these but the guide on this one is absolutely useless.  I would be better guided by someone standing across the room saying "a little more left" or "a little more right".  Also there are no tabs or anything that help you handle the glass while you are lining it up so if you happen to get your finger overlapping it will leave a bubble.  This thing sucks... no wonder why they give you 3 in a box... it will take you 3 attempts.
5,The easy install guide is a huge help to get it on easy and evenly
5,Love it
5,easy to install 3-pack screen protectors.
5,Easy to install good price
5,The template made install a breeze.
5,Easy on just what I wanted.
5,Ok product
5,it works not much else to say
5,I use for horse back riding and landscaping
5,Works just as I expected.  Totally happy
5,Great product at great price
5,Nice and clear. Very easy to install.
5,Quality product and easy install kit was super
5,Just as described  GREAT VALUE
5,Easy to apply
5,Todo perfecto no es abtireflejo
5,Great product as advertised
5,na
5,Quality products and good price
2,Agree with other reviewers that alignment is tricky. Product seems decent got aligned and installed. However once I put case back on it causes air to go under it. You can work the air out but comes right back as soon as you grab phone. This happened with a otterbox defender case.
2,1st screen has a huge bubble that would return as soon as you stopped pressing. Second screen only minor bubbles at bottom and top edges BUT who wants ANY bubbles?  I even let it sit overnight - the bubbles stayed. Will return and buy a different brand.
2,The 3rd screen wasn’t wrapped so I don’t know if it will be usable in the future. There’s a residue on it so it’s not clean and has fuzzies. Oh well. I got 2 at least.
1,The screen product does not stick to the screen.
2,The installation process was straightforward - and it was good to have wet and dry wipes included. The plastic guide was also a big help.Unfortunately the glue around the edges seems to be lackluster. I have a bubble along the edge despite having it installed basically spot-on (plus the glass is flat so that shouldn’t affect things anyway). poor adhesive
1,I bought two boxes of these for my mom’s and my new IPhone minis. I can see why they were $5. Every single one had dust already on the screen cover when you peel off the label. I have bought this brand many times. I ended up using every cover sent (I have never had to do that before) because I thought I was going crazy and that I just wasn’t cleaning the phones enough. I’ll try another one next as I’m not happy with these. Who wants to see specks when they use their new phones?
1,I have screen protector on two IPads and two IPhones.  This protector is the worst.  The plastic guide is thin and cheap; it doesn't align with the phone's screen perfectly.  After following the standard instructions for screen protector installation each of the three included protectors had small bubbles that could not be removed.  In addition the edges of the protectors would not sit flush with the screen creating short (2 or 3 millimeters) bubble-like lines.  This occurred with each of the three protectors and the phone's screen was devoid of dust and completely cleaned pursuant to the instructions.  While all of the protectors are used I will ask for a refund and find a different product.  I was seduced by a comparatively low price.  Don't fall prey to my mistake.
2,The frame used for installation is not precisely made. More room for the temper glass shift either too left or too right. Immediately caused a waste for the 1st of 3 glass I received.
1,So I have a 13 mini. I accidentally ordered the wrong ones at first for the 12 mini. My fault. So I ordered the ones that are cut for the 13 mini. Nope. Put them on and it turns out it is cut EXACTLY as the ones for the 12. Meaning the notch on the 13 is different than the 12. Now before someone chimes in I got my fiancé the same brand for her 13 regular and lo and behold it is cut correct. So basically these are garbage
1,I went through all three protectors and on each of them had the same issue: the top right corner would not fully adhere to the screen. Because of this there was a rather large air bubble that would not go away. Also I found that pushing down about an inch below where this issue was and running my finger up towards it caused the issue to become worse. The air bubble increased in size then decreased as I got closer to the very edge.
1,Didn't fit the phone.  Had to return.  False advertisement.
1,Really bad product. Application guide frame is useless messes up application rather than helping it.  Worse the screen protectors have very loose initial adhesion and slip along the screen from how they're first lowered in so the screen protector adheres slanted toward the edge...
1,First off it captured so much dust no matter how many times i cleaned it or pulled it off. The adhesive was terrible as well all of the corners were pulling or didn’t even stick then 2 out of 3 of the protectors weren’t even sticky
1,Must have had a bad batch. The ones I received didn’t line up with notch at all. Waisted a few bucks. Guess I’ll try another screen protector.
1,The "easy install" frame is absolute crap. Twice the screen protector fell through the frame and got dust all over the adhesive. Waste of money.
1,Didn’t work well with the 13 mini. It popped up every time I tried to put the phone case on. Will not stay stuck down
1,The guide that you put over the phone to help place the screen is smaller than the screen. So the screen sits on it when installing.If you need the guide to fix the screen (as I do) try a different product
1,Three screen protectors came in the box. Not a single one stuck properly. One corner on each screen protector wouldn’t stick! So disappointing considering I’ve ordered & used this brand in the past.
1,Total waste of money . I couldn’t get it on it cracked trying to get it on.
1,Could not get it to stick to phone kept coming off
1,Edges do not cover the full screen & don’t sit flush so dust and debris accumulate under the edges immediately.
5,it is convenient to protect my phone.
5,Installation was super easy and no dust caught under the protector! I used it on two phones and it was flawless both times. Very satisfied with this purchase.
5,The design for installation helping frame is really good. Appreciate it.
5,I am usually nervous putting on my own screen protector because of the fit and the bubbles.This was SO EASY and NO BUBBLES!
5,iPhone 13 mini
2,Doesn't fit iPhone 13 mini properly. The cutout is not precise. The installation tray wasn't that easy to use either. After using the installation tray it seemed the screen protector wasn't aligned properly. Had to remove and readjust. Even then the bottom the screen protector was interfering with the case. Definitely do not recommend for iPhone 13 mini.
5,The installation was seamless and it went on perfectly the first time no bubbles! The installation tray was a really great improvement to the installation process!
5,Phone operates as it should easy install.
5,great product for the money
5,Super easy to install! Clear and no air bubbles. Thank you!
5,Product is as advertised. Highly recommend this product.
5,Quick delivery and working well so far
5,Looks great! Easy install!!Seems durable!! Thanks!
1,Made in China trash product…. Low quality goodAir bubbles & weak adhesive. Not even worth shipping back :(
3,Tried reposition twice it either leaves a gap on the top or bottom that collects dirt not full coverage as advertised
5,Very easy to install
5,The guide makes for an easy install and it’s nice to have two backups just in case. 9h hardness just like the top shelf protectors.
5,Once you get the rear set it works great!
5,I've used this brand of screen protectors before so I knew the quality. However their new installation method make the process soooo easy and perfect. You can't go wrong.
5,The screen protector fit the IPhone perfectly and was very easy to install.  Even I could do it!
5,The guide that comes with this protector makes it the easiest to install one I’ve ever used. The protector it’s self looks good. We will see how well it works. Only installed a few days ago. The warranty will not register as the website says the page no longer exists. I sent an inquiry but no answer has been sent to me.
5,Practico
5,Good product. Easy to place on phone. Good protection
5,The price was right. Delivered so quick. Great gift for my sons.
5,Perfect size for my iPhone 13 mini.  Easy to use.
5,Great protectors!
5,I’ve become a big fan of the amFilm product line and have been buying them over the last few years for my families phones. It’s really nice that it comes with the installation tray which easily aligns the glass when installing plus the 3 pack gives you extras in case of a drop and cracked screen protector or somehow you mess up installing one which is hard to mess up with the installation tray so that probably isn’t going to happen. Nice product.
5,Bought an iPhone and knowing myself knew a screen protector would be a must. Installation was a breeze. Included instructions are clear and to the point. Kit includes everything you need. Phone dropped out of my pocket on a horse ride and fell on some rocks and there’s not a scratch on it. Highly recommend
5,Easy to install install tool helpful
5,Easiest to install I've ever used
5,Easy and quick install bubbles easy to remove
5,Good price easy to install
5,Did its job.
5,This screen protector is awesome. This is the first time I used a screen protector on my iphone. It's such a game changer.
5,Easy to install
5,excellent product - economical and easy to use.  Phone looks great too! Recommend product
5,This is the most official pack of screen protectors I’ve ever bought! It comes in a nice little package with everything and more that you need to set up your screen protector! Easiest one I’ve put on my phone by far! And they’re serious when the mean zero air bubbles!! Very cheap and great quality!
5,They were easy to apply and I didn’t have any bubbles.  Also there were good instructions on how to apply. I’d definitely order these again.
5,My kids each have a 12 mini and a 13 mini.  I put it on both and it fits both.  The edges stick flat perfectly for both.  Turn off your phone and use a flash light shining sideways to easily see any dust particles.  The guide/template really helps to position the screen correctly.
5,Excellent product with cleaning accessories at a great price
5,Easy to install on phone.
5,This is my third order of these protectors. They go on easy and the new alignment jig makes it even better.
5,Easy to install. Provided all that needed to get the job done. Recommend to anyone looking for a screen guard.
5,I have protective screens from this brand for my iPad iPhone and Surface. the brand never disappoints.
5,These were packaged beautifully and very easy to install with the added guide!
5,I don’t even notice it’s there. Perfect install by me and no bubbles. Suck it mall kiosk that charges $40 for the same thing.
5,best for money
4,For the money just as good as some name brand protectors I have purchased.  Not a perfect fit but it works.
5,Easy to install great protection for phone screen.
5,Excelent
5,Great
5,Love this product! Have used similar things in the past and all of them were harder to install. The installation device that comes with this makes it extremely easy to put on the first time in a great position. So great seems very durable will buy again for sure!
5,As stated in description very sturdy and durable.  Highly recommended.
5,I used the same brand for my Nintendo switch and loved the quality. Happy to see that they have these for iPhones too! Can’t beat the value.
5,Amfilm has been my go to for my last several phones.  Product keeps getting better easier to install straight now.  Fantastic!
5,I received the screen protector today. Installation was very easy with the installation guide. After properly cleaning the screen there are no bubbles or holes. The protector extends just outside where the lighted part of the display is so there is room for a case but your fingers don't catch on the edge when swiping from the edge of the screen. You can also register the product to receive two free replacements for the lifetime of the product. The glass feels the same quality as the $40 screen protector I had on my old phone. Touch is smooth. There is a cutout on top for the phone speaker the camera and the face ID sensors. This is nice because there will be no extra layer of glass that could inhibit the operation of the face ID sensors. Overall a great product.
5,I’ve never dropped my phone but got worried when my phone was slipping out of my back pocket. So I caved! Then one day I slammed my phone face first into a corner of a table and my heart stopped! If this screen protector wasn’t there it would’ve been horrible. But it was protected and I was ecstatic!!!
4,The protector broke easily with out falling.
5,I order these glass screen protectors from amFilm all the time. I just got a new iPhone 13 mini. They included a new little tray that helps you get the screen protector on perfectly! Super easy!!
5,cost effective protection for iPhone 13 mini.  came with a weird install tool.  I just slapped it on and I now have a Dutton bullet proof vest pocket.  LGB->FJB
5,easy to install with no bubbles and fits perfect
5,The plastic holder provided is a great feature it is very helpful for installing the screen protector at the exact position. I was successful at my first attempt so now I can save the other two for future use.
5,I was amazed at how easy it was to install. I love it! Not even 1 air bubble. Thanks
5,5 stars. Perfect product. Does the job no cons.If you’re going to put a tight case that’s hard to take on and off apply screen protector before case as the easy install requires no case.
5,This saved my brand new phone from certain destruction
5,Product is great quality and value. I appreciate that the install kit includes a plastic guide to aid installation.
5,It comes with a guide that helps you get the screen protector on straight.
5,well packaged with excellent instructions on how to install.  Cleaned screen well no dust bubbles.  Theplastic install was great - provides an excellent install guide for a perfect drop of protector to screen.
5,it fit well
5,I was not expecting there to be an alignment frame or wipes to come with it and it helped me out so much! I’ve had trouble with screen protectors in the past so I was a bit worried but this was one of the most easy things I’ve done!
5,Handset screen protectors are all pretty much the same in use. What really stands out here is how easy the installation process is: wet wipe dry wipe microfiber cloth all included. The icing on the cake is the wonderful plastic guide that makes alignment foolproof. And bubbles are hard to get - but if you do just lift up at the bottom and try again. Easy. Simple. Quick. And very highly recommended!
5,Me resultó de fácil colocación tiene las mismas dimensiones que la pantalla y hasta ahora resulta muy buena elección!
5,Nice product overall

5,amFilm is my go to for phone screen covers. i've been using them for awhile now within my whole family. Easy to install with the provided guide. plenty of swabs and such to clean the screens. Will likely pick another up to keep on hand.

5,I bought my phone six months ago and put one of the screen protectors on it I can guarantee that it does work very good. I’ve never changed my screen protector because it’s never broken on me. Which is what I love about the screen protectors. They last very long.
5,Easy to install every thing you need is included.
5,Haven't tested it yet and hope not to.
