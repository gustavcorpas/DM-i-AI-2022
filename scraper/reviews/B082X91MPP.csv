5,I bought this on the advice of a friend so that we can do zoom calls to keep in touch since we live on different coasts. She always knows how to suss out a great bargain.Also it is sooo easy to set up.  There is nothing to it and I hate to set up anything technical.  I do it but I hate it.  This requires nothing to do for setup.  Just plug into the usb port on your computer and you are ready to roll.My friend and I are having lots of video calls!  Great for everybody to stay in touch with friends and loved one.Highly recommend and I'm going to buy some more as gifts.
5,No app needed and has USB plug in. Neat little camera. I had an online job interview and this worked great. The mic and camera both yielded good quality. The wire is long enough to reach from the top of my monitor to the USB port on the CPU at ground level.My desktop picked up the camera instantly and I had to go to my computer settings to pull up the camera and mic.I have only used it once for now but will need it daily once I begin working for distance learning. This review will be updated soon.
4,Pros:Super easy. About 10 seconds after I inserted the USB cable my video feed switched from my laptop camera to this one. I can't imagine how you could make it any easier.Value. The clip and included tripod are handy and just like you'd expect but for the price it seems like the tripod is a generous addition.Image quality is fine. I use this for work only and I have no idea if other use cases would find it lacking.Con: The red status light is way too much - like eye of death staring you down. I stuck a piece of black vinyl over it and the miniscule fraction I can still see is sufficient. But we're talking like less than 5% of the red light is all that's left.
4,Ive used this on multiple different platforms ie; messenger zoom etc. Every one i talk to complains about not being able to hear me. I try to look at the settings but I dont think you can adjust the mic on this. The picture is great. Setup is easy. My grandma could set it up .
4,I REALLY liked this camera in terms of options for use and features for the price. My only complaint is that it was used a few times a week for an hour or so and only last 5 months before I started getting distortion on the bottom of the image. I'll be purchasing again because I liked it with hopes that it was only that one device.
4,Great picture quality but the microphone is muffled and quiet. That won't cut it for meetings!! Disappointed but you get what you pay for!
4,Better than the one I had it has a very clear picture.  Only the tripod doesn't fit.
5,it's very good for student and work at home.
5,Works well but sometimes the auto focus gets confused and blurry
5,Great quality video. The Mic is not great.
3,I have had this camera since February and while it's great quality when it comes the camera itself the microphone quality is TERRIBLE. This defeats the whole purpose of why I got this specific camera. Unfortunately I can't return as it has been months but I'm so frustrated to hear from my team members that they can't hear me because it sounds muffled and distorted. If you will be using this camera for your meetings via Zoom Teams etc. be aware that you will need a backup or a headset as no one will be able to hear you clearly. Not even if you are holding the camera/microphone inches away from you face :(
4,Picture is good quality for web cam. Audio is a bit muffled
5,It is a good quality camera. If you plan on doing big in scale this has a wide angle lens so you can really get a 180° view. Fyi most apps you use have a crop option to scale it down to just you.
5,The only thing that happen to me is this was my 2nd one I didnt realize camera cover till this one and the 1st one didnt have. I wish I knew where to get or a .stl file so I could 3d print one.
5,An inexpensive good quality camera that’s easy to set up and use.
5,
4,The camera on my laptop went out.  I bought this camera as a cheap work around.  It works great and looks better than the one on the laptop when it worked.  I was in a work zoom meeting with multiple people...my camera looked the best.  Sharp image.
4,It took a little time to get it set up. My Mac didn't recognise It right away. Finally got it working. In using the little tripod it came with. The built in  screen clamp configuration doesn't work that great with my 32" LG monitor.
4,This works great for video calls. One thing I would change is how it attaches to the monitor. It is not as sturdy a connection as I would like. I added a piece of Velcro to get it to stay on the monitor
5,great for zoom meetings
5,So much clarity on as opposed to webcam on laptop. The details is awesome as well as range of view.
5,Great quality out of the box. The camera is 20x better than the built in camera on my new laptop. We’ll see how it holds up. Great first impression!
4,Plug it in and it works only when you activate an app like Zoom. High quality picture. Comes with small tri-pod.No link to software available to use as a webcam from the manufacturer.
5,la camara web es una las 3 B buena bonita barata
5,Perfect little camera.
4,Simple plug-n-play and serves it's purpose for working from home.  Only tilts up/down not left/right but that's fine with what I'm using it for.  The lens cover popped off and there's a peel-n-stick element that i realized adheres the lens cover to the camera body.
5,El enfoque automático no está disponible y tiene poca calidad de imagen
5,During school shutdowns my teacher wife had to start relying on remote learning programs using Zoom and Google.  The MacBook Air camera did okay but the conditions had to be perfect.  This camera was an instant upgrade - the image was immediately brighter and better quality.  For the price it is a great buy.  We would purchase again no problem.  Sound quality is good as well and setup is extremely easy.  If you're looking to improve a built-in camera on a laptop or add one to a desktop this unit will work great and is money well spent!  ***HIGHLY RECOMMENDED***
5,Used to upgrade my video on my older laptop and I can't get over how clear it is
3,I read a lot of reviews on this and watched the videos attached to the reviews. I did like the look of what I saw so took a chance.That being said it did not work out for me. I am not super techy and am admittedly unaware of how these things work at the technical level but this made me look like I was in a video game.It was TOO MUCH contrast. It was not blurry at all which is great but again took the contrast too far. It made me look pixelated and like I had some futuristic filter on. Pretty unprofessional for a work call.I did like that it had a lens cap and was easy to use. You plug it in and go! No special program or compatibility test.Might be for you! Simply not for me.If you liked this review please click that it was helpful!
5,Image looks great. It's plug and play literally no setup. The little tripod is a nice bonus.
5,I use this for my zooming.  I gotta say it's great for that. I am not to tech savvy and this camara was sooo easy to hook up.
5,I think expectations should be tempered but with that being said the quality is very similar to the quality of my Logitech at about the 3rd of the price.
3,Caused audio sound complication. You had to switch the sound settings on your device every time you use it. Instructions are not clear.
5,Works great. I have had people ask me what I am using because the picture is so good. Microphone works well too.
3,Camera itself is fine. Focus lower light levels (not dark just not bright) and color balance are all fine. Works with Windows just plug it in and give it a minute to get setup.The microphone on this camera leaves much to be desired. Its a bit muffled and muddy like your talking behind a baffle or something. For my use that's OK as I bought this to use along with a Yeti microphone (which kicks butt by the way). Still I would've been happier if it sounded better.
3,Picture quality was great but the microphone doesn’t pick up well at all. On Zoom it’s sounded like I was whispering.
5,After 2 years of working from home I wanted to switch from my laptop camera to an external camera. Bought this model due to the price. Very easy install right out of the box no issues detecting the camera and it worked automatically. Appreciate that it comes with a privacy cover.
3,I have a huge monitor and sit about three feet away. I needed a USB webcam with microphone that would pick up my voice from that distance. This one technically did the job but my voice sounded like I was under water and very quiet. The picture quality was just barely good enough to be passable by modern standards. Also it's very wide view. For perspective my monitor is almost against the wall of my 12x12 office and this camera captured not only the entire back wall of my office but quite a bit of the ceiling and the right and left walls as well. There was a visible fisheye effect on straight edges etc.Overall I can't say this is a "bad" camera but it wasn't what I was looking for. Returning and going with a different brand featuring a much narrower field of view and a long-range microphone.
5,Great camera very clear excellent value for the low price
4,The camera is great but the tripod is worthless.
5,Perfect for my home office.
3,Good for the price
5,So far I am using it only for telemedicine and group Zoom meetings.
3,Not good quality picture
4,This was extremely cheap compared to Logitech or other higher quality brands.  It does have a bit of a fish-eye feel to it but it isn't noticeable unless you move forward and backwards a lot.  The cord is kind of short if you are using a mounted arm.  The autofocus works well but the lighting adjust is whack.  Play with the settings and it can get a little better.  It is hard to configure a green-screen due to the auto features.
5,Just what I wanted. Does a great job.
4,I am happy with this product; it meets my needs.  However there is one issue.  I had to show my driver's license to someone and the camera would not focus to make the license readable.  If you run into this the person had me take a picture of my license and zoom in on it - they were then able to read the information.All in all it works and I'm happy.
4,I wish I'd sprung for better audio. At least this allows me to put my camera where I need it in my home office set-up.
5,Used as intended personal.
4,This webcam is perfect for the price.  The picture quality is excellent and it is simple to set up.  Only reason I did not give it an overall 5 star rating is that it has a super wide viewing radius and does not come with software to allow you to adjust this or add any background filters.
4,I bought this camera because I found meetings I have attended for many years have been put on Zoom only longer than I expected.  It does need a high speed USB port to have a clear picture and good lighting must be provided.  I did not try the microphone  because I used a separate microphone.
5,Great camera and very nice picture. I literally plugged it into my laptop changed my settings to the cam and was up and functional in 2 minutes. Very happy with this purchase.
5,Really easy to use and super simple to set up! I will order these from here as needed.
4,Not the best but it works fine. Get what you pay for kind of deal here
4,This is a very good camera for its price but if you want to spend a bit more money there are a lot of very good cameras and I would do a little more research before buying one of these.
5,Works.
4,I bought this thing for work so I was only looking for cheap not necessarily fancy. And I'm satisfied with it. It does what it needs to do and with a clear picture and decent mic too
5,For the money I feel this is the best in the price range. Easy plug and play connection you then can make a mutitude of fine adjustments if you wish. I loved the first one so I purchased two more for other PCs that I own.
4,I like it. Very good quality. Especially for what I need it for. Very simple to say up and my pc picked it up right away.
5,I do a lot of 1 on 1 zoom. This has good color balance w/o needing to adjust anything.Installed itself after I bugged it in - which was kinda weird! But good.
5,Needed a reasonably priced external camera that I could use for work video calls. The camera needed to be plug & play with no software to install. This little camera works great. Truly plug & play. Picture is much more true to life than a previous camera I tried that stopped working after less than a year. Like the camera cover & tripod that came with it as well.
4,So far it is working great! Only issue is the shutter. It came with an adhesive backing but doesn’t work and the shutter pops on and off easy when trying to open and close.
5,good stuff
5,Great product it came on time & I haven't had any issues whatsoever! If for some reason you want to use just the camera & not the built-in microphone that comes with the webcam you will have to disable it which is no problem. After you disabled it the camera will still be in use just not the microphone. The camera quality is decent & not blurry. Overall great product & I recommend it.
5,A company I did some remote work for temporarily used this camera for their remote employees.  It is a great little camera and works like a much more expensive web cam for a very affordable price!  Grab one!
3,The camera seems decent quality. The video quality was good but the audio was very muffled. Would not recommend camera unless you had an external mic.
2,This worked great although the little camera cover keeps coming off and got lost within the first few weeks. The real problem here is that it keeps turning itself on and off and disconnecting/reconnecting. The first few times I thought it was a problem with Zoom/Teams and rebooted my laptop.But after a while it just seems to lose its mind and refuses to connect for longer than a few seconds. Cannot recommend. You get what you pay for I guess.
5,This camera was exactly what we needed for Zoom meetings without spending a fortune. Set up was completely idiot-proof for non-techies. Plug into your computer and it's ready to go. As soon as I started a Zoom meeting the green light turned on and the video was rolling. If you use a laptop with an integrated camera you may have to go into the video settings on Zoom and change from "integrated camera" to "usb camera." The lens is more wide-angle than I needed (captures approx. 10' width) which is of no concern to me either way but if you are not looking to share a lot of your background this would not be the best.Word of caution: If you are planning to use the camera for something like teaching a class or leading a blended in-person/Zoom meeting using a white board or viewing screen in the background I would urge some caution as the items on the wall behind me appear to have a fairly significant degradation in clarity and there is a fair amount of rounding on the edges of the frame.The attached photos show the camera in stand-by mode camera on the clarity of the video on the screen the camera on with privacy lens-cover closed and the rounding of the edges of the frame (shown in background: straight cement wall corner and straight door frame).
4,I use this camera to shoot down on my game table so my zoom players can see the map. It works fine for this. If your looking for alot of bells and whistles then your gonna need to pay more. But for the price this camera works great.
3,It's ok for its cheap price. Should 've went with the other guys🤔.
4,I bought this camera for online schooling it works really well good image and microphone. My only problem is for proctored exams I need to show my ID to the camera and the camera will not focus close up so the ID is super blurry and you can't read it and the print is too small to see far away. I was lucky I could email my teacher a photo of my ID so she could sort of match it up. DO NOT PURCHASE IF YOU NEED TO SHOW CLOSE UP TEXT LIKE AN ID TO THE CAMERA. For general use this is perfect though.
4,I ordered a webcam so that I can use my desktop to have video calls and not have to use the camera on my phone. The video quality is worse than my phone (as expected) but it does the job. My main complaint is the microphone quality. I have had conversations and no matter which setting I use people mention that I am hard to hear. It will mostly be used for conversations one on one with family and just to stick to my phone for all other video calls.
4,No instructions on sound adjustments but I figured it out after 2 days of trying different features.
5,I recently changed computers… one with no built in camera but I still need visibility. This camera was inexpensive… but to my surprise it was better!  The look focus and light regulating abilities were perfect for work from home!! It sits right on top of my monitor and is plug and play… tight out of the box.
2,I’ve bought four of these cameras mainly for use by kids when attending school from home during COVID.  At the time it was hard to get any camera and these were in stock with decent reviews so I bought them.  Upon arrival one camera had good picture quality but the microphone quality was tinny.  Acceptable for school use but not the office.  The second camera had a purple tint to the video but the mic sound quality was crystal clear.  The third camera had grainy video but a muffled microphone.  The fourth camera had great quality video but again tinny audio making it hard for others to hear us.  I would not recommend this as a work camera and after trying to use it for awhile as my home office camera I upgraded to a Logitech C922x and haven’t looked back.  These are good cameras for kids but don’t think you can use one for work and don’t have high expectations of any sort of quality.  Maybe you’ll have a good picture?  Maybe others can hear you?
4,good basic cam
5,I purchased this so I didn't have to keep opening my laptop during business meetings to active the camera.  I like the Lens Cover - it is a great feature.  It provides great video and audio.  Very happy with this item.
2,I really liked this camera but it's going back. I need the microphone to work and it just doesn't. The mic records but at a volume so low as to be useless. If you can use this camera with another mic (such as the one on your computer) this might work for you. I need the mic on the camera to work. And yes I tried every possible setting.
5,For you first time web cam users this is perfect.  I had never had a web cam so I didn't know if there were any computer requirements to use this.  I didn't know if I needed software drivers or anything else in order to use it.  Turns out you don't; it's just plug and play.  You can test it on a dummy Zoom call designed for just this purpose on the Zoom web site.  It just plugs into a USB port and (make sure the cap is off the lens) automatically locates and presents if you sign into a Zoom (or other like minded software/platform) call.  Pretty cool.  When you aren't using it leave the cap on and leave it unplugged so there are no surprise viewings.  I got it in case I needed to interview remotely and it works like a charm.  Recommended especially for the money involved...
3,Zoom Meeting
5,Love the image quality and color. I don’t use the camera for a microphone.The one thing that could be improved is the way it mounts Lon your monitor. It just sort of hangs on top which works ok but if you need to adjust your camera angle you cannot just push the camera down as it will fall off the monitor. Minor inconvenience as you don’t often change the angle and everything else is great especially the price
2,I purchased this camera together with the HD Webcam 1080P USB Webcam. This camera beats the HD Webcam 1080P USB Webcam on the image quality. However the audio on this camera is putrid. Complete dulled off almost as if I was talking through a pillow over my mouth. If the audio was great I would happily rate this above the HD Webcam 1080P USB Webcam because it could be a really good camera.Pro's:* Easy plug and play installation.* Good build* Great picture quality with a good balance of tone and crisp details over the full spectrum. (Better than the HD Webcam 1080P USB Webcam).Con's:* No image quality settings. You get what you get.* The audio. If it was not for the audio I would be tempted to give this a 4.75 to 5 for the price because it would be great value.
5,This is a great product. Only complaint is the color correction is weird. So if you have color led lights behind you or if the sun hits your room a certain way (if your room is not a completely neutral color) it will color correct which makes your skin look weird. It's great for everything else.
5,Super easy to set up. Lots of comments from other people that my video quality is great. Color comes through perfectly too (my laptop on-board camera had a weird reddish hue to it that was annoying). Would definitely recommend this camera!
5,I needed a web cam for my office computer at work. With the new "normal" on days that I go into the office instead of telecommuting I really needed a web cam and waiting for my employer to take care of this was just not in option. I picked this one for a couple of reasons first I could get it with same day delivery. Second were the reviews and finally the price.When I got home from work the package arrived around 7ish. I wasn't very impressed with the box very plain almost thought I got scammed. I did take the camera out and it looked ok.The next morning when I got to work I plugged it into an available USB port and within less than a minute the camera was connected and ready to go. This was great as I had a video meeting first thing that morning.The camera works perfectly and from what I could see on my screen the video quality was great. The microphone works well as I didn't have anyone telling me to speak up.This is a great web cam at a great price!
4,equivalent to a much more expensive device.
3,Fair (considering the price) but some issues were noticed: significant image geometric distortions in the borders autofocus works but sometimes with some blur quality acceptable only for chatting user manual lacks specification and details and low-quality tripod doesn't stabilize.
5,I like that this included the tripod. The picture quality is great if you’re just using it for school/work meetings. If you’re doing any kind of video editing I would go with a higher quality. For me this is just what I needed and pretty cheap.
2,The picture was fine but the microphone's didn't pick up well at all.  Way too quiet.  I couldn't find any support to try to fix this issue.  It still worked fine in the desktop Windows Zoom program because that application uses enhancement algorithm.  However in Google hangouts the audio did not pick up well.
5,I’m sure there are better quality cameras out there but I think the quality is good enough for me definitely an upgrade from my laptop’s built-in camera.  I’m not a fan of the way it clips onto your computer it’s not very sturdy. I like that it comes with a privacy cover. There is a light on if it’s plugged in I found that annoying so I used a tiny piece of black electrical tape and problem solved. All in all I think it’s really good for the price and am happy with my purchase.
3,The camera is fine the fish eye is a little annoying but it's good for the price.
4,So far so good.
3,Great picture quality but lags when on zoom. No lag with google meet. Not sure why the difference.
5,The picture was great for Zoom but if you’re used to a built-in computer camera with narrow range you may find the need to clean up your clutter!I like the cover for the lens as it prevents the camera to be used inadvertently.The stand is very flimsy but mounting the camera on top of my desktop Acer computer worked fine. If you use your monitor whether desktop or laptop monitor at a severe slant this may be problematic.The price was reasonable for what you get.
5,Works well. Built-in mic is adequate for videoconferencing as a tele-work employee.
4,It did not have a mic so using it on a smart TV was not avaiable
4,I wanted a web cam for my desktop which did not have a monitor with integrated camera as a better option for video chats with friends and family. I tried another one that was difficult to get to work and had  worse video quality than my laptop's low res camera.  This was definitely a much better choice. It was pretty much plug and play on the desktop. It has a wide picture with good resolution and color. The instructions were easy to follow and no special software was necessary other that having the the right video-calling application that both callers need.  It is all the video quality I need and a very good price.
5,This is a great webcam and worth the price simply for the ease of use and versatility. The microphone is pretty low quality so look for another option for audio. I use this and a headset and works great!
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Probably a good video camera package and value except for fisheye effect. There doesn't appear to be a setting or an easy way for a beginner to get rid of the fisheye effect.  Didn't realize the severity of effect on first test until changed to a different scene.  Now a bit too late to return.  Will plan to purchase a no-fisheye camera or camera with settings.  Begs question -- why would anyone design sell or give great reviews to a camera that distorts the scene? Am I missing something?
5,First things first it came out of the box plugged in and worked.  The set up is a no brainer.  The picture quality is acceptable.  The focus is good.  There is some noise in the signal but not that limits the use of the camera.  In short it's good product at a fair price.  I would buy it again.
4,I needed a camera w/ mic for my new gaming PC so I could do Skype and Zoom. Picture quality is amazing for the money the sound quality is good enough. Much cheaper than the brand name stuff yet so good which is hreat cause I'm an unemployed college student and do not have unlimited money so I look for the best stuff that comes at an affordable cost (such as this camera).Note: unless you want to un/re-plug this camera every time you reboot your PC to get it to work plug it into a USB 2.0 port and not a 3.0. This might be an issue with my computer and possibly the untested optional preview updates for Windows. Otherwise this camera works great with no manual driver installation needed.
5,The quality is great. It's adjustable and you just plug in and go. I have had it for a little over a month and use it once a week to record my podcast. I have no complaints so far!*Attached a pic from a recording to see the picture quality.
5,Plugged camera into my laptop and worked immediately without setup needed
5,works ideally easy to install plug and play video and sound is awesome
5,I ordered this webcam when the built-in one on my Lenovo laptop started acting flaky. As other reviewers have stated it's a wide-angle view but that's okay for what I'm using it for. And the image quality is so much better than my laptop's I wouldn't go back even if the built-in magically fixed itself. Much better than I expected from a mysterious brand name. Figured it was worth a shot given the price. So far so good!
3,Got this a month ago. Worked very well initially but stopped working within a few weeks. Would only recommend if you're feeling lucky!
5,Has a fisheye effect when I look on my camera but in my Microsoft teams meetings etc. it works very well for what I bought it for! Great price too!!
4,Great inexpensive camera with clear picture and good color. Mic only works when it wants to.
3,I have to unplug and plug back in to reset a couple times a day.My work team consistently reports that my audio is very low and I sound like Im in another room.Going to have to return and find a cam with a better microphone.
4,This camera gets the job done and it reliable and easy to use. It is decent and effective.
5,I needed a web cam for Teams and Zoom meetings so that I can keep my laptop closed.  Simple install (just plug n play). Mic is good.  The picture is a little grainy on Teams but it's still very good.
3,The camera only works when I plug it into my computer it does not work for the purpose I bought it for and that was to get on zoom and have my face be seen by others in conference every Friday. I still can't figure out what the problem is. Otherwise the camera looks great it does pick up my face but not on zoom.
5,Great camera for streaming i have two of them
5,I had bought this camera to use it meanwhile I received a webcam I had ordered for 300.00 that was on backorder. I used it for about two weeks and when my other camera arrived it was grainy the audio wasn't that great and my face looked distorted. I ended up returning the 300.00 webcam the same day I opened the box and kept this one instead. I was surprised by the camera quality the mic and the privacy cover. Also there's no back-feed with your speakers. I would like for it to come with a clip that you can clip it to your screen instead but all you need is a little elevation and I have enough things on my desk to give me elevation. If you don't care about elevation it's great with just the tripod that it comes with and the camera itself can move up or down more. Enjoy!8/5/20The problem wasn't the camera for the desired clip. It was user error. See the photo on how to grip it to the top of your screen.
5,Works great! Easy to install
5,Clear picture quality and good audio for online meetings.
5,I was really bummed when my internal webcam malfunctioned on my MacBook Pro especially when I would have to wait over a week just to see somebody at Apple and then more than likely have it sent out for who knows how long.  With covid webcams have become more important than ever.  I use Zoom a lot for business personal things and most importantly for my Spirituality.  I was concerned being that I have a Mac it may not work well.  Just a gut feeling.When it arrived I had it working within minutes and half of that time was spent taking it out of the box.It was that easy and it looks great.  I cannot recommend this webcam enough especially after going a little crazy looking at all of the options available.  It can get very confusing and I made the right choice especially for the price!!!
5,I recently got a new laptop for work but I use a large monitor and bluetooth keyboard. If I wanted to use the built in camera for Zoom meetings I would have to look to the side making it hard to work at the same time. Plus the angle make me look weird. Anyway I got this camera to mount on my monitor and the first video meeting I had with my boss he was like "What's going on? You look so clear?". So needless to say it's got a good picture. My only gripe is I was the mount was a little more flexible.
2,Camera quality was good for the price but even working to adjust in all my settings could not help the audio to be loud enough for people to hear me
5,Works great for zoom meeting at work.
3,It’s a good camera but idk if it’s just mine but it stopped working after the 1st week. I have no idea what’s happening but if it does work it works well clear picture and the auto focus is great.
4,This webcam is a solid build and with tripod included is a very decent buy for the money. The camera worked immediately as soon as I plugged it in. The microphone did not seem to work at first but that was my fault - I had Input Sound turned off in Windows 10 Settings. If the same thing happens to you try Start > Settings > System > Sound > Input > Troubleshoot to fix it.You won't find this or any other troubleshooting suggestion by the way online because the product provides *zero* support information not even a company name. Hence four stars not five.
4,Decent good product works very well.
3,The picture quality is good but it seems the mic quality is not great.
5,It will slide on to your monitor very easily and the additional tripod is very helpful for other shots
3,Can't seem to figure out how/when the camera USB is recognized but when it does work the picture quality is great & clear.
4,Easy set up. Good picture and sound quality. Have only used 3 timed
2,Picture was completely washed out made me look like the dude from powder. Product felt rather flimsy like it could break if the 3in. tripod tipped over. It was super easy to install but no easy way to change settings or try to fix the brightness/contrast issues. Returned for full refund.
5,Best bang for your buck! Great option for remote workers.
5,This camera has an excellent clear video.  Easy to install.  I use daily for parent and staff meetings.  Amazing quality for the money.
5,Simple to set up good quality.
4,I tried a cheaper one that had bad echo with my speakers. This one has no echo and the picture is good enough for my business and personal needs. I was looking at a brand name that usually goes for ytwice as much but they are all on backorder or marked up to ridiculous prices due to COVID-19. I am very happy with this purchase and do not feel I need anything better. The cover is nice and the tripod is good too though I put it on top of my 27" monitor with no issues. There is no zoom the angle is on the wide side for a single person and it does not correct for reflection off my glasses but overall this is a great value and shipped very quickly.
2,You would think a USB device would stay connected and recognized by your computer… but nope not this one.Claims to be plug and play automatic download and compatible with everything…First off good luck getting your computer to recognize the webcam in the first place…I tried on 5 different computers and models all same thing!Then once your using it prepare for it to disconnect.Done for the night? Better wake up 30 minutes early just to figure out this setup all over again!When the camera works… which is after a good 2 hours of back and forth.You would think for the price you would be set up ready to go!Only reason I’m not asking for a refund is because I don’t want to go through the hassle.
4,For some reason I could no longer use my logitech with my windows 7 computer and it was very difficult to find something similar in stock online and impossible in the stores around me. So I took a chance with a brand I did not know and am very happy with the product. I installed it simply by plugging into my computer USB port. I am able to maintain security by closing the viewer when not in use. The only problem I have is that I have to rest it on top of my screen and had to use some tape to keep it there otherwise it is great!
4,Arrived fast easy to install works fine.
5,Love the picture quality! Definitely worth every penny and not to mention it enhances your beauty for sure!
4,Nice camera for the money
5,The price and quality of this camera was more than I expected. I am very pleased with this camera and as I said it was within my budget!!!!
5,my teammate liked it so much they asked me to order one for them
5,es  muy practica y buena lo que buscaba.
5,Only issue is the picture on the left & right is slightly distorted as noticed by other purchasers as well. Otherwise easy to set upPlug in and go.
4,This arrived the very next day. Worked immediately when plugged in. Easy to attach to monitor or can be attached to the little tripod that comes with. For some reason one side of my screen is quite dark (like in the shadows). I am hoping I can figure out the lighting so that won't be a problem and the picture is a little grainy but it may just be on my end. Will play with it a bit to see if I can correct these two issues. Great little webcam for the price.
3,Works fine and connected to my Microsoft Surface Pro without hassles. Two dings though. First ding: the "privacy shutter" is not integrated into the hardware. Instead it's an external plastic piece that you attach yourself using peel-off adhesive (provided). It's not clear the best way to center this stick-on piece so it's possible I didn't do it as intended but when I try to close the shutter it doesn't entirely close.  If I press it down it closes entirely but then it pops up a little bit allowing some light and a tiny bit of the image frame to enter the camera. So it may give a false sense of security when in fact some parts of the image are still transmitting.  The second ding is that the entire brand of this device is "webcam" -- in other words it's a generic.  I expect it will be sold under many different product ID's allowing the manufacturer to avoid repercussions if they get some bad reviews simply by selling under a different listing.
5,So far so good. Quality is better than my 70$ logitech. Very pleased with the product so far.
5,I like it a lot the video is so clear 5/5
5,I was actually surprised at the quality and ease of installation for a camera of this price.  Works great on desktop and laptop.  I have a camera on my laptop but thought I'd test it out anyway. Very easy install on both. I bought one for an elderly friend who couldn't figure out why he could hear and see others on zoom meetings but could be seen or heard himself. He finally figured out he didn't have a camera or mic on his computer. He wouldn't let me come by to install it but I explained it to him and he plugged it in himself and was surprised it worked without much effort to configure it.
5,The camera is great. Like other reviewers it is a wider angle than my laptop camera had so be prepared for that. But the view is great it's adjustable and the customer service is AMAZING. I accidentally messed up the lens cover sticky thing and they replaced it immediately. Highly recommend this add on for your monitor.
3,Upon receiving this camera I plugged it in and waited for it to install. First try using it the picture was like a facetime call with bad reception and the picture going in and out on me. So I unplugged it and plugged it back in but in a different USB port (2.0 instead of 3.0). The webcam was completely not functioning. After plugging and unplugging it maybe 5 times and uninstalling the hardware it magically works. I hope this isn't a glimpse into what the quality of the longevity of this product will be. Additionally the lens is really WIDE so others will be able to see about 2 feet on either side of you. This webcam comes with a fitted privacy cover which is one of the best things about it so far. The picture quality isn't great but my office is usually not super bright so that might have something to do with it.
5,Got a crqzy good deal on these and bought 2 of them for a my studio. Very good fornthe money and they came with a stand as eell! Binus!
4,Got this webcam to attach to an aging monitor and desktop system. The clamp isn't 100% secure on top of monitor (HP LP2065) but the enclosed tripod is another option. Was up and running on Zoom within 5 min. Very easy to use. Like the privacy cap for lens. Cam angle adjustable. Very versatile.
5,This cam has excellent picture quality. Perfect size for atop the monitor. Thee stand comes in handy as well. My kiddo loves it! Would recommend.
5,Video is ok but audio is so weak as to be virtually useless. I've set the microphone volume to 100% verified the driver is up to date and run the troubleshooter but so far no success.
2,I was so thrilled with this camera but 6 months in and only using it 2 days a week for random meetings and it has stopped working. I’ve tried all of the trouble shooting but it’s still dead.
3,Works fine but not exactly the best model out there.  The microphone quality is poor but the picture is decent.
4,This web cam is easy to operate and small enough to use on your laptop or computer.
4,It is a nice basic camera nothing really more or less. The picture quality is fine for your normal chat or Zoom meetings. Just make sure you are properly lite from the front other wise you will come out very shadowed.It came with a decent table tripod and I have to say a good amount of length to the USB cord. All in all better than most and more than good enough for 90 pct of people looking to purchase this.
5,Just so you know I own over $100000 in audio/ video and camera gear. I purchased this for my wife to use on Zoom calls because the internal camera on her laptop  is a piece of junk. On her first use her fellow Zoomers commented on the improved quality and several of them subsequently purchased one. Are there better webcams? Yes I own a few of them including PTZ Optics and a Logitech C922. But if I had to use this camera as my day-to-day webcam I’d be okay with it about 90% of the time.
4,If you only need a camera this is a great bang for the buck.  Unfortunately the audio is not so great and I must use my computer microphone or headphones for better quality audio.
3,Produces a higher-quality picture than the built-in cameras on my 2011 and 2020 MacBooks (why is Apple so chintzy with MacBook cameras?).  In the evening however my face gains a notably pinkish color in Zoom calls; I haven't yet figured out how to correct the color balance.
5,Would have been nice to have a few backgrounds included.
5,I needed to replace my older camera because it kept changing color plus it displayed things backwards. This camera is very clear without having to add extra lighting. It also shows things as they actually appear.
4,Nice video. Microphone plays at volume too low to be of practical use. I should have ordered a separate mic. Which I just did. Still a good deal. Update and one more star.  The camera and microphone worked on ZOOM which boosted  the mic volume to a usable level. Add a virtual background and you are in business.
4,I love the cover on this camera. It is really nice to be able to switch it up and close it when not in use.
2,I really really was excited about this camera and it turned on so of course I was happy.. then it started glitching like crazy flashing purple and pink lines all around the outside. Couldn't see my face at all just a bunch of flashing lights with no instructions on how to fix it.
3,I really want to like this product but I just can’t make it work. I work in an office has lots of windows which has lights come in all direction.  This webcam is very light sensitive so you can’t have the camera facing windows.  The picture will be very dark.  I rearrange my office entirely to get away from windows as much as possible.  Close all the blinds in the morning to reduce the light comes in to the room.  I am still getting one side of my face darker than the other side due to the light.  This is just way to much work for a webcam.  I am returning the product.
3,The camera was an okay camera for 8 months until unfortunately I dropped it once. That one drop alone was enough to kill the camera entirely. Definitely wouldn't recommend it for anyone who would need to move it around or has pets.
3,After 3 weeks of using it I was being told that I sounded muffled.
2,This is not a reliable usb camera. It consistently shuts off and stops working mid use. When it does work it works well but you just can't count on it. You may get lucky with your purchase but not worth the risk in my opinion.
4,The camera was much better than I expected for the price. The stand is very cheap and hard to use; one leg was broken off when I received it. The clip works well and stays on top of the monitor as I want it. I like that I can turn the camera down when not is use. Overall a good product especially if you don’t plan on using the stand.
5,I needed a camera for work and I got tired of using my phone. For the amount of money you spend the camera's what you would expect. 1080p quality. Zoom works fine on it. It has a little privacy lid that you attach to the front. The camera's pretty wide angle. It's much wider than my old camera so it sees a bit more of my room.There's a microphone built in but I use an external mic so I can't say anything about the quality of the built-in one.There's a short tri-pod that came with the camera but I'm not using it. It's only about 3 inches tall. I simply mounted the camera on top of my monitor. It feels sturdy mounted there and I don't think about it.
4,The picture quality was awful. White balance is definitely off everything looked purple when I have indoor lights on. The lens are like those fisheye lens which is distorted at the corners. If you just want a webcam so others can see your face in a meeting this might be a cheap option; wouldn't recommend otherwise.Edit: The seller contacted me and was willing to provide a free replacement. I didn't take it because I've already returned the item but I appreciate the gesture so I've changed this review from 3 stars to 4 stars.
5,Quality is a lot better than I expected from a camera of this price. Not amazing low light but when the conditions are good this webcam is great!
5,The camera video quality is great but the microphone leaves a lot to be desired. I had to buy a headset with built-in microphone and bypass the microphone on the camera.
4,The video doesn't seem super sharp (wouldn't call it HD) but it's better than the laptop camera in terms of color and definition. The included stick on lens cover is nice to have though it could have been designed a tad bit better or better integrated with the camera as it feels like an afterthought.
5,using for zoom meetings. Works great so far
4,It does not grab a big room’s (30x30 ft) view so maybe half of the room will be disclosed. Other than that everything is great.The camera quality will not be clear if your laptop’s camera does not offer a clear view.The cable is easy to plug into a laptop and turn on for viewing.It does not sit well (very light) - use adhesive to hold it down in one place. If you plan to move it around use an adhesive that is simple to remove.
3,The resolution on the XPCAM is garbage. Very pixelated with a delay. My old Logitech camera only went up to 720p but worked fine with VLC media player. Skip this cheap ChiCom knock off.
2,I bought this unit because it had a camera cover.  The camera cover is an add-on adhesive.  When I went to remove the backer the adhesive came off the cover and coiled up and was not usable.  The seller does not stock replacement parts so I could not get another cover.  I returned it because I will not have an open camera in my office.  The camera worked great otherwise.  It is a very wide angle and it caught some of my whiteboard on calls which I did not like because I have confidential information on there from time to time.
2,Just another 4.5 star Amazon item that can't live up to the inexplicably high review stars. As others have said this camera has a gopro like fisheye effect that cannot be removed. It blows my mind that a product that is so obviously defective in this way can have such high reviews. I am honestly getting tired of trusting Amazon's ranking system only to receive a disappointing product.All that being said if you can get past the weird color and lens distortion the image is at least clear. For me it's a deal breaker and I will be returning this camera and selecting something else.
2,Picture quality was good and auto focus always worked but I could not rely on the Microphone. The camera now does not stay connected to my dock(changed USBs Migrated to Laptop reseting defaults all attempted) and I can no longer use it for a camera either.
4,Camera has very good picture and HD quality.  The lens proved to be a little concaved which made the picture show bottom heavy.  All in all a good camera but does not have a zoom in or out feature. Will keep it for wide view conference meeting but will use another camera for making videos.
5,My cell phone couldn't link in to my doctor's video link. I also have an old  p.c. without a camera. In the age of COVID-19 a good  webcam is a necessity. This one was inexpensive and plug-in and use. Took me a little while to to figure out the privacy cover but once I did it was easy. I can now have webcam appts. with my various physicians and reduce my risk of exposure to this virus. I don't trust that other people necessarily follow good public health policy and I don't want to get sick because of someone's stupidity or laziness. This webcam was a good purchase!!
4,Webcam was very easy to install. I just plugged it into a USB port and it was good to go. It comes with a privacy cover but the double sided sticky tape to attach it to the webcam wouldn't come off the paper without getting tangled up. No big deal as it seems to stay put without it. I have not used it except for the 5 minute test when I installed it. We'll see how it does when I join a Zoom meeting.
5,I had a little issue with my camera but they quickly replaced and camera works great! easy to just plug in and work!
2,Although the camera was easy to set up plugged right into the laptop and worked perfectly it stopped working after 3 months. The window to return it closed after 30 days so I'm stuck with it. Very disappointing.
5,This little webcam came within a few days.  It is awesome!!!!  Truly plug and play.  Absolutely superior bang for your buck.  Was borrowing husband's older Logitech webcam for webex meetings prior to its arrival.This web cam does not flicker for me -->  the logitech webcam  flickered depending on position.This one is very solid and stays put when you mount it on the monitor--->the logitech webcam would wiggle a bit if you touched the cable.The tripod and privacy shutter work well and are a cool bonus.This webcam does have a slight fishbowl effect at the edges of the screen-->The logitech webcam is definitely superior in this aspect-no fishbowl effect.Mic is sensitive and picks up even the whirring of the computer fan.Price is reasonable for covid pandemic prices.
5,I was uncertain when I saw the price and reviews but am happy I took the chance. This is a great camera and I have used it weekly since my purchase. I read people speaking about the picture quality but I am able to get my video to show in HD and with low light from the adjustments in ZOOM. The color is perfect the video is high def the microphone picks up well and blocks out outside noises. I recommend using both the settings in the camera's hardware and the program to maximize the quality.
5,Works great
4,Picture very good.  Difficult to get microphone to work and there are no instructions as to solving the mile not wotking
5,This was given as a gift the person I got it for loves it and said everything was great except the mic its not very sensitive.
2,I was impressed with the clarity of the image but the mic is substandard.  The sound is muffled.  I compared to my older camera with mic and the audio is just bad.  I returned the first one thinking it was a fluke and was disappointed to find the same thing.  Had to return the second one and will be looking for a different brand.
5,This is definitely an upgrade from the previous one that we had.  The quality is clear and the audio sounds perfect to the audience.  This purchase helped with Toast Masters Meetings and Zoom meetings.  The quality of the picture picks up everything in the background that I had to be very cautious.  The only thing I would change is to allow it to have more rotation of the camera itself.  My previous model- base can stay still and you move the camera but in this model you have to move the whole thing.  Other than that I still enjoy the product.
5,Best external web cam I ever owned.
3,You get what you paid for. The lighting is weird - made my face super pale so it doesn't adjust well based on your skin tone. I have a higher quality camera made by Cisco and it's professional grade and in the same space and in the same lighting quality there is 1000% difference in the picture quality. So if you just want to pay for a cheap camera you get the cheap quality as well. Be prepared to make your own physical adjustments in your lighting by covering your windows facing you to taper the brightness coming in to your room. Would I buy this again or recommend it? No - not really. Invest in a good quality camera so you get the picture quality that  you really deserve.
5,Really like the lens cap - for privacy.  Nealy zero effort in setting it up.
5,So far this is a wonderful item.
5,I was actually shocked with the quality of this camera. I am regularly using Zoom for office meeting and needed a larger screen than my laptop which ended up requiring me to purchase a camera. The clarity on this is better than my MacBook Pro. It also comes with a lens cover which is a nice peace of mind. 100% worth the buy. My only issue is that the clip device is a bit loose in attaching to the monitor but it doesn’t matter as long as you’re not aggressively knocking it around.
3,I got this product cause i needed one for college and was loving it till i had to use it for a test with honorlock turns out the camera has no dicernable autofocus so i was unable to use it to scan my ID which made it impossible to use the camera for my test. Auto focus is a necessary feature to have so this is a real deal breaker. other than that the product is fine it has decent video resolution and the microphone. nothing amazing but very competitive on price. I would pass though due to the autofocus issue.
5,Affordable Price; good quality easy set up
2,While easy to install and designed nicely the unit has problems.  One the video is poor quality with little to no dynamic range - in other words it looks grainy not good contrast between foreground and background and rather washed out looking.  Two the microphone simply does not compare to other leading manufacturers' microphones.  I cannot tell you why other than Windows 11 troubleshooter reports it is only picking up 9-11 percent of the maximum range and my Zoom meeting customers complain is sounds very muffled almost impossible to understand.  So this one is a goner for me and will be replaced with a name brand camera.
4,Works good especially for zoom meetings
1,The camera size was great.  And set up was simple...but not.  Plugged the USB cable into a port on my computer a brief wait and device was recognized.  I did a test Zoom call to make sure it worked.  Everything worked but the volume of the mic on the camera could not be raised to a level that other participants could easily hear my voice.  I did a bunch of troubleshooting and found that there is supposed to be a mic boost option in the audio settings on my windows machine but due the lack of a separate audio input on the camera that feature is not available.  I spent two hours researching and troubleshooting and came to the conclusion that I would not be able to get the mic volume adjusted above a very low level.  Returned the camera as no apparent fix for the problem.
4,Good webcam for the price.
2,I bought this camera and the image kept flickering and the camera keep losing connection with my laptop. I thought the camera was defective so I asked for a replacement. The replacement camera has the same issues. (Note: I tried my husband's camera in the same USB port with the same computer and it is fine so it's definitely the cameras not the computer or the port.)
5,Great buy for the price. Very glad I bought it.
3,People tell me I sound like Im in a tunnel.
2,I originally bought this camera in September 2020 when many other webcams were not available. It worked OK at first though the picture quality and light balance were never quite good. I had to close the shades in my office (even on cloudy days) to avoid getting a washed-out image. After a couple of months I had issues where my computer would register a USB error related to the camera and the video would go out in the middle of a Zoom meeting. At first it was solved by disconnecting the camera and then reconnecting it but eventually it gave up altogether. I contacted the seller and was shipped a replacement camera.This past week the replacement camera started having the same issue USB after about 9 months of occasional use (both had similar performance otherwise). I gave up and have replaced it with a Logitech camera which has much better image quality and light balance. I recommend avoiding this camera and instead spending a few extra dollars to get one from a reputable company with quality products.
2,The camera is fine for general use but I needed it for a proctored exam from home and it wouldn’t focus on my drivers license well enough for Honorlock to accept my ID. Instead I had to unplug it and use the laptop camera and tilt the lid to capture my work area instead. Very frustrating.
5,It’s soooo easy to set up!Picture quality is great.I’m glad I chose this one.I recommend 100%.
3,I really really liked this camera but it quit working after three months. The power button light it’s connected but the camera no longer works. I’m sad this didn’t last longer and disappointed I already have to buy a new camera. It was a good camera while it worked - just wish it worked longer.
3,The sound on this sounds like I'm talking into a paper cup. It's horrible and disappointing. I wish I had kept the box and tested it further and I would definitely send it back. The video is fine but the sound is really not usable for screen sharing video tutorials. Disappointed.
4,I needed a newer webcam for all the video conferencing I'm doing now and this is a good option. I did not read carefully that it is a wide angle only lens and it's lopsided slightly. It shows way too much of the background for my tastes but that was my fault. It's not a name brand so it's less expensive. I've had it for week now and it was easy to set up.  Again it's a good value but not perfect.
5,I have tried many web cams - its required when setting up some clients (law firms and medical clinics) for video conferencing. This cam is extremely easy to set up and install and the cover for the lens is a feature you should never overlook. The audio is clear and video is sharp even in a variety of lighting situations.There are several that installed at one office and I purchased two for home. I recommend it for the price.So far I have purchased 9 of these and installed in many environments and not one dissatisfied comment.
4,The sound from the microphone portion sounds garbled to me when I played back a Zoom meeting that was recorded where the microphone plugged into the microphone jack of the PC was just find.
1,I bought this for Zoom calls as I work from home but it stopped working after 6 months.  The microphone never really worked well (no one could hear me speaking) so from the get go it was not that best and I had to continue using my laptop microphone in order to be heard. Then recently the the video constantly flickers(significantly - like the whole image looks like static TV) which is distracting for everyone else on Zoom calls.
5,Worked right out of the box with my Mac Mini. Flawless performance both on FaceTime and Zoom.
3,I was looking for a rotation capability for the camera. I have a shelf over my PC. I was wanting to clip the camera non the shelf and rotate it down to me. This camera DOES change vertically but does not rotate.The picture quality is good so I clipped it on my monitor and it is working well.
3,Camera is fine microphone sounds like you're at the end of a tunnel even 6in away
5,Exactly what I would have expected given the description and price.
5,Great buy. Price is very reasonable for the quality of the product.
4,Shows a pretty cool picture assuming you have sufficient light in the room. The microphone is not that good however. If you have a lot of background noise for any web call then you may have to either speak really close to the microphone or get a separate microphone altogether
3,Single person fine Family pink (HELP)
2,I bought this webcam as a direct replacement for the built-in camera on my laptop. I wanted to close my laptop and still attend meetings while my laptop was docked in. I've already tried adjusting the settings on my laptop but the quality is still poor.  I guess I'm shelving this camera.
5,Easy to set up. camera quality is pretty clear.
3,Video fine sound terrible. My team told me I sounded like I’m in a cave.
5,The camera is great. However it doesn’t attach to my screen very well so I used the little tripod.
5,Exactly what I needed for school and didn't pay even one to what the store was charging
4,I've compared this side-by-side with cams that cost twice as much. It's very solid. It has great low light performance with good detail  and good contrast but the colors tend to be a bit inaccurate as pics tend to be a bit too yellow. ( I haven't tested the mic.)
5,Great quality sharp image
4,It works right out of the box. Build quality is good with a dust cover. Focus is fine. The picture quality is dark. Instead of buying lighting I use my iPhone with an app for Zoom.
4,Nice camera with reasonably good features. Price is just right. Can’t expect good audio quality if want to use it for singing. Overall a great camera for the price.
5,More frame formats and more consistent frame quality than the similar Logitech C920. Small tripod included is a nice touch I haven't seen on any other camera.
5,Good value
5,Connected it right out box and it worked great with out any issues
5,Camera interfaced well with computer and sets up automatically.  Good picture quality and sound.
3,The video that comes out of this camera is not great. The lower third of the image constantly cuts out and gitches. Also it is not able to utilize ambiant light to create a good image in low light situations. My webcam on my laptop is much better quality but I like to have my laptop to the side with my primary monitor in front of me. The hope is that this cam would be comparable quality but that is no the case.It was very easy to set up in Windows 10. I plugged it in and Windows did the rest. I thought that was very nice.
5,I got this for my wife to attach it to her monitor during Zoom meetings. It's been a good performer especially considering the price point.
4,So over all not bad. The microphone on this one is terrible so I suggest using headphone but for 25 bucks not bad. Bought it for my monitor for my office space and it fits perfectly in the top of my monitor.
4,I disliked that you couldn't prop it up on  a narrow screen and be confident it would stay in place.
4,super easy to use and nothing to install. Just plug and and its ready. I used a Mac Pro and I believe it will be the same for just about any OS.The video quality is really good and as promised. It came with a handy tripod and a lens cover that sticks to the web cam for privacy. Overall a really great product that you can trust and buy.
2,Microphone is total crap complete useless for vid conferencing. Video is good audio is terrible
4,I bought it specifically for Zoom meeting and there is not a good way to attach to the top of the monitor.
4,good camera but it is less light sensitive than camera on macbook (needs more brighter light esp. when using in the evening).and a tripod is super small! i use other tripod that i had...it works well and image is good.for this price the camera is great !
4,This is an awesome camera with great video quality and mic embedded. I was looking for something like this. I would recommend getting it for Zoom calls.
5,Great for the price.  Easy installation.
4,The only downside to this product is the picture quality when I am holding an item up close to the camera. The picture is not nearly as clear as I had hoped. I do a bit of online teaching and sometimes U have to hold something near the camera for a student to see. I wish they could see it clearly. Otherwise it works as expected.
5,This camera works well for zoom calls or anything that’s not streaming. Could be better for game streaming but great for business calls.
5,Works as promised easy USB interface and started working with windows 10 right away
4,If you need an easy non fancy camera for work or school this is t a terrible choice not super high def but does the job I tested the mic my professor heard me so all in all for 16$ it wasn’t bad.
5,This camera has a super crisp image. I've received compliments on video calls that my camera quality is awesome. Make sure you have a lamp or something to provide good lighting.
5,Easy to set up and use!
3,After several video chats on discord I discovered this camera has a fish eye lens effect?? Why? If I roll away from the side on my chair I can see it distort. Camera quality I’d say is between 720 and 1080 realistically. Microphone quality on the camera sucks too but that’s something I don’t mind too much since I have an actual mic. It’s an okay camera to start off I guess... but I don’t look too flattering under fish eye lens 😅
2,Mix does not work well
2,BOTTOM LINE: The microphone is such poor quality that the great video quality could not compensate. If I either (1) never wanted or needed to talk in meetings or (2) am willing to keep my camera on all the time then I would keep the camera. Well I am returning this camera.PRO:-- Plug and play with the included USB cord.-- Video quality is better than my laptop built-in camera (1080x1020p) in that it automatically makes my image bright.-- Comes with a privacy screen that you can stick onto the lens.-- Comes with a mini tripod.-- Camera can swivel up or down and is easy to mount onto a monitor.CON:-- Audio only works if the camera is on.-- People described the audio as "under water" even though I am only 2 feet from the camera.-- There is no support for the audio issues. It is a real pain to have to return the camera.-- Mounting is unstable so don't plan on moving the camera much.
5,Works great for meetings etc.  Quality picture and easy to use!
3,The camera is a pretty decent webcam. However it doesn't independently lit video appearance in relatively low light. It causes you to depend on the relative platforms like Zoom or Skype to increase the brightness.
3,The quality of the picture is great but I had trouble with the mic from the beginning.  When in Zoom or when making a video call I could get it to work if I unplugged and plugged back in.  That no longer works.  For now I will continue to use with my Realteck speakers in the PC.
4,Image quality is really good.  Easily better than I expected for this price range. It was plug and play on my Mac Mini. Only drawback is the mic quality is just average.  But a solid 4-star rating overall from me.
5,Works great. Have no issues and quality is amazing
4,Really nice webcam for the price. The only thing keeping it from a 5-Star review is that if the cable is touched the signal will briefly cut out. If you are using Zoom or anything similar this can be annoying at times.
4,This webcam was easy to install and the picture and sound quality were more than good enough for my needs. The microphone quit working after about 3 months of use but the manufacturer promptly sent a replacement webcam. It's nice to know they stand behind their product.
5,I have a laptop where the camera is mounted above the keyboard so it was only able to look up my nose.  This camera is super portable and easy to set up.  No more nose cam!  The image quality is great.  Best of all since it's not attached to a laptop you can position it exactly in the sweet spot of where you look best.
5,plugged in in the usb port and worked just great . nice for the price
5,No. I will rate but I hate writing reviews.
5,Works exactly as expected.  Great for video conferencing.  Setup was simple - just plug it into a USB slot.  I especially liked that it comes with a lens cover (which you need to attach manually in case you do not want this feature).I’ve used the camera with three video conferencing solutions with no issues.  Everyone reported clear video and good audio.
4,I liked the camera a lot the only issue is even with the lights on the picture is a little grainy. It is definitely nice fire the price though. I would recommend this to anyone on a budget looking for a webcam
1,Works great if plugged directly into a computer. Unfortunately if you have to plug it into a usb hub the mic will no longer work. All you hear is a buzzing noise. I've literally tried 5 different USB hubs. Started out with several cheap ones then upgraded to USB 3 and even a powered one. All have the same results. Would be a decent camera if not for this one major issue.Update: This webcam has to be plugged directly into a USB port on your computer. If you try to hook it up to a USB hub (any hub i tried many) the microphone will not work. I paid a little bit more and purchased a Logitech C920s. The difference is night and day. The quality is 10x that of this webcam. I was having the mic issue that went away with the new webcam. It was definitely not caused by my setup or system. Do yourself a favor and spend a few dollars more and get what you want. The way it mounts to the monitor is better the sound is better the picture is way better. It was worth the money rather than fighting with this thing. I originally gave it 3 stars but reduced it down to 1 after I purchased a real webcam. This is knockoff junk with mass produced internal components that are re-branded and sold as different products. Don't take a gamble get a good webcam. I paid $68 for the new camera at a retail store as opposed to paying the price gouging prices that Amazon has been allowing on here.
4,The camera quality is good clearer than my laptop’s built in camera. However sometimes it looks like a fish eye lens. That might be a setting that I need to adjust.
4,This camera is great especially for the crazy price although i wish there was one thing different. the clamp for the monitor is not very stable/fitting on my screen. otherwise product is great and I do very much recommend.
3,The camera is awesome BUT the microphone doesn't work well.  I've had virtual meetings and they always have trouble hearing me - and I talk pretty loud usually.  They have to raise their volume really high to hear me.  That shouldn't be the case.  I would send back if I could.
3,If you have a separate microphone this should work pretty swell Happy that it comes with a small tripod!However the microphone on it sounds pretty poor so either use a different microphone or get a different webcam.Its also worth noting that there isn't any software that comes with this. You just plug it in and use it wherever something asks for a Webcam.Thankfully in my case I can keep using my old webcam's microphone while getting the tripod visuals with this one.
2,I go this to use in my zoom meetings for work and other activities due to the pandemic the picture on the webcam is very good. how ever the microphone is not very clear  everyone says it sounds like im in a tunnel and that they can hardly hear me.  I have made several adjustments to the microphone settings and nothing seems to work to make me sound better.I went and bought a small extremal microphone to sit beside my desk  and that one works perfect.
5,good for meetings
4,I like the unit..  It connects me with a ZOOM network that covers parts  of three states.  The Zoom master has medium and larger groups at least once a week.  Works good.
2,The product arrived timely; however the packaging was not secure. The shipping envelope was not completely closed and the adhesive strip was still hanging outside of the package. The camera usb cord was very loose causing the camera to turn off during my video conference any time I touched the keyboard. I will be returning this product and requesting a full refund. Perhaps I got a bad one but I am unwilling to chance it again.
3,Camera quality decent but the audio is not good. Audio is distorted.
5,I use this for video calls while working from home. It works well and I like that it has a separate light to let you know that it’s on in addition to the light that shows it has power.  And then it has the flip down privacy cover which I love that I can flip that down and know that no one is watching me without me letting them.
5,Its installation process was instant - just plugged it in and it worked. After using it I came to realize that its microphone was better than the one in my laptop.It is a wide-angled camera (which was one of the reasons I bought it) though there may be users who would find this feature a nuisance as it show a large area of the room behind the user. Fortunately most programs (like Zoom Skype etc.) let you use a photo as you background which keep the background hidden.
4,For $20 you really can't go wrong with this webcam.  It far surpasses the webcam picture quality on any laptop.  Would recommend it to a friend.
5,My son used his laptop’s camera but use another separate screen for remote class. He feel uncomfortable that he has to turn his head . So we bought this that he could face to the screen directly.It can be used immediately after connected. It has a little bqautifulize function to make you look thiner and more red on lips.
4,I just bought this for college classes via Zoom. I’m using it with a PC. It’s very easy to install you pretty much just plug it in a USB port.At first the microphone didn’t work. I tried a few things but ultimately just restarting my computer fixed the issue.
3,The camera is a good purchase overall for the price it arrived well packaged and on time from the seller. The camera cover is easy to install and easy to use. The mount clip and included tripod work well. It is plug and play with my Windows 10 machine with no issues. The only negative I have found is that the room needed to be well lighted for the best display over cameras I have used in the past with minimal lighting in the same room. Great camera for the price point.
4,Nothing super fancy works well for video. Stand is a little bit unstable for my usage (not tall enough) but it's ok and does what is needed.Haven't used the audio so won't comment on that aspect.
1,This webcam stopped working the first time I went to use it. There was intermittent sound but no picture. The power light was on but the signal light went out. Tried different USB ports but nothing worked and had to return the webcam. Will not purchase this product again.
5,using product for online class.  excellent resolution
5,easy setup
4,I bought this webcam for online school as what most people would do nowadays and this one is great no problems at all. One thing to consider is that this camera has wide view of everything so anything could be in the background. The internal microphone is trash also the mini tripod.
2,The picture quality is amazing but the microphone does not work.
3,I bought this as one of three different webcams in the $20-$50 range to see how they compared to my (I thought overpriced) Logitech C-910.  They all worked "OK" but none came with anything like Logitech's software (no zoom pan follow-my-face etc.)  I've had problems with getting multiple cameras working at the same time that seemed to be the Logitech driver's fault but all three of these had the same problems. I'm giving this and the others 3 stars because they work but not much more.
5,This camera is an upgrade to the standard built-in webcam. If you add proper lighting you will be amazed at the quality and definition of this camera. The built-in microphone is adequate and the setup was simple. You will have to disable your default built-in webcam for this one to work but your computer should automatically find this webcam. Enjoy!
4,Performs as expected; not the highest end but great value
4,Works pretty well but occasionally drops out and I have to unplug and plug in again.
5,So far quality is not my style but it's a good camera that's slim and slender. Picture I haven't seen any better than 1080p looks grainy but that might be my monitor or my tower. My stuff is pretty old however installation is real easy real simple. I do not recall this having any download but if it did it was so simple I forgot about it.
4,I ordered this webcam to use for my son's online classwork that requires a webcam. It was super easy to install and worked great. If you want a cheaper 1080p webcam then I would recommend this one.
4,This product was great for the price.  We ordered 5 of them for the office and they all work great with clear picture and easy to set up
5,Works really well. Set up instantly (plug-and-play) on my Mac. Color seems accurate and image is sharp and clear. Another reviewer mentioned the color being off toward purple but my experience is that the color matches reality pretty well. The included tripod is really small but it looks that way in the listing so no call for complaint there.
3,It was easy to install and fairly easy to use.  The picture quality is good in adequate light but in lower light it doesn't do as well.  I have to increase the brightness in the camera settings which washes out the picture.The always-on red power light on the front was annoying and I taped over with 2 layers of electrical tape to block it.  The in-use light is nice but I really don't need a power light.  It isn't like it has a separate power supply from USB.
4,Wow thanks Amazon! This webcam ahead of its scheduled delivery and helped me close out the week continuing with teletherapy.  My clients talk about the images being blurry but I think that may be the case in one circumstance only. I like it’s flexibility with on laptop or tripod. I’m glad I purchased it and that it was in stock😊
4,easy to setup/good picture-for zoom
4,Decent camera. Works immediately when plugged in just out of the box. Only complaint is that it has a wide angle lens and the picture gets distorted on the sidesbut good enough for a simple webcam.
5,Plugged it in and all is well. I use it for teaching online and it is clearly up to the task. Picture is fine and students say the audio is good. Opened the box  clipped it on my desktop screen plugged it into a spare USB port opened Zoom and Webex sessions without missing a beat.  Very happy so far.
5,Worth my moneylove wide picture.
5,Fácil la instalada
4,This camera is very easy to use and the quality looks great however the mic on it is awful. I always use a secondary mic instead.
4,I liked the ease of setup and picture quality.  I am not sure if this is just a problem with Mac but the microphone becomes inaccessible during use.  I have to disconnect and reconnect during the session.
5,It was quick and easy to install!
5,I am very impressed with this web cam I have a dell lap top for work and we do all our coaching and meetings through Microsoft teams and the camera in my Lap top was just not cutting it poor picture quality.  I am very happy and satisfied with this camera  the picture quality is great even in low lights.
4,Surprising picture quality for what I paid. I wish it had an on/off switch or button but otherwise does the job of “kitten cam” for my stream just fine.
3,Bought this camera for my son's distance learning purpose.  It was pretty easy to install just plug and play.  After installing and testing it on Zoom we noticed the camera picture was of very good quality.  However the mic didn't work for some reason.  I went thru various troubleshooting steps with the camera and my Windows 10 and it worked for a short time but that was only temporary.  Bought another camera from a different vendor on Amazon and it worked perfectly from the moment it was plugged into the computer.  So needless to say I'm returning this one.
5,Easy to use and worth its price
2,It's a low cost camera and the image is low quality.  With adequate indirect lighting the image had light / dark shading in horizontal lines.  Not suitable for business videoconferencing.
5,There is not much to say.  I plugged it in and it works.  Great picture and the microphone picks up everyone in the room nicely - much better than our laptop ever did.  The only problem is that the lens cover (which is supposed to have a frame that sticks to the base) keeps falling off as the stickum didn't last for a day.
2,sucks
2,Easy set up. Satisfactory picture for the price. But  I was told by my team that they could not understand me. I did a test later and discovered that it sounds like I'm speaking through a pillow. I can't use this device. Maybe this was fluke and nobody else has this problem but I have to get a different solution.
2,I bought this camera for a couple computers back in Sept 2020 and thought I would give an update at this point. Unfortunately around October we started to experience issues with the "not recognizing USB driver". I was so convinced it was a computer/windows issue not recognizing the cameras because both systems do not have installed cams. So I figured the camera/drivers/software were having issues recognizing the external cams.  I proceeded to have drivers uninstalled installed wiped etc... and dealt with the cameras working one day and then the next right back to the same issue for the next 3 months. Finally I realized since the issue was occurring to 2 computers exactly the same I'm going to assume it is the cameras NOT the computers. I really wanted to love these cameras since there were so many good reviews. I have to blow my budget now and get new cams to see if it's indeed a cam or computer issue.
3,Good camera!
4,I really think the camera works very well and produces an excellent picture.  I am disappointed that it does not appear to have an "on/off" switch so that it can be turned off when not in use instead of having to be disconnected from the USB port.
5,The easiest install I ever experienced. Literally a plug in (usb) and it works
4,The quality of the devise isn't bad. I am happy with my purchase.
3,pretty blurry but the fps is good
5,I love this webcam with tripod.  It's very clear and I like that the tripod has flexible legs you can screw on or leave off and place it on top of your monitor.  Also I like the privacy shutter because you can close it and you know nothing is on (or you can turn it toward the wall).  I would definitely order this item again.
5,great camera
4,Camera works great handles the low light condition much better than other cameras i have. The attached microphone is crap lots of echos and reverb.
3,I purchased the cam as an optional replacement to the integrated version in my laptop. Main use was business purposes (video conferencing).PROs:Good pictureEasy setupShutter coverCONs:Poor audioI tried adjusting various settings talking at several sound levels changed distance from cam/mic but no improvements. Unfortunately I had to discontinue use of the product because people had a hard time hearing me.
5,Product installed easily. Plug n play into my Linux laptop running Windows 10 virtual machine.  No problems. The only issues are minor. (1) The camera doesn't sit on my monitor securely. If I open the privacy door it tends to fall off. (2) the privacy door sticks on. Doesn't stick on too securely. You have to be careful opening and closing it.
5,its good
5,Just what I needed for older notebook PC
2,Solved initial challenge of flickering; changing setting in Skype from 50 to 60hz seemed to fix this. I don't use Skype but could not find any other way to toggle. Would still be at ~4.5 star level for price pointHowever the audio from its microphone could not be any worse; it is not understandable. It sounds like mushmouth with a heavy lisp. After fairly thorough internet searching and playing with windows and application settings as well as trying to find a driver and rolling back the windows 10 plug-and-play driver I am giving up for now; though I did post a question asking for tips above. If you don't ever need to use the mic I would recommend else until some fix is introduced you might be wise to consider another product if you want the microphone.
3,I purchased this webcam to try creating some card-making classes.  I had no experience with webcams.  It is easy to use.  Provides a nice video.  I would prefer a camera with the ability to do close-ups.  This is a single wide shot webcam.  Because of the very reasonable cost I will use this webcams as I learn how to make videos.
4,The camera is good. I am unable to get the microphone to work but that might be user error. In general I'm not unhappy with it.
2,Worked great for the first 6 weeks and now my video keeps freezing and the camera keeps turning itself off. Wish I would have just bought a nicer/ more expensive camera in the first place…
2,I tried to stream on my xbox one it made my game lag to the max everyone including myself in the xbox one party was glitching sounding like a robot. I would not recommend this product due to that fact. I'm very disappointed and upset that I spent all that money for it to not work properly
5,Bought this webcam to replace the built in camera on my laptop.  Now I won’t have to take the laptop off of the docking station to do a webcast.  Set up was easy just plug in to a USB port.  Loaded drivers in 30 seconds and I was good to go.  I use another set of speakers/mic so I can’t speak to that.  Nice long USB cable.  I would buy this again.
5,ease of use
5,My desktop computer had no camera or mic and found myself needing to participate in Zoom meetings and hearings during pandemic lockdown. The “privacy shutter” is just a little lens cap but it does the job.  All around a good product at a good price.
5,This camera was so easy to install and use.  Just plugged it in to my Windows 10 machine entered a Zoom meeting and everything was good.  No special work to get the camera installed in the OS.  The picture quality and focus is excellent.  No complaints about this camera.
4,Arrived a day ahead of schedule!Not fantastic but good quality for the price.
5,Was worried after reading some of the reviews and there was no need for picture quality and the sound is amazing for the price range. Easy setup. I guess some people don't know much about a simple install. All you have to do is unmute the mic and turn boost up like you would have to do on any mic .
5,The camera is exactly what I was looking for. Great picture and easy to use
4,It is good for short period. When it was on for 40 minutes or more it shuts off often
4,It came on time and it works. What else can I say. For the money it works good. Only gave four stars cause I would like to have some way to zoom in and out.
2,Great camera but sound doesnt work unless speaking right in to the camera which means the other side sees your mouth not face but for the price the camera is good
3,No matter what I did I couldn’t ever get this camera to function possibly when using Zoom for video conferencing. Every time I would try to mute or unmute myself the program would freeze. The quality of the camera is surprisingly good for the price and outside of using Zoom it was functional. If you need a camera for video conferencing just spend the money and get a Logitech.
5,Works great!
5,Love the quality of the camera. Used for personal online Apts
5,Great picture. No issues with it
5,Great webcam super high res easy to setup......plug and play!
2,It's a very wide angle webcam. You want to make sure that you are sitting close are to your background wall. Otherwise is going to take the whole room. The quality is a little better than the integrated webcam on my average model laptop. But definitely not as good as your phone's front camera!
1,Doesn't work well with Mac. If I touch the wire or try to adjust the camera it switches off and I have to restart the computer for it to work again.
1,The camera was simple to get set up and started on our computer. However when I turned it on the picture quality was horrible! All grainy and more black and white rather than in color? In the settings screen at the picture quality option the drop down option \/ was totally empty were no options for picture quality?Did I just get a bad unit?  Hope there is and answer since I purposely bought this for my wife's PC so she could use it for her Zoom meetings! Not sure she would be happy with it now!
4,Bought for my desktop p/c; overall good value.  Light adjustment and color a bit off but a clear picture and audio.  Have used several times since my purchase.  Would recommend purchase to a friend.
5,Having a camera
5,Had this about a year or 16 months now! Still works great!!
2,Sadly this could have been a great webcam. The picture was fine for the price. I wouldn't fault it as it was really acceptable video and clarity. The worse problem is the microphone. It simply fails to work. I have to unplug the USB and re-plug it back in and the microphone starts to work for a little and fails again. Then I have to unplug and re-plug it in again. I checked "Device Manager" and it detected the microphone ok using the "USB Camera" standard driver (Windows 10). I tried to uninstall driver and let it redetected and installed fine but the microphone will not input any sound until you physically unplug the USB connection & re-plug it in.Problem is it keeps failing so I ran out of ideas to fix this. Have to return it unfortunately.
5,I tried a couple of different webcams in this price range and this one was definitely the best. I don't like the look as much but it worked better. It also was super easy setup with an imac. I literally just had to plug it in and that was it.
5,Simple camera that does the job.  Provides a second camera to your laptop.
3,I was hoping to improve on the quality of my meetings but n oone notices any difference and I've asked between this and my laptop's built-in camera. No software to control it It won't work with my 1-year-old smart TV in short I'm not convinced it was worth the money.
5,This camera was easy to setup. Really just plug it in an you're done. I've been using the mic on this too and it works great. Picks up a little background noise but it's not too bad. Love the privacy flap. Might get another one for home too.
2,Everyone complains that they can't hear me very well.  It sits right on top of my monitor so I am about 3 feet from the microphone.  It has become unusable for that fact.  Video is fine.
3,The title says it all.
3,The camera looks and works nice.  The onboard mic is full of static and unusable.  I'd return but I'm using the mic built into the tablet so I'm good...
5,This was very easy to use just plug it in and it works.  I have a MacBook Air and the quality of the picture is way better than my built in camera.  This allows me to put the camera up higher at a more flattering angle.
1,I bought this webcam as an external webcam to my work from home setup so I wouldn't have to keep opening up and using my docked laptop. It worked adequately for the first two days although the microphone was TERRIBLE quality but I figured it would work well enough for just picture. This morning I decided to work on my laptop from a different location in my home unplugged the USB and when I plugged it back in for a video call the quality of the picture was so washed out no matter how many blinds I closed adjustments to brightness/contrast/saturation I did or moving to different angles I tried. I basically looked like a ghost which was very distracting and not appropriate for a work call. Returning after only 3 days - avoid.
3,The camera works fine and just needs to be plugged in to install but the built in mic doesn't seem to be very good. It has trouble picking up my voice.edit: Update:  Customer service contacted me and offered a free replacement. I declined the replacement since I already had a headset whose microphone worked fine and they refunded $10. The company's customer service was very polite and generous.
4,Great camera for the price. Have used it for meetings working from home for the last few months.
3,The picture is very clear - it is way better than my laptop's built-in camera.2 negatives...The wide angle has a somehwat distorted fish-eye appearance.The microphone is absolutely horrendous.  You can't understand anything said on it.I am debating on whether the turn it or just keep it to.use for the photo quality
5,Nice
4,Your friends  receiving will report a "fish eye" effect to what they see otherwise not bad for the low price
3,Installation is simple. At this price point it's okay. Video quality is acceptable. What surprised me is the terrible microphone. And no it's not my audio system settings. In addition there appears to be about a 5 degree off-axis skew. It appears that my head is slightly rotated off center though the horizontal axis is perfectly level.
3,Video is great however you will need to purchase a headset with mic for use with this product.You must be within about 24" to be heard and even then audio quality is low.About 5-10 min into each Zoom call I get a pop up that says the mic has stopped functioning.
3,La calidad Nobes buena en todos los sentidos pero por el precio creo que no podía esperar más
2,I have this hooked up to a HP Thunderbolt docking station. I have tried hooking it up directly to the laptop but it constantly drops connection with the machine regardless of where the physical connection is. I love the camera cover and it worked great for a few applications but once my employer migrated over to MS Teams this camera was not reliable at all. I worked with my employer’s IT department to troubleshoot but it was a futile effort. I want to mention that this camera works fine on my personal laptop (also Windows 10).If you’re using this for business/home office I would splurge for something more reliable.
5,Nothing
3,We bought this to have as a back up for the built in iMac camera that has had some issues. This way we’d be able to continue with distance learning without having to take the computer in for repair. The web cam had better clarity than the built in but the white balance was overly magenta. Based on this I’d go with a different manufacturer if I had to do it again.
3,The wife is now working from home and needed a camera for her zoom meetings. This camera allowed her to be seen but the microphone won't work (Windows 10 platform) which is why I only gave it a passing grade. More trouble to send it back than it is worth. She is happy just to be seen and not heard anyhow.
1,Wish I had read some 1 star reviews prior to buying.  Microphone is an issue for me - regardless of connecting directly to the laptop or through USB hub. Since I have barely used it but purchased it about 5 months ago I may not be able to return it.The product does not come with the company info or how to contact them - poor!!
3,I bought this webcam for zoom classes because it said it was a mic and camera combo. while the computer recognizes there is a mic plugged in the mic does not register any sound at all.Overall its an okay webcam but if you need both mic and camera buy a different one.
5,Easy to set up and good quality.
5,This has been a great little web cam for our work computers. The quality is great and it was so easy to set up. Love that there is a privacy cover as well. Super inexpensive but great quality!
5,Easy to set up....just plug and play. Have not tested the audio yet but I sure it will be good as well!Good price for a camera like this and so much better than the one I purchased several  years ago !
3,It is easy to set up and use this camera with my PC. The fish eye lens makes for a great video image. The only issue is the microphone. When I did video phone call the person on the other end could hardly hear me speaking- they said it sounded muddled.
5,This a great product that will not break your pocket. I like it.
2,I reviewed this webcam along with four others to evaluate for use in a classroom setting and am specifically writing a review to warn people. The camera does indeed have a 1/4" mounting hole and comes with a handy tripod however it is such terrible quality I cannot recommend it's purchase for more than $20 or so.As you can see in the above photo it has significant issues with white fringing is washed out by only moderate light and cannot correct and overall produces a poor image. It's audio is barely better as it comes across tinny and echoey with poor quality compared to most competitors in the same price range.That said it connected easily to the computer and could serve someone's purposes if they didn't care about image or audio quality.If you get an amazing deal it could be worth it but otherwise steer clear.
3,This thing works fine but the monitor mount is nonexistent.  It just kinda sits there.  I can't make it "flush" with the back of the monitor per instructions because the back is curved; but even if it wasn't it would wobble around because you can't tighten in any way.  Are they all like this??
3,Easy to install and use for video conferencing but had issues losing connection
3,The in-built mic of this webcam is extremely weak. When I finally got to test it during my Zoom class my professor kept saying I needed to speak louder yet the mic setting was on the highest volume but no matter how loud I spoke he couldn't hear me well.
5,I would buy again. It's a good value. I use the tripod that is included.The clip to the top of a monitor was unstable for my devices.
3,This camera has good picture quality and sets up easily. The tripod makes it easy to go from my home office to work and back. The microphone only seems to pick up if you're quite close to the camera however. I ended up buying a separate microphone to supplement it.
4,Cómo canta funciona bien y tiene buena calidad para el precio. El micrófono funciona muy mal
5,Great quality - camera and microphone
2,Worked great for a month then the video degraded quickly but the audio seemed to still be working.
2,good value but after a yr  the people on other side say they cant see me because it too dark
3,The camera was simple to install and works well with Zoom.  But it will only run for about 5 minutes before it turns itself off.  It also pulls all of the available power from my usb port on my mac (500mA).  I am going to order a different camera
4,Seems to do what it promised.
4,They make it look like its a floor stand when its a desk stand for the camera.  False advertisement.
3,I use this camera for Zoom meetings and the image is grainy and dark despite my settings. I previously used an LG camera but bought this one because of its price and instant delivery. I'm going to keep it as a back up but will be ordering a different brand.
3,I really loved this webcam. I have a MacBook Air and the camera quality is awful. I purchased this camera in hopes that the quality would be better and it was.Unfortunately as of today the webcam is not even working. It does not turn on at all.
5,Used on several computers. Works great!
3,Although the camera image is of decent quality the microphone did not work. This could be the defect of the the piece that I had experience.
5,Very easy to install - plug in and it's ready to go!
3,This camera lacked features such as tilt pan and zoom. These features were in the camera I had before this one. Thought I was getting an upgrade but not so. The picture quality is good though.  I do not recommend if you want options.
4,Easy to use. Plug & zoom.
3,For what you pay you get a pretty ok little HD webcam. It's not great in low light but it gets the job done. The audio quality of the built in mic however is absolutely horrible. So bad I'm actually thinking about exchanging this for something else.
4,needed a cam for live streaming its not the best but its not the worst and it works fine out the box.
1,BUYER BEWARE!This camera is supposed to have a built-in microphone. When plugged into the PC it indicated one but no sound... On opening up the case I discovered that no mic cartridge had ever been soldered down to the PC board inside. I have been forced to buy a separate microphone so the camera can be used for zoom meetings. It costs too much in time and fuel to return so I'm eating the cost but this review won't come down even if the vendor fixes the issue.
5,Plug and Play worked perfectly - Camera is sharp microphone is very good and the quality is very good for the price.You would expect to pay much more for a camera that works as well as this. - I have been on Zoom for more than 30 minutes 2x and each time without any issues very clear video and audio.--So far so good
4,My peers recommended this product as we use WebEx for working remote. Captures very good and clean video or images and allows convenient positioning with a small tripod.
1,It’s cheap for a reason. Instructions were terrible. Quality is NOT HD. So cheaply made it seems more like a “prize” you would win at a ticket arcade. Actually more like a cheap prize you would expect to receive from collecting bazooka Joe gum wrappers
4,Watching local sports teams or individuals play!I enjoy keeping up with the news.
3,overall its a decent webcam and if you're looking for an inexpensive option this is great.  it has a privacy filter on it which is convenient.  however dont expect 1080p quality.  It's a bit grainy and blurry but it's still tolerable and good for basic video calls.
4,Does what it has to do. Bad in low light.
1,I can't get it to work. I had two friends and 3 relatives that work with computers (it's their actual job) try to figure it out and they still couldn't get it to work. Money wasted but oh well worse things have happened. Maybe the product itself was defective. I don't know. Just proceed with caution. Happy shopping :-)
1,The camera worked fine for a while but recently failed. It lasted about 6 months. Over the past week it started to fail randomly while I was in work meetings. I would not recommend this product.
2,Picture quality is fine but the audio quality is poor. Everyone on calls say I sound muffled; works worse than a laptop's built in mic
2,I purchased 9 Jan 21 and have intermittent operation challenges.  Camera works fine - but turns itself off or loses power and can only be revived by un/re plug.  I have tested all of the PC's USB ports with other devices and none randomly lose power.  Sometimes camera powers up with PC sometimes not; sometimes power indicator just flashes until I un/re plug.  Win10 is all up to date with win10 camera working fine as long as device holds power.  I therefore do not recommend this camera for essential - i.e. work related tasks.  My PC has 4 USB ports and I am now reusing each in the hope the camera will stabilize.
5,I like it very much it is the first one I have ever had. I am 76 years young and my 57 year old Wife just had surgery on her brain I can not see her in person but with this Web camera I can see her and talk to her and she can see and talk to me
2,Microphone is awful
2,The picture/video quality is superb! I couldn't ask for anything better.HOWEVER--the quality of the camera physically is quite garbage. I was only able to use mine once before it started to give me issues. I'd have it plugged in and go to adjust the position and it'd act is if it'd lost connection or it'd been unplugged. All from a slight movement.Also you can ONLY use it if the room you are in is well lit. Like you need to have your ceiling light on. A backlight or the LED RGB straps people seem to like these days will not be sufficient.Allow me to save you the hassle by saying keep looking. This camera isn't worth it.
4,Esta perfecto .y muy bien el precio.👍
5,Need a camera for my work monitor so that I didn't need to keep my laptop open. This was recommended to me and was a great buy. Picture quality is great and the price was right.
5,I have used it for several different meetings and it has a great picture.  I have also used it to record a video and it worked really well.  Good quality.
5,I was pleasantly surprised at how simple this camera is to use and how good the quality of the picture is even in low light.  I wish I had owned it years ago.
5,I was able to test the audio via google voice it was clear plus used windows camera to see the camera working.
1,Awful product!!! It will flash and turn off if you use this for more than 15 mins. Trash
4,Solid camera at a great price
5,Received this camera HD the pixel is really high see very clearly the image presents very good no blur if you want to buy a high-definition camera then it will never let you down we use it as a video conference is very convenient very easy to use colleagues said the effect is great!
5,Very good inexpensive and easy to use.  Comes with a leg which allows you to affix to a monitor as well as a tripod for countertop mounting.  Satisfied.
5,This company gets 5 stars from me...the product is good good camera quality. Their customer service is great! I had an issue and emailed them with very prompt response and they stood behind their product warranty. Thank you!
3,Great camera. Microphone not so great. I still have to use my headset to talk which is what I was trying to get away from. However my previous camera was freezing up and I’ve not had any issues with this camera.
1,I've tried installing the one I received on two different computers and while the camera quality is fine the various entities with whom I need to Zoom for work all complain about the microphone clarity (or lack thereof). They say there is a buzzing sound and the sound quality is poor.  So I've had to fall back on my headset and am once again searching for a functional webcam/microphone.
5,Easy to setup at a good price and the quality of the camera is very good.My only bad comment would be that the clamp that holds the camera to my desktop screen doesn't hold it tight enough
4,It works pretty good.
5,Easy to set up easy to use. Especially like the little tripod you can set it on! Plus it has green and red indicator lights to let you know if it connected and/or on. Recommend.
4,Easy to install and use
5,Quality and value! This webcam is easy to install gives a decent picture and sound and very adaptable to either place on top monitor or use on tripod. Includes a camera cover to block video manually. Great purchase.
3,The tripod consisted of flexible legs which I think negates the point of a tripod.  Also said legs are kept in place with a very small amount of low-quality glue with predictable results.  It doesn't need a tripod.  I guess it just needed a tripod as a selling point.
1,The first few uses after the webcam arrived worked fine. However after about a week of owning the webcam the image started flickering and I could tell that the connection was unstable as it would either cutout or my computer would not be able to recognize that the webcam was plugged in. This would usually correct itself after plugging it back in but after 2~3 more weeks of this the webcam finally shut off entirely and it will no longer turn on. I'm sure YMMV but my experience with this product has been very poor and I will not be purchasing one again.
1,Not sure why the vendor decided to make the claim of "1080P". This is basically a low res high noise cam design from decades ago.Please don't waste your time. Otherwise you will have to return it the second you plug it in.
5,This camera works great and for a 1/3 of what I paid for a logitech C920s Pro. I should bought 2 of these instead of the logitech.
4,Used this for zoom meetings. easy to use and works great
1,The camera is delayed when I stream and laggy it stopped working in two months🫠
3,I really wanted to love this camera but it required a direct connection to the PC/Laptop and I don't have any free ports to connect it too. Had to send it back as it didn't work with the powered USB 3.0 Hub that I had.
5,Very easy to install and use. Best part is it comes with a convenient tripod. This allows me to use the camera from side angle as well and not just on top of a monitor. Overall good purchase.
4,I use this camera for streaming with zoom
2,I tested the video and it was fine. Unfortunately when I tested the audio the sound was not clear no matter how I placed the mike. Too bad but I did buy another webcam which has better audio.
1,Worked very well the first day I plugged it in then the next time I turned on my computer it claimed the USB device was unrecognized. With zero drivers to try and update it it is now a paper weight
4,Its ok
2,I like the compact nature of the camera and the initial quality of picture and sound. And then just like that the picture started flickering and with it the sound. I would not buy this camera again unless you need it for a very short period of time.I also wasn't very happy with the height of the tripod.
3,The built-in webcam on my MacBook produces much more realistic colors but this add-on for my Windows Desktop was easy to install and get running.
3,Returning. It works for video and the quality doesn’t look good for picture but that could be bc zoom lowered the quality I hear? Problem I’m having with windows desktop is microphone worked first day but haven’t been able to get it to work since. Hope others have better luck.
5,Very pleased.  For a cheap camera this is definitely with at least what they are asking.  Would buy this camera and from this seller again
5,Camera was just what I was looking for easy to set up and a great quality picture.
5,Camera is great quality.  Easy to install.
5,Camera auto and picture are great quality. It. comes with a tripod that can be placed  anywhere not just on the subject. Good quality for the price.
3,The camera background of the picture is kinda rounded looking or curved when looking at yourself. The quality of the picture is OK not to bad. The consumer quality price of the camera is probably only worth maybe 25.00$ in my opinion. doesn't work well with Google Duo. But works well with Zoom.  I give it a 3.5 stars
3,The microphone is not as good as one you would find on a logitech camera. Camera is wide angle but warped on edges.
5,I bought this for the sons for distance learning. It works great very easy to install. Love that it can clip on top of the PC or you can use the tripod. Easy to move around and use on other devices. Will buy it again.
1,I was honestly excited to find a cheap webcam and the reviews made it feel as though I was getting a good deal because I only needed a webcam that was better than the one on my laptop... well maybe it would have been if it actually worked. After waiting forever my laptop finally recognized it and it was working. Then it would stop working and 2 seconds later start. Then it wouldn't work at all. I know I am being repetitive but I am just so frustrated because I needed this for class and now have to wait and buy another one.
5,This is a very high definition camera It helped me a lot during the epidemic You can have meetings at home and communicate with friends at the same time High-definition pictures and the real party is no different It made me less lonely during the epidemic
1,The camera I got is a 720p at best there is now chance this thing is 1080p
5,Good quality
1,My camera worked for 3 days and then just stopped.
5,Good depth of field
5,This webcam is very clear smooth and will not freeze it is very clear even in dim light it can also filter background noise the sound is pure and clear there will be no mixed sounds simple installation and no complicated drivers.  It's awesome
2,I dislike a piece is missing.
5,Exactly as described. Does exactly what I wanted it to do. I would recommend this to friends and others.
5,No problems or complaints both computers I've used it with recognized it automatically.  I like the little tripod attachment stable enough and easy to position.
5,Was easy to install on Windows 10 USB plug-n-play no driver needed. I had to tinker with my Windows 10 privacy settings nothing to do with this camera itself. Once Win10 settings and permissions were set camera worked fine microphone picks up sound fine too.
5,ITS the same angle of laptop but way better quality and i love the fact you can hook up to any camera tri-pod
1,Absolute trash.1. Does not work plugged into a USB-C hub (Hyperdrive) which works with a 4k monitor and literally all my other devices. It detects but shows only black when I tried. Had to connect it directly.2. Picture quality is much fuzzier than my pathetic MacBook Pro 720p built in camera. This is like losing a car race to a bicycle. it's probably a 640x480 picture being "upscaled" in hardware to pretend to be 1080p.3. Not only was the picture worse than 720p but the exposure is horrendous. I have 4 bright lamps in my room for good lighting and this camera looks like I'm actually sitting in the dark. It's literally like night and day compared to the Mac camera I intended to replace.Save your money and use the built-in if this is all you can afford. Or buy a cheap 720p or 480p Webcam because this is definitely not better! I returned it immediately.
3,I liked the video quality but the microphone wasn't clear.
5,This works great.  I was really surprised at how will it worked.  Replaced my Creative Live! Cam Webcam and couldn't be happier. Cost less too.
4,Works as expected!
5,This met my expectations. Good value.
3,It works pretty well most of the time but even though I have a stellar internet connectionwhen I try to screencast the audio is Mr. roboto. Sometimes the image is pixilated a bit too.I'm returning and getting a better webcam.
4,Works as designed.  Picture and auto focus is good.  Tripod...well not so much.
2,I bought this camera in March at the height of covid when it was the only camera available. All the brand-name ones (such as Logitech) were out of stock.I've had this camera for 6+ months now and it's a good quality lens and picture. The center of the image is sharp and in great focus. Unfortunately if you are taking calls from a normal-size room the sides of the image will have a curved fisheye look. There is no way to "straighten" the image.So I recommend this camera only if you are going to be using it with a green screen.
2,Bought a Logitech and had to return it as it would lose focus. This one was the next more expensive model and it had the exact same issue. Picture goes blurry but if it put my hand two inches from camera it’s crystal clear. This one came with a 4 port USB port which half the ports stopped working.  I don’t recommend Logitech and only bought the brand because my boss told me to. Note in picture I’m the burry person on bottom right.
1,This product crashed our computer within seconds of it being plugged in. I would never plug this device into any other machine we own.
5,Bought this for online proctorWe testing with WGU. Meets their requirements and had worked well. Just plug and use. No problems
5,This lil guy is the real deal. Primarily use it for zoom and webex and it gives you a strong wide angle. Step your background wall or home game up because this camera will pick it up. Very happy with this camera.
4,The picture isn’t amazing but it definitely gets the job done!
3,First the camera is great! My only complaint is audio that's on-again off-again. Have to tinker with it much of the time to get both going.
2,Set up was easy. Picture looks really good a slight improvement over my built in Dell XPS laptop camera. But the sound is BAD. Really bad even from less then 2 feet away in a quiet room. I had to purchase an additional USB microphone for our Zoom calls so people could understand me. Now I need two USB devices for calls one for the camera and one for sound. It's far from an easy or elegant solution. Look elsewhere if you plan on using this for sound.
2,Good picture quality but the camera is exceptionally "glitchy" - I tried everything including changing the USB port ensuring the cord was straight etc. but the camera constantly glitches.  I realized about 31 days after I bought it that it wasn't a quality product but unfortunately couldn't return it.  Don't waste your money.
1,The camera is quality is awful and just everything about it is awful
3,Everything is big in the middle and warped inward at the edges. The redeeming quality is it makes my small nose look normal size.
5,Quality quickly dropped off permanent pixels and texture. Return window closed and I can’t contact support. This is only 3.5 months old and I paid $$ for this! Super unhappy
5,Camera works great easy to plug and play. The little tripod is only 2-3 inches tall but the legs are flexible and can let you place it in multiple positions.Great price- a real bargain.
1,Not 1080p.  MUCH lower resolution.  Junk toy camera.  Even my kids laughed at how bad this thing performed.
5,its just want i wanted easy to install but i am having problems with the audio. Im trying to figure out why.
5,This was very easy to setup and took only a few minutes.  The quality of the picture and audio is really good for the price and is even better than some more expensive products similar to this.
3,Good item priced right quality in question. Stop working after 4 months
5,One issue I keep having is that the microphone sometimes doesn't works with some of the apps that he uses for classwork.  It's not easily or quickly diagnosed or resolved.
5,I wish it came with a microphone. good buy for the price. works great and you can place it anywhere on your desk area or space when working
1,Initially when I purchased this camera it was to replace one that only lasted a year.  This one lasted 2 months.  It was positioned on top of a monitor and didn't move the entire time I had it.  The return window is 30 days as is the case with most cheap products and when I went to chat Amazon for support all I was told is you cant return it....NOT HAPPY with this garbage.
5,Picture quality is bright and clear. Big improvement over my laptop camera and the price was great. I almost paid twice that for a Logitech but the one I wanted was out of stock. I’m glad I took a chance on this one.
1,I needed an external webcam to put on my desk and thought the Webcam HD Webcam 1080P with Privacy Shutter and Tripod Stand would work. It was inexpensive and I liked the idea of the tripod. Unfortunately the tripod is ineffective. The camera is very light and the bendable legs on the tripod started to revert back to being straight so imagine being on camera as it slowly starts to move so you are moving your head to stay in shot. I was willing to live this but after about 2 months a wire in the camera must have come loose so any movement (even the smallest) caused the camera to lose it's connection. Nothing worse than being on a video call and your camera keeps dropping. This might work if you only need the camera for occasional personal use but it definitely isn't up to use for work calls.
3,The camera worked fine but the housing of it was fragile and the cord ripped out.
3,The mic did not work after installation and test.  I used the webcam in a Zoom meeting and could see and be seen but I was unable to verbally communicate.  Do you have a suggestion?  Should I return the webcam?
4,Great camera!
5,The speed of logistics is very fast the product quality is also very good the appearance is fashionable I like it very much I use it to and distant family video call use is very convenient very good
5,Great product for the price.  The four dollar additional discount was a bonus.
5,Great for work zoom calls that require a web cam. Was surprised with the great quality for what I paid.10/10 would recommend
3,Really bad fish eye
5,Got this webcam (2) to use in family Zoom chats and for my mother to use on her computer.  Both were easy to install plug and play. The performance has been great so far. Would buy again if I needed another one.
3,Great camera quality easy setup.  It doesn’t pick up audio from a couple feet away though.  Use it for video not audio.
3,Works great but as soon as the 90 day free coverage was up the microphone broke!
3,focus not so good night vision sucks. it mite be just mine who nows.
5,Very pleased with this - the camera is great as advertised and I love the little tripod that came with it.
2,I bought this camera to use for school in my proctored exams. When it came time for my online assessment however most of the initial setup was working with the webcam trying to get it to focus. Its wide angle lens means that it can't auto focus on objects close to it so my ID verification was nearly impossible and almost caused me to fail my exam.Get a different camera if you need one for school
2,I bought this for a Chrome Box so my son could use it for his school Zoom meetings. The camera works great and has good quality and a wide lens. The issue is the mic it only works once you unplug the USB and plug it back in. Once you close the Zoom call and start a new one the same thing is required. It is very annoying to have to do this constantly. The description says that it is made for Chrome  but clearly has issues.I tired this with Google Meet as well and the same issue.
5,Video is extremely clear easy set up just plug the USB and let it go.  Great camera.
5,It sits right on top of monitor. Use in zoom meeting. No setup required just plug it in.  Like it a lot.
3,The camera has the fisheye effect and gives everything in the room a pinkish hue.  Otherwise it's a good camera.
2,I can say that the picture itself was good. But I didn't realize it was wide angle which is apparently standard for all webcams in this price range and was my fault for not reading the whole product description. But it was returned because the audio did not work at all. It wasn't a computer setting because I checked everything and my other webcam worked fine. I did really like how well it mounted on top of my TV that I use as my monitor. It easily gripped the top and that's why I wished it had worked and not have been wide angle.
5,Works perfectly with MS teams clear sound videos is awesome.
1,The video quality was good for the price. The mic does not work well sounds like I am really far away from the mic and doesn't seem very clear. My old laptop sounds way better than this webcam.I've tried different settings turning up the mic. It still doesn't pick up audio very well.
3,Camera itself is quite good but directions for use poor.  Manufacturers name doesn’t appear anywhere and no software accompanies camera.
3,The camera seems rounded. Discolored image and video and very low quality. There’s no way it’s 1080p meaning they lied on the listing.
2,The camera I received only focuses on the background and my face is blurry. Since there is nothing to adjust I am not able to sharpen the foreground image. I have played with the lighting in the room but it's still a very poor camera for meetings. I didn't use this seriously for a while and kept thinking I could adjust it somehow but now it is too late to return. I thought others could learn from my experience.
5,Good camera and it produces a good picture. Use for ZOOM Conferences. Manual is almost useless very little information about the camera’s operation. Someone with no experience with computer cameras may have a hard time setting up and operating it.
2,The fish eye on this thing is aweful and from what I can find there isn't any native setting available through windows nor is there any software from the company to download to change the camera settings for using in different applications.We use Spelltable to play MTG and this is simply not usable for that. It's fine if you're just using it for face cam and don't care if the background looks curved.
5,very nice webcam although you need to know that it’s a wide angle camera compared to other webcams youll see a lot more than usual.
5,I use this for Zoom for guitar with friends.  It is very easy to set up and does a wonderful job.
5,This has got to be the best picture and audio quality for a compact camera I've seen. What a great buy!
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             I recently purchased this camera for my computer since it came without one. The picture quality is good.  The problem is with the microphone.  When listening to playback it sounds like the speaker is under water.  I've uploaded a short video to show how it works. I do not recommend this camera.
3,Used for zoom and had evening sessions definitely need to purchase some type of lighting if you plan to use this any time after dark.  In the daytime I just open the blinds and it does better.
3,Couldn't get it done work right! Don't know if it's me or the camera. Sent it back
1,I bought it for my regular group zoom sessions but it stopped working by the 3rd one. I should have realized that a webcam at that price wouldn't be the best but I expected it to work a little longer than it did.At least I could count on Amazon to make it right which is greatly appreciated. They are refunding my money.
1,The color scheme of subjects are off. Skin looks red. Picture is so not clear.  The reason why I'm writing this review is because I went back to Amazon to find another webcam which made me upset because I have this one that advertised 1080p but this is not a quality camera. I need a clear picture where we look normal on screen.
5,Great price for Webcam. It was super easy to install. It is as good as the $90 cam that I bought at Staples.
5,This is truly plug-and-play.The images are excellent due to auto brightness and color adjustment.The sound is clear.Also it has a built in flip up lens cap.
5,I'm very happy with this camera. I had purchased it for business picture is clear color is good and you get a fairly wide field of vision with it. The camera was super easy to setup.
5,I needed this for the increased number of Zoom classes due to the pandemic.  It came ahead of the scheduled time delay so I was very pleased. It works well without issues.  Easily set up for my PC.
3,After a month of usage the microphone has stopped working. The video is still great though.
1,I bought this to replace a Logitech webcam that I've had for over 5 years and that is not working properly.  The two most important things for a webcam are good picture quality and good sound quality.  This webcam has neither of those important attributes. The picture looks completely washed out and people experiencing my sound on Zoom tell me that they have a hard time understanding me.  Neither of those issues occurred with my other webcam.  I will be returning it.
5,
3,The camera image is very pixelated and doesn’t stay in focus. That’s why it’s so cheap
3,The video  is not a clear as my cell phone. Does not Auti focus in low light.
3,Camera works great easy to use. Stand fell apart first time wouldn’t hold the regular iPhone in place and then the pivoting let just broke- so completely useless
5,
1,The picture isn't great very washed out and flat but it's acceptable. What was the real deal-killer for me was the audio quality through the built-in microphone. Absolutely unusable. Had to return it.
5,Great quality at a great price!  No other words needed!
5,Camera is easy to use. Easy to set up. The camera works.
3,It easy to install. The picture quality was decent but it's only use right us college zoom classes
5,Liked it so much I bought 2
1,Should have known for the price this was going to be a cheap product it will shut off all the time the wire/power cord moves and you have to hold it just right for the webcam to come on. Don't buy find another product.
5,According to people who have seen my view during conference calls on Teams the picture is really excellent.
3,Had to get a camera for online exams. It does better long range- definitely has the fish bowl look going on. Works well enough for what I needed it for and was cheaper than most.
1,I use this camera for work meetings. Easy to install and use but have been told that I sound terrible on the other end. I know it’s not my voice because the one I use in my other work office sounds great I’ve been told. I will have to buy another!
5,Good quality picture fast response to motion but low quality grip on top of monitor
2,I purchased this for virtual school. The sound never worked but the camera image wasn't too horrible. It lasted 4 months before my students started yelling what's wrong with your camera? It pixelates me then switches on and off randomly. Oh well. I've managed to make due until the end of the year. It will be going in the trash in a few days.
3,Camera easy to use (plug and play worked instantly). However the camera and picture quality looked grainy even in a bright room. And haven't been able to get the microphone to work. It just doesn't pick up and sound.
3,It's OK for the price.  The video quality is OK but the audio quality is quite bad.
2,Camera quality is good. Audio is very poor.
5,I plugged the camera in and it worked just fine. Has a great picture clarity. Great buy for the money.
5,I had one of similar price but died. This one is much better in quality.
5,Should have bought this camera a year ago! Awesome picture quality!
2,Mic sounds muffled and swapped it with a standalone mic that worked fine. Going to return. Picture does look great and was hoping this would work. Possible it's just a dud.
3,I have got a few webcam until now but this is the best one so far ! good quality camera  easy to install... etc. !
5,This thing can take a beating  dropped it on a hard floor about 15 times
5,This little camera works very well with my computer allowing me to enter web conferencing easily and well.Installing it was very simple. Plug and play really.Good value for this unit.
5,I was very wary about this camera because it was so generic. It is great — better than any Logitech I’ve owned. I teach online for a living so video quality is part of my livelihood!
1,Camera didn't work out of box for three different people/computers.  Low cost so will eat the price and throw in trash.
1,This camera is not good if you work from home and need a reliable camera. After 6 weeks it stopped working. also i never used the audio as it sounded muffled. I guess you get what you pay for with this product.
5,No problem to setup and configure. Mic needs to be fairly close as it is a bit weak.
5,Very good quality for the price - use it for our Zoom meetings at work
1,Camera seemed to capture video in frames.  Bad microphone.
5,Sits perfectly on top of my all in one desktop. Good quality and easy to move and adjust. Much better than the camera that comes installed in the computer.
2,I bought this for a student run elementary school news team.  The picture is distorted.  The wide angle makes the host look like she is rounded.  The color is not very accurate even after adjusting the settings.  Also there is no zoom.  That is my fault for not checking but just in case someone else is thinking it has a zoom feature.  It doesn't.  I'm disappointed and another one isn't in the budget any time soon.
5,Great quality image and the microphone also does what I needed it to.
1,has the quality of a 2001 web cam dont believe the 1080p BS...the quality is horrible. Returning immediately.
5,Easy to install just pop on your screen or use the tripod that is included and plug in.  Picture quality is okay and it gets the job done.
5,Good camera for the price.  Plug and play into a Windows 10 laptop with no installation issues no need to load drivers. Good wide angle picture quality.  The little tripod included is a nice touch.
2,The camera is very easy to install but there is no software to adjust the raw color. I had on a dark blue shirt and it showed up purple within the video stream.  There is no supporting software to adjust color balance. What follows is an addition to my review. The seller contacted me and offered either an exchange or a full refund. I opted for a refund and can thus testify that the seller is honest and stands by the products they sell.
5,The camera quality works very well for video conferencing and while the tripod is very small its helpful for moving around the camera easily.
5,Operates as described.  Quality picture.  Use for school proctor program and very efficient.
5,Nothing here to dislike.  It handles Zoom calls with ease and works every time.
1,I was just "upgrading" my old webcam. The picture on this is totally washed out and grainy--it's just horrible. No driver no utility to adjust anything. Just to make sure I took screenshots with backlighting and without neither of which are good enough to use ever and then unplugged it and plugged in my old one and took the two screenshots from that and looked at them all side by side just to make sure I was being fair. Cheap old one fine. This one throwaway item.The product page even as of this writing says 90 day free returns 3 year replacement. But the minimal product manual does even have a company name or contact info. Amazon has the return window set to 30 days and this sat here a while before I plugged it in so I missed it. (Called and Amazon agreed I could return it. I will be glad to have it out of my life.)
5,Works pretty well for the price Picture seems good
3,The picture is great but I don’t have any audio. There was no cable supplied for me to connect to the back of the camera presumably for the audio connection 🤷🏻‍♀️.
5,I liked it so much I bought a second one for another computer
5,Great product. Great price. Easy to use. I don’t really like wide camera range which has a slightly rounded look to image.
3,The quality of picture was not as I expected.
2,Returning this for a refund. Compared to a Logitech 920 not even close. Low light fuzziness overall just not a real HD camera. Also has native "fisheye" lens that can't be disabled in Zoom. I did not test with Skype or other apps i am sure it works fine and works the same. Also compared to built in camera in Macbook Pro and Dell Latitude 7100. Both built-ins were far superior.
2,This no-name webcam with a ridiculously inflated list price has  Facial-enhancement technology in it. So whether  you want it or not it smooths out your face so you look like a cartoon character without any character. I would just feel stupid using this so will return it. It is plug n play to the nth degree. No icon appears no way to know if it is working except to go to a Zoom test meeting...that's when I learned I had gone back in time 40 years.
5,Though the cam quality isn't exceptional  the customer service is. I had a problem with my camera and was refunded immediately. 10/10 service!
3,Does not have good light sensor.  Produces dark image.
5,Very easy to install and good picture quality. Very pleased so far
5,The picture is clear and it is easy to install for my home office use.
5,Works great. Very easy plug in and go. No hassles.
5,This camera has worked perfectly for me for my daily company webex calls FaceTime zoom etc.  I also used it to shoot a musical concert.  Wide angle is good.
5,Great Audio & Video Quality!
2,This camera will do the basics.  It delivers an average quality video.  The microphone has an extremely low level and must be placed close to the speaker to provide clear and audible conversation to video conferencing participants.  Best when coupled with a headset or some other microphone which defeats the purpose of the onboard microphone.  The included stand is nearly useless.  Consider other options...
1,Audio quality once camera is connected is terrible
1,I purchased this webcam and started a new job. I have been skeptical of these off-brand Chinese companies in the past but chose to give the benefit of the doubt as the reviews seemed good enough and real.  As soon as I started the webcam it was made clear that my sound quality was terrible and the camera gave a very "fish eye" effect which was totally distracting.  I was embarrassed by this (thank goodness this didnt take away from my interview)  :(  The tripod thing broke immediately out of the box. Get a logitech camera instead or you will be responsible for one more piece of waste in a landfill
2,The camera washes out really easily if there is any natural lighting. So it isn't great during the day but it's pretty good at picking up detail in darker settings. My main complaint is that it started flickering about a month ago and I can't get it to stop. Also anytime you cover the leans with the provided cover it stops working and turns everything yellow and I have to unplug the camera from the computer and re install it.
5,Decent camera quality. Very easy to setup. Camera cover is a nice addition.
5,It has really saved me from going out to appointments where some of the providers do not always see the patients.
2,I was excited to get my webcam based on the positive reviews it received however ever since I've installed it the picture won't stop flickering.  I've updated the driver however that didn't do anything.  There is no manufacturing contact at all listed in the manual no website no number so there is no one I can call.  If someone has any advice on how to fix that would be great otherwise I'll return this for refund and consider this my hard-learned lesson against buying unknown labels off Amazon...
1,Camera was great the first week or so and then would freeze or act up intermittently.  At a month it just died altogether.  I shut down my computer every night and would say it had light to medium use throughout the week. Was cheap so just replaced with another brand that was a little more expensive.
5,Just worked great on the box. Audio and video are superb.
1,The webcam wouldn’t allow us to choose an option to change the default.  I purchased it for my daughter for her school tests and it does not work.  The school didn’t find out the problem until we were outside of the 30 day return period so I can’t return the camera.  I highly recommend against purchasing this item.
5,Surprisingly very good quality. Video is great and sound. Haven't had issues gHighly recommend for those pesky zoom calls.
1,When I received this I did a test and everything worked fine.  When I had a zoom meeting 3 weeks later the camera wouldn't work.  I tried everything multiple times.  Uninstalling reinstalling yata yata yata and still not working.  Light is green on left but the other button is always red.
5,This is my second WebCam purchased and so far this thing is perfect! Great image and the privacy screen/stand are a must for me!
1,It appears that I got a lemon. Upon connecting the screen is extremely fuzzy. Completely unusable. I took a picture from my phone and uploaded here. See it for yourself. Ended up returning. The package and box looked like someone returned this before. Normally some sort of protective thin adhesives are attached around lens. No such thing at all. I inserted a memo "defective. Do not resell " in the return box but who would listen...
5,Works well with little effort on install. picture quality and mic above average for the price
5,Recently coronavirus outbreaks in the country and my campus starts to do the remote teaching and other stuff which need a camera. This camera is in good design and quality. Plug and use! That's it.
5,Great wide-angle and has a lense cover !!
3,Out of the box this is the color of the picture
5,Perfect for the upgrade to an old laptop - especially now that everything is done via video.
5,I love the quality and the price!
2,While the camera itself works great the microphone sounds like you are talking through a sock.  Mostly just using this for video conferencing.  The microphone is so bad I have to use my old webcam microphone and this camera.  Very disappointing considering how many varieties of webcams are available at this price-range.
3,Didn't work very well on my MacBook Pro
1,This was purchased for my daughter online classes. The picture quality was good enough for the teacher to see my daughter from about 6ft away. Do not attempt to get closer as the quality is distorted the closer you get. The mic when it worked was terrible. I have had this for three days and it worked for only one day and it sounded like you were infront a fan with a mouthful of metal. After that it did not work.The only thing i liked was that it captured the entire room when mounted on my wall mounted screen.  Hence thw one star.
5,2 thumbs up for this product  literally too it out the box plugged it in at tested it ...it is as advertised
2,I bought this because of the great reviews. it came on time and was super easy to setup. however what i need it for the picture quality sucks. it is super blurry and i tried sitting iton the computer holding the camera putting on tripod. it does not focus like it should. i will be returning and just going back to the camera on the computer that takes better pictures than this does.
5,Nothing to dislike about it.  It worked as advertised.
1,Webcam picture quality is very good however when it comes to the microphone it leaves a lot to be desired.  My primary issue that whomever I am talking to will "hear themselves" when they speak.  This occurred on my laptop as well as my home PC.  I've confirmed it's the webcam mic issue and not my equipment .  My old webcam does not behave in this faulty manner when connected to my laptop or desktop. Sadly I waited to long to start using it and have gone past the Amazon return window. I also don't see anywhere on the sellers storefront how to make a claim or request a replacement. Now I'm stuck with a useless gadget. I've seen other reviews where the mic has been a major problem so as they say "BUYER BEWARE".
2,Set the device up on my pc. The power light is on but no projection to the pc. The instructions say the camera should come on but nothing happens so reading the instructions state no new drivers are needed or any other to do actions. Unknown what the problems are.
1,It covers the bare minimum. If you are buying to get a better camera than what you already have this will probably be worse. Focus is off and can’t focus closer to the lens.
5,I use it for my daily meetings and camera works great
5,Small picture at only 2 MP but sufficient for conferencing and web calls.
2,The first camera arrived and worked great and was what I was looking for.  About 2 weeks later the camera began to flicker on and off.  Tried it on a few computers and on different software to eliminate other causes.  I then returned the camera and got a replacement.  Hooked up replacement and color is way off (see pictures the stripes are green and gold).  Will be trying a different brand.
2,I had this webcam for about 4 months now and last week it started to glitch while I’m using it and then today it just stopped working. The picture quality is fine I don’t have any issues with picture quality or the camera quality but the fact that it is stopped working in 4 months that is very bad
5,I like the setup of the camera. It was actually just plug and play and we were able to zoom and Skype right away.
1,I bought one for my work at home set up. The sound was very poor. Nobody could hear me so I bought another and had the same issue.  Both were returned and I purchased a different web cam that works.
1,Like others said sounds underwater - sometimes works sometimes doesn't.  The picture is washed out and grainy.  I bought it to replace the one on laptop but its just as bad.  Like too much light.  Returning.
5,None
2,All the logitech cameras have the possibility of making background closer of further away (zoom). This is controlled by the logitech software.This camera just shows you one large space behind you and to your side it has no zoom control.Therefore it is useless.
1,The picture quality is too bad. Also it does not have any zoom option. In the video calls the picture looks very blurred.
5,Just plug it in it sets itself up.  Excellent picture quality.
1,It was easy to install just plug it in. I should have known it was no good when the adhesive meant to hold the lens cover in place fell right off the second I stuck it in place. The first time I used the camera everything went smoothly and it served it's purpose. The second time the microphone wouldn't work no matter what I did. After an embarrassing hour of trying to get the thing to work for a meeting I had to pull out the old junk microphone I had and use that. So if you only need to use it one time then yes this is a good Webcam to get. If you plan on using it more than once and want people to hear you though I'd keep shopping.
1,Don't buy. Buy something from a known brand.
5,Me gusta la estabilidad de imagen
5,Extremely satisfied and simple set-up. Great audio and video.
1,picture quality is ok not the best. but just to join zoom meetings I do not care that much. the problem is the microphone. it's not working properly. My daughter said her classmates all saying her voice sounded weird then I tested the microphone of this camera it indeed was HORRIBLE. it turns your voice into a low fi robot.Also the tripod coming with it one leg fell off. I never used it and never planned to use it. still super low quality tripod. anyone trying to use it be aware.Bought another brand instead only 10 bucks more than this one 100 times better both quality wise and sound wise.
3,picture quality was low
1,The video is grainy and the camera stopped working after a few months
1,Horrible camera not sure why people are giving it good ratings. The resolution is so bad I will have to buy another.
5,With everyone working from home I needed a camera.  This came with a small tripod East to install and great picture quality
5,I use it with MS Teams and it is AOK.
5,Plug and play no work involved in setup.
1,Ordered one of these and it seemed great but the microphone didn't work.  Tried on a couple of different computers.  So exchanged assuming it was defective.  Got the second one.  Microphone still doesn't work on the second one. Tried Amazon Customer Support.  Their only solution was to give me a refund.  Guess I'll go looking for a different one.  Not going to try a third...
5,Plug and go. Easy to install and use this camera. Would recommend to everyone wanting a camera. Works well with Zoom.
5,Good quality for price
1,This camera did not work on Windows or Linux for use with Zoom and 2 other apps. It shows up as being attached but never shows any video or even a black screen. Nothing.
1,Does not have privacy shutter. I'll be trying it out tonight and up date this. UPDATE: This webcam requires more light than I can afford. I have an overhead light on and a lamp and the picture is still dark. My 2013 IMac has a better camera.  (See photos. Right is the webcam left is my Mac) This was taken midday in a brightly lit room. I bought this due to the great reviews but I did not receive I believe  what I ordered. For one thing  no privacy shutter and the camera picture is dark and looks like a fish eye lens is in use. This is not a good product.
3,Ok
5,Easy install works great for meetings classes etc.
3,Camera quality is good for price. However audio sounds like underwater or very far away... was on top of my monitor.
5,Great product for such a small price. Thank you.
5,Adjustment for clarity of picture are easy to make.
2,Camera quality is fine but don't expect to use this for a microphone. Sound is garbled and unintelligible and straight up unusable.
5,It is easy to set up and the picture is very clear.
5,This camera works better than expected. Good price.
5,Good quality webcam. Use it for streaming on twitch.
2,The product doesn't come with or have any operational software so determining the status of the camera as it operates is perplexing. It comes on and off and that's it.
5,Calidad de la camara
5,Plug and play.
5,Got it to Skype my Math Tutoring Clients...excellent quality
1,The Camera worked fine the first day I got it. Then after about a month the camera quality worsens until the camera is just flickering red blue green and white
1,I bought one of these cameras as a test to see if it could compare favorably with my Logitech. I was initially impressed both with the video as well as the audio. So I bought 2 more of them. Every one of them (all 3) have now stopped working. One of them has completely died (the light comes on but the video and audio no longer work) and the other two have continuous audio issues. Sometimes the audio works but it often cuts out for no reason. These are not reliable webcams. Unfortunately the first one I bought is beyond the return window but I am sending the other two back and have bought Logitech cameras to replace them.
5,It was easy to install and the picture quality is great.
1,Terrible
5,Fast ship does not have zoom feature
1,This was a complete waste of money. None of my computers even recognize that I have something plugged in.  I tried to find software online and can't even find a website for this company.  I trusted 6000+ reviews; but the item I received is absolutely worthless.
5,Clear picture easy to setup
5,It is a excellent webcam.
5,Easy affordable and the quality is great.
2,camera is ok didn't even come with cover to hide camera lens when not in use. Another made in china product. hope it lasts.. I would have spent a lil more money to buy a better quality product.
5,Desktop computer
2,This product works fine and plugs right into your PC but the mic has horrible quality the image contrast is very dark compared to my standard laptop camera and it is fisheye - distorting the room behind you. This is a cheap camera.
5,easy to use and great price
5,Very Easy to install and video quality is GREAT
5,i like it
3,poor quality video
2,Since I got this webcam it has only worked about 40%-50% of the time. It's really frustrating when I need to use it but it doesn't work.
5,Great quality.Good picture. Clips on top of monitor.
2,The ease of connection was the main reason for selecting this product. Wrong  Windows 10 connection is impossible to date.Until I can find a solution for solving the mic problem it will be rated poor.
5,Easy to set up and use.
2,At first site I was impressed with the quality of the live image.  But still a still frame (picture) reveals super low resolution that cannot render legible text regardless of the lighting or proximity.  I tried  to display my drivers license and is was impossible to read any text at all.
1,Using Windows 8.1 this camera sometimes turns off showing an error in the Device Manager. Re-plugging it into a different USB socket helps occasionally but not every time.Other than that mic is way too quiet even when boosted to a max.EDIT:Okay that's it I'm really angry now. After waking up from hibernate camera got lost again and I can't get it to work. Literally every other camera I had over the years was better.EDIT 2:Camera just dies after using as a camera (not as a mic) for a few minutes.
5,Computer
5,Works good for the money!
5,Good product
5,Great camera and easy to install
5,Met all my expectations!
5,Great Quality
5,Really great
2,Always had issues then broke completely.
5,Easy to use decent quality for the price
5,Connected right up to my older computer.  Happy Holiday
2,The camera angle is super wide showing almost an entire room almost panoramic like the picture was alright but the coloring was a little off grips well to the monitor and the built in mic isn't bad
1,Images appear blurry. The webcam installed on the PC works better than this. Did not test anything aside from image quality as this was a dealbreaker. Will be returning for something better.
2,overall quality is acceptable. picture is acceptable but unstable. it goes in and out of service on its own. getting it back on was difficult once it goes off. acceptable for show video conference. but not for live streaming.
5,Great product
2,While it’s simple to use and plug and go the camera doesn’t attach securely to the top of my laptop screen.  Any movement of the laptop causes it to move and fall.  It doesn’t actually clip onto anything.  It just rests on top.  Really frustrating.
5,Good camera for cheap!!!
1,THIS CAMERA IS JUNK!!!!! SPEND MORE MONEY AND GET BRAND NAME. THE CAMERA HAS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE VIDEO QUALITY ALMOST NO AUDIO CAPABILITIES AND NO ISO (LIGHT IS HORRIBLY RECEIVED BY THE SENSOR).
5,it seems ok
1,I have a DELL laptop. Sometimes it recognizes the camera and sometimes it doesn't. Very unreliable. Returning. Also the microphone sound quality had some background/feedback loop issue I had to switch to my internal laptop microphone.
5,EZ Install with windows 10. Nice tripod  accessory. Good price..
2,I accidentally reviewed the wrong product! I purchased it as part of a black friday sale and after using it 5-6 times gave up. This one is horrible at night even in decent evening lighting and each time I used it the microphone would stop working unless I rebooted my computer.
5,Great quality video and audio
5,We like the excellent picture quality and ease of installation.
2,Decent image. Easy to install. But the audio is terrible. People told me I sounded like I was under water. I have a 10yr old Logitech webcam that has better sound. Returned it for a refund.
5,great buy
1,Terrible mic quality. wish i had bought a more expensive one.
5,Not shabby.
2,While the camera does have good resolution and wide angle view is easy to install the image flickers and there is a constant wave that travels up the screen especially in poor light. I have not been able to find another cause that would explain this issue other than this webcam itself. If I use my mac's HD webcam the image issues disappear.
5,Wide and clear view! Easy to install just plug in the USB!
5,Yes
5,There were no drives to install just plug and play.
1,I bought this webcam for a proctored exam. Was not able to take the exam as the quality on the webcam was not able to get a clear picture of my identification. Long story short I was not able to take the exam due to the quality of this webcam.
1,If you want a webcam that works when it wants to and you enjoy endless frustration as your camera freezes over and over and will not correct itself despite having excellent internet services in your home then this is the web camera for you!
5,Great camera
2,You get what you pay for and for 10 more dollars you can get a webcam 3 times as good. Its very very dark even with brigh light in the backround and I dont think it is 1080p. Looks like 420.....and the mic isnt a good mic for mic spamming. Its just a bad mic
3,Read the headline the C920 is superior.
1,Doesn’t work well. Used one day and decided to return it. The camera on laptop is better if you can believe it. Disappointed.
5,Its pretty good I have no complaints
2,It helps but i wouldn’t recommend because the audio cuts out even with headphones. Only sometimes
5,Great Product ...:-)
1,Mic worked fine and consistently but the camera would hardly ever turn.  Downloaded the drivers to run the camera and that did not help.  When it would finally turn on it would only work for a minute or two
5,It is so good and the mic works great too.
2,The image performs poorly in less than very bright situations.  I've posted two pictures one with the built-in camera on my iMac and the second with the USB camera.  I will be returning the camera it is unusable for me.
5,Clear quality
5,Works perfectly as described. Fast delivery.
3,Not 1080 maybe 480
2,Good video; poor audio!
5,Exactly what I need
5,Quality is great.  The privacy shutter is a plus.
5,This was one of my best purchases. Easy to install and quality audio and microphone.
3,it was okay... really bad quality
5,I appreciated fast delivery easy set and good quality image.
5,Great product for the price and exactly as expected
3,Webcam for Online school broken within 6 weeks.
1,The camera is fine the microphone is horrible no one can understand. The built in mic on my computer works 100 times better. Don't buy this product. I want a refund!
1,Great little camera for a very affordable price. My desktop computer/monitor came with its own built-in webcam but the video quality was always inferior. I don't understand why an expensive all-in-one can't quite get the webcam feature clear and responsive. Anyway adding this $16-$25 webcam works great & even comes with its own tripod. (I bought 2 of the same camera within a week & the price had gone up.)UPDATE (4/13/2021): I'm now three weeks past the return window and this little thing has just stopped working. VERY disappointing! Definitely changing my rating!
2,I read some wrote the same issue im having with this webcam.  After a couple of uses the camera now flickers. I use it with obs studio for live streaming and it looks terrible when it starts to flicker. The colors of this camera are off. I would look for something better before buying this.
1,Don’t waste your money. Pay a little more a get a well known camera brand.
1,I know it says this device is compatible with chrome book but it’s not. I can’t say whether the picture quality camera quality or auto focus are any good because it doesn’t work with my computer. This is false advertising and I’m sick of it. These companies are on my last nerve with saying they work with chrome book because nothing does! I plan to get a new computer fairly soon and I will update this when I know whether or not it works with other brands. Right now though I am not happy.
5,La facilidad de la instalación y la calidad de la imagen
5,Easy to setup
5,Works very well and good picture.
5,This really is plug and go great picture and sound.
1,The microphone on this camera after only a month of use has developed a scratchy output.  On several recent Zoom Calls the person listening to me could not understand me as the out was so scratchy.  This is very disappointing as the video camera output is excellent.  The return window for this product closed for me just ten days ago.
2,Maybe I got a faulty one but everything in my background and myself included has a very pink/red hue and undertone to it. That didn't happen the first few times I used it and now I'm outside of my return window. Waste of money.
5,Very easy to install and shows clear pictures.
2,The camera did a nice job when I purchased it. The camera quality was "ok" but it worked. However after 8 months of use the camera completely died. So yeah it's pretty frustrating but I guess you get what you pay for.
2,I am quite dissatisfied with the product. It changed the shape of my background to appear "rounded".The picture quality is so so. The one good thing I can say is that there was no picture delay in regard to sound and picture corresponding
1,The camera worked well for the first month but then stopped entirely. Won't register on any computer. Spend a little more money to get a camera that will last because this camera sure won't.
5,So much better than built in camera.
5,GOOD
5,Easy to install and works right away. Just for personal use.
2,My company uses Microsoft Teams and the microphone on my camera does not work. My PC can see the mic and make it my default mic but the mic does not pick up my voice. The camera works fine but it does not work as a cohesive system.
5,Excelente producto con relación precios y calidad
1,This camera is really hard to use. The wires are messed up on it so if you have to move the camera at all it will disconnect. I bought it for taking exams for online school and I had to buy a new one due to this one constantly disconnecting
1,Bought it about a month ago to replace one that would no longer focus. I checked the video and all was fine and the microphone had output. First use was today and my voice was too garbled to understand. Who would have expected a garbled microphone?With a loopback I could hear all the distortion. Replaced this with a cheaper spare and all was fine.
5,Just as advertised! Picture is so much better than on my Dell laptop
5,Used for my meetings and church service.
2,Video has quality but the microphone is very bad. People cannot understand what is being said and report the audio very low. I wouldn't recommend this camera if you plan on using it for communication.
1,We use these reviews to decide on purchases.  However  the review questions do not ask about the mix sound quality.  So now that my return window has expired  I'm not able to return this thing.  Forcing me to buy a microphone to work with camera. The picture is great  but they need not even put the mic on it since it doesn't work.
1,I was excited to purchase another webcam when I found out that you can now hook up a camera to the Amazon Fire TV cube for video calls or drop in.  I ordered this one and also the converter to mini usb and hoped for the best.  I have an overhead light in my den and it is not dark.  My chair is about 6 or 7 feet away from the camera.  The picture is dark and grainy.  I guess I will be purchasing another Logitech.
1,This was an experiment. I was curious to seeif a $25 Chinese webcam could work.Answer: NO!The sound quality is terrible: this is a useless device.It sounds like I'm talking from inside a barrel.At the bottom of the ocean.I've unplugged it and plan to pony up the moneyto buy a Logitech 920...which actually works.
5,Easy to install
2,it turned on and it’s easy to plug in but it froze 5 seconds after i turned it on but i tried using my friend it worked on my computer so some work and some are defective
1,When it works it works well. Picture quality is good it fits well on my thin-bezel monitor and doesn't hang down into the screen. I like the flip to cover the lens when not in use. However it seems to overheat easily or something. It will often work for about 5 minutes and then stop working. Zoom will report that it can't connect to the camera anymore. I don't have any problems with my old webcam - just this one. It's really annoying since it works so well when it works. It's just not reliable.
2,Even in adequate lighting at 1080p picture is very blurry and noisy.No zoom control. Wide-angle is good but there needs to be an easy way to crop.Camera physical design and construction are good. Included tripod is nice. Privacy shield works fine.
2,We bought for my granddaughters online virtual learning school but the microphone doesn't work!!
5,muy útil y se ve bien.
1,I'm using the latest version of Arch Linux (5.11.1-arch1-1) and it doesn't work out of the box. I searched for a compatible driver but could not find one. This manufacturer claims to support Linux 10.04+ which makes sense for Ubuntu but there is no Linux kernel version 10.04 so I think they just confused Ubuntu with Linux. Ubuntu is a subset of Linux! Regardless I couldn't get it working so I chatted with Amazon support and they recommended this one instead: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07P84DN2K/ref=ewc_pr_img_1?smid=A2EY0NNW0UXU7H&psc=1. I have yet to try it out.
5,The camera is so good and nice good to try and worth to buy it again!
5,It was packed well. Arrived on time. Easy to setup and worked as promised.
5,it is easy to use
1,In order for me to get the camera to work so people could see me I had to turn the lights off. Called customer support and there was not a fix other than this. I sent it back for a different camera and all is good.
5,A great camera. Great quality.
1,Made the mistake of not testing this camera until after the return-window had closed. The audio doesn't work! It's muffled and basically unusable. Garbage product!
2,I've had computer technicians and others try to adjust my computer settings so that the camera mic would work but it does not. Never has. Hours of trying to no avail. Not recommended.
2,While product does not work with Apple OS Big Sur it does work with High Sierra. If you have Big Sur DO NOT BUY this webcam.
1,I could get over the terrible picture quality if this camera reliably worked. However the picture cuts in and out across multiple video platforms (zoom team webex) and constantly freezes. I returned immediately
5,Easy peasy
5,super
5,Works great picture quality is awesome. Best webcam I have used.
1,Tried to take my exam for a college course but the test proctor refused to proceed with testing due to low quality of the video . The video appeared black and white and super grainy. Looked like a low quality of cctv . Why can’t you put 0 stars
1,OMG. I either got scammed or this is VERY defective.  Yes it is simply plug and play and cry.  The worst camera ever. My reverse camera on my car after a day in the mud is better.  It seems to focus okay there is no focus adjustment. The color is horrible my skin tone looks green like Frankenstein. The picture is SO DARK I have two strong lights blinding me and the picture is still very unacceptable.  Please try a different brand that's what I get for being cheap.
2,The camera itself is great but mine didn’t come with a tripod that I need for school and for proctored exams.
2,The actual camera is ok but we have been using a lil over 3 months and the microphone doesn’t work and I it continuously falls off the laptop and falls off constantly.
2,The camera is a faulty product. As your environment gets darker or as you turn on lights your image turns pink. My coworker and I got the same camera and have the same issue.
5,God how can it be so clear
2,This was a great camera (high video quality easy to install maneuverable) but it stopped working after only 6 months.
1,This camera started out working well - bought it for online school. 3 months in the video stopped working on Zoom. It works for a few minutes then cuts out and I go back and forth a few times turning the video back on and then it just switches over the my laptop webcam. I got this because I can't use my laptop webcam with my setup. I would NOT recommend buying this!
1,The picture quality is good but I didn't know the sound quality until one day I was using it for online meeting. I should have check it out the sound when I first connect instead of just seeing a good picture then assume the sound is good which is not. The other party cannot hear what I am saying from my end. Now I need to get a new one.
1,Seemed like a very nice video camera at a great price that even included a cool little tripod stand.  Picture quality was great.  But in 2.5 months it stopped working.  Today when it stopped working I tested it in a couple different computers to verify it was actually the camera and it was.  Very disappointed as it only lasted two and half months.  Don't waste your time or money on this camera.
1,Worst camera quality I have ever seen. No way to adjust settings or quality. Picture is dark grainy and switches between pink green or a somewhat clear picture.
1,In a normal brightly lit office this webcam was so dark and grainy it looked like the lights were off.  For comparison I had a second USB webcam and the webcam built into my laptop both of which looked great.  I wanted an additional webcam for a different angle. Unfortunately this webcam was dark grainy and most annoyingly had a greenish picture.  Don’t waste your time with this webcam. I received it less than three hours ago. I’m on my way to drop it off for return now. Only reason I kept it this long was to eat lunch.
2,Even with spot lighting on image is too dark.
1,I bought 2 of these cameras and both of them have stopped working.  One will not even come on and the other the microphone sounds horrible.
2,The webcam is okay in a brightly lit room.  Otherwise if it's dim or average light the picture is almost black.
1,Old webcam stopped working ordered this one to replace.  Picture was great easy to install.  Whenever using the webcam it will randomly freeze the image.  This happened through multiple different software programs (skype teams zoom and roll20)  Did some basic trouble shooting checked drivers uninstalled/reinstalled restarted PC.  Nothing seemed to fix the issue.Plugged in a different webcam and have had no issues.  Something with this webcam or it's software is broken.  Unable to return due to taking so long to troubleshoot.  I would recommend getting a namebrand webcam.
2,Easy setup because it's very generic. This camera performs well in challenging lighting situations but it suffers from a very pronounced fisheye effect. I want to love this camera but I can't because of the distorted picture.
5,It works well
2,You get what you pay for.. Using it on a new mac pro have to unplug it and plug it back in a few times a day. Otherwise i guess its fine.
2,I bought the camera today. It works fine with my windows laptop. However microphone doesn't work at all on my Ubuntu desktop. I spent an hour trying all tricks but in vain. I wouldn't recommend this product if you are a Linux user
1,Speaker doesn't work after 30 days
5,truly plug and play
5,very  good  product
1,Poor quality quit working in the middle of a work meeting.
1,Not happy with the camera. A few months after using camera it began having an intermittent problem with shutting off. Tried it on three different computers. Same problem. Now it's past return date and 2 months past warranty (6 months apparently). If you dont mindnthrowing away 35 dollars every six months the quality of the picture was ok
1,Set up instructions are as simple as "plug in and use"... tried that didn't work and broke my system settings for my microphone.
1,The camera has widely variable quality;  zooms in and out and image is not stable.  Also it will not remain on top of the laptop so you must carry the tripod around.  I  have it taped to my laptop but it is too heavy for that purpose.It will not work with SKYPE either.I am teaching via ZOOM and will now have to buy a reliable product.
1,Very unhappy with purchase.  Camera instantly overheated and would not turn on after initial plugging in.  Returning to buy a better option.
1,Audio does not work. Tried on two different laptops. Same result so it is the camera. Bummer. Will be returning. Maybe I got a dud maybe they're all like that. Don't know. Do know that this one is a dud!Resolution is not very good. Little better than an older built in ASUS laptop cam but no better than an older built in HP cam. Expected better because built in cameras are typically terrible!
1,my computer does not recognize device on windows 10 usb malfunctioning
2,No software means no white balance. The contrast on the image isn't good. Everything looks washed out.
2,This is a cheap camera but it works ok once you get past the fussy behavior.
5,it look nice
2,I bought it because the Mac camera is poor for Zoom purposes nevertheless it does not work .. had to disconnect it because the red light is permanently on
2,Ive tried the camera with my teams meetings for work but the quality is poor.
5,Great for working from home.
5,Amazing quality
5,I love it ver good quality
1,I didn’t work at all and some of the pieces were missing
5,Great camera for the money.
4,I purchased this camera for my pc to do college stuff and it works nicely. One thing I will say though is that with its built-in microphone if you use headphones for audio you will need to go put headphones as preferred audio in your computer's settings or it will be through the camera.
5,Works well
1,I bought this product for the microphone so I can participate in Webex meetings. My PC is Windows 10 and I could not get the microphone to work with Webex. When I got it to finally work I was told that it made me sound like I was in a tunnel or underwater.
1,It's mediocre at best. Audio is terrible.
2,Used the camera 3 times and it died. I don't recommend.
1,I was happy with the quality until it stopped working- all together no light on at all (my computer is new the wire inside the camera seems loose now. Disappointed but maybe price point expectations ?
2,Sound quality is awful. Sounds like you are underwater. Also the tripod is awkward for it.
2,This was super easy to install but the camera is ridiculously bad. Everything has a pink tint to it and faces are so white it's almost blurry.
1,Took a chance on this based on other reviews and number of purchases. Unfortunately had to return due to truly terrible sound quality. The picture quality was good but the sound was awful. Other reviewers have described it as sounding like the person talking is underwater and that’s pretty accurate. Tons of echo very bass-heavy and muffled.
2,order something else. Picture Freezes and has to be unplugged to get it to work again.
1,I bought the camera on September 27th today is October 30th. It stopped working today and keeps dropping the video during my meetings 3 days outside the return window. If you want to have something work for 1 month then this is the camera for you. On November 8th it went from working intermittently to not working at all. Computer does nothing when I plug it in and lights don't come on. Buy something else!
1,This camera worked great until it just died mid zoom.  It didn't even last a year.
1,Picutre is great it was easy to install. After recording a few videos the sound is garbled after every recording. Don't know if it works until I after my recording which has cost me a lot of time on videos I put together that I cannot use.
2,Video Quality is marginal snd the audio capability in the mic is terrible.
2,The camera quality is ok but the picture/hue is very pink toned. Can't seem to do anything to change that and its awful.
2,Lamentablemente el micrófono no tiene buen sonido
1,Works great at first but randomly stops working during calls.  Sometimes it only takes 2min sometimes it lasts an entire 30 min call.  Completely unpredictable.  Unplugging and replugging fixes it but you can end up doing this several times during a call.Don't buy and get a better different camera if using for work calls.
1,This cámara's mic worked as if it did not have one the worst is web cam and mic stoped working 2 weeks after purchase. It was not even recognized by PC. Worst thing you will ever by from Amozon Stay away!
1,Purchased two cameras. One worked great and one had intermittent issues where the camera could not be found and red power light goes off. Issue was the cord connection at the camera. Wiggling the cord at the camera "fixes" the issue until it happens again. I will replace the camera because who knows when the wiggle will not fix the camera.
1,Broke after six months
2,Worked really well for four months! Stopped working suddenly between two back to back meetings. :(
1,Bought this due to overwhelming good reviews what a disappointment. Out of the box the microphone doesn't work at all even though the recording LED is lit. The picture quality is really bad more like a 720p camera than 1080p. The colors are too dark and everything is blurry you can't tell the different areas of a sweater apart as it's just a blob.
2,Yea not sure if mine got messed up or if its the camera but it just flickers and isnt clear no matter what I do
1,I purchased this camera at the end of September.  Plug and play.  Really nice.  1080p as advertised.  Really nice.Died exactly 21 days later.I understand wanting to save money but just bite the bullet and purchase a quality webcam.  If you purchase this one you'll end up spending more because you'll have to buy a quality webcam 3 weeks later.
2,I bought this partially for taking tests which requires hold up your ID for the proctor. The camera doesn’t focus at all. They can’t see my ID with this camera.
2,If you have any background light forget it
1,i can not work it
1,This mic is terrible. it echoes and is unusable.
2,The camera is ok but has a noticeable fish eye effect  the microphone does not work well at all and I use my tablet's resident microphone instead.
1,the camera works fine but the sound drops out or doesn't come on at all. the warranty was only good for 30 days so of course it took 50 days for it to die.Any suggestions of what to do with a useless webcam?  good thing it was only 25 bucks.
1,Bought five of these webcams. The video quality was fairly good but the microphone quality was horrible. Every single one produced playback that was hardly heard and muffled. We decided to use our own microphones but within six weeks three of the five web cameras were no longer working. I don't recommend this product whatsoever.
2,Audio does NOT work with our Dell desktop.
1,It seemed like it worked ok at first although I think the audio was always a little suspect. Within weeks the microphone stopped working consistently--I'd have to unplug it and plug it back in and even when it reactivated people complained that the audio was distorted and hard to hear. Returning and buying a name brand.
1,It keep stop working either the microphone or the camera. We use this for my son’s online school and every time it malfunction it stop him working on school stuff cause we have to fix it and find a solution like logging on a diff computer
2,Fish eye lens is disruptive and unflattering
1,I bought this camera three months ago on Amazon. Image quality is decent and easy to install.However it recently started to fail with frequent blinking. I can't find a way to claim the warranty. I am going to have to buy a new camera to replace it.
2,The automatic brightness level was very poor.
1,Extremely disappointed. The camera freezes 5 seconds into using it while in Microsoft Teams meetings. I've updated system firmware ran file checkers reinstalled Teams. I have to unplug the camera and plug it back in just for it to work for another 5 seconds then freeze me like a screenshot during my meetings.
1,Color on this webcam is awful compared to other ones I've had in the past. It has a heavy pink/red tone to it so it doesn't look natural. Tried using it in several different situations with different lighting & they all looked bad. Pay a little more & get a better quality camera.
1,The first time I used this it hooked up easily.  Just plug and play and select USB for video.  However during my 1/2 hour Zoom meeting it dropped video 6 times and I had to click the video button to reconnect.  It's being returned!
1,I returned it because it did not work.  I ended up purchasing a different brand from Best Buy.
1,-Damaged item the webcam I purchased was defective and would not connect to three different computers.-There is no company logo or name advertised on the box or the manual.-The box just says "webcam" and the S/N number or the model number do not pull up anything on a google search.-IMO better off going with a different brand
2,Camera is ok but the mic has poor audio quality and cuts in and out.
1,Doesn’t come with a manual and doesn’t turn on when plugged into my laptop. Needless to say it was a waist of money because it doesn’t tell you how to install it and hook it up to my dell laptop
1,Worked great in the beginning.  Now it's dead
2,The camera has a huge red tint when used under low light
2,The image was not sharp and there was a sine wave rolling through the image. Tried on 2 different computers same result.
2,I wouldn’t buy this if I wouldn’t get reimbursed.
2,Annoying ringing tone when the camera is on.  Sent a message to company but never received a response.
1,The color is horrible.  Washed out too much. No real color to the picture on the screen. Iput the lense shutter cap on and the camera no longer would come on.Sadly I don't even use the thing.
1,Camera is fine but the MIC sucks!  Can't use it for anything
2,Ok video but very poor audio.Microphone does not pick up sounds very well.
1,The audio quality on this webcam is horrible. Audio is very distorted and is full of noise and intermittent breaks. Video quality is worse than the built in (720p) webcam on my laptop.
1,10 days after the 30 day return period the camera started to malfunction.  It was always when I had to adjust the camera direction.  It would loos connection and I had to fumble with it to regain connection.  Money wasted for me.
1,Terrible product. Microphone doesn’t work and there’s no user support. I’ve tried all methods to resolve this issue. I bought it for the intended purpose to take assessments with online proctors and the camera can’t even focus on my identification card to verify me. If you’re looking for value get something else because this product was terrible.
2,Broke in 2 months
2,Plug and play?Not with Mac OS CatalinaI tried every trick and port and nothing happened 😔So disappointed
1,Bought this for proctored exams in my online classes and you cannot see clearly and read information I am to hold up
1,NOT RECOMMENDED. Don't buy a piece of crap. Mine died yesterday. It may be cheap buy that's in quality too. Find another AND buy the $5-7 warranty offered.
1,A fortnight after using it just started showing black and red screen and no picture
1,Picture quality was very good but the sound is barely intelligible so it's basically useless to me. Got it as a spare since the price seemed good for the features good thing I have another (different) one.
1,The microphone is awful and picks up no sound even at close range.  No stars out of 10.
1,The camera quality is decent for use by kids doing virtual learning. However due to the loud buzzing noise that is emitted from the microphone it is pretty much useless. Would not recommend buying and would look at another brand.
1,This camera can’t focus near distance subjects picture was very blurry.  Also the build quality is not good. Surface is rough. Returned.
2,The flicker will not stop despite driver re-installation camera settings in Zoom and Teams etc. Returning this product.
1,The camera is great. Love the privacy cover! However the mic when on top of the screen and only about 18-24" from the user sounds like someone wearing a mask 6 feet away from the microphone. I had to buy a mic to also use on video calls.
1,This camera is easy to set up & that is about it. The camera doesn’t auto focus or anything. I needed a good camera for proctored exams & unfortunately there isn’t an option to return it.
1,Isn't it supposed to be plug n play? Is there an app to download for it to work? Is it incompatible with the Android powered HKI RBox?
1,I have a 6 year old Walmart webcam I paid $15 for it has better quality than this. 1080p doesn't always equal good image and this is a great example of that.
1,Broken after one use
1,Terrible picture quality audio is muffled all around a bad camera that I plan on returning. Don’t let the top rated comments fool you save your money and DO NOT get this
2,Low quality sound and low light video.
1,0/0
1,Camera does not work with Windows 10.  Windows 10 refuses to recognize the camera at all with a continuous warning that  the USB device is not recognized etc.
1,Takes over 30 minutes to warm up otherwise it's just static lines and lots of pink circles all over the screen. Very dissatisfied
1,The picture was not clear and my colleagues could not hear me through the camera microphone.
1,I suppose I'll just have to dedicate the time to call support.
1,The video quality is passable in good lighting anything other than that is crap snd the microphones are total garbage.
1,Wide angle fish bowl effect
1,Worked great for about a month. Then all of a sudden the video quality went grainy. The video quality is so horrible now it's not usable.
1,Bought one and worked great. Good quality and easy to install. So I bought a second one and doesn’t work. I tried on two different computers both which the other camera works on.Shame as I was hoping more consistent quality.
1,Worked well for the first week then camera went in and out during remote teaching and microphone went out completely. Waste of money if you are using on a regular basis.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Like how does this even happen without it just being an issue with the camera
1,Received the webcam today. Tried connecting to two different computers.  Neither would recognize the device even connected.  My old webcam works plug and play perfectly on both of the same computers.  Minimal instructions provided and lousy troubleshooting tips.
1,I have to replay it every time because if I don’t it sounds like a robot
1,Terrible audio.  Can not understand anyone.  Super muffled and muddy.  Can not use.  Going to look at better options.
1,Did not work at all  tried three different computers just in case  nothing.  waste of time and money.  then i didnt get the full refund to add to all the frustration
1,The image quality on this camera was poor. No matter how bright a room was the image on the screen was too dark and grainy.
1,Headline covers most of what I have to say. The device was quick and easy to install and had decent quality for the price point but broke almost immediately after purchase.
1,It's a great product when it works... it stopped working after a few months. Warranty is pretty much impossible to deal with don't get this.
1,save your cash get another bran it s cheap but works
1,The camera didn't come on at all
1,the sound is so bad that it's unusable
1,I purchased this camera to hold video conferences.  The quality of the picture is terrible: my Surface Pro  has a better camera than this.  Not worth the money. I will return it immediately.
1,Did not work with my computer had to return
1,Microphone hardly picks up voice and voice sound is scratchy and weak
1,Bad soldering job on the USB plug. Broke after only 2 months of gentle use.
1,Picture wasn't bad but the sound was inaudible. Ended up sending it back.
1,Never buy this messy product. It is useless
1,after three months this cam doesn't work.  It's been stationary/mounted the same place.  Windows Device Connected/Device Disconnected sounds every 15 seconds.  Tried multiple devices and same results.
1,It never worked
1,Bought to use for MS Teams meetings; camera kept flashing whenever in use within the app. Microphone was very poor co-workers could not hear me without holding the webcam up to my face.
1,IT DOESNT WORK THE AUDIO IS ABSOLUTE GARBAGE.
1,Mic quality is awful nobody can hear me using this. No point in buying this webcam
1,Sending it back. Only used once and it was alien sounding voice
1,Don’t buy... you get about 4fps. Super choppy video feed. You get what you pay for!
1,Unlike the description and the pictures the camera did not work on my Xbox. Couldn’t even use it waste of time and money.
1,Bad picture quality and stand was broken on arrival.
1,Participants in my webcam session described my audio via this webcam as low choppy and robotic.
1,Was not able to return as it broke after the return window. Not sure why this camera was Amazon choice. Garbage.
5,Great picture auto focus. Fights with my laptop's built-in camera but that's a Dell issue.
1,The microphone on this webcam has never worked. It's useless to me without the microphone.
1,did not last long.
1,Camera shows very dark in all lighting conditions . Returned for refund.
1,Would not connect to my Xbox like it said in description
1,lost of time it was disconnected not stable and occurs by chance
1,The video doesn't work. And I'm told the audio sounds like I'm underwater.
1,i have no idea how this has 4 stars
1,The worst picture quality I have ever seen. It's completely dark can't see a thing
1,worthless trash. didn't work.
1,The camera works okay however is webcam does NOT have a privacy shutter.
1,Mic stopped working 3 weeks in. Also cable is really sensitive and i was concerned abt it from day 1.
1,Poor quality
5,Quality is very clean!
1,The microphone is not working. I have buy additional microphone
1,Defective item. Does not work on MacBook Air or TV
1,The microphone is unusable.
1,Quality totally missed on this webcam.  The picture was pink but The mic was pretty good.
1,Product stopped working within 6 months.
1,Horrible picture quality
1,Not a really good camera. Bad video quality and sound. Look elsewhere.
1,Microphone does no work!!!
1,Easy to install video works great but the mic was completely broken.
1,Very cheap and low quality.  I feel duped.
1,MIC DOESNT WORK
1,Connected easily but was not able to view anything.
1,Stopped working after two Zoom meetings.
1,Stopped working after a week.
5,A bit tricky to balance on a laptop but it will do the job. The tripod is a great addition.
4,The picture/video quality is good but the mic sound quality is not so great compared to others we use.
5,I was planing to buy a much more expensive camera - The young man (much younger than me) who works in my office said that this model is much better for far less money! He said the range of the camera lens is much wider the picture quality is much better and it was about 1/4 the cost!
5,Works as it should. Bought on sale making it cheaper than many worse options. Would not hesitate to buy again if i had to at the regular price. the tripod is super useful and I use it most of the time and also when moving the stream to the workbench i can wrap the legs around whatever is nearby to hold the camera as needed.
5,The camera and mic set up is outstanding. Glad I purchased it.
3,The video is good on this but the microphone sounds muffled.
1,This camera worked for one meeting. Now the camera turns on and off randomly the mic does the same thing. Constant freezing. Go with something else. This is not worth the money.
1,Mic has a big lag. Video quality is poor. Not worth it.
3,Perfect easy to assemble
1,Sometimes it randomly will work in Windows 10 other times the PC doesn't even recognize it as being plugged in. It doesn't have an auto focus but the silver O ring around the lens spins and that is how you focus it. If you can even get it to work that is...
5,I bought this webcam for work. I use a docked laptop and monitor so I couldn't easily use the laptop camera. I plugged it in and it worked instantly. The video and audio quality are good and there are many different ways to stand the camera up. The cam image is widescreen. No complaints so far.
1,Saw other reviews saying how good this was but they must have reviewed something else.  The picture quality is actually quite bad but more importantly the camera kept freezing during meetings despite having a fully patched and up to date system.  I even tried this in another laptop and same issue.  Using my old camera and the MIL's and there were no issues with either of them.
3,The price was great for what you're getting and it sets up very easily. However the auto-focus doesn't seem to work. I needed this for online exam proctoring and the camera refuses to focus on documents and IDs. Furthermore when maneuvering the device to show my room and exam area the camera disconnected multiple times while never physically unplugging from the computer.
2,The camera quality is pretty great but I get constantly notified that I can't be heard or understood by my cowworkers.
2,started failing slowly until it stopped working completely. It sat on the top of my monitor never moved once.
2,It's a decent camera but the wire has an issue where it freezes and turns off. It wasn't like that when I first bought it but about 8 months in it started and it's gotten worse since then.
3,I'm sad because I loved this webcam and the setup however I had to return because the microphone is terrible. Every time I went on zoom or FaceTime on my computer I was told I sounded like a robot. I know it's the mic because it worked fine when I connected with my AirPods.
5,I'm always cautious with "no-name" brands such as this but I figured that for the price it was worth the risk. I got it because it says it works with Linux so I took a risk. Turned out great. Here's my set up: I need to attend periodic Zoom meetings and I was concerned by reports of poor security using Zoom. I couldn't get it to work properly via a web browser (where I was going to run it in a Firefox container) and I didn't want to install the software on a computer where I do sensitive work such as banking. So I dug an old 11" Macbook Air out and installed Linux MInt on it (Ubuntu Linux with the Mint GUI). Next I signed up for Proton VPN and installed that and finally I downloaded Firejail a LInux sandboxing application. The last think to install was Zoom from their website. I admit that doing all that takes some degree of computer knowledge and working with command line script instructions with which I'm quasi-capable so it took some trial and error but I finally got it to work. The final set up was to write a shell script set up to launch Zoom in the sandbox. The Macbook Air has a webcam but it wouldn't work with Linux and fixing that was apparently possible but the instructions were daunting and would require a lot of faith that what you are doing is safe which I wasn't prepared to do. So that's when I bought this webcam. Lo a behold I plugged it in and it immediately worked. In fact whenever I use it I get comments from Zoom participants about the quality the picture. I've used it maybe 8-10 times so I can't comment about the durability which other reviewers complained about.
4,I finally bought an external monitor which meant the webcam on my laptop would catch me in profile as I worked. And the quality wasn't great either so I bought this webcam for my monitor. It was very easy to install the picture is very good and it feels like a solid little webcam. I've even used it on multiple devices without any issue.My only quibble is minor; you have to sort of balance it on top of the monitor. I would have preferred something a bit more sturdy like a clamp. But it's never fallen off so not too terrible. Good product.
4,This worked perfectly fine out of the box. I use this for work when connecting on Skype MS Teams Zoom and Google Hangouts. I did not have any issues using the desktop ap vs. web version of the apps (I'm on Windows 10 OS). The picture quality is okay-- good enough for work. The audio quality is not the best apparently the audio sounds hollow or muffled to other participants in meetings but again for the price of this cam it's good enough. I would say be careful when you put the camera cover on. Once it sticks you can't get it off! I put mine on slightly crooked and now can't fix it but it still works.
5,For the price this little web cam camera has exceeded my expectations! The camera has decent picture quality set up is a breeze came with a tripod stand and has a flip cover to block the camera lens. The microphone works well but can have a slight echo sound at times. Overall for the price this webcam camera is an excellent buy! I highly recommend this product!
4,i gave the product as a gift to my brother.  He is pleased with it so far.
3,Does the 672 webcam model come with user instructions? Nothing to tell me how to use the features or move around from one to another.
3,PIcture is OK.  Lens very sensitive to light.  Tends to look washed out.  Computer screen needs to be dark.Better with Very Low Light.
3,EVERYTIME i WANT TO USE IT HAVE TO UNPLUG IT AND PLUG IT BACK IN ALL THE TIME
4,Good value. Low res.
1,The colors on video come out looking purple
4,ok device good value. vaue
2,I purchased two of these.  I teach virtually and got so many compliments on how great I looked on the zoom from co workers than I purchased a 2nd one and shipped it to one of my co workers to use as well promising her that the HD quality is amazing and that she will love it.  Unfortunately she was unable to get hers to work.  She tried several things to no avail. As stated we are teaching virtually so got totally side tracked and didn't discuss until weeks later when we finally saw each other in a faculty meeting.  I noticed she was still using her old camera. That's when she told me it was a dud... and just did not come on at all... but by that time The window had closed to return it.  Disappointing bc I definitely love mine.  Hate that she received a faulty one and that I'm out $26!!
2,Lines going down the screen constantly
5,Doesn’t rotate/twist around vertical axis.
5,Works great and give excellent pictures.
5,I bought this camera to work from home and it works great! It was the perfect buy as its not bulky and does wonders for my work life.
5,Works well.  Computer recognized it.  Picture quality is ok for the cost of the unit.
5,Definitely a great webcam for the pandemic era. Sharpe picture quality with high resolution. The mic may not work very well but I don’t use it anyway so not bothering me. Bottom line I would recommend
5,I had to get a new webcam for meetings. The price on this was good so I gave it a try. I'm surprised at how good the quality is for such a cheap price. It's a good buy.
2,It’s good for looking at it but when I got it I tested it and the audio was horrible you can’t even hear me there’s this really loud buzzing noise it’s garbage
2,The camera was a gem until it gave out after 8 months. Very disappointed. I guess you get what you pay for.
2,Not sure if I keep getting bad cameras but it keeps disconnecting saying there's an issue. Ordered a replacement and the new had the same issue. Suck because when it was working the camera picture was perfect
5,I bought this after originally purchasing a more expensive camera with more reviews and ratings. This one worked straight out of the box on my desktop. Very good picture quality and sound.
5,I am a teacher teaching on zoom - this is a high-quality image and wide-angle. I've gotten compliments from other teachers - and I got a great deal!!
2,The microphone randomly stops working. As a result I am going to need to buy a new web cam. It’s been a problem practically since day one.
1,My work bought this webcam for me to better transition to work from home and it is a menace. If you can get it working? Totally fine. But getting there is impossible. It crashes Skype Zoom and every other video-using application as my computer cannot figure out how to communicate with the device. And because it has no support or driver functionality there is nothing to update or run to try and improve it. Now it sits precariously on my monitor entirely useless because it won't run with any program.
5,This camera is really nice for the price you pay for! Would recommend for streamers on a budget not for long term streaming goals though.
2,This feels extremely cheap. Seems like something bough on a Chinese wholesale website and flipped for a much higher price (way more than it’s worth trust me).
2,I liked this camera. but it stopped working after a few months
2,Used it 5 different times then the auto focus quit working. It’s still working although for my purpose the Auto focus is a great deal.
5,very good camera  I'm kind worry because the low price but  works great  mic too great merchandise .
5,I like the camera good quality and works well. I give it a thumbs up 😁👍
1,Installation was easy on both a Windows and Mac computer; however the camera quality was too dark to keep it for Mac use. When I connected the camera on my Windows computer the image was brighter on the Windows computer but I bought this to use for my son's Zoom calls on the Mac. I tested using Photo Booth and Face Time and even with several lights turned on it looked like we were the movie theater.
2,No software to adjust picture
1,Worked great for a few months. Now the camera is glitching and will not stay connected to my computer. Turns off every 20 seconds.  Too late to return or exchange. I hope the company reads this to do something. Waste of money.
5,Excellent product and high quality.
1,Terrible used it twice and second time it just powered off and stopped working....you shouldn't sell things like this without testing...im writing to the better business bureau!!! It stop in the middle of a conference call!!!
1,Camera didn’t work light turned on tried everything I could camera still wouldn’t work.... I tried many different things and many different devices
1,Nice picture. But microphone stopped working in less than 3 weeks. The settings in Windows 10 are correct. So that's not the issue. Tried removing device and reinstalling. That didn't work either.
1,Did not work
1,Beware I bought this camera from the same seller with the brand name hrayzan first camera was good then bought this Xpcam quality was not so good I returned it to buy another Hrayzan since my first one was great second Hrayzan cam was even worse than the Xp cam.
2,So I bought this webcam as a second one for streaming. The quality of this one is soooo bad I'm going to have to go and purchase a super bright desk light to even make it useable and I already have a shop light pointed at me plus natural light from a window and the light from my monitor. This would work fine for zoom conferences or things where you don't Really need to see your face or the art your working on. The privacy flap is like a sticker with a hinging lid so I feel like it's going to fall off and the stand seems a little delicate.
2,I needed a good camera for Zoom meetings from home and the office.  This one was reasonably priced and had good reviews.  However it turned out to be a dud.  It installs easily and comes with a little tripod.  But the video is too dark and grainy and even the HDMI mode does not really improve things.  The brightness can be adjusted but it only made the image look washed out. This camera might be okay if you really don't care how you look on the monitor. I have a professional job so I am a bit concerned about appearances.  Interestingly I have an old Logitech c260 that has a better image than this camera which doesn't really make much sense. Anyhow I requested a refund. Would not recommend this product.
1,This camera arrived quick and setup was very easy. BUT video and picture quality was poor. Even worse the camera keeps disconnecting and turns off on its own and also crashes Zoom so bad that I have to restart my computer. If you are planning to use this camera for Zoom or work related meetings DO NOT BUY
5,I really like the way I can attach it to my monitor. It opens up my whole office. I not sure why everything is in reverse when I am doing a web meeting but that doesn't bother me. I just don't know how the camera projects what it is showing but it works so much better than my old cam and that is all that matters.
5,Once I got the camera installed and was video chat with friend they were dude that Camera is Clear and the voice is like you are right next to me. After that I was so impressed I ordered another for my other devices.Easy hook up (install the privacy cover 1st before installing camera) and self adjusts to your device.
5,This camera has a clear image. It is also equipped with a small tripod you can easily adjust the angle and direction of the camera. Black feels very high-end and it looks very nice with my computer monitor and keyboard. It is a good choice to use this camera for work meetings or remote classes. After the purchase the goods arrived soon and Amazon is indeed awesome.
4,I got this for about $17.  I like it expect that you need to have a lamp on for someone to see you as it doesn't seem to be designed for dark rooms.  That's the only reason I gave it four stars.It came with a little tripod but I put it over the top edge of my monitor where is it sits securely.Do I recommend?  Yes.Would I but it again?  Yes.
5,Bought this camera to do Zoom meetings with my doctor and the grandkids.Easy to set up easy to use! 10 minutes from box to first use! Picture quality is good though it doesn't remarkably perform well in low-light. Sound quality is good. Great product for the price!
5,The picture quality is excellent except the over saturated magenta color which gives the camera horrible color accuracy. But compared to other cameras on the market and for the price its worth the hassle. A firmware update could probably  solve the magenta over saturation but the camera quality is so good that for the price its tolerable. Super easy to install: plug and play.
5,Pleasantly surprised by this $25 webcam. Ordered for meetings while working at home and as someone who has a little experience creating and producing videos this was definitely worth the money. And I have actually started using this with to video call friends and family for situations where my iPhone isn’t ideal.
5,No hay nada que configurar por el precio me parece una buena inversión. Tiende a acoplarse el sonido del parlante con el micro incorporado en la cámara cuando usas un parlante externo
5,This camera is perfect for zoom.  I'm able to move it around and set it on my monitor.  It's a better angle than my laptop camera.  It solves problem of where to look when using 2 monitors.
2,Product looks nice and connected rather quickly. Picture is very grainy looking.  If you would need something in a pinch this would do the job if you are looking for something for professional use I do not recommend due to the poor picture quality.
5,The item was smaller than I expected it to be and I was afraid it wouldn't work very well. Thankfully I got to try it within a few hours of my order arriving as I am currently seeing clients via a remote platform and my tablet view is just terrible. It was as simple as attaching the camera to my monitor and plugging in the usb. It took me a few minutes to figure out how to attach the camera to the computer but other than that no additional configuration was needed. The client was able to see and hear me without any problem.
4,This camera works fine and is a good deal for the price. The quality is high enough that I don't have the need for a green screen with my old computer. I don't care for the way it mounts because it doesn't feel secure.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Hlod camera a little dark but that might be because I gave no lighting in this room.
5,Bought it for my wife's computer.  Took 10 minutes to install and operate.  Loved it so much bought one for me!
5,I stream everyday using this camera. It is amazing quality for the price. The only downside is you cannot color adjust the camera and have to change the color of your lighting to account for the color you want your video to be
5,This is a wonderful HD camera with a somewhat wide lens.  Easy to install and provides an excellent picture.
5,An inexpensive and fully functional webcam. I plugged it in and windows recognized it instantly. It can sit right on top of the monitor or you can use the included tripod. I fired up Skype ran the testing and it worked like a charm.  Video and audio were particularly good.
5,I love the easy install and use. I was just what I needed!
5,Excellent value for money. The picture and video quality is better than any high-spec laptop with a built-in camera. The main function，Plug and play-no need to install any software just plug it in and start using it.Mounting bracket-can fit any thickness monitor and can be easily adjusted.Tripod stand-If you want to put it on a table please include a cool tripod stand.
3,This is pretty much what I expected for a $25 webcam.  The image isn't very clear but it was easy to set up and the mini tripod is convenient to have.
5,A
1,Don't bother
5,easy to install good picture quality
5,Easy to use high quality webcam.Easy to install and set up usb is useful. Easy to show playing in flows.
4,It’s a good high quality camera that needs a lot of light. It doesn’t do too well and low lighting situations it really needs bright light that works just fine
2,Set up was simple and it was easy enough to use - however the camera had a fish eye effect and it was not flattering or appropriate for business meetings.
5,Camera & picture quality is great. Easy to install too.
4,Didn't hold as well to the top of the laptop as previous camera but picture quality good.  No problem with setup at all.
5,Great Webcam with microphone and beautiful HD pictures.It is powerful and easy to use. Great work on Google meet.
5,Works as a temporary camera worth the prices
5,Surprised by excellent quality for such a cheap camera.  It looks like the cameras that I used to buy for 60-70  dollars!
5,Great buy buy here.
5,Came very quickly.  Love how easy it sets up and the quality
5,It is very very good.  It is very easy to install and use.I like it so much.
5,we needed a camera to conduct Zoom calls for out office due to COVID and this is a great little camera and works vert well for our needs.
5,Everything good and affordable price compare to other similar items in the market. I couldn’t find camera cover cap though.
5,It doesn't focus or change focus . But it's great for the price I.paid
5,Nice!
5,easy to install good pic under low light very compact
2,Very dark colors and too much distortion at the edges.
5,Fantastic product. Easy to use right out of the package.
5,works well
4,Easy to setup. Good quality
5,Looks great.
5,Very good.
5,Camera quality is great.Mic is clear.
5,Pretty good for what I need it and use it.. haven’t had any sound or image issues so far.. easy to install just plug in and go!
5,easy to use
5,This webcam is perfect for non-professional use! The only consistent complaint is that it doesn't grip well on your flatscreen monitor. Remedies I've seen are adding padding or even wrapping the cord behind the hinge. Try this hack: Put on the included tripod and bend the legs towards the back of the monitor. And I didn't think I'd use the tripod at all! 😏
5,Nice for the price!
5,I am very pleased with the camera itself - the picture quality and ease if installation and use.  It is great to have the privacy cover too.  The people I meet with on Zoom did not like how my voice sounded with the mic though and much preferred my laptop's built-in mic.
5,At this price point I did not expect much.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the picture. I now have three of these in regular use with no problems.
4,The directions didn't cover how to install the lens cover.  I missed the the tab to pull of the adhesive protective film the fist couple times I looked at it.  Then when I started to use my own adhesive I noticed the pull tab to allow the adhesive to stick to the camera body.  When I pulled the tab off the adhesive came with the protective film  instead of staying on the lens cover.  I had to pull it off the film and put it back on the lens cover.Othewise good quality.
5,Was perfect grip for my monitor comes with a small tripod too. Definitely worth my money.
5,Love the simplicity love the lens cap love the autfocus.  Teammates tell me the picture comes across clearer than the folks using laptop cameras on our Webex and MS Teams meetings.
5,This webcam works well with my setup which is primarily zoom on both Mac and PC.  Picture quality is good and crisp.  Love that it has a privacy filter and status light.  The only thing is the mic pick up is a bit low.  Other than that satisfied with everything else.
5,With all the online meetings we’re having these days hearing how bad my video was getting  old…. This fixed the problem for sure.  Installed with no problems. I was up and running in no time.  Would buy it again.
5,This webcam's flexibility to be used in a number of ways allows me to use it at home and work.  And with virtual everything these days very handy to have around.
1,I purchased this specifically for my online exam the agent was not able to read any of the text written on my ID card and I ended up using my laptop camera for my exam. The camera was too blurry. So I don't recommend for any online exam the camera quality is not good enough.
5,Camera was very easy to use. Simple plug and play! The camera is practical clear  and of good quality. For the price I would recommend it.  I like the tripod as well.
1,It's not the greatest and it's not the worst.
5,I bought this camera for my YouTube streaming program. I was amazed when I connected this camera with how clear my image was. I paid $199 for a Logitech camera that is not even half as good as this camera. I have unplugged my logitech and use this on my main computer.
5,Works good! I was very surprised at the quality considering the price. It's well-made and comes with a stand (optional as it clips to the monitor too) and a lens cover.
5,Her work computer didn't have a camera and she needed one to attend meetings and classes.
5,Quick easy setup great price!
5,As described
5,Works perfect for me. The picture is clean the quality is great not a fan of the built in microphone but other than that its perfect.
5,Does exactly what’s it’s supposed to do. Installed easily and worked perfectly
5,I use this camera at home for remote meetings and it works quite well. A great value for the money !!
3,Comparing with my Logitech C920 I find the wide angle good for applications where you need a broad close audience view. Unfortunately the analog microphone is noticeably less clear and requires speakers to be closer to the camera than C920. This didn't work in my classroom application and the seller graciously agreed to refund my purchase upon returning.
5,Simple to use and operate.  Although there were no instructions for computer use it simply plugs in and starts.  Great camera for the price I wasn’t looking for anything more than some simple zoom meetings from my home office.
5,Great value for money
5,Great Quality Quick Delivery would buy again if and as necessary.
4,The camera is easy to set up and much better than my (2014) laptop. BUT the mic is worse than the laptop. So I use the laptop mic and the new camera for meetings.
3,I'm just going to get to the point. If you're using this for a zoom call it'll get the job done. Microphone quality is so-so you get what you pay for. I recommend getting a dedicated mic if you plan to do the whole long distance relationship thingie a lot. But the picture quality leaves much to be desired. I needed to show my photo ID to my exam proctor and it just couldn't render my photo ID's text clearly enough.Oh well. My family member just happened to be in need of a webcam so it became a nice gift. Off to Walmart to shop for an alternative.
1,Returned. Photo quality was poor.
5,Purchased one for me and one for my SO at the start of the pandemic. Both are still working great. I use mine at work and the quality is great. The wide angle is great and i love how it has a cover. Only small pet peeve is its light so I sometimes knock it but my 3 monitor stand wouldnt be able to take a heavy one so it works better for me.I have not used the built in microphone so i cant speak to it.
1,One star
5,For Logan Crawford interview
1,The sound is terrible the others on other end can't understand what is being said.
5,Great little camera for the cost.  Decent auto focus and picture quality and sound pickup.  Effortless plug and play.  The little detachable  tripod is a very useful bonus!
4,Update 6/21... Company contacted me after reading my review and offered me an immediate replacement or refund.  Having already purchased another camera I opted for the refund which was received in less than 24 hours.  EXCELENT customer service!Inexpensive camera that does well for  video  Wide angle lens so you can sit 3 feet from your monitor and not look like you are in a closeup.  Would be 5 stars but audio is not so great.  After several video conferences people told me I sounded muffled and distant.  Again only at 3 feet. have to wear a headset or earpiece/mic .
5,Easy to set up and easy to tilt or turn. This is a nice uhb detachable web cam
5,Plug and Play works great with my mac.
5,Works like a charm great picture for personal or business applications!
5,Crystal clear video microphone works great for dictation! Delivered quicker than anticipated too!!
4,A good buy.
5,Fast shipping installed as it should ni fuss no muss works great  very pleased with this item
5,Very pleased how easy it was to get installed and immediately up and running. Wide angle made it easy for hubby and me to chat with our granddaughter at the same time
5,Happy with purchase.  Easy to set up and the picture quality is great
5,Easy to install. Easy to use.
5,I finally tested the Webcam on a Zoom call. It worked well. In fact the people who were meeting with me said that the video and sound was clear. I am running Microsoft Windows 11 and the driver installed automatically. The one tricky part is that what appears to be the power button on the right stays red leaving you to believe the camera is not powered on. But as long as what appears to be a wifi button on the left turns green your video will work.
5,this camera is good and can record at 1080p very well!
5,Product was great until it stopped working for no reason. It sits in the office with no movement and just stopped. Don’t recommend it if you plan to use for longer term.
5,I rarely use the webcam and it's ideal for me. I was pleasantly surprised by its image clarity and clear microphone.
4,Best value I was able to find
5,Nice inexpensive web camera with built-in microphone.  We use it for Zoom meetings and it works great.
5,Webcam works great. The picture is very clear and easy to see. No issues at all.
4,It adjusts well to lower light and the picture is very clear.  This works great with Zoom.
5,This is a great camera for a low price. Excellent picture quality and easy to use.
1,Poor picture quality ..... came in fast
5,10/10 great for pc vids pics and calls
5,Simple set just follow the included instructions.
4,The video is fine and the audio is just adequate.  In several Zoom sessions people asked me to speak up or get really close to the camera.  One of the computers I used it with the audio was garbled to the other participants but I'm guessing it was something odd in that computer.My only real complaint is the mounting - the piece that rotates and is supposed to clamp the unit onto the monitor (or whatever) is just not tight enough.  It barely holds the camera at all.For the price it's not a bad deal.
5,I like this product. Yes I would buy this again if needed
5,Good quality
5,I am well pleased with my camera
1,I got the item and hooked it up to my desktop. Everything went fine. I could see myself and talk. I used it for a work meeting and left it. Cam back the next day to stream and it didn't work. I have to basically put the wire at a weird angle and not move it to get it to work for the stream. As soon as i ended the stream and touched it it went back to not working
5,I really like this little camera.  It has a solid picture and video quality.  Easy to install for those of us who are not tech savvy.  Plug and go. No drivers to install no drama.  Easy peasy.  I use it for work meetings and general video calls with friends.  I have cooked on camera with friends lead conferences on Zoom all with no issue.
5,But this for my sisters zoom classes and it works great. good quality easy to set up.
5,The camera quality is ok
5,It's a good camera but does have a bit of a fish-eye effect. It's pretty solid though.
5,Positioned perfectly on my monitor!
5,This was an addition to the camera set up at work a little better camera than the others and works very well for the intended use.
1,The microphone is inaudible if you're more than a 6-8 inches away from it. Literally unusable for meetings and sounds muffled. My laptop microphone when the laptop lid is closed picks up significantly more audio. This shouldn't be sold as a product since it is useless for it's intended purposes.
5,This works exactly as I hoped it would and it quite versatile moreso than I expected. I did not realize it also came with its own little tripod and that has worked out just as well as mounting the camera to the top of my laptop screen. All in all I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend it.
4,Webcam is easy to install
5,This is a good cheap webcam. I used it once for an interview because my computers webcam is garbage. Now it sits there unplugged on my work desk mocking me. It was plug and play and worked well.
4,Muy liviana !
5,With our current climate of Virtual meetings I needed to upgrade my office computer for visual participation. This camera was very easy and quick to install and worked almost instantly. It also has a mic on the device. That came in handy as well.
5,I am just learning the capabilities of my iPhone. This tool make my pics and videos easier to take.
4,Audio Visual is not the best but for the price is definitely a good product.
5,This camera exceeded all my expectations for the money I spent on it. Best tech purchase I made in a while.
5,Perfect quality decent mic and pretty good tripod
5,Great video camera that is immediately accessed on PC. Has a lens cover. Long USB cord for ease to move. Clips on pc or use the included flexible tripod.
5,Llego en buen estado menfimunciona bien y me llego rápido.Me gusta mucho.
5,Bought to teach online nationally and it works wonderfully even with 100 students in the meeting they can all see and hear me just fine.  Better than the camera that came in the laptop.
5,Arrived on time and works well for the price
4,Really love it. Affordable great picture quality for the price point built in mic there's a lot here that I really can't complain about. The only thing really holding it back is the clamp. It doesn't really secure itself well to my monitor. I like the low profile of it/doesn't have much of a bezel getting in the way of the screen but it doesn't really latch on closely behind the monitor so it does shake/wiggle quite a bit.Solid camera just a poor stand.
3,I have two of these. The first one is great. Great camera and great microphone. This one no one can hear me on the mic camera. Still good but had to use a separate Mic on this PC.
5,Works well for the price.
5,Good buy.
4,This camera has nice picture quality with Zoom but not with OBS which was what I wanted to use it with. The playback quality with OBS was very slow and distorted despite having a really fast internet connection.
5,Thanks to CoVID my kids go to school online. I bought this because the laptop my daughter had been using didn't have a camera. We got rid of that one and decided to use an older laptop that we thought was broken. To our surprise it worked and the internal webcam did as well. However we decided to keep this webcam because the picture quality was so good. She's 11 and figured out to how to set it up on her own so I'd say it's easy to install lol
4,nice little unit good mic and decent quality comes with an awesome tri pod that im re purposing into something cooler
1,The camera image was better than I expected but my audio (my voice as received by the people on the call) sounds echo-y and like a robot. Returning this product to buy a Logitech.
4,Works fine as regular webcam. Had to proof my identity via webcame and it was not able to get the ID sharp. Has to use laptop camera.
5,Works well
5,This little camera is a game changer! I needed an affordable web cam for my public speaking class and this was my life saver! The picture is so clear it's easy to use you just plug it into the usb port and go!
5,Sharp focus. Image a little narrower that laptops on zoom screen.
5,Works very good and has great quality.
5,This is an excellent cameera for the price. I am so impressed with the qaulity of the video. Very happy with this purchase.
5,self configures. No hazzles. Very easy to use. Excellent quality of camera and mike.
1,Video is great. Audio is terrible. Microphone quit within 45 days. Unfortunately outside of the return time.DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK!
5,No problems with install Works flawless
5,There may be some cameras that have a higher definition or that may be a function of Zoom/broadband bandwidth but even if it did not seem Ultra 4K the clarity was very good especially for something this inexpensive.  If you need low cost camera that is easy to install/setup/use this fits the bill.  It even comes with a little fliptop lense that you can use to cover the camer to be certain of no spying without resorting to adding masking tape over the lense.
5,Pros. great value and video quality the audio works great too and its easy to install...plug and play. Note the angle can be very wide or too wide for you. it displays my entire half of the room.Cons: Sometimes I have to pull the usb cord and re-insert it to get the image back...But all around this was a great purchase!!!
5,Buena calidad
5,There are so many webcam suppliers with poor quality control that it is difficult to make a decision on which webcam to purchase.  The reviews on this appeared to be more consistent in quality.  I ordered four to get the quantity discount.  This webcam worked right out of the box.  Plugged it into a USB port aand connected to a Zoom meeting.  The video was good and the audio worked without intervention.  I am very pleased with the video and audio quality as well as the ease of installation.
1,Not worth getting
5,Not sure how long it’ll last you can never tell but for now solid! Gets the job done and a surprisingly wide angle.
2,Wasn't what I was looking for and didn't perform very well hard keeping it Focused.
5,Good price good quality camera
5,Is very good for the price video is smooth is wide angle and takes videos and photos in HD the tripod is nice with the camera cover wonderfully made and sturdy doesn't feel cheap.
5,super easy to install good picture.
5,Awesome!  Works great
5,Product came when it said it would and works perfectly!! Plug and play. 1080p resolution Tripod works great too. Perfect for streaming and recording videos.
5,very useful and cheap
1,Could not focus on objects.  Kept blacking out or losing connection completely.  Not worth the money or frustration.  Junk.
2,I bought this for use in my college classes as well as for streaming. This  camera is so unreliable!! It keeps turning off randomly. It seems to only stay on for a maximum of 5 minutes which is very inconvenient and frustrating for streaming. I've unplugged replugged restarted the computer with it in the port and restarted the computer with it not in the port. Nothin has worked. Not to mention where is the company information?  Who am I supposed to call to help troubleshoot? When  it does turn on the picture quality is great. It only has a fisheye effect on the edges of the picture which doesn't encompass my face. I can't care less about the fisheye....I just want it to work for my 3 hour lectures and streams.
4,picture great only problem the mic dont work
5,This camera I am very satisfied installation is very simple I put it connected to my computer the effect is very good the reality is very clear worth recommending!
5,Love it works great and great price
5,Works very well to meet my current needs of getting together with Family during a celebatorial time-My birthday!!Reasonable and user friendly
5,I am very surprised by this product it looks very beautiful people look comfortable its image is very clear much better than my previous and very easy to install!
5,webcam is a great low cost webcam. It's very simple to setup was instantly recognised on my computer and with a couple of clicks I was up and ready to join my colleagues in my zoom conference with video. The picture quality is rather good and considering the price of the camera represents good value for money. It secures onto the monitor no problem and using the support at the back you can easily adjust the pitch and tilt to get the best viewing angle.
2,I wish I didn't have to do this but...I thought this camera would be an upgrade. Turns out I was downgrading. And it's worse than I expected. The picture is grainy and of awful quality. The microphone seems like it doesn't wanna pick up my voice. And when I switched back to the native camera to see if the computer was the problem the difference in quality was startling. Turns out the native camera I was trying to upgrade on wasn't so bad after all. This was a bad purchase man. "No bueno" as my friend who was sitting close by said by way of feedback.
5,Easy to install physical flap is nice to ensure privacy doesn’t fall off monitor when it shakes (I move my desk a lot)
