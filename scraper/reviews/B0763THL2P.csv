4,Manual says you can use the remote from up to 25 feet away. I bought this unit to put on a high shelf with the intent of controlling it via the remote. But the remote won't control volume - you need to turn the volume knob on the unit itself. So can't put it where I intended. Image using your TV control but having to go to the TV to set the volume. Pretty stupid design. Otherwise nice form factor and good sound from an inexpensive unit.
4,I use this radio in my shop. It's on 24/7. So far it's working great.
4,I bought this system because I needed a new CD player as my old stereo system quit playing them. This is basically a good system and  easy to use. It doesn't have the deep rich stereo sound that I thought maybe it would have but it is a decent system for what I needed it for. I would like to know how to reset/delete some of the preset channels though. I mistakenly preset staticky channels and didn't see that in the directions.
4,It is small and compact I use it for personal use in my home and it sounds wonderful.
5,We got this for my dad garage and he loves it. It works great is plenty loud. The only complaint is that the clock does not display all the time. You have to push a button.
4,didn’t like the fact that you can’t control the volume with the remote otherwise the unit was better than expected
5,This is a great little radio. Great sound and great features. Picks up stations that my old radio could not
4,Perfect size for shelf placement.  Easy to mo e around. Easy to use.
5,This system is practical and efficient; It will never reproduce Carl Orff at concert volume.  But I like listen quietly to the complex compositions of Bach Frank Zappa. and Jacob Collier and on this system I can hear every detail with full and clear sound.
3,I really like nearly everything. The size and looks of the unit is just what I had hoped for  and it looks great in our Florida room. I was disappointed in the low volume in the blue tooth mode. Turned up fully as far as it will go it is only about half of what it is in the other modes like radio or cd. That is my only beef with this unit. Is that a deal breaker? No. I would buy it again and I am thrilled with the unit.
5,Great sound it's fun!Love the color the sound Doesn't take up too much space and sounds great!
1,Look I knew that this would be cheap.  I wanted a simple pair of speakers I could listen to while in my room at a moderate volume.  I considered the CD player an added bonus and a worthwhile upgrade over just bluetooth speakers.Its terrible.The blue screen stays on all the time due to this primarily being an alarm clock based on the space the alarm functions take up on the control panel and remote.  That wouldn't be the worst except the screen is unreadable from almost every angle.  Looking head on?  Nothing.  Slightly from the side? Nothing.  I can only see the display at very steep angles and then it's just a glimmer.  I've literally never seen an LCD display with such unreadable characters and bizarre viewing angles. I mean it I am looking at it right now and its as if its just an illuminated blue rectangle.The remote is the so light and flimsy its a slightly textured sticker instead of buttons.  By the way the remote can't even control the volume!  It could serve some function of changing the modes but with the unreadable display good luck telling which mode you are on as you cycle through them.The bluetooth worked... once.  I have since been unable to get any sound from it again.  (I work in technology have had many bluetooth devices.  I really don't suspect this is user error.)The sound quality is abysmal.  I had low expectations but compared to a $40 bluetooth speaker the bass is non-existent.  Not like "I want booming bass" but more like "Damn shouldn't this song have a baseline?  At all?"  It sounds almost as if that was EQed away to accommodate and underpowered amplifier.  It sounds worse than any budget car speaker system.  It sounds worse than the speakers built into a cheap tv.  It sounds worse than high end laptop speakers.I really regret throwing out the packaging as they looked fine at first glance.  I struggle to think of a use-case for these.  The lack of working bluetooth means they sit silently on my shelf.  I am going to just throw them away entirely.  I would feel guilty about that but its Magnavox that is making this crap not me.
3,Liked the size and sounds amazing. My only concern was that the CD player didn't last long and that's what I wanted it for.
5,I wanted something for my kitchen.  I was changing my kitchen accessories to pink and this came up on my feed!  It works well is very lightweight and has many nice features (including Bluetooth) and was perfect for my kitchen!!  For me this was a good purchase!
4,Me gusta su diseño es bastante bueno por relación precio calidad. El sonido no tan fuerte.
5,I couldn’t afford an expensive CD player with a radio. It is small easy to use and sounds great. Very happy with my purchase!
3,This is more for a child's room than anything else. My husband was looking for a stereo system like the ones they used to sell for the living rooms alas he found this one we know have it in our guest room.
3,Can't adjust sound quality
3,No Volume Control On Remote....Wow Would Have Been Nice To Know In Advanced .
3,This is a very small cheaply made plastic unit. It did play but the souks qualiry was poor and had no Bass to the sound. Extremely light unit. Not worth the money.
3,The CD player doesn't work
3,Received the Magnavox MM435 Compact Shelf System on May 5th.  It is compact it will almost fit on my windowsill (I live in a house with larger window sills).  It does come with a remote however the remote only controls the DVD player (1 disc). I don’t use Blue Tooth so that is a wasted feature for me.  Due to the size of the unit all the buttons are very small so I had to dig out my reading glasses to set it up.  It does not have a sleep timer for the radio.  The sound is very good and this house does not get very good reception however I had no trouble tuning in my favorite station.  There is no way to program several stations at one time so if you need to change the station you need to turn the dial.  For me not a big deal.  The volume range is nice.  I can turn it up enough to hear it throughout the house (1200 sf) and low enough to just have it in one room.  I didn’t notice a headphone jack so if you are using it in an office with other people you may encounter some issue.  Over all this fit the bill I was looking for as far as a small radio for one room.  For the price it is a pretty good deal.
3,Sounds so cheap.
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I gave a lower score on this audio system not because of the sound quality but because the backlight on the display does not work or the dimmer switch that controls the backlight doesn't work. It is impossible to see what function you have selected. I decided not to return because of the hassle.
3,Not what I expected for a clock/radio even with a CD player. There is no snooze or delay shut off. The wires to the speaker are just for show less than 3 foot long each you cannot place them on opposite nightstands for your bedroom. The features on the remote are worthless there is no ON OFF Volume control Source option for AM/FM/CD. The only thing the remote will do is Play (as long as radio is already on and set to CD) skip or rewind and pause. This is hardly functional for operating unit from bed. Sound is okay but I prefer a fuller sound. I would not recommend this.
4,Main complaints. The power button it difficult to find since it matches all the other buttons. We have it elevated about 6 ft off the ground so I colored the power button black to find it easier. The remote has very limited functions which does not include a power button or volume control. But does come with a battery.All that aside for as small as it is and as cost affective it is great. I love the size the BT connects nicely the white is crisp has a battery backup if you lose power (these batteries are not included). The display is easy to read with adjustable back lighting. We are very happy with it. Even more so considering the price point and it's features.
2,Was disappointed that after one month the power button stopped working and can’t turn it on to use anymore.
2,The button for changing the channel sticks also it is clumsy to get to different stations (time consuming).
4,Sound quality is excellent also pulls in stations very well with internal and wire antenna.  Lacks tone and balance controls.  Also lacks presets. Wires for speaker are very short - like only 3 feet long.  Tuning knob is very touchy too touchy in my opinion.  Power button is oddly placed and although there is a power indicator LED it is nowhere close to the power on/off bottom - very odd indeed.  Remote doesn't control much except the CD which is basic in what it can replay - I would think it would at least be able to control volume but no.  So not head over heals about this unit but since it has great sound quality and great volume it suits my purposes just fine.
5,Sounds good though no volume control on remote.
2,I returned the first radio i ordered for because it wasn't picking up signals. Another one was sent to me which I did not request for hence I want to send it back. Thankyou.
2,System worked there days and now it doesn't work at all. Waste of money.
2,The sound quality volume & remote work great. Just the CD player hasn't work since we first used it. but we didn't use it until several month because we wanted the compacted size for our camper
4,I’ve been looking everywhere for a small stereo system that had a radio tuner. (So hard to find in stores these days.) Because it was a Magnavox brand I figured I was getting quality.I initially questioned the quality due to the plastic casing. But I plugged it in turned on the radio & wow! Such a good sound from such a little box! The CD player & remote was so simple. Very happy with the product & glad that Magnavox lived up to their reputation once again! You did not disappoint!!
4,This product for me is a good purchase for a retiree on a fixed income.  The sound is clear with no hiss and is full with decent depth.  As it is a small size good light is helpful to see and read the function buttons and bars.  The remote does not include a volume function.  I listen to opera classical and jazz cds on it and they sound good to me.As Magnavox states this system was not designed to rattle the walls and windows.  If you need more oomph in your sound look at other systems .
4,This is not what you want to buy to wow guests at your next party. That is not why I bought it. I do projects in my garage and wanted sound. I wanted the option to play a CD to listen to the radio or stream the music from my phone. For that this serves the purpose very very. Not crazy about the color white but that doesn’t affect the sound. I don’t regret having purchased this stereo!
5,I bought this for my parents for Christmas but they went out and bought one themselves.  Instead of returning it I kept it for myself.  I have it on a shelf on my t.v. stand and I think it plays great!  The bluetooth feature works well as does the CD player and radio.  The time display is not as vibrant as I'd like it to be (even with changing the dimmer settings.)  The only color available at the time was in white which is okay but would have preferred it in black or dark gray.  For the price and size of the unit it is worth it and I would recommend it to anyone considering a small CD/radio shelf unit.
4,Like most people I ordered this because it had a remote and bluetooth. Unfortunately the remote only powers CD functions. No off/on no volume...only CD. The sound is actually pretty good for a small stereo. Magnavox has always been known for their great sound since way back. I like it!Update - This little sucker actually sounds mint! Built for rock and roll sound.
4,This was a good buy for cds and radio in my shop. Sound quality is adequate but bottom end is nonexistent. I was able to wire additional speakers to this player which helps to spread the sound to different areas. Others have complained but I am happy with the purchase.
2,On December 8 2021 I placed an order for a gift for my mom for Christmas.  She wanted a radio that had a CD player to listen to her CD's.  The order arrived in mid-December.  A week ago the CD player stopped working.  I contacted the seller and she told me that she does not accept returns after 30 days.  Rarely does a new CD player stop working so quickly or before 30 days.  I lost $89 of my money and my mom was left unable to listen to her CD's.  I do not recommend this radio.
4,Overall quality is fine size works really well for my needs (just wanted something to listen to in the office without taking up a lot of space). The sound quality is a bit weak (tin-ey) but didn't expect high quality at this price point. Only complaint about the remote is that it is only for the play features there is no source selection or volume on it.
1,I bought this cd player for my bedroom.  It came a lot smaller than i expected.  I pluged it in and the cd player lasted one day.  I tried to fix it and i found that if you put batteries in it it will work.  But then the next day it was back to not working.  My point is do not by this thing. It is complete garbage.
4,Bought this for our 27 year old disabled daughter. She has very limited use of her hands or arms. This small remote control is very easy to use. She has learned how to listen to radio and she knows how to put in her cd music and change to a new one when she’s ready. Well worth the money.
4,Exactly what I was looking for. Needed something that would be bluetooth compatible. So when I am doing my cleaning I can listen to my music. Cleaning and music just go together for me. It fits great on the fireplace mantel in my living room. The sound is loud enough to even hear upstairs. Could not ask for better especially for the price!!
3,It is what it is. Inexpensive.
1,Worked well was cute and perfect fit and my daughter loved it in her room and was able to fall asleep to fav CD at night but one day last week after owning it for just over 2 months the speakers failed and now the whole thing just sounds like whitenoise. Passed up my return window so I'm stuck with it and out the money. Such a disappointment!!
4,For what it is. It’s just right. Maybe I’ll buy something a little bigger next time if I want to use it in the living room. Had to put it in the bedroom. It’s works great in the bedroom. I would recommend it for anyone who wants a good sound in a small room. Office or bedroom
3,I read it was small and they were not kidding!  The speakers would both fit in a shoe box and the system would also fit in a standard shoe box w/ room to spare.  I have it out on the porch but suffice to say you get what you pay for!  It is more for a kid or to leave at a beach house where you might want something to keep you company. Not for a primary source of music for sure.
1,None of it is easy to work and sound is terrible and disk would not play and sound is terrible. I would not recommend it to anybody. I should sent it back but I would hate for someone else to get stuck with it. I am putting it in the garbage where it belongs.
5,I must admit I was hesitant to purchase this product based upon some negative reviews but decided that the good ones outweighed the bad.  I am so happy with the purchase.  For the reason I was looking to find a modest prices CD player that would find in a small spot this was just it.  The sound is great the remote is only for the CD player but does exactly what I would have hoped except to turn the power on/off.  Truly glad I went with my gut!
2,Piece of Chinese crap......
3,Wow.... it sure is small! Not sure this was worth what I paid for it. It’s like a small boombox with external speakers.  As far as the speakers good sound quality; loud but won’t shake the floor. The remote is tiny and works fine even with no power button.  The unit and speakers are light plastic.  So far it’s working out fine for what I wanted it for I’m just upset that I paid way too much for it.
5,I needed a low price system to listen to my morning radio programs.  This was a great price and replaced a huge broken system.  It has AM which I found difficult to find as most systems now only offer FM.  This is not a high end system but it definitely works great for me at a very reasonable price. Remote control only operates the music CD. All radio controls are located on the unit itself.
5,Great sound. even on low volume I can hear music anywhere in my apt.
4,I like that it is a small unit that doesn’t take a lot of space. I don’t like that the remote doesn’t turn on and off the system but only works for the CD player.
1,I've had this for a little over a month and it has already completely quit working.  I only used it once. Do not buy. The only reason I gave it a star was because zero stars is not an option.
4,This stereo works really good. If you have a small space it would be great for it.
4,I didnt get the remote control and I need it how can I get it. I though it was bigger but is good.
1,I like the size of the unit and it has good sound however the CD player worked for one day and then just failed to work it spins the cd and recognizes the cd and shows the tracks however does not deliver any sound. The AM and FM works ok. Also the display fades out some of the time. I guess you get what you pay for. It lasted about a month and just stopped working did not turn on at all. Not happy with this product it was a waste of money.
4,You get what you pay for. Sound is just ok
3,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. Its a good value sound is good. However my complaint is that you can't turn off the LCD screen. It has a dimmer but even "dimmed" the light output is insanely bright. We have to put a shirt in front of it at night because it illuminates her whole room.
4,Not bad for the price sound quality is good. Do they sell a remote that is compatible with volume control on off buttons?
3,I like the fact that it works good and picks up local stations fairly well however the remote only works on the cd player so you still have to turn it on and off and also manually adjust the volume. Can't set the time with it or change functions either. Kinda feel like I got cheated on the deal.
3,These are WIRED speakers not BT. The BT is only for accepting audio from your BT ie your phone.The REMOTE is NOT for the channels volume or source (AM/FM/CD). It is ONLY to control the CD player - tracks repeat and stop. Ugh.You get what you pay for................
1,Stereo sounded ok for what it was. Remote does not allow volume control…what? Bluetooth had a 10’ range.  Stereo stopped working 1 month after purchase. 65.00 for a 1 month stereo unacceptable. Don’t waste your money or time. Total cheap crap.
1,Bought for an inexpensive radio for work 2 weeks after buying it the power button stopped working and the digital screen went completely out so you can't see the station you are looking for or the clock I wouldn't buy.
4,I like fits on my shelf perfectly does take up to much space.I speaker wire should be longer though
4,Good
4,Great little CD Bluetooth and am/fm radio. Volume great. Remote not so good. only controls track changing on unit. But that doesn't distract from overall value! #sezTop
3,The stereo is sooooo small. No way to change base and tenor. It sounds ok but could be so much better.  Bigger speakers would be a huge plus. I guess if I read further and seen the specs I probably wouldn’t have bought. My husband thinks it’s ok tho.
5,Love this cute little radio! I bought this for my home office and it’s sits perfectly at the top of my shelf. I haven’t turned the sound up super high but do not keep it at a low volume and it sounds really good no static at all. Great value for an inexpensive price!
4,The sound in not great.  For the money it's okay.
4,Compact with great sound. Great stereo for the price. Good speakers.
1,Fast delivery descent price easy set up. Played one CD sounded great than stopped working.
4,My son absolutely loves this player. In an age of digital content he has a collection of CDs that he prefers to DC. Being able to play by both means has made him a happy camper.
3,Decent radio. Bought for my shop. Would have been better if the remote could have done more. Like turn the radio on or control volume. All it does is work the cd.
5,Nice radio will use it in my garage. I like the tuning feature and the sound is good as long as the antenna can be mounted near a window. My only issue is that the remote only works for the CD player and not the volume or on/off switch.
1,Just set up today 9-14-2022 and it is not working played one song and would not play any more!
3,I had a previous radio by Panasonic which lasted me for over 10 yrs and had great reception. I can barely tune in just one station and I placed it exactly where I had the other radio.
5,This gets a parent's thumbs up from me because it's not a boom-stereo.  The speakers are great and the volume can go up pretty loud BUT unfortunately there is no headphone jack so that my daughter can blow her own eardrums out without taking mine out along with them.  It is bluetooth enabled though so if a person has bluetooth headphones then they're good to go.  We don't happen to have any sadly.  But that's next on the list!A great little stereo though with overall good quality sound.
4,For a shop radio good not much bass.
3,It gets it lots of stations sounds good its just the remote only controls the CD player and nothing else.
3,A little disappointed in the product sound (speakers sound like tin cans) and overall quality. I was hoping for better from Magnavox brand. Can’t get the remote to work.
4,Really enjoying it
1,I hae not tried to use it yet and it is so small.. not thrilled at the momwnt will see if it works...
3,Overall the sound system was great for the price. It's smaller than what I expected from the pics. Unfortunately the remote was defective but for the price it serves the purpose of a radio and a CD for my father.
2,Lots of disappointments on this purchase.  Super cheaply made all plastic.  REMOTE only controls the CD player which I probably won't use at all.  All other operation is manual.  I also thought the speakers were wireless they are not.  The only positive is the sound from the speakers is clear and good.  I have the radio in my store and need a remote to quickly turn it off or turn down the volume as customers come in and out or the phone rings.  What a total DRAG!!
3,Decent basic stereo. It is compact which is what I was after. The biggest disappointment is that the remote doesn’t control the volume only the CD player functions.
3,It’s very small and decent sound quality. Seems like it may fall apart easily. I bought for my in laws and they can’t read the buttons. Tiny!
1,Worst piece of junk I've bought a long time on and off button wouldn't work after 2 hours
3,The product does the job satisfactorily but there was NO remote. I requested a replacement and was sent a second CD player again with NO remote. I just stopped asking.
4,SMALLER THAN I TOUGHT BUTY WORKS AND SOUNDS OK
5,great small unit that sounds great and easy to use
4,perfect for my need
4,good quality for the money
3,It's very small and no good sound quality. You basically have to turn volume to max just to hear. Connection to Bluetooth is no good either....a waste of money
3,Less than six months after receiving this the left speaker has completely stopped working. Very unfortunate as this was a promising little stereo in the beginning.
3,I am very disappointed I can’t since with my Alexa dot. Didn’t know this when I bought it.
4,It says the Speakers are detactchable and they are not
3,Nice stereo except the blue light is irritating Good value for price
3,No AM signal. FM signal is weak very touchy. I would recommend spending a little more money and get a better stero.
1,It wouldn't play a CD
5,The speakers have a good sound. I was also pleased with the Bluetooth and radio as well as the CD player. I can turn it up loud enough for my mother who has severe hearing loss without any distortion
3,The remote won’t work!!!bought new battery and still doesn’t work
3,Instruction manual print too small to read and not clear enough with magnifying glass.Unit is very small.
1,I'm sorry to say for some reason it didnt work. Unfortunately I had to return it.
2,The Stereo is not of good quality. The piece that contains all of the buttons on the front fell off immediately after taking it out of packaging. The two speakers that it come with do not produce a high volume. However it does work in the sense that it can play CD's radio and it even has bluetooth capability that actually works. While it does function it is not top quality.
3,The volume control makes one speaker cut out occasionally. Pretty annoying.
3,Sounds okay but very hard time tuning into the station that we like. Bluetooth works well. For a small unit not bad
5,Very surprised at the quality purchase we made at a very economical price.  This unit is small and takes up very little space but the sound quality it generates is exceptional.
2,Ok . sound quality not even just ok... Also not enough sound for the space... The charge to return postage was approx half the purchase price. The company then on top of that charges a 20% restocking fee on the item... after my time ... I’m in the negative if I return the item... sucks... I gave the item to a stranger. The cost of the item is what I paid to learn not purchase from this seller.
1,Perfect for a very very small cubicle where people want you to “keep it down!”. The little Bluetooth speaker (pictured)  I was hoping this stereo would replace is louder than this POS. Don’t buy it unless you want a really real quiet stereo.
2,Horrible sound.  I bought this to play my subliminal CD's to fall aasleep.  It made voices sound like they had a rag stuck in their mouth.  The remote never worked.  Volume was lousy.  I will garage sell it for $5 just to get rid of it.
5,Living in a rural area I did not expect to hear music very well but all of the stations I listen to come in very well. My favorite is Joyfm.com
3,Sound is fair not good. But what do you want for this price.  I'm okay with it!
4,Happy with the unit overall. price was OK. The only thing I do not like is that you have to use the remote for the CD player. If you use the remote you are SOL.
5,I have a Radio tuned to 1 Station playing in my Garage 24 hours a day. I tried several tuners and this is the only one that eliminated Station 'drift' 24 hours a day!
5,Love the fact the small size lets me put it anywhere. Sound is also amazing for the size. Would recommend this if your looking for great sound in something that will fit anywhere.
5,Definitely old school but of you need something for home that's little I would recommend. Do I think it's worth $50 no!
3,The Bluetooth does not work.
1,Poor quality
1,First impression was how small it was which I actually didn't mind. Then in pressing buttons it was really cheap plastic sound if you know what I mean. Sound of radio was just ok. Like many say you get what you paid for. Here's the thing I did read a review or two that said the CD player either didn't play or stopped playing. Well I put in my first CD and did everything correctly (it shouldn't take a genius to figure out) and it showed I have 20 songs on the CD. Started it and everything was fine until it wasn't. It stopped at the 10th song and couldn't advance to the 11th. I tried everything to get it to start over again and nothing. Not worth it. It's going back! Don't buy it if you're smart.
5,This is so cute and compact. Sounds great. Fits perfect on my bookshelf.  I would recommend this for a small living room or a child's bedroom.
3,Ok sound. Just really tiny system. Really is a "shelf" size
5,ARRIVED ON TIME PACKAGED WELL VERY LITTLE ASSEMBLY WINDERFUL SOUND PERFECT FOR MY SMALL CONDO I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS PRODUCT A÷÷÷÷÷
3,Everything about this little system was great except we really needed a remote for the entire unit.  Honestly the CD player wouldn't have seen a lot of use.  Unfortunately when purchased the product description didn't clarify about the remote limitations.
5,My flat-earther wife loves it. She'd do reel-to-reel tape if still possible...
1,Product did not work had to send back
5,Did not have a remote control with it.
5,I like everything about the stero system it's nice small. Set nice on the shelf loved Wi-Fi and remote control the price is nice👌👌👍👍
2,All I wanted was something small for my husband's office that he could listen to AM radio and use his cell phone to listen to his media. The BlueTooth wouldn't work and the radio reception as spotty at best. Some stations tuned in just fine and others were barley audible on FM. And on AM none where without static. Also if you switched between AM/FM you had to re-tune the station meaning it was not a digital tuner. I will say the tuning was very responsive and I was pleased with that. We didn't try the CD player. Sending it back to Amazon.
2,I was disappointed in this.  Its very small in size but more for the side of a teenager's nightstand.  I am unable to tune to my favorite radio stations it just doesn't pick them up. The CD player I do enjoy however.  I should've  put my consumer dollar towards a stereo system instead.
1,Bought it for a gift to my Mom's ( 94 y.o) and she opened and tried to install it few days ago.  It never turned on!! Not with power or even batteries.  Was so mad that I asked her to put it on the garbage.  In top Amazon didn't even give me any credit (in spite of many thousands of dollars spent in the past) because was out of the time frame for return!Not fair but anyway DON'T BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP.  And regarding Amazon I will start ordering as much as I can in the future from Walmart that has same prices and service!
3,Returned. Did not reach my expectations.
5,Fits right in my night stand. Very good for the price. It cost a few more dollars if you wait too long so get one while they are cheap.Will be used for listening to favorite CDs and radio.
5,Nothing all good
5,Much smaller than I expected but the sound quality is perfect for what I need it for
5,This is the neatest little stereo. The sound quality is great.
3,Was a little disappointed in the quality. I expected more from a Magnavox product. I'm glad I got a good discount on it. be  I would be returning it if I had paid the original price.
2,It's like a toy.  So lightweight that you cannot press buttons without holding the thing down. Sound is tinny. It's not what I expected but Good for a youngsters room. Remote is for CD player only.  Maybe I missed that in the description.
5,It took 5 minutes to set it up.It’s compact and simple to useThe sound is very goodGood value
5,Awesome little stereo compact fits behind my computer on my work desk. Had a issue with reception but running the antenna wire to the metal casing on  the window always me to get all the stations I want to listen to. Highly recommend
5,Works out well in our exercise room!
5,Radio came on time and packaged well. Got it for the garage and works great. Small but a good sound for the money.
3,Not that loud
1,bought this sterer for my shelfgot  it and set up as instructionsworked great sound was ok then atfer radio went offhave read instruction book if you want to call it thathecked the speaker wires they were ok.Still no raadio or CD.I would reccomend that you don't waste your money on this .ITS A PIECE OF JUNK.
1,This stereo was nice for the price but buyer beware. This stereo stopped working after one month. Messaged company we were a few days past the return date. They sent us to the “warranty department “ they never answered the phone. After a month of email with the warranty department and the company I purchased from they finally stated they would send out a refund. Well here I am a month later still waiting for the refund and still getting the run a round.

5,Good value for price paid
5,Compact with a great sound using it out on my garage and I love it!
4,Every thing is good
5,Well worth the money
5,Perfect size for my garage.
2,I purchased this so that I could listen to Christmas music this year.  I have had it for a little over three months and the CD player is already broken.  I have only played it a few times per week so I'm pretty sure it's not from overuse.... Very disappointed.  :(
1,I purchased this product and received it in April.  I have been using it regularly working from home.  Sound was good easy to use.  I was happy with the product until today.  it just stopped working completely.  It does not appear to be getting power.  The clock is working (battery backup) but none of the CD/radio functions work at all.  I have yet to contact the manufacturer but will be doing so.  I would not recommend this product.  Very disappointed.
5,Ver y good for your money
5,perfect for my needsand I can get some AM stations
5,I listen to CDs.
5,Very nice for price
5,Great price nice gift
5,Great little machine for the price.
2,Low quality volume can barely hear anything that plays
1,Cannot Control the Volume Level! It begins loud and you cannot lower the volume. I think it's meant to be in an open area (barn garage or shop). It's not working out too well in the small bedroom I have it in currently. I would not recommend this player unless you are planning on placing it inside of a very spacious area!
5,Nice
4,Nice  compact size has good sound.
5,ok
5,Radio is prefect for my home.
2,I was disappointed in remote control the functionality was limited. It purchased what appeared to be and felt like plastic.
4,Readable radio dial good reception speakers pretty good
1,This radio is junk it goes in and out. It will come in fine then lose reception then come back in again . The antenna wire is worthless no matter how I have it.The dial to change stations is very sensitive. I would send it back but took a hammer to it because it was so irritating. This is just my experience.
5,gift
1,The item that I received was not what is pictured. I ordered this as a Christmas present for my mother and had it shipped to Florida. My daughter wrapped it for me so It was done when i flew in. We received a dvd/cd player. Very disappointed. Nothing we can do about it now. I just hope I didnt over pay for something that was nothing like what is pictured.
5,Just what I was looking for does everything I needed it to do.
2,The picture in which i ordered from made the unit look more substantial.
5,Best little CD player have it next to the bed and use it every night. Sound is perfect and love the fact it has a clock!
5,Excellent value for what it is and good sound.
5,I absolutely love it. Thank you so much
5,Love it. It sits on top of my piano in my den and looks very attractive there. I like the sound quality and it's appearance.
2,Love the size - always loved Magnavox products but this thing sucks. Radio FM tuning is sketchy at best continually hear other stations in background cd player doesn't work period.  I'd return it if I could. Would not buy again. Disappointed in Magnavox.
2,Dislike the item Period.
2,Dificult to program. Will not stay on station.
5,It’s quite small but for its size & specs the unit produces good sound. Plenty loud enough for a small room or office. Bluetooth paired easily & sounds pretty good.
5,Amazing sound quality for the price. My son was thrilled. I did not expect that much sound from those speakers. Now off to shop for some earplugs.
1,I purchased this to listen to cds in my small retail store. I was replacing a similar machine (very old but still worked). It didn’t have Bluetooth or digital tuning tho. Now I wish I’d kept that one! In just over a month (conveniently just past return date) the machine stopped reading and playing cds. So frustrating...radio & Bluetooth still work so I’ll just use it on my screen porch. Too bad I’ll have to buy a new store system.
1,While this is a nice small compact little system it did not function and was returned. I don't know if there was an overall defect/short in the electrical system within it but neither the CD or the radio played. At all. It was completely dead like it wasn't plugged in at all. Considering the brand is Magnavox I really didn't have any doubts that it would function. I sure hope this was only my misfortune and others have better luck with this.
1,It did not work at all and I could not send back for a refund because the date had expired . I have it in a box sitting in the closet. The box was damaged when I received it.  Try to return but I was told the time had expired.
5,The remote only works for cd's could not change radio stations or volume
1,I've had stereo for three months and over last week it keeps just shutting down on me usually after a couple of minutes.  It should not be breaking down after three months.  If I could return it I would but it is past the refund window.
5,Its small but sounds good
1,Probably best for little kids who are not concerned for sound quality and GREAT for their parents who do not want to be blasted!  Not suitable for my use sound quality not good but a cute very small unit that would be  great for small kids
5,The compact size and sound
5,on time good radio
5,So far very good
2,I liked the looks of stereo and the radio sounded great but when I received it the CD player did not work however they refunded my money promptly.
5,A Christmas gift for my 12 year old son. Nice little stereo system and didn't break the bank.
1,No AM reception.Remote only controls the CD player.  You can't turn the stereo on/off with remote.  No presets for radio stations.  It's as if they entered a competition to see who could make the cheapest radio.  Congratulations we have a winner.
5,Clarity and sound are very good! A present for my son and he loves it!
5,Small system with big stereo sound.
1,the cd  never worked I reported it amazon said they would refund they also for me not to return it  also I have never been refunded yet
1,The remote didn’t work. I couldn’t get the CD player to work. Couldn’t change the time. The only thing that worked was the radio.  I am returning it.
5,Great sound for such a small CD player. My favorite part is the remote
1,Upon arrival was disappointed at how small it was and when I hooked it up to try to get a station it was very difficult to tune in any thing clear and then when you walked in any direction it would change the volume level. Just a very cheap Poorly made product not worth the money.
1,I didn't expect a great unit but I did expect a good unit. This is a real cheap and flimsy music unit. Came with a broken speaker with it's guts inside rattling.
1,Radio stopped working after about 3 months. Controls were very spotty. Try something different.
5,Gift for my technically challenged Mother and she loved it!
1,CD player worked for about 5 minutes and then just stopped working would not play cd’s at all.Seemed like a nice product other than that.
1,In the back of the stereo there's a place for batteries but the  AAA doesn't fit it not happy
5,Wow..amazing sound!!!!
1,The sound is offal the tuning knob too sensitive speaker cord way too short. I'm returning it
5,Great
1,I was embarrassed to give this to my daughter for Christmas......so much so I bought her a replacement. It truly exemplifies poor quality.
2,It stopped working on me!! So sad
1,Waste of money you can barely  hear it if in bluetooth  an cd player quit working two weeks after getting it absolute trash
1,It was just past the limit for returning this item. No more electronics from Amazon for me!
1,Function button does not work. Disappointed. Will now have to box up and send back. Such a hassle!!!
1,It worked a couple of times and hasn't worked since I've only had it about a month
1,Product is not what I expected I'm having a hard time returning it cannot in all honesty recommend or buy from your company again!
1,The CD player stop working three weeks after I purchased it.
1,CD reader broke within a month! Returned for a refund.
1,Had to return it. Would not play any cds
1,Worked great when I plugged it in. Worked maybe a 1.5 hrs and shut off and won't turn on.
1,Little piece of junk. Magnavox isn't what they used to be.
1,CD PLAYER DIED AFTER 3 WEEKS .  VERY DISAPPOINTED!
1,Not durable sort of cheap in quality
1,I tried many music cd's but they turn for a few minutes and stopped. The radio and clock work. I took the square trade protection plan but I don't feel that I should use that immediately.
1,It was smaller than I thought it would be. The speakers sound like it was broken or in a tunnel..
1,Need to send back cd does not work
1,CD player is jammed it don't open all the way up
1,Poor sound quality very poor.. Returned unit. Also simple remote only to use with CD  but not radio unit...
1,CD didn’t work through out
5,works good
1,It will not pick up any stations!
5,Thank you
1,Can’t even make it work. Sending back.
1,Horrible merchandise! Was not what expected. Opened box and set up...never worked!
1,Die the first night returned waiting for new one to see if it works
1,Bad quality very cheap and poor sound.
1,only used radio first and first time tried to play a CD the turntable didnt work and in process of figuring that out NOTHING works on it now!
1,The sound quality is terrible
1,Speaker was broken
1,Returned too big for area
1,To small  in on a remote control on for CD play
1,Remote don’t work reception very bad keeps fading
1,Doesn’t work
1,Smaller than I expected for the price
1,this has already stopped working..... it is the cheapest made stereo system I have ever owned ......
1,Never turned on after being plugged in.
1,Volume not good.  Some cd's won't play
1,One one speaker worked returned for refund.
3,Cannot program in radio channels or turn off the backlit Blue LED light at night.  The remote doesn't power on or off and is works for the CD player.  Not worth the price.  the clear plastic insert on one of the speakers pushed through to the inner compartment of the speaker to no avail as soon as I touched it.  I like the compact size and the sound is good but not a good value.
4,Fair quality and sound.
4,Good sound quality and easy to set up. Remote control not working upon unboxing. I will replace the battery and hope thats the problem.
1,Bought this as a Christmas gift for my 5 year old who loves music! Went to play on Christmas morning and the CD player wouldn’t recognize any CDs. The radio worked but the sound quality wasn’t that great. Sending back.
1,This like all of them the CD player fails.... what happen to making decent CD parts these days?
5,Set this up in my daughters room so that she can listen to audio books at night to help her sleep.  Working perfectly.
5,I love this stereo system! Just what I needed. Great quality and price! Thanks
5,Best little radio and cd player for the money
1,CD player made a noise other than the music coming out from the CD. Very irritating. it made a "clicking" sound (everything it went around--like a "scratch" on a record turntable). Radio was decent. But really was looking for a CD player to play at night with sleep function. I had no problems returning the item.
4,It's ok for personal use and small crowd to entertain
5,Great sound and nice compact set. Great purchase.
4,Needs the base boost.  Easy to use. Same as unit that was replaced. Good sound. User friendly!!
5,nice little shelf unit
5,I love the color the sound is great!!It’s compact perfect size for my boyfriend’s apartment 👍🏼😄
5,Good  clear sound .
3,Sound not bad but bass comes out when turned up....Has remote but only for CD player not for power or volume which would have been good in this purchase...
5,ok
5,Has good sound. It looks good but is smaller than the pictures make it look but best of all you can tune the radio without the remote
1,I didn't like it and I returned it.
5,It sounds good u can program up to thirty different stations
5,This is a great little C/D player and radio. Sound  is great. I just wish the remote  control could turn the radio on or off.
1,Very poor quality on every respect!
5,I love this little stereo! It’s compact yet sleek.
5,It works well enough to not return. Take that as you will when you decide. It was easy to set up it looks nice sounds pretty good.  The bad is that the remote doesn’t even work the volume and tuning is TOUCHY! And the light does not turn off completely. Annoying.
3,The sound is very thin even with the bass response turned on.  The reception is very poor. Unless the station you're trying to get is very powerful don't expect to pick up a distant station.  I even used a dipole antenna and still gets poor reception. This would be fine except the sound is very bad with the speakers supplied. I ended up using another set of speakers and it improved the sound considerably but most might not have the opportunity to do that. Overall a generous 3 stars.
1,The CD player would not work. The radio worked fine but I bought it for CDs so I am returning it.
5,I love the player. I listen to it every night when I go to bed. I am very pleased with the product. Thank you.
5,Good for the price. Perfect for my garage. Would be for small place too. If you want to rock hard and loud though this is not it and you will need to spend more.
1,Thought there was a headphone jack. No wouldn't accept headphones old or new. Tried brand new BT headphones but wouldn't link up. I returned this unit. Small speakers have a good sound but not interchangeable.
4,I would say it is a pretty decent item for the cost.
3,The remote for this unit leaves a lot to be desired.  It doesn't allow you to select a particular song by its number on a CD and it doesn't let you regulate volume.  On my unit the lid on the CD compartment sticks when you close it so have to keep a sharp instrument handy to pop it up just a bit in order for the disc to spin.  Other than that the sound is good for such a small unit.  Works fine in a bedroom.
