4,I recently ordered five “renewed” iPad Air 2 tablets through Amazon.  The Air 2 was and still is one of the best iPad designs.  So good in fact that the first iPad Pro 9.7 (2018) was really just an updated Air 2 and shared the same thin construction laminated 9.7-inch Retina display and overall size.  The Air 2 has supported seven iOS updates and currently runs the latest iPadOS 14 –talk about longevity.  Over 2 million iPad Air 2 models were sold during its two year production that ended in early 2017. Since you can no longer buy a new Air 2 the only option is used/refurbished.  Apple devices like the iPad are remarkably durable and buying refurbished is a great way to find a "like new" device that will last you many years to come.  It's a good value too: When the Air 2 was originally released the models ranged from $500-$700.  A few years later you can buy the same models renewed for $200-$300 --a great deal for a device that's still state-of-the-art. There's no shortage of vendors for renewed/refurbished iPads but one thing is clear:  “Renewed like new” is a broad term that covers everything from near-mint condition to laughingly-damaged devices.  Some vendors are better others are worse none will be perfect.  Here’s my experience shopping over the past month: Vendor #1:  All Out Apple I purchased two iPad Air 2’s from this seller one 32GB and one 64GB.  Both arrived in good condition packaged safely and they work fine.  The cosmetic defects are OK --a few light scratches and discoloration on the back of the case on one and a few nicks and shallow dent on the back of the other.  When held at “arm’s length” per Amazon's criteria the issues are not that visible.  The display/touchscreenS are fine.  The batteries in each last the normal 8 or so hours under typical use. The vendor includes a decent 2.4A (12W) USB charger and cable with each device similar to the original iPad charger for fast charging times.  Vendor #2:  Platinum Deals[UPDATED 3/6/21:  I purchased four iPad Air 2’s from this seller three 32GB and one 64GB.  One of the 32GB arrived in close to "like new" condition.  The cosmetic defects were minimal however after two weeks use I noticed that a portion of the display backlight would flicker when set to the lowest brightness setting --the sign of a failing LED in the backlight.  I returned this iPad for another from same seller and the replacement works fine so far.  However the cosmetic condition of the replacement is not as good as the first one since there are noticeable blemishes all the way around the aluminum bezel and there are a couple light scratches on the surface of the display glass.]  The other two iPads were unfortunately a totally different story:  each one was delivered literally bent in the middle --not dented but actually deformed as in the device was not flat!  This had nothing to do with shipping since the devices were well-packed and the boxes were undamaged.  The deformation on each device distorted the display glass and it was easy to see the permanent distortion when viewing along the edge of the device.  On one iPad the deformation was severe enough to cause backlight distortion that showed up as bright spots along the edge of the LCD (see photos).  The fact that the refurbisher considered these two bent iPads to be "renewed like new" is both hilarious and sad.  Of course both of the bent iPads went right back in their boxes for return to Amazon (I put a bright yellow post-it on each one to hopefully warn whoever inspects the returned devices not to turn around and sell them again.)  This vendor also included different USB chargers (either 8W or 12W USB-A or incorrectly one of them was USB-C) and cable with each device so they are not consistent --the 12W charger is the correct one for faster charging times.  I do give the vendor credit for immediately sending me the correct charger to replace the wrong USB-C charger delivered with one of the Air 2 units.ADVICE:  So my advice is to inspect your "renewed" iPad carefully since the vendors are not consistent in the overall condition of what they'll send you.  The iPad Air 2 in particular is remarkably thin and perhaps more prone to getting bent if mishandled during its life --perhaps explaining why bent ones find their way to a refurbisher in the first place.  The Air 2 has a wide tolerance for being bent and still work without a problem. However it's quite clear that "like new" may not necessarily mean "not bent" for the ultra-thin Air 2 so use the 90-day Amazon Renewed Guarantee wisely to make sure your renewed device meets a reasonable definition of "like new" upon receipt.Overall I'm happy with the two renewed iPads I decided to keep (32GB models one from each vendor listed above).  I'm not sure that any one vendor does a better job in selecting "like new" iPads but clearly one of the above did not have an issue sending two bent iPads.Finally be aware that the 90-day Amazon Renewed Guarantee says you'll get a full refund if not satisfied however some of the refurb vendors claim to charge return shipping and restocking fees.  The Amazon Renewed policy is not clear about this so if you're charged fees for the return then you should contact Amazon to have them correct it.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 UPDATE on charging . The cord included was useless . BUT I just used my iPhone cord and it charged to 100% in no time !UPDATE on streaming . Streaming seems fine ! Websites came right up ..I can quickly get to my classes and streaming is smooth .Also I  like this size ! It’s almost too big for holding . So any larger and I would feel like I was trying to grip a small laptop . This is a good size !! The viewing portion is about 6x7-3/4 the entire surface is 9.5-6.5Product is exactly as expected . Had a opening video but I could t load to Amazon reviews for some reason .  Not in original packaging as was stated . Simple white box inside an Amazon box . Came with a cord for charging and that’s it ; as stated . However  it says “lightening “ speed and that is doubtful . It’s still charging (30mins) and is at home not 2% more than when I got it .I’m giving it the benefit of the doubt for now ;  will update later . The “excellent “ refurbishment was just that  excellent . No scratches anywhere that I could detect ; screen is perfect ! It had 50% battery on arrival and I was able to automatically get on  connect to my iCloud  uodate to the newest IOS version 15. Whatever (🤣) and get right on . All my apps are there and usable . I was able to add allnof the sites I use to the home screen with saved passwords . I will update later with info for  1.) procreate and stylus ability and  2.) streaming video and 3.) adding a SIM card if I choose so I can use my cell (supposedly this can be done but … not really an issue for me )!These are the two main things I want to use this for . The ONLY drawback so far - and this is if it would even bother you - is the lag with the keyboard. This is a 2gen iPad Air so it’s to be expected . Does not disappoint me at all . I do t plan on typing or texting on it !
5,I received my gently loved iPad Air 2 on Wednesday charged it and had everything transferred from m old iPad Air that was 8 plus years old. I replaced due to the fact that Apple didn’t support it with updates anymore.I bought this one because I was going to spend $500 plus on a new one…but after looking on Amazon I found the refurbished ones read the reviews and thought you know I can get this a new cover and screen protector for half the cost of just getting a new one! glad I did!The one I received looks like it is brand new so someone loved this one as much as I loved my old one! So far so good. I had saved everything thing to my iCloud so transfer was very easy. Didn’t lose anything in that process and so far have been very pleased!
4,I got this deal under $175.Is an old ipad so does not support a whole load of apps. I feel a bit slow (1 ~ 3 sec to open some apps).For me I was looking a 64gig storage to put a decent music collection in it for offline play.When I use it even the calendar take up to 2 sec to open. Since I got it for some basic office work calendar notifications emails and so) and offline music play this does not bother me.I was thinking that with a cellular chip I could make regular calls as well. But nope. It only got network connectivity for not having 100% dependencies on wifi (improve portability). So making regular calls will not work. Facetime and others will with cellular network or wifi.The package was well presented with a generic charger the astetic was like new not blended all corners intact barely usage wear signals.For me this is more than enough. Some others will consider a dead device.
5,I was surprised by the condition of the device although it has some signals of use the condition is great. The packaging is not original but very well protected. Also accesories aren't original but looks great. The back cover of the device shows some scratches and seems that a name was deleted with some kind of sandpaper but even with that the condition is acceptable.This device was released in 2014 but even in 2022 works very well.Screen is in excellent condition and scratches are not perceived. In overall exceeded my expectations.For reference the store that sold the item was All Out Apple.
4,This iPad arrived in excellent condition. The screen was perfect there were no scratches or imperfections on it. The touchscreen works perfectly. The battery life is great. Don’t be afraid to buy this product. I’m glad I did purchased “renewed”.
5,This has been a great product however after downloading 6 apps I got the low storage BS! So if u like a lot of apps don't waste your time or money. I wish I didn't 🤷‍♀️
4,The battery discharges very quickly.  As soon as it is plugged in the percentage is like 49%.  Something is wrong with this particular one.
5,My wife wanted me to waste hundreds more on a new iPad. I decided to take a chance on the renewed iPad air2. Setup was automated and painless. I doubled the ram and like the performance & display clarity. Would recommend to any & all.
4,Toma tiempo en cargarse el cargador con que vino es lento
