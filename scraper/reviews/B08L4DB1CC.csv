4,The steel on the inside of the 360 ball head on one of the lights was delivered broken. I used black electrical tape to keep it on. Otherwise the lights serve the purpose. They're easy to assemble and they're bright.
4,These little lights really get the job done. I used one as a key to couple with my ring light as a fill and the other unit as a back light. Made my small space look great. I‚Äôm not sure these would be sturdy enough for a lot of travel but they work really well for my basement setup
4,Good for the price.  Smaller than I expected and I wish they would extend a bit higher.  A wall plug would have been nice instead of having to use USB adapter.
5,The package arrived with one ball head. It doesn‚Äôt screws on neither of the tripods. Too bad I like the light but it‚Äôs crucial for this to be able to tilt it.  I will be requesting a ball head or return the whole thing.
5,These lights work great. They come with an array of colors which are easy to change. Power cord is short which works fine in my studio but want to make note of it for others who may be concerned with length.
4,These work well for the costs.  The dimmer switch is useful.  No problems with how they perform.Only thing I would change would be the height that they can go too.  A little short in my opinion.
3,The lights are lightweight dim-able with easy to use color filters. The stands they come with are cheap and they will fall apart leaving a trail of hardware like nuts and bolts wherever you go making them useless. Use a different higher quality stand for the lights and you are good to go. The lights are worth the price even without the stands to be honest.
4,Las luces son sencillas sin embargo creo que est√°n bastante bien por el precio
4,I bought these to use for product photography and they've worked well so far. I did notice after I got them that each light seems to have a slightly different color temperature (one warmer one cooler) not sure if they are suppose to be like that but it is what it is and hasn't bothered me. A few months after buying them one of the lights has started turning itself on seemingly randomly at night. Maybe I just have a ghost?Overall would buy again and they're a good value for the money if you're not too picky about quality and just need some additional lighting. I do wish the cords were a little longer though.
4,Great price.
5,Great for YouTube broadcasting. Priced right
5,This really helped me with the lightening it is easy to assemble so you don‚Äôt have to worry about it.
4,I use these to accompany my ring light. They work but aren't too bright on their own. Switching out the slides is clutch. The remote that dims the light is a b word to use but it works
3,They work great! However if you get annoyed by high pitch noises I would not adjust the light at all. As soon as you dim them they start ringing.
5,They work AMAZINGLY for what you pay for. I will say the color screens do get a little warm when used for more than 5 minutes but for the multiple shoots I have used them in nothing has melted.. yet? Lol.Definitely a great purchase if you looking to improve your setup or improve the lighting in video/photo shoots!
5,This is a great product for not a lot of money. I use it to light my green screen.
3,These lights are nothing special and a bit pricey for the quality. Maybe this is more on me because I expected a little more and would probably spend more money next time to get a more featured and controllable light. I was admittedly being cheap here and I regret it but the lights OK.
3,By far the cheapest crap I've ever bought on amazon... I mean this thing doesn't even qualify as cheap. It's not bright cable is short so repositioning is a challenge if you don't have 20 extension cords. Overall not going to buy again or need for very long. Oh and these things get hot when you leave them on for too long
3,They work great but be gentle with them. The base that threads onto the stand is very thin and flimsy. One of them broke while simply setting up for a video it was barley bumped. I sanded the paint and put some JB Weld on it and moving on with life. But they are really bright.
4,These are easy to use but they really don‚Äôt project enough light to be useful even in a small room. Spend a little extra and get brighter/larger lights.
3,Light is good pictures rock but swivel broke first time I put it on
3,Inexpensive and it shows not that bright. Maybe for a helper light.
5,For the price I was not expecting it to be THIS good. It came with 2 tripods the lights themselves and 5 color lenses (including white) (10 total lenses 5 for each light). On their wire there‚Äôs a little control panel thing that lets you adjust the brightness. I actually highly recommend. If you‚Äôre looking for good lights at an insanely reasonable price this is the product for you.
4,El producto es de buena calidad recibe su energia por USB y aunque cumple su funcion en cuanto a iluminacion no es tan de lo mejor porque tiende generar sombras fuertes por lo tanto lo recomiendo para videos en casa y cosas sencillas porque para un resultado mas profesional dejan mucho que desear pero aun asi son muy buenos.
4,These are decent  simple led lights
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Great for product photos super lightweight easy to use. Not the sturdiest at max height but I like them. There's a swivel head attachment so you can aim the lights.
5,These are actually fantastic for what they are. The fact you even get 2 tall tripods with universal-threaded connections for less than 40 bucks is a steal since you can use them for anything else but the lights themselves are also very bright. They are not huge so you will want to use the provided or other diffusers but with clever placement the right diffusion and leaning on some software enhancements in post you can likely make these work as well as a much more expensive 'light tent' assembly.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†the best decision over the best option UBeesize LED Lightthe package is simple and safe thanks to UBeesize for your beautiful and helfull product and thanks amazon for few hours delivery.Adjustable Tripod are metal everything else is resistant plastic and very stable.the size is same as I saw in amazon and the expected one (I don't understand why some people are complaining) the product has bright light and can be adjustedTripods are very long and you can connect different devices such as webcams phone and others the cables are long as well (I will like even longer as possible but they are fine)The lights can be turned in any direction and either way up and down as well 30 90 is amazing.I use the lights in a car and it seems all natural you can also change the colors as you can see in the photos also you will appreciate the difference from the very darkest to the highest light possible in these lights. (only 1 first and both after)I Would recommend this to anyone for taking pictures putting on makeup streaming or creating content.If anyone has complaints I remind you please look at the price first I think it is something important to keep in mind we all want the best but sometimes demanding too much is not cool.blessings to you all and have a good day
4,It's very different from other light kits that I use. This is more portable and can be attached to a laptop or anything with a USB port. It needs barn doors and a change in temperature not just intensity... overall it's good.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Pros: don‚Äôt be afraid by its size this little thing is POWERFUL you could actually use only one if you want to and it will do the job. I make videos for instagram and TikTok (@polianaciliento) and I was struggling with the darkness of my kitchen lights my videos were coming out with poor quality because of it but this little guy it‚Äôs really powerful. I would say that this lighting is 10x better than a ring light which I also have used before.Cons: it doesn‚Äôt come with the outlet what is a bummer but it says in the description that it doesn‚Äôt and it‚Äôs not expensive so not too bad.
3,I bought this set of lamps to light my home movies. All is well EXCEPT they didn't think to include USB to wall outlet adaptors so now I have to order two adaptors to use these things. True I can plug the power cords into my PC USB ports but that isn't really a solution I'm happy with.
4,Over all not horrible decent brightness. My major complaint the power cords are usb and did not come with power blocks. On top of that the cords are very short. They are decent quality for the price. Slightly annoyed I have to buy two usb power blocks its kinda cool because you can use power banks to power them but it should be better advertised they will not work as is out of the box.
5,Get these lights for your studio if you want to be a content creator. It took me about 10 minutes to set up and they come with interchangeable color tabs.Say YES to these lights üëçüèæ
4,I‚Äôve used high end professional lights before so I know where the bar is set. These were surprisingly useful in a portrait session and provided nice dynamic colored light when paired with natural light. For the price I expected much less brightness but these babies can do the job.
5,I wasn't sure waht the quality would be.  This set is pretty nice.  Pretty bright easy to move.  I'd recommend.
5,le dio a mi oficina un aspecto muchisimo mejor  ademas para los videos queda perfecto como luces de fondo.
4,One of the lights will not turn off when press the off button on the connected remote. It only turns off when unplugged. Other than than everything else works well.
4,Just the right size for what I need them for.  I use them for my product review videos for YouTube. The lights are light weight and are very easy to travel with.  The included filters are a nice plus.
5,Better to press the button than having the power on your phone. For the price! Great!
5,Very nice product and enjoyable.
5,The product is just as described. Value for your money. It's bright and you can adjust the brightness level. I'm quite happy with the product.
5,I use these to add some added light to my desktop when I do Youtube recordings of projects.  they are USB powdered so I don't have to worry about lots of wall worts I just use a tower of power for all of my lighting needs.  which also means that I can take them with me on the road as I can run both lights on a portable battery pack.  the diffusers are good for mood lighting or to soften the light the tripods that come with them are by them selfs worth the money I paid for the whole setup.
2,It‚Äôs a good product for the value but first things first the base of the tripod is nowhere near as big as pictured which makes the tripod easy to tip over. On top of that I was missing 1 light and a mount with my original order. I told them about it and after complaining they sent me an entirely new kit.. sounds great right? Wrong the new kit has one light that is completely busted so now I have 4 tripods 3 lights and only two of them work‚Ä¶ At this point I kinda just want my money back if you just need to do a quick photoshoot then these may work for you but I‚Äôd just rather not bother
3,I haven‚Äôt even tried my lights yet but I didn‚Äôt know you need a wall usb charger for them.
4,Lights are a bit small but not nad overall
4,Smaller than I thought but in all seriousness it works really well! It‚Äôs super bright. I like it
5,Great product. Easy to set up store and use.
4,The adjustable brightness is great. My suggestions are to move the on/off/adjustment switch higher on the cable - I have to bend over to reach it. And to have a pass-thru "always on" position so I can control it with a smart plug.
4,The AC in this case USB is a little short easy to overcome. The light is great.
4,Used these to take my baby‚Äôs Christmas photos bc hiring a photographer was so expensive! Our photos came out great. I didn‚Äôt think they‚Äôd work so well bc of the price but I must say they exceeded my expectations!
5,The lights are good enough for my needs.
3,The lights are ok in brightness. But they fall over with the slightest bump and the light covers broke off from the falls. Also‚Ä¶ the cables are too short when the poles are extended to the max. USB is not good for this.
3,I didn't want to review too early. I wanted to use for a while and see if things get better. Buy I stopped using for now. The light is like a flashlight not soft light. They came with USBs and nothing to plug into electric socket so I have little options on where to plug in. If you're serious about taking pictures and video this light is not for you.
3,The product in and of itself is not that bad of a deal but understand the drawbacks. First off I didn't realize it's powered only by USB and secondly it's not really that strong of a light. It only works if it's right up on the subject. Any further away than a foot and a half from the subject this light is useless at least for my purposes. This was an impulse buy on my part. I had a better quality light with stronger output dimmer and battery option that I had my sights on but saw I could get two for the price of one those with these light. Read the fine print. You get what you pay for.
4,Setting up for small stream. Can‚Äôt afford the ‚Äúpro‚Äù lights so I gave these a shot. To my amazement they work fantastically. I was able to use the face light at high and the second as a fill from a different angle and lower power.The ball adjustment for the light head is a metal ball in a plastic socket. The plastic is threaded and that‚Äôs how you lock it in place. The metal screw can easily strip the plastic threads if you twist the locking screw too hard.Overall for the money they do exactly what I need until I can afford nicer lights or I may never need to upgrade.
5,I love the different settings for the lights from lite to bright.  Helps me much better to do what I'm doing because of the lights.  Definitely recommend this.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I was so happy when I came across these. I had a last minute 360 event and needed some lighting. I ordered these and they were so easy to put together. They also got the job done. Very bright and love the different light settings that you can choose from. I ordered four. I love that you can switch out the color plates. I use these lights for all my photo booth events now. Easy to transport and assemble. They don‚Äôt take up a lot of space. Make sure you have either a USB box or outlet to use them.

This brand never disappoints me. They get brighter than I thought they would. I think they could definitely even light up the room in the dark on their own. I like that they‚Äôre small actually. Easy to store when I move back and forth from school. I like that it‚Äôs not one big light too. It‚Äôll have light from both sides instead of straight on. Haven‚Äôt done a shoot with them but I think they‚Äôll be perfectly fine. It‚Äôs a little brighter white than I‚Äôd consider daylight but hey I‚Äôll take it. Can color correct later or play with the screens. I‚Äôd say both of them together is easily like at least if not more equivalent watts than the big 85w bulb I had.
5,These lights are a bit small and unfortunately not as bright as I would‚Äôve liked
3,For the cost these are great for filming in small spaces. They also come with color filters and stands. Assembly was really simple.My one disappointment was the fact the power chords end in USB rather than q standard outlet plug. Thankfully I already had a dual USB to wall adapter but c'mon now that's just one more stupid thing to haul around.For the cost it's pretty good.
4,They are good for the worth.
4,They are going to light up anything too far but are good spot lights for small scenes the color filters actually work well
5,Easy to maneuver when taking pics for online selling. Adjustable. Happy with purchase
4,The lights work well but be careful they don‚Äôt fall over. One of mine fell over and the plug ripped out of it. Other than that issue they are very useful.
4,I was surprised at the brightness coming from these things for what they cost. They are easy to set up and the adjustable brightness is great too (they adjust independently). The only real concerns I have are the durability and the lack of an AC power adapter. These are super lightweight so easy to transport but don't bang them around I don't think they would survive. Each light has its own power cord that ends in a USB I was surprised to see that it did not come with a USB power block or something to convert to an outlet. Overall solid product!
3,I use this for streaming and the light quality is okay. Not the best but it gets you by .
2,I try my best not to create garbage and I have access to taps and tools so imma try to get this one going but come on now
4,Pros:1) Easy to set up2) Multiple angles of light to cancel out shadowsCons:1) Needs a better diffuser; light is almost as harsh as an open bulb2) Yellow is verrry yellow; I‚Äôd hoped it would be more of a ‚Äúwarm white‚Äù
3,I'm pretty confident I could get the same effect with a couple of table lamps. The filers could diffuse the light better shadows behind the subject are still harsh. But these lights are better than having nothing.
3,Save your money. CHEAP!!!
3,Just not what I expected.
5,Soy un streamer nuevo y peque√±o y tiene la calidad y precio que uno necesita para empezar en este mundillo y luchar por nuestros sue√±os ofreciendo una buena calidad de imagen apoyandonos en una buena camara que este al alcance de nuestro bolsillo!!!Hazlo sigue tus sue√±os!
3,Is expensive and it does not work a lot.
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†The pictures make it look bigger.
4,Not bright enough
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I am very pleased with this product. It is very easy to set up and operate. I love that you can adjust the tripod to whatever height you need. It is also great that you have four different color filters to use; White Blue Red and Orange. It is very easy to switch which filter you want. Simply slide the filter out and slide the new one in. Each tripod stand comes with an easy to use remote that allows you to adjust the brightness of the light as shown in my video. I am very excited to use this product for future projects. I definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a light set up for filming or pictures.
2,Bought to do live steaming and shootings but for me it‚Äôs not enough had to buy another one.This is one is more for short distances shootings like make up‚Ä¶
5,Exactly what I expected.  Would like a longer cord.  USB wall plug as an add on bundle would improve the product.
5,‚úîÔ∏èShipped on time‚úîÔ∏èWorks Great‚úîÔ∏èFlexible adjustment height and practicality‚úîÔ∏èWorks great on my live video broadcast!
5,Los tr√≠podes son de muy buena calidad son muy ajustables y vers√°tiles para muchos usos. La luz es muy intensa la posibilidad de cambiar el color es excelente son muy sencillas de utilizar y el precio es buen√≠simo. Muy recomendadas para empezar.
2,Really was hoping they would be better quality but not good at all  lens covers fall of easy they tip over at the slightest bump or wind
5,This product is definitely worth it. Super easy assembly. The stands when I ordered I had thought would be small which wouldn't be an issue fir what I was using it for. However the stands extend to about 5 feet or so. So not only can I use them in my video production I can also use them with my portrait photography as well. The dimming and brightness controls are on point. The color filters are a hard plastic which is a fantastic feature as they will not easily tear or break. Way to go with this product really loving them and can't wait to begin shooting.
5,was on a budget and wanted a way to get good lighting for cheap. had low expectations for these considering how cheap they are but they work phenomenally. I use these for streaming/videos and they light me up well. the red is harsh though other than that it is amazing and easy to use. amazing for its price. 10/10 would recommend
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†I love this light for all my crafting. It's bright easily moves from project to project. So glad I bought it!
2,These are cool for indoor shots with a LOT of light. They are not bright enough to cut out shadow.
5,I purchased to take better pics of clothing I sell online and they work great but I had to buy an extra set for complete lighting.
5,If you need good lighting for a small space the. Look no further. A nice affordable product that works out of the box.
4,The lights are pretty good good brightness very adjustable the only downside for me is the plastic where you adjust it is a little weak just be careful when adjusting
5,I really like the lights for the price. The lights are a little small only a little bigger than my phone but they both can get very bright which makes up for the size. I love how many colors it comes with and how you can adjust the brightness. The only thing I‚Äôm not a fan of is they don‚Äôt come with cords that plug directly into the wall they are just usb cords and you have to have your own wall piece because they don‚Äôt come with one. Other than that I really like them and can‚Äôt wait to use them.
3,The cord is just a little too short
5,This product is really easy to use just adjust the knobs on the side to set up or put away. The tripod that comes with the lights can also be used with a camera making it great for filming content. I would definitely recommend these
5,I have been extremely impressed with these light. Easy assembly great instructions and simple to use.  Because of the way that the lights are made they can be used for many things.Great for photography and video lighting and enhancement.  They include color filters and the brightness is adjustable.They are also perfect to add light to otherwise dark areas as well as for reading.The price for this product is low but the quality of the lights and tri pods is very high.I am going to order more for gifts.  I recommend them highly and was glad to find them
5,Love the brightness and how easy to use it is. But you need a power source to plug it.
3,The lighting that I needed will be a little brighter.
5,I can not say enough good things about these lights. When first starting out recording or live streaming the cost add up quickly and as I found out lights can be very expensive. This bundle is perfect for starting out the lights work great and the control over the intensity is not often found on less expensive equipment. The fact you get two lights two stands and films (which are not cheap pieces of paper they are actual thick plastic). Honestly I ordered another set just so I can have a light setup at my PC and at my Painting station and not have to move them.
5,Use for vblog. This set has everything you need as beginner.
5,Got it for my wife as she needed better lighting when teaching virtually. You can connect it via. USB on your computer so no need to have an outlet or an adapter for this piece. Just angle it where your eyes won't see it as it can be a bit blinding at the max setting.
3,Light is ok could not use on the date intended because no where in the title does it mention it‚Äôs a usb plug style . Lots of words in the product title just not the right ones.
5,I m using this as a ‚Äústanding‚Äù lamps for my  children to read write doing homework‚Ä¶. Wherever they are.  It works so well now I own 2 sets (4 of them).  It is so bright to keep my kids away from darkness n prevent wearing eye glasses in the future‚Ä¶ I use it as reading light too!
4,Everything worked as it's supposed too. Very bright lights. Able to power off a cheap battery pack. Tall tripods when extended but small enough to use on my work bench for extra lighting when not using for photos
3,These small lights may be bright enough when pointed directly at a subject but they are not bright enough to bounce off walls for indirect lighting. The main advantage of these lights is their daylight-like non-yellow color.It was possible for me to get brighter lighting by using a half-dome shop light with a clamp and an ordinary household LED bulb having 1500 lumens of brightness and a faint yellow tint. Cost of shop light setup - $14.
2,One of my tripods is not screwing all the way down and needs to be replaced
5,Aun no he usado espero q todo bien llego
3,This has to be for table top only. Not bright enough for what I bought it for but it definitely has its own uses
4,So far so good (Ubeesize warranty hasn't been impressive for their tripod o-ring light; hopefully this will be better if a problem arises)
4,Not super bright good as long as you're relatively close to the lights. Past about 4 feet away you might as well just use a regular lamp.
2,First I am pretty sure I saw a lumens rating on this product when I purchased that was impressive.  Don't see it now so may have been updated.  Next the images you see in this ad show the light against background objects that have been manipulated to make the light panel look larger.  I have used a couple of times as a light weight portable option for interviews using a Sony Nexcam professional level camera.  When lighting a subject you will see about a 3 decibel improvement in lighting.  That is not much.  Effective use is probably lighting a subject with in about 2 to 3 feet max and then they will cook under the heat of the light. Can be useful for back lighting and shadow elimination.  Overall just too weak for any serious work.  Its what you get with two lights for $29.  My low review has mostly to do with the deceptive nature of the marketing images..
3,Joint at the top of one of the stands was broken.
4,Set your expectations to match the price and you will probably be happy (or at least unsurprised). These are working perfectly the light the green screen behind me for chromakey during streaming and video conferencing.
5,These lights are easy to use and provide great lighting
4,The lights were easy to set up and use. They also have a usb plug in and not a wall plug in so be careful if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for. They were perfect for what I needed which is lights for doing videos.
5,Perrfectttt like i bought these lights as a add on to my home photoshoot studio for my online boutique and I am impressed! I was wondering could I sue since the lights hit me right in the eye when I cut the switch on lol that was shockingly painful but shows me that those lights work. Oh yes how can I forget the colorful shades I loveee those so much it literally changed the lights I was so impressed by that.
5,Easy to set up. Don't take too much space. The lighting is perfect for what I want it. It's perfect. And you can't beat the price.
5,They‚Äôre a bit flimsy but definitely worth it if you‚Äôre just using them for personal pictures and such I‚Äôm sure could be put to better use by a better photographer
5,Probably the cable look too fragile but even tho it work great !
4,El producto se ve en buen estado aun no lo pongo a funcionar pero no llegaron los filtros que tengo que hacer?
5,We bought these for our church videos. So much better than the ring light that makes people's eyes look possessed. We use them off to the sides a bit to even out the shadows.These run on regular USB phone chargers or a battery pack if you don't have a handy power source. Very versatile. I've used mine as music stand lights reading lamps extra light at the sewing machine etc. I may buy more for the car emergency kits.
5,I purchased these lights to supplement the natural lighting in my office when streaming. great selection of colors and easy to setup which makes for a great experience. 100% would buy again if i needed to get more lights! Also the hight on them is great for setting up on my desk or next to it!
5,Lights are easy to set up. Brightness is adjustable but I have not tried color inserts. Tripods are a good height to use and height is adjustable to use from the floor or from the desktop.
5,I was looking for good budget lighting and im impressed you get 2 lights for $40 and it's definitely worth it. Works well and is cheap.
5,Great product for the price.
5,They definitely do a good job of lighting up a small space! Very worth it! The colors are very nice and you can definitely see a difference!
5,I've only had them for a couple of days.. but they are SUPER bright they work very VERY well..I was a little hesitant at first (because of the price). HOWEVER!With that being said these are absolutely WORTH the money if you're on the fence.. BUY THEM! you WILL NOT regret it! they're plug and play.  the little color filters they give you are great!the bang for your buck is incredible with these!
5,I have really liked my LED Video Light with 51‚Äù Adjustable Tripod Stand Kit. I am using it for workplace projects. We are expanding our internal marketing capabilities through photography & videography so we are creating our own studio space. These lights have done a great job so far meeting our lighting needs to keep our subjects (people & products) well lit. I would recommend getting these. They aren't huge but they will do the job in a smaller environment.
5,Love this light kit. I am photographing small products for a future web site.
5,Arrived when it said it would Love the tripod and versatility. If you leave them plugged in they do remember the settings and the filters are a very nice addition.
5,For this product being as cheap as it is I definitely wasn‚Äôt expecting such a good quality! not only is the lighting vibrant but being able to adjust into any height in angle is such a bonus! Highly recommended!
5,really like that the lights have tripods and will run on my phone battery packs. Runs almost 3 hours on a battery pack or plug it in the usb on the computer and it probably runs all day. I generally only use for 1.5 hours or so at a time.
5,Great for lighting if you are trying to do video content. It's very easy to put together.
4,i love the lights made a big difference for the project im working on but my only issue is the blue filter doesnt showe in blue but more white over all for the price it is really a cool device
5,This is a great product that works well for additional lighting. The leds are very bright and its a nice addition that extra colored gels are included with lights.
5,The tripods safe very durable and sturdy. I‚Äôm not a proficient photographer by any means but I can definitely see the impact on picture quality with the lighting. I like that these lights are portable and way to set up and use. It will take some creativity to use when an outlet not available to plug these in or your computer is not at full charge. Otherwise this is a solid tool.
4,Stands are good. Lights them self are cheap but bright as hell. Happy with them
3,Not as sturdy as I thought it would be. The light was not strong enough for what I was trying to do. The connections were not properly made.
5,For the price it is an awesome light! And the filters work great!
4,Una de ella alumbra menos.
5,The product was easy to assemble and gave off enough light for my projects. The price was not bad either. I love that you can change the lights to different colors
5,This product is good quality. It comes with multiple lighting colors and has a really easy set up. The lights are very bright. The only con if you can call it that is that It uses a usb for its power source but doesn‚Äôt come with the wall adapter. Other than that this product is really nice.
4,It's a good product if a little limited in its lighting ability.  Good value for your money.
4,Great value for the money. It will make my zoom meetings look crisp for sure!
5,My son loves it
5,Just get it!
5,It was perfect for what I needed and allowed for photos and videos to be twken
5,I LOVE THIS! The package comes in set of 2. So you can get lighting from more than just one angle. I love the levels of brightness it gives you. The tripods can stand very tall and short so that‚Äôs a plus as well! I love the color options of a light blue tint red white and orange. Highly recommend for photographers and videographers!!!
3,The order was missing one ball head and BOTH of the light stands making both of the lights essentially useless. The lights themselves are amazing but I have nothing to stand them on for my show. Really disappointed because if everything came with it they would have been perfect.
5,With these you don't have to sweat it out in a photo session.
2,First the stands are flimsy and tip over very very easily. Second the USB cords are short and when having to adjust the computer or lighting it pulls the stands over. The lights are bright and can be softened or less bright. The color inserts slide in and stay put very well.
4,Serves the purpose. you can use it for multiple jobs
5,Buena
4,Monitors are kind of small great value though.
5,Fast shipping and product as described. Couldn't be happier. Thank you.
5,These lights were easy to set up and use. The filters provided are great! With Filters I can actually point light toward me unlike others are returned. My only con is I would also like a plug-in option in addition w USB but that‚Äôs an easy fix Would definitely recommend!
5,Great quality for the Price. The filters are nice hard plastic and not flimsy at all. I like that you can power these lights off of a usb power bank wall plug or any USB port on your notebook/PC. The stands are decent quality as well. The base is sturdy.
5,Used it for a photo shoot & it gave great light. Even the photographer was impressed & chose it over the ring light. Since it comes with two lights for the price of one it's one of the best deals out there.
5,These are so lightweight easy to use & put off great light. As a Commercial Photographer it was important for me to have something that is easy to carry around with the rest of my equipment. These are compact enough to fit into my backpack.
2,Lights are WAY smaller than I thought
5,Very cool little lights camera pics up on everything now!
5,Perfect for video conference calls. Small and compact and easy to set up!
1,The light is bright enough for my need. However it is made of very cheap material. The head knob broke while assembling. I am not sure if it will even last a month. I am just returning it.
5,These lights work very good for lighting up items to resell and are super easy to use.
5,The reviews are spot on for these lights. They‚Äôre light-weight easy to assemble project low to high light levels include quality filters and are easily unassembled for compact storage. They light up my older photo tent for product shots perfectly. Great value! I‚Äôm very pleased.
1,The material for the mounts for these lights seem cheap and thin. I would say not the expect these to last.Buyer beware this might work for a little while but with something this cheaply made its possible it may break after the return window has lapsed
2,I‚Äôm not satisfied
3,These are not very bright lights. The cords are not very long either which makes using them inconvenient at times. I do not recommend these lights.
5,Si quieres empesar un canal o necesitas luces est√°s tienen buen presio y son suficientesYo les cambio los filtros de diferentes colores fenomeno da un vistazo en mi canal ministerio de ense√±anza gracia y paz
5,I have several products by this vendor. All perfect for what I need it for.
5,S√∫per practico y hace excelente funci√≥n
5,My daughter loves it!
5,Customer service from UBeesize has been outstanding. They were super helpful very communicative and helped with getting a replacement for the light that came with a defect. Not the first UBeesize product I‚Äôve bought and definitely not the last!
3,cheap. not what I was looking for.
4,easy to use
5,El producto se ve de muy buena calidad. Cumple con lo prometido tiene 10 modos de iluminaci√≥n y las paletas de color son de mucha utilidad. En cuanto a los vendedores ninguna queja todo en orden buena presentaci√≥n.
5,Very Bright and effective great for zoom calls in low light rooms as well as photoshoot. If you're just starting out your career as a YouTuber and don't want to spend all of your money on a light that's stupid expensive. I recommend you try this light set up.
5,I needed good lighting for taking photos of my artwork. I gave this product a try and am very happy with it. Easy to set up and adjust. Can't believe it's so inexpensive!
3,They‚Äôre really cheap light and the usb chord is short so it‚Äôs hard to get an extension chord for it
1,The lights are bright‚Äîin fact too bright for most applications‚Äîand the dimmer switches are broken so one has to cover the lights with cloth to tone them down. Not a very reliable solution.
2,I do not recommend for a pro photographer but if you are just looking to add a bit of brightness to your photo I guess its ok. However I don't recommend at all!
5,The light is good!
2,this came with missing and broken pieces i sent it back.
1,Did NOT get the LED lights at ALL. Box is too big. my order looks opened and used.
5,I bought this set for my Facebook Lives. It gives the right amount of light and no shadows. My Facebook Lives look so much better now.
1,The lighting was decent when they both worked. One light stopped working a couple months after I got them. It was the wire. I went to move the light to see what was going on and I noticed if the wire was jiggled a certain way it would briefly turn on. I keep the lights in the same spot at my photography station. They don‚Äôt get banged around or moved a lot or anything like that. So I‚Äôm guessing it came with a crummy wire and now I‚Äôm down to one light for my product photos. When I replace them I‚Äôm going with a different brand. I understand you get what you pay for but it should have worked for more than a couple of months.
5,These lights are very bright easy to use and serves our  purpose of lighting up for Zoom meets.  They are of high quality especially for the price.  I‚Äôm very happy with this purchase!
5,I was able to use these lights for different purposes.
5,For being so small they do produce a very bright light ! Recommend for the money and quality
5,These are handy and bright! They did a great job of illuminating what I needed! I love the versatility and look forward to playing around with them in different configurations.
5,Exactly what I needed and expected.  Made my own personal green screen studio with light on a budget.  Looks nice work great and not bulky clunky or cluttered..
5,Easy to use and the lights are great and bright!
2,I recently purchased the set while they were on sale and I still feel like i way over paid for them. The lights are not that bright and everything on them is cheap light weight plastic. if you‚Äôre just looking for a cheap light set you‚Äôll need 3 sets at least to get anything remotely usable for video and photography
5,Es una opcion interesante el brilo no es muy alto pero para usarlo en un escritobio va genial.
5,I love this product. It was so easy to set up and it is sturdy. I like the adjustable length. Easy to store away as well. You simply can't go wrong. Value for $$$ amazing!
1,The worst item I have bought it‚Äôs not bright at all the lighting sucks I was only sent one instead of 2I give it a big fat 0
5,This is a great product.  I only setup one and even that gave the light needed.  The color filters were perfect addition.  Quick and easy setup to use.
5,The light is very bright but the orange and blue aren‚Äôt as saturated as I thought they would be but still a great set of light for the price.
5,Most definitely will recommend this to people who love lightingwant to stream or just to make a tiktok! Wonderful product
5,
3,The lights are really small don't really know what you would use them for didn't work for me so I ended up returning them.
5,I was pleasantly surprised with the overall quality and features since I wasn't expecting such a high quality product at such a low price.
5,They work great and easy to maneuver
5,Not bulky and work great for my needs I use them behindy camera for live streaming
5,Value of moneyEasy to useIt versatile because the tripod can also be use as phone stand/ light Weight camera holder
5,Es un producto solido las bases tienen buenos acabados las luces son super poderosas y el precio es el mejor del mercado 100% recomendado!!
5,Lighting is awesome love the adjustment options to keep it short or make them taller. Definitely worth the price.
5,These are nice heavy duty lights that extend to 5'. I am very happy with the promptness of delivery and with the quality of the product
5,Purchased based on another review about the performance of the lights. Recieved my purchase very fast tested the lights and am very pleased.
3,Easy to use. Not the longest cords. Also after 4 uses one of them broke on one of the rod levels and won‚Äôt adjust.
5,Great product
5,Gets the job done! Love the changeable light filters. Gonna use for filming and photography.**Short stand but not a big issue.
5,Amazing product! Do the work!
5,This product is amazing and for the price! I thought it was only 1 light stand turns out its 2! Im so excited!!!!
3,For the price I paid I‚Äôm not upset about the investment but these aren‚Äôt what I expected.
5,Very easy to put together. I love the fact that it gives you color options!
2,The lighting is harsh and fluorescent. Not flattering at all for photography.
5,I was so happy to find lighting that is easy to transport and has a tall tripod. Also a great price!
5,This is my first set of external lighting and I love it. It really will make a difference in your pictures!
3,No es muy buena calidad pero us√°ndolos correctamente son buena inversi√≥n!
5,Super easy to set up and goes pretty high. Nice and bright. Great value for the money
5,Very nice product for the price. It eliminates the shadows and reflections on old photos. Highly recommend it!
5,Small lamps but very bright. You can use lamps with or without stands. I am happy with my purchase.
5,So far so good with the lights.  Still getting used to using them.
5,Great lighting system. Used for a video shoot
5,The light our very bright I only have to use one and I‚Äôm fine
2,Cheaply made
5,Lightweight easy to maneuver and bright. I wish it came with a plug or an option to add it.
5,They came right away and they were exactly what I was looking for!!!
3,The light works great and it‚Äôs sturdy. The colors are hardly visible.
5,The lights work well and they came on time with no drama
5,This light is better then I thought they‚Äôre also very bright but can be adjusted
5,It‚Äôs well worth the money and although the sturdiness is a bit loose in one part I love it!
5,This was such a great find! I‚Äôm enjoying this light setup for alternative to professional lighting. Recommend!
5,La luz difuminada es excelente tiene filtros de varios colores
5,love them!!! so easy to use and the lights are pretty good.
5,Super nice lights and perfect for what I needed to use them for!
5,Very versatile I‚Äôve been using this for streaming and photography and it‚Äôs perfect.
5,Great bargain and the lights work great! Exactly what I needed and was looking for!
5,Worth the money. Amazing tripod quality. Sturdy. Bright. Even the filters are quality.
3,Wish they came with the usb plug ins
2,The stands are way too short and extremely difficult to open.
5,Esta incre√≠ble es m√°s de lo q esperaba alumbra bastante es excelente
5,Love it exactly what I needed for streaming
5,They work well for my home office!
5,Works great to take product pictures. Exactly what I bought it for!
2,There is a reason there is no lumen number listed: these arent very bright at all.  I'm very disappointed.
5,Very pleased with the quality for the price.
5,These lights are perfect for what I needed them for
5,Easy to use. Nice light. Compact
5,Using it for background fill light. Nice to have their own tripods.
5,Easy to use and great quality. I am pleased with my purchase.
2,The light isn‚Äôt as bright as I thought it would be. Could be used for very small areas.
5,Very sturdy! The lighting is great. Happy with the product
5,Live everything about them
5,Great product
5,I love it very sturdy light weight and easy to assemble.
1,I am a content creator on tiktok with over 480000 followers and am constantly making videos so obviously I would need lighting equipment.This product is so unresponsive and constantly doesn‚Äôt work I will plug it in with multiple different blocks and it still won‚Äôt power up. It only powers up when the cord is bent a certain way or just randomly works. So unreliable and annoying. Never in my life will I buy from this company again and I recommend you all don‚Äôt either. So disappointed.
5,Perfect for a simple startup kit. Works as expected.
5,no issues arrived fast worked fine.
2,Everything was fine for the first couple of times I used these lights. Then one of them randomly went out on me and never turned back on. These are cheap but unreliable
5,Good product overall easy to set up would definitely recommend
5,Very bright for being so little
2,Stands are nice quality. the lights are 4" x 6" . Dim junk. Not bright pretty much worthless
5,recomendado el nivel de brillo que da es excelente
5,Can adjust lighting and makes pictures pop.
1,The best way to describe it is.. you basically get the childrens play set version of what you‚Äôre expecting. The photos don‚Äôt match what you actually get. & for me they don‚Äôt light up the way I expected them to. They‚Äôd have to be really close to you to light up the way they look on the product pics. They also don‚Äôt come with the box thingy to plug into just the usb cord so that‚Äôs annoying too. My iPhone 13 is bigger than the actual light :/
5,I dislike it was smaller than I figured
1,Just received this UBeesize LED Video light kit about 20 minutes ago. It was $40 so I wasn't expecting the world however upon opening the box the plastic packaging inside was already ripped open. There were pieces missing scratches and the cords were wrapped around the lights and the color gels were already in the lights as though someone had been using it. In addition the cords were coming apart near the controls. I haven't even plugged it in I'm just going to return it to be exchanged for one that is new. I will post an update once I receive new product.
5,Great product
2,Very cheaply made was missing parts but was wtill usable definitely  I decent starting setup
1,There seems to be inconsistencies in product quality.  One light was nice and bright the other is only half as bright and both are set to their full brightness settings.  I cannot recommend as you may or may not get good lights.  There appears to be serious quality control issues here.
5,Great lights for shop while recording work.
5,Works as described. An excellent value!
5,These put out great light!
5,Works great!
5,Very nice for indoor photography. Good value.
1,I really wanted this product to work because it's light and doesn't take up much space. It failed big time and I had to return it.
5,Awesome product! Love it
2,I have to use both of them for the regular light to be bright enough
5,
5,They do the job
1,Didn‚Äôt receive many of the parts included. I did not receive light filter or light for that matter. Just the stands and bolts
2,The lights work but that‚Äôs it the stand is flimsy and falls over in the slightest breeze. The legs are pointless and don‚Äôt even hold it steady which is important if you need the lighting to stay in place.
2,The light stands fell apart on the first use
1,I bought two of these They do provide appropriate brightness for video shoots But they can't be used for hours as they over heat and shut after few minutes. Need to disconnect let the socket came back to room temperature and then connect them again :(
5,Very cool
5,Great value!
5,Amazing
5,Good lights
2,Isn‚Äôt as bright as they say. Stand is sturdy so I‚Äôll keep them for maybe an accent light. I wanted these for backlights and they can‚Äôt even do that.
2,These stands were opened gently because I was demonstrating how if you use too much force you can break stands.The first time I loosened the stand the wing nut broke off completely...
1,UPDATED:  After no response from the seller and very little help from Amazon I conducted a full return of this defective product.  Buyer beware.*****While one of the lights works fine the other is defective and won't allow me to select a lower setting as advertised.  After multiple attempts to contact the seller I have not received a response.  I will update my review should that change.
1,It‚Äôs cheap was very disappointed
2,We received the item Wednesday. Hooked it up Thursday. Today one light doesn‚Äôt even work.
1,Rome 2-3 after first use. Very poorly made
1,After a week of using it one of the lights do not work any more.  It will turn on for 3-4 seconds and then completely shut off. Cheaply made
1,Sent it back the next day. Didn‚Äôt do anything for my photos. And the colors make for a cheap aesthetic
2,These lights are very cheaply made very poor quality easy to break or damage. They are not worth the money.
1,what a joke!. 60-watt bulb equivalent maybe I need to pour light on my green screen. this lighting was to be supplemental for my setup. nope. it is time to go back to clamp lights with 100-watt bulbs and find some way to position them. jeez. do I have to buy another light kit? I am returning this.
2,The base is too narrow and do it tips over easily.  Very dim lighting. The price is good though.
1,Parts are cheaply made and one of the ball heads came broken.
1,One of the tripods has a rusted screw!  Looks like it was wet when the cap was put on.  The other one looks okay but now I‚Äôm wondering how this happened and whether I should return both!
1,My flashlights have better light than this!
1,Both lights stopped working within 3 months of purchase. I originally thought they were great for the price but now I have to buy new ones. Purchase better lights from somewhere else.
1,This product was very inexpensive. I returned the lights as they were toy quality. You get what you pay for.
1,I expected too much from these the cords were too short the lights not bright enough the color shades are hard to change. You‚Äôre better off spending more on a quality light.
1,I thought it was much bigger and one of the lights broke during my first photo shoot. I looked at the core and saw that the wires were showing. Cheap product.
1,The lights are not very bright; the color filters do not result in very much color
1,I purchased  these lights based on the great reviews and the price-point. Unfortunately it's 6 days later and one of them already doesn't work. Pretty bummed - what a waste...
1,i just opened the product because it was a christmas gift for my brother and this is how it came
1,DO NOT BUY! at first it seemed like a great buy however within the second time of me trying to use the lights it broke in half.... Very cheaply made and did not work as expected
1,Do Not Buy!! Horrible lights . They do not work right . They keep turning off in middle of photo session . Super annoying and frustrating
1,The material and the structure Is very light and does not stand firm.  The wire is short and the light is dim.
1,The cable snapped and didn't work again. Then the something happened to the other one and they end up in the trash.
1,Best to invest in nicer lights these didn‚Äôt do much. Returning
1,A la semana de usarlo se me da√±√≥.Nefasto es mejor no comprar.
1,They barely give any light
1,Did not do work for me. Not bright enough with too lights.
1,the stand broke the first day the lights are smaller than you think but they are bright. very cheap and feel like they will brake by just touching them.
1,One lamp broke after first use. I have only had these for 2 months. Very cheap. Tripod also does not tilt up/down.
1,This was clearly used and opened. I‚Äôm returning it tomorrow.
1,One light died after second use. Filter are useless
5,Light weight and easy to assemble. Lights are better then I imagined. I'm happy with my purchase. I recommend this product.
5,Es mucho m√°s peque√±os de lo que parecen pero la potencia de luz que da es fenomenal sale el dicho tel tama√±o no importa muy buenos
5,Really nice and compact lights perfect for filming in college settings
5,Love the quality of the lights are amazing. Easy to set up and very easy to use. Will be great for my product photos
5,Excellent options included.
5,Great light! Highly recommend!
4,The lights are smaller than they seem to be in the images online but so far they do the trick. I do wish they had more usability for the colors to combine rather than using as one solid color and that a power adapter was supplied but overall solid purchase.
5,These lights are really useful and they didn‚Äôt burn out when I use them and they do turn on with my little battery packs because the last ones I bought wouldn‚Äôt do that and I love that you can change the brightness on it and actually go pretty high and pretty low if you need Changing the color isn‚Äôt super hard either it‚Äôs not like my other ones
5,This LED lights are perfect for streaming web content. I use these in front of me when I do my live streams on twitch. the adjustable brightness feature is a great feature. they are just the right size and pretty compact. I can set them up anywhere. would definitely recommend anyone doing live streaming to get this item.
5,Perfect.  Lights are bright and very sturdy.  Great deal for the price
1,Scratched my floors badly. Light doesn‚Äôt do anything at all
5,Excelente. Liviano compacto. Bien empacado. Muy √∫til
5,These lights were just what I needed and at the price I was willing to spend. Very impressed at how high the small tripods go and they put out a great amount of light for the price.
5,I am new to video production and saw these for a great price. I'm glad I got them....really took the "old hag" look right off my face. Thankfully!!! Easy to put together and use.
5,These are compact lightweight and can be packed up to travel with you. They have different color films to cover the light for a filtered look which is fun.I use them for my pet photo shoots where I just need that little extra light and they work great.Only thing is mine didn‚Äôt come with usb plug ins for the wall... not sure if it was just my order that was missing them but I‚Äôd just keep in mind you might need them!
1,No instructions which is fine. Doesn't take a rocket science to set up. However it doesn't work at all!
5,Used these lights for a photo booth at a graduation party. Excellent product! Compact storage.
5,Muy bueno mejor de lo que espere excelente calidad potente la luz
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I usually don‚Äôt leave reviews often but the quality is amazing! I posted a video showing how it looks on versus normal lighting with it off.
5,So it‚Äôs like this. You‚Äôre just starting out in video and photography and you needs lights you can easily drag about the house that give enough light to use for your photoshoot.So yes these feel a bit dollar store cheap but they put out some great light and as a set of lights you‚Äôd want in a starters kit then these are the ones! If you hate them in a few years and buy the expensive stuff no big deal. If you decide to quit- these are easily passed on to someone else. Either way I should get a good run out of them and the different color screens are a nice touch.I really like them.You can spend as much as you want in lighting but these make it so beginners don‚Äôt have to invest a ton of money for something they may not be doing next year.Worth the price.
5,Works great no issues
5,I bought these for my husbands streaming set up and he loves them! Super versatile and easy to move around. The brightness is so nice I even sneak in his gaming room to do my makeup 10/10 would recommend
5,I bought these to provide some better lighting during Zoom meetings. They are easy to use and adjust the height and angle of the light. A very good value.
5,It‚Äôs better than I expected. It‚Äôs simple to put together and light enough to travel with. I love the versatility in using it for photos or videos. & I get a free gift for activating the warranty! Thank you!
5,These work great in my home studio.
5,amazing tripods. very sturdy. great height to. lights are bright. very happy with purchase.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†Love this product!  It‚Äôs at a great price and provides a really bright light that you can adjust.  Great Value and warmth!  Would recommend this to anyone needing lighting when taking pictures of any type.
5,Easy to use
5,I was skeptical but gave them a chance. Surprising. Two lights tripods and filters! Lightweight feels like they will last. I hate junky products...but this is just lightweight...NOT junky.
5,I am in no way a professional but I bought these for a photography project and hobby use. They have worked amazingly! I am able to lift them with one arm if I need to adjust lighting while using my camera. I was surprised to find out they didn't have a plug but I have a power bank and extra plugs. I can unscrew them and take them with me anywhere if needed. For what I needed them for and the price I thought they were a great purchase overall.
5,Set up the lights in a normally dark area that is hard to film in and they worked great possible new filming location.  The added filters and the adjustable tripod and light control make this an awesome option.Feels heavy duty and should last for a long time
5,Impressive lights and sturdy stands. It was a pleasure to use
4,Easy to put together. Came with 2 sets of 5 different colored screens to change light color ‚Äî white yellow blue orange and red. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù and it raised up to a couple inches shorter than my height. Doesn‚Äôt require batteries but you will need 2 adapters (1 for each light) to plug into the wall for it to work. Lights are not very bright so they‚Äôll work best in a very dark room. Pictures came out well! I feel the product was a little pricey though.
5,These lights were extremely easy to use. The set up was effortless and the lights and all the pieces are of great quality. The different color attachments were lovely because you could change the light to almost any color and instantly change the mood of the whole shoot. Being able to adjust the intensity was wonderful as it allowed maximum control. I also kept them on for several hours straight and they didn't seem to get too hot. These are the best lights ever!!
5,Easy to set up great value
5,it is everything i needed it really helped to lighten up the place.
5,Great for my meetings or photography shoots
5,I use these to film my nail YouTube videos at night and these lights make it appear to be daytime. I'm shocked at the price.
5,Muy bueno y muy facil de instalar
5,Nice lights work perfect for what I need selling stuff online.
5,Na
5,The best product I have bought so far
5,Just unboxed the set. They were well packed & they got here 2 days early!Seem to be well made. Feel solid. Wires feel good & seem to be secured well.Stands have a good feel to them also.I'm headed out for a trip South and they will be used on this trip. When I get back I'll update this with actual use information.
5,Awesome product! These little lights really shine bright. I needed new back lights for filming and made my videos come out crispy clear. Also great for taking selfies!
5,So far so good! great solid lighting for photography and great as work lights. They are light and convenient to carry and stand very stable on the ground.
5,Very bright and worth every penny. You will get amazing lighting for this price along with choices of colors. Love it
5,Strong and powerful and the best thing is that it uses usb.Very good quality product.
5,Love it! Works perfect! Would love to review more on my Instagram and YouTube where I have a 14k reach across my platform.
5,I love how tall the tripod is and how easy it is to set up. Very bright lights and compatible with my portable charger on the go. I‚Äôm not a HUGE fan of the colors though.
5,love the lights. They are small yet just the right size.
5,Works great for what it‚Äôs advertised for. Uses usb plugs to power. Top heavy when extended- easily tipped over
5,These are sooooo worth the price. I use them for newborn/children photos indoors with props an does perfect for that!
5,It works perfectly
4,They are quite small and that can be good to some people. Since the LED rectangle measures 15.6 x 3.7 in this means there isn't much space for the lights to diffuse therefore the light that is emitted is concentrated and they basically work like two lightbulbs that emit light on one direction so even with the filters they don't create a hue it's more like a fixed colored spot. They are very bright to the point that it can cause a headache if you stare at it a couple seconds so in most situations I don't crank up the brightness level. My only small complain is that the position of the controller in the cable is way too low a little higher would make it more confortable to manage other than that performance brightness and quality is on point.
5,Great for the money! Easy to set up!
3,These provided lighting but not adequate lighting for the photos. Also I had to find charging blocks to plug them into as there were none in the box. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend purchasing these.
5,The color gels can't decide whether they want to be a diffuser or a gel and fail at doing either effectively.To get better diffusion I just use some diffusion fabric over it bare and for better color I use DIY color gels made from plastic folders.Other than that the tripods are pretty versatile so I use them for more than just lights.The lights themselves are dimmable which is very important.Plus they don't get hot and run on USB which lets me connect them to battery packs easily.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                              ¬†Justo lo que necesitaba trabajo video de cosm√©ticos y dem√°s üòä son luces muy libianas y pr√°cticas kas te comiendo totalmente
5,Still new to this  but I am liking what I see so far.
5,Very happy with these lights. Great price. I like that it can be extended to almost 5 ft or lowered to sit on a table top. The fact that it‚Äôs dimmable is also great. Works very well. Love it.
5,This product was definitely worth the money! It came with different colors for the lights and was very sturdy. Would definitely recommend
4,This is a great lighting option for the price because it does the job well and is super versatile and light. USB power source combined with the small size and light weight of it means you can pretty much bring it anywhere and make use of it. Mine came with a small flaw and annoyance where there was melted plastic on one of the screws which makes one of the lights slightly tilted when screwed on. I'm pretty confident that I could remove the melted plastic off the screw with a knife but because I'm forced to do that I think my review of it deserves one star less.
5,I was amazed how bright these lights were! We used them outside and our pictures came out great! Definitely recommend this product!
5,Arrived quickly seem to be of decent quality.  Tripods stand level with no wobble.  Lights are much brighter than I expected.  Very pleased with the quality and especially the price of these lights.
5,These lights are amazing!! You should get them. I use them to take pictures and to do my makeup.
4,Lights are good cords are not very long nor did they come with the wall adapters.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†My uncle bought another one which offered 3 of these lights with almost everything same but he got that for those paid free reviews i actually bought this one and i can say it's way better than the one he got for free and the way you insert the interchangeable slots are so much sturdier and vibrant.
5,I use these lights for Live Streaming. They work GREAT for me and what I do. I have no complaints. Been using them about 3 days. I like all the color slides. Seem to be good plastic so far. Lights can go full bright or dim which ever you want. I have one brighter than the other one to balance. I have no complaints about this product. Thanks again.
5,They're pretty bright come with mounts that that swivels and are very easy to use.
5,good lighting system for the money
5,Helps my job as a teacher.  Great lighting.
4,Let their be light!
5,These lights/ tripod may be the best purchase I‚Äôve made these year for my nail care business Adorned Studio Nails (ig @adornedstudionails). I mainly use the tripod with a attachment piece that holds my phone to take steady photos. The lights are awesome for taking photos at night or windowless rooms. Being able to change the brightness of the lights really helps a lot to not give harsh lines in photos and videos
5,Would buy 2 sets to adjust for more dynamic lighting situations. Otherwise these are great value for the price.
1,Pens√© que la luz era suficiente para poder hacer mis fotos en casa pero no alumbran lo necesario. Estaba muy decepcionada con estas luces y decid√≠ cambiarlas por unas mejores un poco m√°s cara pero valea pena si quieres un buen trabajo
4,These are Great for making YouTube videos. Very bright and seem more expensive then they are.
5,These are awesome! We even used them camping. As long as you have a live USB port you have light. And colored light! The tripods work great. All around great buy!
5,Excelente calidad y el precio es buen√≠simo las ped√≠ a colombia y llegaron intactas
5,You will see your Future! These are bright! They will light up your life! I had to angle them not to shine directly on me because I didn't want to go blind! But they worked so well lighting up my background!
5,Very good stuff practical Easy to use on the go. Last night I connected these to my laptop usb port very bright light as daytime and clear images and worked for two hours nonstop. Very satisfied I'm ordering more.
4,The set of light does a good job for the price it is sold. Don't expect miracles but to light up small objects it is sufficient. For videos not so much.
5,La iluminaci√≥n LED es mucho m√°s eficiente energ√©ticamente y tambi√©n econ√≥micamente.

3,Compr√© hace como un a√±o las luces m√°s parecidas a estas de Neweer... pens√© que ser√≠an muy parecidas pero con mejores tripi√©s... los tripi√©s s√≠ son mejorcitos aunque siguen siendo "chaparritos" pero la intensidad de la luz es quiz√°s la mitad de las Neweer... a mi me sirven para el uso que les voy a dar pero no la recomendar√≠a como para ser la luz principal si vas a grabarte en un espacio cerrado. Adem√°s la altura del tripi√© no da como para grabarte de pie.
2,La intensidad deja mucho que desear solo pueden ser utilizadas para eliminar algunas sombras. Lo √∫nico que me gusto fueron los 2 tripi√©s que vienen incluidos pero ni siquiera te incluyen una bolsa para almacenarlos.Devolver√≠a el producto si no fuera porque los tripi√©s le quedaron muy bien a un palo de luz marca Muzaka que si tiene una intensidad y gama de colores (32000) por el mismo precio que pague por este art√≠culo.No entiendo porque en otras rese√±as hablan de buena intensidad.

1,Doesn‚Äôt work properly
5,This product is a great and inexpensive additional tool as I start my journey into food photography.
5,I at first wanted a tripod for some lights I had  but when I saw this deal  I thought it was worth a go.  I am very happy with the lights for the price they are a great deal!  The tripod is sturdy and articulates for controlling the angle for the lights.  The only downside is now finding 2 spare 2A phone chargers - but that was clear in the description.
3,Cheap quality but led are okay
5,Great quality and having the tiered tripod has been so much better than my previous lights which were harder to secure.
1,Pros:-dimmable lights very brightCons:-one of the legs came broken-one of the wires came unattached to the circuit board so I had to open it up and sauder it on myself-the rubber things on the legs came off within a day or so-very very unstable and they take up a lot of space-hard to adjust easy to tip over-after about 1 year of use (they just sit on my desk and I turn them on and off for zoom calls) the wiring on both became very loose and just broke off the circuit boards so now they're useless
5,Works great
2,I returned mine since one of the light controller's plastic encasing came chipped and at first glance it is what you payed for (got these at 38 cad at the time).They are 10w lights each super lightweight and the tripod is made of metal also lightweight.The colouring gels are easy to use and they do a decent job both for video production lighting or used as floodlight. Not good enough if you are using a camera. Webcams and phone cameras should be fine with it.
5,The products feels kinda cheap at the beginning but for the price it does the job correctly. The light is super light and it is bright.I think this is a perfect kit for streamer who will have a permanent lighting setup and for a video maker who would like to have a very portable light.
5,I bought this set of lights to help improve lighting for our video projects and these lights definitely do the job! What I especially like is the various brightness settings which makes it easier to adjust the lights based on how close or we put it from the subject. The tripods are good but can seem a bit top heavy if they're not put on level surface. We've put it on carpet and setting it up felt like it could topple but they stayed put.As other reviewers mentioned the lights are in a plastic housing but that's the case with most ring lights that people use so it's a non-issue unless you're going to take them 'on the road'. All in all a worthwhile purchase if you're looking to get more lights to improve for filming without having to spend a lot or purchase lights that require lots of storage space.
4,Tr√©pied presque inutile trop court.
5,These have been great for my little studio for YouTube videos
5,Me gusto la iluminaci√≥n son pr√°cticas y compactas pero con buenas prestaciones en cuanto a la iluminaci√≥n llegaron muy bien empacadas y bastante r√°pido. Llevo m√°s de un mes de uso y todo bien hasta el momento
1,Cheap plastic light not bright at all. Feel like cheap plastic without any real light output. Box came already opened cardboard destroyed and plastic opened too. I definitely not recommend.
1,The coloured plates are not enough - light appears washed out and just slightly tinted. You need coloured leds for better effect.
3,I was excited to receive the product the lights work well and easy to set up but one of the tripods was loose and I tried to contact the manufacturer but they said contact Amazon and then Amazon said they could only refund and not replace the tripod.I decided not to go ahead because of the time it would take but besides the loose tripod and not being able to replace it everything is fine.
5,Does its job nicely
5,Haven‚Äôt used it a lot yet but looks good
1,The coloured plates are not enough - light appears washed out and just slightly tinted. You need coloured leds for better effect.
5,These are great little lights that pack a punch at their highest setting. The hardware's great quality for the price frankly ‚Äî I've seen other reviews of similarly-priced products complain about cheap plastic. The tripods for these are metal.I bought these for better lighting for teaching meeting and streaming. I have one set up on each side of my dual-monitor set-up.A couple of notes:- The coloured inserts are fun but don't really work to "warm up" the light in a natural way. The colour is quite obvious and should be used with purpose (i.e. if you want to flood something in blue/yellow/red/orange light or some combo). The inserts could be used more subtly if you're in an environment with a similar colour (e.g. using the blue light as a fill if you have a blue backdrop).- The lights aren't especially high ‚Äî 4-foot-something ‚Äî so to put them behind or above an elaborate desktop setup you'd need to mount the USB lights independently of the tripods. As I said I have mine on either side of my monitors and that works fine.- This isn't necessarily a negative but note that the lights are quite small. They work absolutely fine for my purposes but to light a larger area you may need larger lights. Definitely work for Zoom/Twitch/Youtube purposes.If these were more expensive I'd rate them a 4: great but with some limitations (see above). Given their price though these are really a steal.
3,I was excited to receive the product the lights work well and easy to set up but one of the tripods was loose and I tried to contact the manufacturer but they said contact Amazon and then Amazon said they could only refund and not replace the tripod.I decided not to go ahead because of the time it would take but besides the loose tripod and not being able to replace it everything is fine.
5,The height of the 2 LED light kit is accurate and can provide a large range of movement and provide a great range of brightness depending on your needs. For me I uses mid range setting for photo shoots and easily adjust the angle of the LED lights using the ball joint.However if the switch is made closer to the LED box it will be best as I need to bend down to access the buttons on the switch. The switch will touch if its not fully extended. Fully extended its about 12" off the ground. So I coil the excess wire to the last nut so that I don't have to keep bending down.
4,Buena relaci√≥n calidad precio  me funcionan bien para lo que las compr√©
5,Everything looks and works great
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†This light is excellent for filming in low light conditions. It's really bright on the highest setting even with a coloured filter.The filters are easy to change.The light is extremely easy to operate and it only takes a minute to set up the tripod.The pivot bearing makes it really easy to aim this where you need it.I also tried this with a USB battery pack and it worked well so one of these lights is going in my car trunk for emergencies late nights at the beach or the day we're allowed to have family gatherings again.This is an extremely good and versatile light.My only complaint is that the cord is rather short. About 6 feet so you may want a USB extension cord to go with it.
5,I like the product to be honest for the price its highly recommended
4,Using the lights to complement the lights I already have for my light box that I use for product shots. The colored lenses will be a nice addition I think. The LED lights are bright but not as bright as I was hoping but should add to my existing setup. For 50 bucks you should expect an introductory product and for that it delivers.
5,Needed a video light and this was recommended. Very happy with the purchase and love the different colors I get with the light. I've made other purchases from this seller and recommend their product because of their excellent customer service.
5,The LEd lights worked really well. It has multiple sliders to provide different color combinations of the light as well.I mostly use the white/yellow light for my zoom call meetings. It is a great replacement for all the ring light users. :)
1,Both of the cables on each light eventually just tore off. Barely had them for that long
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I have just bought UBeesize LED Video Light Kit 2Pcs but one is not working ! Please watch the video. How can I change a new one while I don't keep a box? Thanks
5,It's great value for money. Would have been better to have a remote to control the power and brightness rather than an attachment to the wires.
5,I‚Äôve had them for about 5 months but only started to use them for 2 months and one had the power cord come apart and show the wires and another one stopped working all together.  I bought two sets of 2 and I‚Äôm really disappointed in the quality.  The light isn‚Äôt bad though. If you want something really bright these aren‚Äôt the lights for you though.
5,Great little tool for a great value
3,I bought 2 of these and 1 of them just stopped working for no reason.  I tried different charging cubes and different outlets and it just won't work.  The other one i bought works fine though.
5,Great sturdy items. Great deal for this price!
5,I love these. They are smaller than in the pictures. The images are a bit deceiving and they should change that. No need to lie if your product is good. Anyway I bought it to light up my home made marble runs and it is great that they are a pair. They did a nice job. Although I bought them for my videoing of my marble runs I use it all the time. It is now beside my bed and I use it to read dim it to watch a movie on my laptop. I am basically using it as a lamp. The adjustable head is great. Puts the light exactly where you need it. They are light and easy to move around. I bought a usb extension cord so I can put them exactly where I need them.
5,Surprisingly good quality. A little wobbly because they're so lightweight but that's manageable. Best for localized lighting close to the subject as they are small and have narrow lightspans. Not the best for portraits but perfect for selfies and small product photography. Work well on a desktop or work surface for task lighting. All in all quite versatile and well worth the money.
1,So disappointed in this product. used it once for about 20 minutes. When  I went to go use it a second time it wouldn't turn on. Don't waste your money on this. Wish I could return
1,Quality of light is not good not bright
5,Awesome product what I expected
1,They do not give enough light and build with the worst quality plastic.  Returned them.  Stay away!!
5,Worked great for my product photography class! Great little lights with great brightness!
5,Fast shipping and really easy set-up! Works right out of the box. I like the different colour shades offered for different moods. I think it's a great addition to my streaming set-up as a DJ
4,Pour ajouter un √©clairage lors de cours en ligne sur zoom. Lorsque je suis √©loign√©e de ma web cam la lumi√®re aide beaucoup
5,This package contains 2 lights 2 stands and some colour filters. The built quality is average and made out of plastic. The stands are metal yet they are lightweight and easy to transport. The package also includes two small ballheads which allows you to points the lights in any direction. The lights are fairly bright and have 4 different intensity settings. these lights are great for blogging and online meetings were you would like to have proper lighting. The lights are not the brightest for portrait shoots unless you can plant them fairly close to your subject. Overall I am happy with them these lights and a battery bank allows me to set up my blogging video anywhere I want.
1,This could be a good thing for specific purposes but is definitely not good for iluminating a background. :(
5,The work lights work quite well unfortunately are very very light weight so topple over easily yeah
5,Fast delivery great product!
1,Stands a bit unstable even when folded out cheap quality
5,Looks good
5,Recommend +++++very good quality satisfied:)
5,fast shipping excellent product
5,Very bright
5,This is a great choice for DIY photography lights as they are very light and easy to be adjusted in height and angles.The best thing is it's not a single light and you can create a focussed room for the photography or for brightening up the area as they are very bright and you can change to multiple colors with filters blue yellow orange red and white.Tripods are versatile and can reach up from 23.62" to 57.68" and can also be used for cameras or any other hinged support devices.These are USB-powered lights and can even be charged with a laptop or portable battery as they have very little consumption due to LED bulbs.Highly recommend the lights due to their excellent quality and price...!!!
2,It's a handy product since I use it for filming auditions while travelling. But it's quite cheaply made and the light temperature is only okay.
5,Fast delivery great product!
4,Simply and quick installation. Improved video quality instantaneously
1,You get what you pay for. Do not bother with this.
5,Buen producto excelente calidad meses de uso y a√∫n funcionando con gran brillo y color uniforme. Lo recomiendo
5,The lights do everything I need them to do for recording myself with my phone. They're small but bright. The tripods aren't amazing quality but at the price it's more than good enough and you can always swap them out for different tripods if you prefer.
2,It‚Äôs certainly light weight and efficient for space saving.You definitely get what you pay for.All of this would have been fine but once I found my own extension cord and extra usb cube I plugged them both in but I still needed to plug in my ring light.I thought to myself ‚Äúthere needs to be a better way‚Äù.My intent is to use this for live fitness classes and all I got was shadows on each side - worse than it was with one ring light.Still good for smaller-use purposes whatever that may be: food blogging or something? But definitely not for live or recorded fitness classes.
1,I bought the Refurbished ones.On the box it says ‚ÄúAmazon Tested‚Äù.However‚Ä¶.. neither lights work!!Unbelievable!  Couldn‚Äôt even test one of them.Will order a new set and test them out.
5,I like the product. I think it's good for the price. Uses USB port which is great.
4,Really great cheap light. Easy to use and can connect via USB so you can easily use it with a battery pack.
4,Use to make videos. Decent light for cheap product.
4,It was smaller than I expected but the light is very good.
5,tr√®s cool j'adore l'ajustement du niveau de lumi√®re
4,Use to make videos. Decent light for cheap product.
4,Son ligeras y port√°tiles pero no iluminan tanto como esperaba.No me arrepiento pero podr√≠an ser mejores
1,After reading all the good comments I ordered one then returned on the same day. This is a cheaply built Made in China Light Kit.  Even on maximum brightness it's still no where near the actual light and brightness we are looking for. Tripod Sticks are sturdy but light boxes are fragile made with very thin plastic. Not worth your money spend little more and get something better and more professional.
4,I use these lights for video conference and youtube video's.  Great value for the price.
5,Love them.. when I‚Äôm showing my jewelry online it‚Äôs absolutely amazing.. great lighting love the different colours that it comes with.. so I can change it up.. love the fact that I can make them table top useable or floor useable.. just a perfect products
5,Amazing lights very bright. Light and portable. Would be better if they come with a carry case
5,Amazing lights
5,One of the extension rod became a little loose but overall the quality and light plates are very good.
4,The mounts are too fragile however the lighting works well for shooting videos.

5,the price is very low
5,Cumple con la funci√≥n y eso es excelente. La altura lo suficiente para alumbrar tanto interior como exterior adem√°s se puede regular la intensidad.
4,Por el costo son muy muy buenas. Los materiales de los tripi√©s son resistentes aunque la carcasa de los Leds no tanto. Est√° bien para rmpezar y tener luces de apoyo.
4,Easy to set up very bright and the colour filters are a lot of fun. I would recommend this if you need 2 sources of light and are looking for a budget option.
5,Fast shipping great product will highly recommend
5,Great
5,My only suggestion would be plugs for the USB ends on the lights
5,I bought this to take a pictures for my jewelry company and it‚Äôs Amazing!
5,Though these are budget items they are fairly decent quality especially when you want a simple solution to provide consistent lighting for (say) a green screen.The stand adjustments are what I would expect and they are stable. I was pleased to see that the lamps attach to a standard screw for photography mounts and this screw is on a good quality "ball" (sorry a better term doesn't come to mind) that provides range of angular adjustment.Each lamp is powered via a standard USB connector. So you either need to hook these to a USB hub or a power bar that has USB ports. Fortunately I already had a power bar with USB ports (that I never imagined I would use until now).Dimming the lights is easy using the buttons next to the on/off switch. For my use I need the lights at max but you have a range of illumination.
5,Great product for a great price !
5,It is good to use. It can change the color of the light.
2,These lights have just been a constant source of frustration for me. They're bright and all but the filters are absolutely useless and barely diffuse at all. You also have to be very careful with extending the stand because the rods pop out extremely easily and it's a nightmare to try and get them back in.
1,Just a little bit of movement the wire got snapped.
5,Loved these are great lights !
4,I make indoor videos for my YouTube channel which just started months ago. I don't want to invest big to get the Professional level of every piece of equipment for the moment and I'm happy to find this affordable one. It's very bright and adjustable. When I shoot I put them both on a table as I'm standing up. This is why I'm giving it only 4 stars as they are a bit short. I'm 5'4" BTW. But overall I'm happy with this product and it's a good starting point for your video shooting as a newbie.
5,decent lights for your bucks
4,Feels really cheap other then that they work well and they are bright. Came quickly.
5,Light is Pretty Bright and works as desired
5,Item that arrived was as described. Good value for the money.
5,Light is Pretty Bright and works as desired
3,There were no instruction manuals. There were no tripods. This renders it completely useless for what I need it for.
5,I needed to light up my desk area and they work great. The adjustable angle is helpful.
3,
3,They work well to fill some background shadows from your flash for photography. But they are no way near as strong as flash lighting. If you put them on your table directly to either side of you while you film from your webcam I would say they are an excellent choice. However for subject matter several feet away I would say they are going to be too weak.
5,Son de buena calidad
5,Cumple con su funci√≥n al 100% y su calidad es impresionante vale lo que cuesta y mejor si lo agarras en promoci√≥n
5,Una maravilla por el dinero que pagas
2,same brightness when plugin 5w and 10w power source.
5,Light is Pretty Bright and works as desired
5,Wow!! Simplement parfait pour diverses situations! Love it.
3,not bright enough
5,Pretty bright tripods are sturdy.  The lights are lightweight and the gels work well!
5,I like that this is so compact and versatile. I didn't need full blown studio lights but needed something to brighten up areas for photos of products I was selling online. These work perfect for me and I can get the light exactly where I need it.
4,Una de las luces prende m√°s que otra
4,These lights are pretty good. The amount of light that they emit seems to be about right and the filters work well. The stands adjust very easily but I think the tripod base could have been a little larger. Overall though they are good lights at a good price. On flat ground the stand bottom shouldn't be an issue either. If the ground is a little uneven you need to be careful since they can tip over easily. I would buy them again
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                              ¬†Excelente producto por un buen precio.
4,Tiene un excelente brillo pero los filtros la verdad es que me decepcionaron un poco est√°n muy feos se atoran a veces al entrar el filtro blanco es bastante transparente as√≠ que no se logra difuminar bien si le hubiesen puesto una l√°mina reflectante de fondo igual y obten√≠a m√°s luminancia por lo que se regresa.
5,Bright lights adjustable height lightweight does a great job.  What else do you want for this price?
5,Arrived exactly as displayed. Easy to put together and worked exactly as described. They are light weight compact and easy to move around if you are looking for versatility for your home studio.
3,The product is ok first i was happy it was so light then i realized it was so light that it felt 2 times in 30min... Also during the day there's no point using it it's not showing at all. Good for a night usage.
5,Good quality for the price and is brighter than I expected!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†This is really good for the price! I tried to capture the light intensity in the video so hopefully it shows how bright it can get. The best thing about this is that you can plug it in on the go because the power cord end is a USB so you can plug it into your computer power bank etc def worth it !
4,Even though this is not a "High End" product it does the job and is decently priced.  The telescopic tripod is really nice however it is prone to tipping over fairly easily.  Bottom line not a professional product but worth the price for the amateur or beginning photographer.
5,Great lights and easy installation. The tripod is really great for multiple purposes. Perfect for adding lighting background or on a subject. I've been using it for zoom calls and basic video production.
5,These have a solid brightness to them so taking photos of food and content in general is made much better as these really light up the product out of the dark. The additional filters are good but you‚Äôll probably only ever use the main white filter. Extremely easy to use if you have a power bank already this will be such a breeze. Just plug them into the power bank and that gives you the mobility to move them around and put them exactly where you want them! Satisfied!
5,Works as expected. I'm glad with the purchase.
1,The lights are okay but the cords are not durable
5,
4,Not as bright. Light part doesnt move so u have to make sure product is on the same height as light. Even after setting lights on opposite sides and product in between shadows are visible because the lights are not very bright.
1,The tightening mechanism is garbage after tightening a second time the gimble metal sheared apart due to poor design and materials. Lights are also not very bright.
5,
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†The UBeesize video light with tripod kit was easy to set up easy to operate easy to change the lens and excellent value. The kit was securely packaged to ensure it arrived in perfect condition. The kit came with 2 light heads with 5 filters for each light head (white blue yellow red orange) and 2 tripods. The tripods were adjustable to accommodate any lighting height or angle that was required. Each light had its own individual USB cable with on/off switch that also allowed the intensity of the light to be adjusted.This is the perfect light kit for anyone starting their video presentation debut or experienced users. I give this product a 5 star review.
5,Son peque√±os pero con buena iluminaci√≥n. Estoy contento
5,the lights have a lot of power and can adjust the intensity
5,The lighting system came in time. As advertised. And I feel it is very sturdy. I am a starting youtuber and this exceeded my expectations. I use one tripod to hold my camera and the other for the light.
5,I used them once and was very pleased with the results. I loaned them to a friend and it lit his live video very nicely.
5,Perfect as described
5,These lights come with a power switch and adjustable brightness.  They include several filters (Red  Yellow Orange and Blue) as well. These are too thick to be used for minor lighting alterations but are great if you need something heavy.Stands are good and very adjustable. Can be used for other things (like mounting cameras or microphones that have a 1/4" screw mount). Only thing to be mindful of is the legs - they aren't very long so don't mount anything too heavy or it'll tip.I use it with a Woohoto cellphone holder a SmallRig 5.5 inch Adjustable Friction Power Articulating Magic Arm that I connect the UBeesize light to a Deity V-Mic D4 Duo and a Samsung S20 FE in a case. It's an extra couple of pounds and it's quite stable.Overall very happy - would recommend. Just don't expect studio quality lighting at this price point.
5,love the portability - use battery pack or plug in to usb chargers just great dimming is perfect colour panels great great ambient light for photos Great Crafting lights
5,I‚Äôm a photographer and was really skeptical about the price. But they are 100% worth it. Definitely need some dark natural light for full effect but these are great!
5,Great product and excellent output. Combine yellow and orange to have a great effect
1,Terrible. Not what is advertised. Pictures are very misleading. These tiny little lights don‚Äôt do anything.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†the lighting was really high quality and the colours was so cute. All my pictures look cute when using it
5,great product! arrived quickly simple set up and excellent quality!
4,The lights have been amazing for product shots videos and video conferences. My only issue with them to date is that the bolts on the tensioners to adjust height appear to become dethreaded quite easily this has left me unable to both keep the legs open and adjust the height as I can't tighten them in place.If bolts could be improved this would be a 10/10 recommendation.
1,No math with included pictures.
2,I expected more output from this size lEDs. It is basically adding some ambient light. Even if you put it on top of the object that you are filming it will not provide you with consistent illumination.
4,The construction is a little cheap (you have to wiggle the colour panels a little to get them in right). But they're fine for indoor photography. Note they are USB powered and do not come with a wall adapter.
4,These lights work very well for small scale photo shoots at an extremely affordable price. They work best close up and with little outside light. Adjustable brightness and 5 color jells for each light is a great addition. I wish the stands could go a little bit higher to reach face level and the plugs only come as USB so I need to use outlet adaptors. Other than that this product is a solid buy for entry level photographers.

2,It‚Äôs a great light source and love the price on this but it
5,Stands are very sturdy. Lights feel cheap but what do you expect for the price. Surprisingly super bright also and the added colour filters are great.
4,The main reason I purchased this product was for the stands... the lights were a "bonus". I needed a couple lightweight stands for putting small cameras on to use throughout my studio and these stands are perfect for that. The lights are good but not as bright as you may think. You won't light up a large area with them but that said I have used them to light up some of my 3D printers while they print and I want to show them on a live or recorded stream. You won't get the 5V USB plugs you need to power them so make sure you have a couple of them on hand or have a power bar with USB ports on it. The only reason it lost one star overall was the brightness of the lights otherwise these are a great purchase.
5,These lights work great! I'm not a video or photography expert. I'm using them to take photos of my drag. I tested taking pictures inside with natural light (from the window) only the room light and these LED lights and the LED lights work almost as well as natural light and much better than the room light. I am very satisfied. The filters are also cool for different artistic colour themes.
5,Placing them is the easiest thing to do. They can take whatever angle you prefer and the lighting is excellent. To do product photography they have helped me a lot. Super recommended. Excellent lamps
5,So far so good. They work great and arrived quick.
5,Very happy.  Works very well for this price.  Thank you
2,It‚Äôs a great light source and love the price on this but it
5,Doit acheter deux cubes pour la brancher au mur
5,Would definitely buy these lights again. Already a button two pairs and definitely would buy more for sure great lights for backing lighting and adding more for the price
5,Very good first impression. Just what I needed. Quality seems very good.
3,Very small. Not powerful lights. Only meant for video bloggers and lighting needs for close up shots or videos for the most part but you get what you pay for. Good for non professional videos at home or YouTubers etc..
5,I love it something different
1,I believe that the seller has recently changed the product as the image online shows that there are 4 extendable parts to the tripod and that it stretches up to 57 inches. However the product I received only has 3 extendable parts and is closer to 36-40 inches long. The image on the website is almost exactly what you get in the instruction manual that comes with the product except this image has removed the 4th part and only has three. For these reasons I believe that the manufacturers have changed the product so that it is much shorter than what is advertised on Amazon.
5,It‚Äôs a simple stand light weight for phone or small camera etc. the LEDs are good
4,Excelente opci√≥n para tomar fotos y videos. El tripi√© esta un poco inestable por lo que le pongo 4 estrellas .
