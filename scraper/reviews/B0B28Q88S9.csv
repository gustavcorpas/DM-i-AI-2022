5,I bought this watch because I was looking for an alternative to a iWatch.  This watched checked all the boxes so I read all the reviews crossed my fingers and purchased.The delivery was speedy and the the directions in the package were easy to understand for the initial set up.I did however struggle with getting my text message notifications to push through. I did a lot of internet searches and read all the trouble shooting solutions and still couldn‚Äôt get it to work.  The app had a customer support tab and they were great in assisting with the problem.I have been wearing the watch for 3 days now and it is definitely worth it‚Äôs money.  The watch is great for keeping track of your heart rate daily fitness and I enjoy the water reminder app for times when I am chasing the kids  in their extracurricular activities and forget to stop and breathe (or in this case drink).  The watch has done well with getting wet and  still functioning.  The call answering function and microphone worked better than I expected.  I was asked several times what I was doing differently while on a call because they said the quality was better than it normally is.  Which surprised me because normally I use Apple  AirPods.Overall great buy for your money!
5,There are pros and cons about this watch but all and all this is one of the better smart watches.Pros ... I like the fact that I can pick my own background.  I like the fact that it reminds me to drink can check my O2 level and breaks down my sleep (it shows light sleep  deep sleep and REM).Cons ... I can't adjust the volume on my watch.  It's not allowing me to turn down the sound when I'm in meetings and it's not allowing me to turn up the sound to listen to my music through my watch.I'm not able to sit in a hot tub or do dishes with my watch on (it says in the instructions not to place in hot water).
5,I can make and answer calls all from my watch!! View text messages email alerts and many other social media notifications. Battery is doing great so far still over 80% after 2 days of constant use . I did have a little bit of trouble getting some things synced and set up but the 24 hour customer service is amazing. Sent me videos with step by step instructions. If you are looking for a smart watch that does it all this will be your new best friend.
5,I‚Äôm glad I bought this watch. I already have Apple Watch which I bought last year and honestly I regret spending money on tht I mean come on why did I spend 400$ on Apple Watch when I could get something that does the job for less then 50$. I bought this one to send to family member overseas and just wanted to try it before I send it. I‚Äôm in love with this watch. I‚Äôm buying another one for my daughter. I totally recommend this watch. Easy to use. Customer service is very helpful.
5,I have  bought  about 6 smat watches  but this  is the BEST so far. It is  user friendly has  a strong  battery and Yes you can  MAKE  and  RECEIVE  calls on it.. I'm  so much  in love  with  the watch have  told  everyone  I know  about  it. Buy it now  and thank me later. No one  is paying  me to write  this and you can  know  by my limited  choice of words
5,When I first thought about purchasing this idem I was saying no this is not going to work right but once I received it and set it up i really do love it  i have a Samsung Galaxy A32 it works great I check my heart & oxygen rate every day as well as how many steps I do everyday & yes I would recommend this idem i love it
5,So I was looking for an inexpensive smartwatch since my one for work broke. I figured since I ride a bike and walk all day I can look for something to help track it. This does well with that and even allows you to Easter a different type of workout. You can recieve and make calls get notifications and what not. You must keep the app running in the background of your apps though that‚Äôs the down side. You also cant have multiple lock screens to it but that‚Äôs ok ig. And you have to be within 10 meters of your phone for the watch to stay paired. But when it comes to the basics this watch isn‚Äôt bad at all. There‚Äôs just things you wish it could add. The app itself for this watch are helpful. They give you tips and have a help line to answer questions. They have a section just for common asked questions. It will tell if your watch is paired the battery life and even let you review the product from the app as well.
5,I replaced my dead smartwatch with this watch.  It came quickly and after charging it I was amazed at how quick and easy it was to set up.  It has all the functions that I am looking for and has many more options than my old watch.  Still checking out all the features.  I would recommend this watch.
5,The watch is very good and the sound is great. I use it at work and best speaker and sound when using to answer calls that I have had. Battery life is great and band is easy to put on. All functions work well so far and looking forward to a long life time of good usage.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†I love my watch so much this is my first smartwatch I always wanted one I have a iPhone but I could never afford the apple watch itself so I went on Amazon and took my time looking at all the watches and read all the reviews this watch I have I came across look it over and over and read all the reviews I was so impress of what I was reading but also nervous to buy because I didn‚Äôt wanted to waste my money but being able to buy the insurance on the watch I felt like what could I lose so I brought it the price was unbelievable considering how awesome the watch is all features you can think of I‚Äôm so in love not to small not to big feel so good on my wrist the best it‚Äôs waterproof don‚Äôt have to freak out when I wash my hands having to take off put on take off put back on thank you Amazon you guys are truly awesome thank you for truly taking care of your customers and not just our pockets making sure we are satisfied I love you guys I truly do  Thank you people if you are looking for a smartwatch look no more I promise you you will not be sorry the best if you ever have questions it‚Äôs always someone to talk too 24-7 a live person no robot battery life is unbelievable and the progress of each of your activities it‚Äôs spot on  And so easy to get it going once you get it home
5,I HAD NOT HAD MY WATCH PHONE MANY DAYS WHEN I TOOK A FACE PLANT ON MY FRIENDS FRONT LAWN.  I COULD NOT GET UP.  I WAS DELIVERING SOME SHOPPING FOR HER.  I CALLED HER ON MY WATCH PHONE  SHE THOUGHT I WAS JUST  ASKING FOR HELP WITH THE SHOPPING BUT FOUND ME ON A HEAP ON HER LAWN.  SHE BROUGHT ME A FOLDING CHAIR AND THANKFULLY I USE IT TO GET UP THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU ! SHE WAS SO IMPRESSED I BOUGHT ONE FOR HER TOO  WE HAVE HAD SO MUCH FUN WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS.
5,This was the 6th white watch I ordered.  They all came pink and rose gold... This one did too and I finally gave up on getting a white watch. It's easy to set up easy to use and it has all of the features one could hope for.
5,Very comfortable I love that it tracks my sleep my steps I can check my oxygen and more! I got this so I don't miss calls while working since I can't have my phone out I can see any important calls or messages. The battery life is also great I charged it when I got it and have worn it for 2 days and it still has 50% battery.
4,I bought this because my old one finally died. This is a good watch just be careful in the shower. I had dialed people not knowing it. So needless to say I take it off before showing üòÇ. Otherwise it is a good watch. Easy to set up and use. Love the customization of watch faces.
5,Although I just purchased this watch I can‚Äôt wait to see how long the battery last.  The comments from others indicates satisfaction with the extended battery life is the reason I purchased this particular watch and converted from my Apple Watch which has a very short battery life.
5,Battery is okay it will last about 3-4 days with minimal use. Over all it's easy to use and set up. Worth the money.
4,I like the watch but it's not working properly planning on returning if I don't hear back from the seller soon by Monday Sept. 26 2022. Thank you
5,I love this watch there is nothing I would change it does everything I need at a fair price. I had a slight glitch I contacted the help and they were fabulous they solved the problem. I sincerely love this watch.
5,It was easy to sync to my phone. There are several watch faces to choose from. The battery life is better than my Versa. The stereo count is pretty accurate you just need to make sure you adjust your stridr distance.
5,This is the first smartwatch I've ever had. I found it really easy to use professional looking and I love it. I'm a horseback riding instructor and I needed a watch that was secure and reliable. This watch was everything I hoped for and more!
5,It works really good. Nice wallpapers for it. Easy to use and wear. Highly recommend
5,It's a great watch! The only thing that I noticed was that you can't reply to messages and you have to hold the watch up to your ear if you use it when talking to someone.
5,Took a little bit to set up because I couldn't get the app to download but once I got it everything works great and you can customize a lot on this! The speaker to make and receive calls works fantastic as well.
4,The price and I only need to change it every 3 to 4 day.. After I  download the app it was easy setup....I love ‚ù§ it...
5,watch works great I have not had any problems with this watch it does everything that is supposed to do even arrived early
5,UPDATEThe battery life for this is terrible!! It only lasted 3.5 days after I charged it for 2 hrs to start with.This is exactly what I was looking for! Works great and east to use! I LOVE IT!!!
5,Nothing to dislike. I like everything about it the battery life is good and the watch did everything I was expected it to do.
5,I have an iPhone but didn‚Äôt want to spend the money on a matching brand name watch and I found this one. It had a return policy so I thought why not try it? I‚Äôm so glad I did! The set up was easy to follow the customer support chat feature is 24/7 (I tested it and it wasn‚Äôt a robot) and it even comes with two screen protectors that I wasn‚Äôt expecting! The blood oxygen level and heart rate features seem to be accurate as I compared it with my finger sensor I had purchased several months ago. All in all I‚Äôm very pleased with this watch!
5,Very user friendly and no junk apps to burn up my data.  Battery life is exceptional.  Apps are very accurate the weather app isn't spot on and the app states that the "report is for your general location" and is within 7¬∞ accuracy so I won't make the mistake of wearing a bikini to the snow park LOL!  Highly recommend this watch.
5,I love how it looks i can answer my calls the sound is great easy to use in the app you can find a chat to help you. Definitely I recommend it.
4,The call feature is awesome.  That's the whole reason I got the watch. I is just what I wanted!
5,Much better than the other Android watch I had and cost 3x less money
5,It's easy to use.. charges fast.. info is pretty accurate.
5,The watch is awesome üôÇüëçüèΩüëçüèΩüëçüèΩ the best watch I ever had.
5,I bought this fitness tracker so I could see how high my heart rate was getting while working out.  I‚Äôve only had it less than a week but so far it works great.  The battery life is fantastic.  I haven‚Äôt charged it in 5 days and I still have 1/2 battery left.  It‚Äôs a great alternative to buying an Apple Watch.  It pretty much has the same look and functions but at a fraction of the price.  Would definitely recommend!!
5,I love the display and ease of use. I have looked and looked for the perfect smartwatch to do all the things I wanted  but this one out does all of that. i can make and recieve calls with no extra money because it is bluetooth connected. Wow! everyone says it is such a cool looking watch. Thanks guys for such a great watch and such a great price!
5,Really enjoy that I can get calls and all my notifications
5,So far I love it no problem yet but definitely will let y‚Äôall know if it is
5,Why by an Apple Watch for $200-$600 when you can get this for $45!! I went into work yesterday and bragged about this and all my coworkers want a link to buy one! It does almost everything an Apple Watch can do with the exception of not being able to send text or Apple Pay. It‚Äôs almost set up exactly the same and super easy to use!
5,I alwayd wanted a samsung watch but they were to expensive .... so i gotten this watch as a replacement im so glad i did.. i like the fact i can make/ answer calls read text messages it can count my steps and do lots of other things .. i say get the watch
5,I received my watch. I like it.But the alarm only works in military time no am and pm.
5,The watch looks good. Functions fine. The 24 built-in live chat support easily gets the user past learning curve bumps in the road. It feels a bit limited. Can't text out. No calendar or time-related reminders. The infrastructure is fixed and simple.  But if you are willing to work within the watch's limitations it is a perfectly OK product
5,Great watch. Like the large band. Easy to set up. Great price. Very happy with this purchase
5,Battery Last for a few days heart rate accurate
5,Super easy to useand set up. Was Super Excited that it came with 2 screen protectors since getting accustomed to having it on my wrist I hit it on a door jam. Screen protector took the but the screen it A ok.
4,I like the looks and ease of using. The only thing i did not notice is i receive text but cannot send. A little disappointing.  Otherwise works great.
5,Great and very easy to use!
5,I love how you can answer calls and receive a SMS reminder for all different kinds of apps. The call quality is amazing. The price was great too for all that comes on it. It was a little difficult at first to set up the watch but only for the SMS feature eventually I was able to receive SMS so its all good now. Overall 10/10 recommended!
5,Arrived fast and safe in secure package. Easy to use and great customer support 24/7. I am a bit of a dummy when it comes to gadgets and was helped until I got it. I had a Amazfit which broke after 8 weeks. Now I bought this one and other than it is a bit bulkyer and doesn't have GPS it's a great alternative for a great price. I can highly recommend this watch so far.
5,We bought this watch for my daughter when she‚Äôs out playing and we need to get in touch with her. It does everything we expected it to. We have a  Samsung sm-a326u and it works well with it. She loves how pretty it is that it has a lot of cool features.
4,Not that easy to set up
5,Seems to be good so far although I just got it yesterday so we'll see... love the ability it had to answer calls
5,I absolutely love this watch. It has all the capabilities of the more expensive name brand watches but is available at a much more affordable price tag. Right out of the box it is ready for use. I highly recommend purchasing this watch!
5,Very easy to use and battery life very good and very good for the money I spent on it
5,Product is very easy to use. Can track calories throughout the day which is what I was looking for. It also reminds you when to drink water which is pretty cool. Can receive texts alerts and  has the ability to make phone calls.
5,Love getting messages while my phone is off charging in another room. Easy to sync. So many features I haven‚Äôt explored them all yet. I have a very small wrist and the band is very adaptable so it fits just fine. And all at a great price.
4,I tried this for awhile. I think if you know what you are doing it would be great!  The elderly/technology challenged not so much!
5,There's really nothing to dislike. It's stylish very lite you hardly know you're wearing it. Has the bells and whistles needed. Tracks everything you'd want it to. Light vibrating reminders honestly I'm getting another in black fur trading out. I bought the blush pink. Great purchase fur me.
5,Bought for my wife she is enjoying it battery has good life and she likes all the features.  (There are many!!) HR and spo2 is accurate.  Great watch for the value!!
5,Battery life is awesome it does not stay connected to Bluetooth and I have to constantly reconnect it and the band is awful if I could change out the band I would be happy with the watch if not I will be returning it.
5,I am very happy with my watch. It does everything it is supposed to do. It is a gift from my husband for our 5th anniversary. Easy to wear. It‚Äôs a breeze to set it up. Highly recommend
5,Watch is very compatible with Apple Watch and the price was highly affordable.
5,The battery life is awesome
5,Really easy to use .great price too
5,I like how great it works and was a great price.
5,I have a small wrist and this watch actually fits me! It has lots of holes so I can get a tighter fit to measure my health status. It also has lots of watch faces that let peiple who wear reader glass see without the need to put glasses on. Great watch! Amazing price!
5,
5,Its super slick and cute nice size screen
5,Very handy if you need a friendly reminder for meetings and appointments.  Fits well on my arm.  The sound is good and has lots of features.  I am getting my husband one because it fits his too.
5,The accuracy of step counting is impressive for the price. I also love the fact that I can make and accept calls directly from the watch itself like an expensive watch.
5,I love this watch
5,I use rhis for tracking my steps and it works great. Accurate and still allows me to answer calls and view my texts to make sure it worth grabbing my phone.
5,I'm using this product for all the things that shows in detail the great watch to have
5,Excellent watch and long lasting battery life
5,Watch does exactly what it says.  Love the screen customization.  Speaker for phone calls is clear.
5,I love that it shows me the song that is playing on my Bluetooth speaker and that a can make and receive calls.
5,Nice watch and easy to use.. üëçüèºüëçüèºI‚Äôm happy..üòä
5,This is such a great watch especially for the price. Does pretty much everything a high priced smart watch can do for a fraction of the cost. And it's super cute!
5,It does everything that it says it does. Light weight and very easy to get it up and going. And fast delivery.Definitely recommend!
5,I love everything about it easy to use not heavy on my arm greatPrice
5,I just set it up and was looking at watch faces. It looked like many were for kids and I wanted something that wasn‚Äôt fancy and simplistic for an adult. I did find something simple but it had a small Dinosaur on it.  I will say it was easy to set up.  This is my first smart watch so I will have to try it out for awhile before commenting anymore.
4,The watch is easy to use with the apps easy to use
5,Very easy to connect to my Android cellphone. Perfect for tracking my daily activity and long lasting battery.
3,I specifically wanted a fitness tracker minus the price tag‚Ä¶and that‚Äôs what I got. I was on the stair master completely out of breath and it read my heart rate as 109. Absolutely not. Steps are not accurate. Contacted support and the resolution was to update profile with weight and height etc and the steps would be more accurate. Did this and didn‚Äôt help. It said I walked 5000 steps before noon. LOL It takes a while to update too. Weather is not accurate and gives a range instead of the actual temperature. Aesthetics are nice! Looks just like an Apple Watch. Being able to use the watch as a remote for the camera is great too. But it misses the mark with fitness tracking
5,Only had this a month won‚Äôt charge not worth the money
5,
5,I found the app was very helpful in converting the watch from metric to imperial units. It also is self-explanatory to use fast to charge easy to use and tracks my workouts well. It's a very slick watch and looks cool. I definitely think the price isn't too over expensive and was worth it.
5,This watch was so easy to set up and use. I love all the feature exactly what i needed. The calls are clear and its awesome receiving all the notifications. Exactly what all the high end watches do but for cheaper. The battery life is also amazing. I definantly recommend.
5,I like this product. Because this watch have coll features. For example the watch can help to take call when your phone is not with you and help to call someone from watch. And have camera and watch can control your phone too. And most importantly thing is the 24/7 customer service. Chat with customer service to solve your problem. And peoples who but this product it's worth it. Thanks You.
5,This watch is perfect has everything you need and want out of a smartwatch. The battery life is great it‚Äôs very easy to use and has a great app. The price is awesome and comes with a warranty. Overall very happy with this purchase.
5,I love that it was very easy to set up.. u can my ur own pic ur watch face.
5,I used this item to monitor my workouts.
5,So far I'm enjoying my watch  alerts me to messages and calls
5,
5,Good value very easy to setup & pair with your cell. Battery life is very good & charges fast.
5,I do not dislike anything!
5,This smart watch has everything  those high-end brands have except the cost I love w everything about it you can make a s answer calls  and it's very clear.Amazing value you get GPS spo2HRwaterproof.Only dislike is not many colour  options.Black grey and white.  I got black and grey for my daughter.I promise you will not regret this purchase.

5,My son likes this watch so much with all it's great feature.

5,Fitness
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I got this yesterday and set up was very easy. It works well with my Moto Z3. Today I was driving to the store and I received a phone call and I answered it using the watch and I talked hands free. Very convenient! This is comparable to the more expensive Samsung watch in terms of functionality. I chose this face cause it shows everything you need at a glance. I can recommend this watch as a superb deal!
5,Easy to set up and sync. Works great with my one plus android phone and perfect size for my small wrist!!
5,Watch was easy to pair with my phone and so far I am very pleased with the functionality
5,Watch is easy to set up and easy to use. Download the app and you ready to go.

5,
5,I received the watch quickly. it is very easy to use and set up
5,I liked this watch it accurate and easy to use.
5,Previous watches had proven difficult to pair with my phone. This one paired immediately and directions were clear. (A pleasant change.) Customer service is emphasized in all materials. I am delighted to find a manufacturer that genuinely stands behind its product.
5,Wore my watch for 2 day Already still good on battery life
5,I really like the watch it connects easily and can make and receive calls from my iPhone 13 pro max.
5,Love this watch  this is exactly what I was looking for. I love when it tells me my messages and to drink water(I asked it to)I recommend this product.
5,Excellent and easy to use too
5,Nice screen easy to use very good
3,Just received this watch yesterday so I can't say much right now except that it came very nicely packaged and it was very easy to set up. It seems like a good value gor the price. My Fossil watch stopped working after many years and I'm getting ready to go to Jamaica and really needed a watch especially one that was waterproof. Hopefully it will meet all my expectations. What disappointed me is that it states the color as white and it is not even close. It is peach! So now I have to search for another band. I'm going to give it 3 stars for now because at 69 that wad a biggie for me. I dont want to shop all day not even online. I need to know Im going to receive what I expect so if there are no other disappointments I will rate up later.
5,Great watch easy to set up. Love all the features. I will be keeping this watch for a while.
4,I like its easy to use.
5,Not sure of battery life(wife's watch)Love yo own one myself  waiting on mine to wear out
5,Overall this watch functions well has a good battery life and meets expectations.
5,
5,Great product for price! It has filled my needs completely.

5,Love this watch! It's definately worth more than the value of the watch!! It's loud so it's easier to talk to someone over it!
5,I absolutely love this watch! So many wonderful features!  Easy to pair and operate very comfortable to  wear Great price
5,Really enjoying the watch honestly used it since i got it. Loved the sleep tracker learned what light sleep was for the first time
5,So far I haven't found anything that I haven't liked.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I used it cause it helps me with my job as a driver and I like because it looks very nice on my wrist

5,It's easy to use.
5,Very easy to use and set up. Love this product!!

5,Great value. All the features you would want for less cost.

5,Fits great and looks great
5,I like that it looks just like an Apple Watch. The speaker on it is amazing and so clear. It said the band was white but it‚Äôs more of a pink color which I‚Äôm ok with. It came almost fully charged. Love that I can change the display face. I purchased one for my mom as a gift after falling in love with mine.
5,Have only had this for one day.  So far it is a great product.  I am electronically challenged but it is real easy to set up even for me.  All of the options on the watch work as stated.  Really happy with the watch.
5,Love it
5,Me agrado todo esta super bonito de muy buena calidad y facil de usar.

5,It was easy to set up and does a lot
5,Works perfect and does what i expected it to do. Would recommend.

5,Easy to use do not like the fact you can't change the date format.
5,Super cool pretty accurate battery life lasts pretty long if you don't keep the brightness up all the way love being able to change the face to personalize it to my style! Definitely worth the price.
5,
5,After about a week the watch is not working. I need to send it back for my money. It doesn‚Äôt even measure one‚Äôs blood pressure. Do not buy it again.

5,I like how easy it is to see the screen and also how loud the speaker is in a phone call.The only thing is the person I call has a little hard time hearing me. Maybe I can adjust the microphone somehow.

5,Love that I don't miss any of my husband's text while I'm at work anymore. The move around and drink your water are also awesome! Bonus was receiving and making calls with no issues!

3,Got one and had to return as it only worked answering phone once then never would again. Company offered me $$ for a good review which makes me very Leary but I asked for another one instead of refund.  We'll see how 2nd one works. ü§ûü§ûü§û
5,Love this watch it's perfect love the sleep tracking and  battery last without having to charge it constantly.
5,Just got it today. Delivered on scheduled and I already like it far more than my previous which I also purchased from Amazon and actually cost more. This product is FAR easier to set up use and customize and comes w/far more features and benefits then most. Will keep you posted should I encounter any difficulties but so far? I'm severely impressed. Worth more than priced!!
5,Great watch
5,Amazing watch
3,Everything else seemed to work great. But I tried everything with texts; even watching videos.
5,I like how easy it is to set up and easy to use.
5,I really wanted to sync my workout apps but it isn't synchronization over all it is a good buy I like the ‚åö good battery life

3,Steps are not accurate every time you move your wrist it picks up as steps.
3,Not bad just wish I could add more to the contacts.
5,I use it for counting my steps and my sleep patterns
5,Great product
5,I love the watch.no issues
5,Battery is long lasting
5,The media could not be loaded.
5,I love the color of it
2,Wanted this watch to use around the house to answer phone calls and see txts so my phone wouldn't need to be on me constantly.  Total failure & very Disappointing. If your phone isn't about 6 ft away from the watch it disconnects from blue tooth. Has alot of features but without a reliable phone call mode this watch was worthless.
2,This product is not waterproof. My son was so excited with the product. Based on the product description he assumed it is waterproof and went in to swimming pool. Watch was dead when he was out of pool. It was wrong product description.
2,Battery on full charge lasted 2.5 days instead of the week claimed. Online instructions are minimal. No explanation of features or of app usage.
2,it will no longer charge  lasted less than 2 months  first the faces kept changing and going nuts  then it just didn't work anymore  too late to return  oh well I thought it was great for the 1st month.
2,This watch was purchased for a secondary smart watch to west outdoors in the water at the lake. It lasted 4 days before it died. The water had clearly messed it up. The purpose behind the watch was for water activities and exercise outdoor. Sadly did not meet expectation.
1,Stopped working properly. Kept calling random people on its own. Even called my boss while I was talking trash about him and  he heard EVERY BIT of my rant. Lost my job! I'm really depressed.
1,The watch does not count steps or distance accurately. I walk a trail that is 4.1 miles. It counts over 10000 steps but says I walked 1.1 miles making the watch useless. I'm sorry I didn't make the deadline to return this piece of junk.
1,I did not get to use it at all because it never powered on when I received it. I had to send it back because it was broken.
1,Supposed to be able to read text messages it doesn't. The app leaves a lot to be desired. Very minimal options. Watch faces are childish and none show battery life. You have to open the app to check battery life. Tried to download more watch faces but it wouldn't download. Will be returning. I would not recommend.
1,Cuando lo conecto a Bluetooth solo se conecta a llamadas y tampoco me deja cambiar la hora
1,Doesn't do what it says in the context. The face plate was cracked when I received it and it doesn't. Record your blood pressure. And your heart rate is off.
1,The App that drives this smartwatch is not available in some overseas locations. Check for the App a availability on your phone before you buy. Amazon were great and refunded this purchase. HuaWise Fit App.
1,I've only had to watch for a couple of days and so far I'm not 100 percent happy I haven't been able to make or answer calls or text and I'm not able to change the face of the watch
1,Bought this watch for my daughter whose a swimmer. She wore it one day in the pool. And its dead. Won't turn on nothing. Its supposed to be waterproof. Its not.
1,You get what you pay for. Not very accurate at all.
1,Broke after a mknth
1,Didn‚Äôt work as I expected!!
5,This watch is very easy to use and it is on point with accuracy a very nice birthday gift üëçüèæ.
5,Like the watch and love the fact I can actually talk to my family without getting noticed at work now . Very light and comfortable on my wrist will be ordering another one for my mom. I like that you can pick different watch faces and have many options .
5,This is a very comfortable watch to wear. My Versa died and I figured I would give this a try and I‚Äôm glad I did the ability to answer the phone is very helpful if I am not near the phone. Like being in the bathroom.There are choices for the face and I chose this one. The only thing I am not happy with is the delay in seeing the time . I need to push the button to see the time I think the manufacturer said the raising of my arm would light the face but this only happens at nite. Which can be annoying. When I am trying to sleep. Over all it has lots of features that are very helpful.A good buy.
5,I like that it looks similar to the higher end watches on the market today only its totally affordable at the same time with an equivalent feature set. The speaker on it is amazing and so clear and LOUD!.  The band is just plain black but is the best choice for an all-black watch face so I'm good with this.  It came almost fully charged. Love that I can change the display face with hundreds of other options using the app..I might buy some of these as gifts espeically for my daughter who LOVES the thing and immediately asked for one for her birthday.  :)Thanks again for a great product!
5,The functions are very easy to use
5,This watch does everything that it said if can do I just love it best deal I ever had on a watch to
5,This watch was super easy to get set up. I have only had it a couple days but the battery is holding strong. It came with a screen protector and had an extra in the box that was a plus! Does what it says it will great find!
5,I love it. It looks very high quality. Overall it is very nice for the price. Would order again.
5,Very satisfied
5,Battery life is impressive. Very impressed considering the low price.
5,Very happy with the watch! I love that you can personalize it with any picture. The app is easy to navigate and set up was quick. It has everything I need in a watch and you can't beat the price.
5,I'm very happy with my purchase. It took a while but I got it working and it works great
5,I love that you can call out and get calls.I wish it let you view picture messages and reply to text but it's a really good buy
5,The watch made checking messages and keeping up with my diet and exercise way more easier because the watch is taylored to my specific body dynamics amazing product
5,I bought this as a gift for my mother and she really seems to love it. She used to have a fitbit that was lost and she has said this watch has most of the same features as the fitbit. It has a very nice feeling soft band and very elegant look almost light pink not white as described though.
5,I never had a smart watch so I don't have anything to compare too.I do like it. I basically just wanted a watch where I can see notifications (text) and incoming calls.this watch was a plus because it lets you answer your calls. you can only see your texts cannot reply back.if I walk more then 30 feet away from my phone the blue tooth will drop and I will have to connect to it again manually. I dont know if this is supposed to work this way or its just my phone that has me manually connecting watch back to bluetooth.when I am in the car driving and connect my phone to the car via bluetooth phone disconnects from watch.  it is what it is.  like I said this is my first smart watch so I am just learning them.for the price......I'm satisfied.
5,

5,I swim and this watch has a IP68 water üí¶ proof rating which is hard to find.

1,Love that it's easy to use. That was my first thought now the watch doesn't even work and I have only had it less than a month.  Can't even return it because it's past the date.  Just a complete waste of money I am so very disappointed.
