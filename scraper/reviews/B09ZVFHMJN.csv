4,This extender will give you some extra outlets and usb connections.  The electronics seem fine with the circuit protection etc. One reason we purchased it was to be able to use it behind furniture in such as way that the plugs do not further protrude into the room but go to the side so as to allow the furniture to get closer to the wall.  For 120v outlets 4 are located on the side allowing the plug cords to be out of the way.The usb plugs remain on the front of the device but most USB cable ends do not protrude too much.We also wanted to install the extender horizontally for a couple of uses but of the set we bought two would not remain level but sagged to an unattractive position.  The instructions suggest that swiveling the plug to the horizontal should be done with simple tools suggesting that it would be rigid in the set position but we found that it was too easy to rotate and thus it would not hold the true horizonal.  As a result we returned two of them.  So if horizontal setting is important this may not be a good choice.  The four uiits we purchased differed alot in this regard so it is a chancy proposition to assume that horizonal holds will work.
5,Love these life saving outlets they are so awesome just plug in and use and they have USB for phone as well that makes it more versatile You don’t have to bring so much extra USB it’s all in one here and even for the newer version of iPhone have its port. Love it
5,Seis receptáculos y  3 USB Fácilmente accesibles
4,This is a pretty bulky item. But it's nice & can it has 2 or 3 USB ports to charge your phone(s)
2,Upon receiving this brand new item we tested all of its 6 outlets and 3 USB ports. They all worked however this Eienko unit sparked like crazy. I'd say about 80% of the time we inserted plugs into the outlets they visibly and audibly sparked sometimes almost shooting out. We own many power strips and surge protectors and the sparking does happen on rare occasions but this item sparked like no other. Not sure if I got a dud or not but we've already returned it to Amazon due to safety concerns and the overall longevity of this unit. I have a very similar wall mount surge protector with rotating plug made by a brand called Trond and that one rarely ever sparks.Another complaint is as a previous reviewer stated the Eienko I received did not do well in holding the weight of plugs/adapters when rotated sideways so it sagged downward. The rotation seemed too easy/loose. In comparison the Trond surge protector we have rotates VERY stiffly and can maintain the weight of various plugs and adapters when oriented horizontally.Also this is a slight nitpick but the pictures of this item on this website show that the USB output total is 3.4A. This is incorrect as the actual unit's USB ports total just 3A combined.After receiving this Eienko unit and wondering about the excessive sparking I noticed that the model number was "PW-503". And actually the box I received showed a different brand "Lvetek" on it (see picture) even though the actual unit was branded Eienko. My conclusion is that there are various branded iterations of this "PW-503" out there made by the same manufacturer. After some quick research on Amazon one of the other PW-503 variants is the one by Poweriver. That one looks exactly like this Eienko one except that it has 3 type A USB ports instead of this one which has 2 type A and 1 type C. Aside from the USB difference both look EXACTLY the same and have identical power specs which makes sense because they are both "PW-503". So I read reviews on the Poweriver PW-503 and there are currently 11 negative reviews of it mentioning excessive sparking similar to what I'd experienced with my Eienko unit. Also the Poweriver PW-503 has quite a lot of negative reviews (with pictures) of the unit physically falling apart after just a few months or so. I was concerned that the PW-503 I received would also eventually come apart which would be a safety hazard while plugged in.Anyway while I'm not sure if I just got a dud this Eienko PW-503 that I received was returned to Amazon mainly due safety concerns caused by the sparking as well as its inability to stay straight horizontally when things are plugged into it. Of the wall mount surge protectors with rotating plugs available on Amazon this Eienko one is the cheapest at just $10.99 (at the time of this writing) and that price was attractive and one of the reasons I purchased it. But unfortunately it ended up being a case of you get what you pay for. If there was no excessive sparking I would've most likely kept it.
5,Just what we needed!
5,Love it its perfect for behind  my sofa and its compact size.
5,This was used in the kitchen to connect the coffee maker toaster can opener and plug in the front doorbell unit.  Well worth getting!
4,works nicely. will purchase again.
4,It is in our kitchen socket for over a month provingitself useful in the everyday life.Traveled with us for about 3 weeks and proved itselfuseful in the hotels.We did not LOAD it with coil / oil heaters but ithandles a kettle and phone and a computer.Worth the money. Enjoy!BTW what is "drying power" we are asked to rate ?
5,One of my electrical outlets has a bottom socket that is controlled by a light switch and a top one that is not. The grounding plug on both sockets is on the top rather than the bottom rendering it "upside down". That wouldn't matter if I were only using the two sockets but I need more. Regular 6 outlet extenders make the switch-operated socket inaccessible. This one is just what I was looking for to solve this problem! It can be plugged in the top socket and rotated to allow use of the bottom one all while adding 6 sockets two USB chargers and surge protection.Yes it can get a little top heavy and tend to pull a bit away from the socket but distributing the plugs evenly around it keeps it in place. I've had no problems with it at all. Well made and highly recommended!
4,This takes up a lot of space. The expander itself is pretty chunky but once you start plugging into it it sort of takes on a life of its own.  It just got unruly big for my space.  There were cords going everywhereThe quality of the item was fine and it worked well. No complaints with the quality of the actual expander.I’m sure this works great for some places and some needs but for me it ended up just being too much. I gave it away to someone who appreciated it.
4,All in all this plug is really versatile.  The USB is strong enough to charge iPad pros (I had other USB PD chargers that can't power an iPad Pro).  I don't see myself using this for travel because the prongs are sticking out.  If they can retract the prong then it'll be great for travel.  Also when in the horizontal position it doesn't snap or click in place.  So when plugging from the top it will turn.  Minor gripes but a little more thought during testing would have gotten it 5 stars.
5,I’ve only got one outlet in the room I’m using it in so this is great! Especially the two USB ports I can charge even more things with the one outlet. It works well had it for months zero problems.
4,This is a sturdy compact unit also a bit tall. The 90 degree rotation is a good idea but it means that the unit might bump into furniture too close on either side. Perhaps the plug should be in the middle? Also wide/narrow (standard) prongs on the plug mean you can't install it upside down depending on how your outlet is wired.
4,Works as intended but wish the prongs were in the middle of the outlet.  It droops downward doesn’t stay level.
5,I like that this swivels so I can get to my other plug in but this also allows me extra plugins at one time in a bedroom that is lacking a lot of plugins. There is the added bonus of having some USB plugs so I can charge my phone as well.
5,I got tired of unpluging one appliance to plug in another one. This outlet fits nicely on the wall behind my counter top and I can plug in my coffee pot my blender and my food processor. Plus it's a surge protector.
5,For the price is a really good deal so far works as expected I have tried all the sockets at the same time and the outlet expander have kept the voltage for the devices and didn’t got hot. Definitely recommend it.
5,Rotates with usb and 3prong plugs
4,Love all the outlet space it has! It was kind of bulkier than I thought but it’s been very useful and I would recommend.
2,As the title says can't even keep the weight of one plug up. Once I plug a second plug in it falls all the way down. I don't recommend this product.
5,It gave me enough ports in one plug.
5,Excellent product. Can't comment on longevity since I just got this but great design. Gives you 6 extra plugs two usb A ports and even one usb C port which is super convenient. Leaves plenty of space to use the other socket in the outlet and you can position it vertically or horizontally. Great purchase very happy.
5,We like this product! Works great and saves us clutter and helps to not have to unplug and plug in appliances when we need them.
5,Me encanto  lo recomiendo
5,Works perfectly and is my unique solution to installing an outlet behind my bed's headboard so that I can have reading lamps and some cool LED wall art just above my headboard.
3,The unit is simple and serves an uncomplicated function. However the circuit indicator lights are essentially useless because they are so dim/weak you are only aware of the circuit status when the room is in almost total darkness.
5,Very happy with the quality of the product and it works exactly as explained. Now I don't have any bent wire plugs as they can be angled as needed.
5,I love the way it turns.
5,Versatile multi plug outlet. This does help expand your standard 2 socket outlet up to 7. It would be small enough to fit in a very tight space. I am quite happy with this purchase
3,It’s as if it’s too heavy for my lose wall plug
5,This is a lifesaver for oddly placed sockets!Also the additional spots for USB plug in are super helpful!
5,This item made my laundry neat and functional.
5,Love the versatility of this item.
5,Works well
1,will not stay in one place continues to move which is really annoying.
1,One of the outlets and all of the USB ports DO NOT WORK.
2,Design looks great. But why would seller or manufacturer allow it to become scented? Couldn't tolerate the smell...
2,I used it for three devices (Apple watch small  beauty product refrigerator and hair dryer) and it tripped after one month and wouldn’t work again
1,I had this in my master bathroom and had 2 plugs in it. It got hot and almost caught my house on fire! If I wasn’t in the bathroom when it happened it could’ve been much worse.
2,I liked the concept but it was wobbly and not ethtetically appealing.
1,Bought this in September just started making sparks in my outlet.  Not a safe plug adapter.  Now too late to return.
1,Neither USB port in this works. Useless. Others out there that do work.
1,Is to small no room for other outlets is not secure into the wall.  Not good to tiny.
5,I ordered this product because I needed an additional plug in an outlet in my living room. This item is very sturdy with lots of room between outlets to accommodate the different type plugs. Its rotating function perfectly fit my needs. High quality product with great design. Better than I expected.
5,Good product. Highly recomend.
5,Like this wall outlet expander because its compact also got plenty of power sockets and USB ports. Anyway worth the price and super quick to install (obviously) - just plug it into a port and rotate the side you need.It’s also a firesafe surge protected outlet to handle all of my electrical needs. Satisfied.
4,I was trying to give it time to see If it would last longer than a week before  doing a review can please have patience seller so far so good I will update again.
5,Adds 6 additional plugs 2 USB PORTS and a type C plug.  Swivels if needed.  A little larger than expected but not a big deal.  Would recommend.
5,This product is great. I can plug in so many different items and things to charge at the same time. I took on our trip to the beach and used it in the motel for all the phones and iPads that had to be charged at the same time.
5,Works as advertised.
5,Good design and very functional. Add on bonus are the USB ports.
5,The plug part swiveled right into place where I wanted it.
5,A little bigger than I thought but it still worked for my needs. If you have a two outlet plug once this product is plugged in you may be able to utilize the opposite plug since the height would block the other thing from being plugged in. Otherwise it's ok and I would buy this again.
5,Received today so far it works great 👍
