5,With this plug you get a lot of options. You'll have options 3 prong and 2 prong outlets and also USB outlets. Used on wall mounted TV Only have1 cord down the wall and put it in a chanel. It's hanging from TV mount with all wires going to it out of site. Well worth the price.
5,6 wall jacks. 4 USB ports and minimal electric bill affect. This is a life saver being that the cord is 35ft long. Love it. I feel like I need 2 more.
4,Good vakue
5,Works just like it's suppose to. I mounted it with the screws provided and haven't had an issue.

5,Tool this on a week long vacation. Was great for plugging in all my electronics and the length of the cord was perfect since we only had 2 outlets and none near a mirror. Great purchase.
4,A great little power strip for my home office.It fits perfectly in a under table desk cable management box and the cord is long enough for me to move my desk around the room if I need the space.The usb charging ports are an added bonus for my cell phone and watch to charge.
