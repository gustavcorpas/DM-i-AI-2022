5,The apple brand charger wanted me to buy stuff separately which I guess would works if you get a brand new phone that‚Äôll come with a cable but not the wall plugin. But I wanted the whole package which exactly what was offered here. My only gripe would be cable length but I shouldn‚Äôt be on my phone while it‚Äôs charging anyways. Guess that‚Äôll deter me a little.It works as expected with the main part of the product securing itself magnetically to the back of the MagSafe otterbox I got at the same time and wirelessly charging for 20% to full in about an hour and a half. Good stuff. I‚Äôll be looking around for a longer cable version soon.
5,Basically exactly like apple‚Äôs MagSafe charger. This threekey charger has the same MagSafe charging animation and looks the same. Great purchase! Charges fast
5,Me gusta mucho este cargador me demora como 1 hora y media no carga muy r√°pido pero es c√≥modo!!! Lo √∫nico malo es q se calienta no siempre pero algunas veces pero igual me pasa con todos los cargadores
5,My iPhone 11 Pro lost its ability to charge via a lightning cable so I needed an alternative.  This is perfect.  I leave the phone on the magnetic charger overnight and the next day it's fully charged.  Thank you ThreeKey!
4,This charger works great but could use some minor improvements. The cable is short making it hard to use while charging. Also the charger head is permanently fused to the cable so I cannot change it for a longer USB c cable. Other than that this is a great product.
5,Purchased two so far. Feels pretty sturdy compared to a different brand I tried and returned
5,This is my favorite product in this category. The price is right and it works well. I have ordered two of these several months apart.
5,Like that you can just leave it on your desk
5,Great looks works very good consider that the cable is just 1 mtr
5,I‚Äôm pleased with my purchase and this is highly recommend üëç
5,Good magnetic charger and it comes with power adapter if you need one. Using the charger with a MagSafe case.
5,This charger works great for my Apple 12 Mini. The magnet is strong enough for the charger to lock into the phone without me trying to fish for it. I have found that it charges as fast if not faster than the lightning cable and I have found a few times recently that my lightning cable failed to charge my phone. Dirt can accumulate inside the lightening port and prevent a good connection.The phone gets slightly warm with this electromagnetic charger but certainly not hot. I use a magsafe compatible case and I don't normally let my phone discharge below 20% so maybe that and the reason that it's a mini is why I haven't experienced the heat that others have. I haven't traveled with it.You should keep any electromagnetic charger away from ferrous metals. Close contact with those could cause some dangerous heat.
3,I like to listen to  audio while charging phone with my AirPods. This works fine with an Apple MagSafe charger but with the Threekey there is a loud pulsing base sound in the background.
4,It works and does everything it‚Äôs suppose to do. But it still heats up when charging.
5,I‚Äôve used other chargers in the past and this one is the best so far.  It grips the table top keeping my phone from moving while charging and theres no guess work when it comes to knowing if its on the wireless charger properly.  I just wave my phone over it and the magnet snaps the charger in place.  My order was processed shipped and deliver very quickly.  I‚Äôve bought two of these so far and have been very happy with both.
4,Great charger it works great with my iPhone 13 pro max.  However I do wish the cord was a little longer.
3,Becomes hot too fast. Uncomfortable using
4,Easy to set up and charges phone pretty fast I‚Äôd totally gift as a gift
5,It charges my phone pretty fast
5,It is so easy 2 use
5,Fast charging.
5,Nice little charger a a decent price point. Powers up my phone quickly. Easy to take traveling. Magnet works through my ‚ÄúSpeck‚Äù phone case. Not a usb connection ( requires electric outlet so assuming adapter or different device would be indicated if 110 voltage not available)
3,Mine heats up way too quickly and also heats up my brand new phone.
5,My Magsafe wireless charger broke and this was the replacement i purchased. I am very pleased with it after a week of daily use. Phone connects automatically and quickly quick charge too. I am pleased with the design and the color as well. I picked this product over others because it came with the charging cube which many others did not. Would recommend and would purchase again!
4,It lacks charging power and seems to take forever to reach full charge. Pretty disappointing.
5,Fast and easy
5,This charger is great. It‚Äôs easy to use and charges your phone fast. I have an iPhone 13 mini and this charger seems to work much better than the $50 Apple version. Definitely would recommend it to anyone who‚Äôs looking for a better more cost effective wireless charger.
4,Easy to set-up and use.  However cord is really short otherwise I would have given 5 stars.
5,Works exactly as it should.  Great price no issues.  I would buy again if needed.
4,When I received my charger it kept cutting in and out and wouldn‚Äôt charge. Customer service had already sent me an email inquiring how I liked it I explained that it wasn‚Äôt working properly and they followed up with a replacement within 3 days.  The replacement works absolutely perfect and I‚Äôm very happy with it.
4,Kool charger easy to use
5,Keep this on my desk at school and it works great
5,This is a good charger especially for the value.  I have no issues with it.  I can use it with my iPhone 12 Pro Max with a case on and it charges fairly quickly.  Did not have to buy a separate adapter either which was a plus.  Many reviews about the unit heating up I did not have this issue and I had it in the charger for close to an hour.
5,This wireless charger is thin small - but super effective. My phone chargers really quickly on it and it feels SO nice to just set my phone down and not have to worry about wires and whatnot.I was worried that the cord would be short since I think I saw that mentioned in someone else's review but the cord attached to my charger is really long and gives me more than enough room to place it on my desk. I'm likely going to buy another one of these chargers for my office since it's so convenient! (also a sidenote - it looks really nice! The white color matches my minimalist desk well).Throughout the day I often have to switch between different workspaces in my house which makes charging my phone a pain. This little wireless charger makes it so easy to just grab my phone when I need it (and makes me want to get the same charger for all of my workspaces!).
5,What a great charger! Everyone knows the biggest annoying of charging your phone with a wireless charger is finding the right spot for the wireless charging to recognize.Well not in this case! It instantly attached to your phone and charge instantly. It even displays a great charge icon that unique to the newer iPhone model even when this charger is not officially from Apple.My only gripe for this charger and probably all magnetic chargers is that getting your phone out of the charger is a bit difficult. It's due to the charger is sticking to your phone. But this is not the charger's fault.An easy fix is to place the charger under something heavy so removing your phone from the charger will not be a hassle.Overall I love the charger. it's a great improvement over other wireless chargers. Obviously you would need an iPhone 12 or later to utilize all of its potentials.
4,It works fine.
5,Deleting a previous or review b/c I realized it was a result of my phone settings not the charger
4,Simply put this is an overall great ‚ÄúMagSafe‚Äù alternative charger at a decent price and gets the job accomplished. Here are a few of my personal pros/cons list. Noted: nohing was a deal breaker on continued use of the item.Pros: Cheaper than Apple MagSafe comes with 20w adapter (huge plus since most are separate) very sleek design sturdy/well-made components the slip-resistant pads are nice MagSafe compatible for iPhone 12 Pro /Pro Max.Cons: gets a bit hot while charging (which also makes the phone hot) doesn‚Äôt seem to charge as fast as I expected but works fine (unsure of normal MagSafe charge speed) cord could ideally be longer
5,Works just fine. Fast charge
3,charger came fast and very easy to use but it's extremely slow at charging.
3,I had high hopes for this charger and it does charge fast but getting your phone positioned right can be a pain.  Plenty of times when I put my phone on this charger only to find out the next day my phone did not charge.
5,I like the style and the rose gold and how well it is magnetic to the phone the case I bought works so well with it .
2,Aftermarket Apple stuff is always a risk but I had gotten water in the charge port of my 13 Pro Max & was desperate for the alternate charger. The first time it worked great didn‚Äôt charge particularly fast but whatever. The second time I used it the plug the charger & my phone became burning hot. I unplugged it immediately.I‚Äôm likely past the return window but I can‚Äôt recommend this charger because anything that runs that hot could very easily damage your mega expensive phone and Apple won‚Äôt cover damage from using aftermarket devices.
5,The product is great works great at home but even better in an emergency in a carMy phone stopped charging with a cord and since it was a corporatePhone it was goi g to take a few days to get a new oneI plug this into the USB port in the car lates my phone on it and it worked
5,Fast charges and is small enough to to travel easy but not to small it‚Äôs annoying to use. Feels like good quality. Nice and heavy. Very happy with product!
5,Exactly what I needed :) Not sure why people say it heats their phone like crazy‚Ä¶ it just heats up like any charger. And like any charger if you use your phone while charging it will definitely get hot! I only charge my phone before going to bed and when I wake up it is fully charged and not hot or warm whatsoever.
5,Works on iPhone with Chi Wireless Charging as well.‚ù§Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏èüíïüíûLove how universal this charger is.
5,The charger is easy to use and works well. Thank you!
5,The charger is fantastic. The magnetic is very solid. It works on My IPhone 11 would definitely recommend this charger .
5,Works great
5,It was my first time to use wireless charger for iphone 13.Easy to set up and very convenient to charge even with the phone case.I've used it for a couple of weeks and have no issue yetPretty design!Strongly recommend
5,Unit is well made has powerful charging transformer and magnetic ring and cable are also well made.  Round charge base magnetically attaches to the back of my iPhone and works very well.  Round charge base also has non-slip feet on it so phone stays put on my desk or other surfaces while charging.  Very pleased with this item and purchase.
5,This product is very easy to connect to my iPhone 13 and charge it was no problem
3,The charging ‚Äúpad‚Äù or w/e it‚Äôs called is too small IMO. If it‚Äôs not in the EXACT right spot it doesn‚Äôt pick up. I have to move my phone all over the pad.  It‚Äôs like a guy trying to find a G-spot it takes forever and then you just get frustrated and find another way to power it.  Wouldn‚Äôt recommend
4,Seems to wok ok. Very little info sent with the item regarding it‚Äôs use. No indication when it is charging or when the device  is fully charged.
4,I really like this gadget but sometimes I feel like it charges slower than my other normal chargers
5,Don‚Äôt hold a charge after it‚Äôs been on the charger all night
5,Grabs phone tight charged well
5,Very good size and powerful
5,Great wireless charger in my truck. Have mag safe case on phone and c-usb cigarette adapter. Holds phone if charging or not charging. Double face tape on top of my dash mount then this charger on top of that. Good to go! No wires to iPhone.
5,Very convenient & small great for tossing into purse or suitcase
3,The charger seems to work fine as long as you can keep the phone and it connected because the charger has a very weak magnet. The magnet won‚Äôt even hold its own weight to the back of the phone.
5,Works well good deal
4,I like the compact size and it seems to charge phone quickly.
4,Esta impresionante ü§© estoy ansioso por probarlo
5,This little gadget is AMAZING! It is soooo  easy to use! So far it has charged several different devices not just Apple products! Strong magnet too!
5,My package was lost and THREEKEY provided a great service in helping me find it and communicate with amazon customer service also. The product it self worked perfectly and does what it is supposed to do.I would totally buy again from THREEKEY in the future.
5,Works great on my iPhone 13 pro max - I have the apple rubber case this charger sticks right to the back great magnet! Highly recommend!
4,So far I‚Äôm really enjoying it
5,This magnetic circle charger works well with my iPhone 13 Pro Max. The magnetic is very strong & charges quick. It matches my phone color very well.
4,Good quality product. My phone immediately recognized it.
5,SUper bueno
5,I love it.Excellent charger. Great quality of the magnetic feature sticks perfect even over the protector case I have on my phone.Also it came very quickly. I highly recommend itThank you
5,nothing
5,Okay so I got this for my LG G6 cell phone.  It works really well.  The magnet allows me to easily find the right spot to place.  One of my favorite features besides it's small compact size is that it works off USB C which means I can use it with my other power chargers ... very useful when traveling and you want to minimalize your hardware.  The power supply is rated at 20 watts so it charges the phone as quick as the quick charger that came with my phone.
5,Super easy to use and charges super fast.
5,Dose not work and dose not chargeCustomer service handling it great!
5,Works great and chargers iPhone 12 Pro Max well. Keep it on my desk at work and has pads on the bottom which keep it from sliding around
4,Good charger though I've only had it for 2 days now.
5,Love it
5,Simple to use. Works nicely.
2,With having both Samsung and Apple products  I thought this would be the answer to carrying extra charges when going out of town.  Great for over night charging but if you're in a hurry look elsewhere.
5,I consider this a ‚Äúno brainer‚Äù charger.  You put your phone on it and it charges (as long as your phone is compatible‚Äù. There is nothing worse thank trying to plug your phone charger in when it‚Äôs dark if you can get it plugged in then after awhile the cord will break or the port on the phone will.  Not gonna happen with this charger.Did I say that it is magnetic so your phone will not fall off‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶  Get this charger.
3,Charger is slow and the phone gets real hot while charging
5,I was happy I purchased two and I would recommend
5,Fast shipment easy to use.  I very much enjoy this product!
4,This charger is great for small area's. Works well for an LG. The only thing I don't like about it is you have to take your case off to charge it and it is not a fast charger.
5,Very good works with iPhone 8 and SE 2nd generation the seller followed-up the delivery process and is very open to providing support or help if needed. Totally recommend.
5,Charges fast and slim design
3,I bought one for my boyfriend and myself. He has the iPhone 12 Pro Max I have the 12 Pro. It works well with or without the magnetic case for both phones. Charges pretty fast. Big downside is that it heats up the phone to the point that the phone will overheat and shut off or start to react to the heat by moving slowly. Since I chose to use the air vent clip to hold the charger and phone I make sure the vent is blowing cold air on the phone and charger. This helps a lot. Pretty easy to setup.
3,I really like this item but I am concerned about how it gets so hot to the touch
3,Muy peque√±o para mi gusto pero funciona bien
5,Great product with prompt shipping. Would recommend it to anyone looking for an iPhone charging pad.
5,It is convenient and charges well. Great as a cheaper version of Apple MagSafe charger wouldn't expect more. I like that it has a rose color matching the theme of my room. Apply does not have that option.It attaches to my 12 pro perfectly well without a case. I have a slightly thicker rubber case which still works with this charger but occasionally falls off when I pull. Otherwise I am very satisfied with this product.
5,As advertised
5,Overall I‚Äôm happy with my purchase. It works well enough to charge even through my clear Otterbox case. It works great as my secondary charger to keep next to the couch for when I‚Äôm watching tv etc.  Not sure if this is normal but it tends to increase the temperature of my phone even when it is resting but I am not sure if this is common with all wireless chargers.
5,Product came in fast packaging was nice. the magnet doesn‚Äôt work with my otter box case which is a bummer but if I take off one layer of the cover it charges but the magnet doesn‚Äôt stick.  I have to lay the phone down and let it charge so I can‚Äôt charge while I use it.  But overall those are minor inconveniences and I am happy with my purchase.
3,Sometimes I put the unit o ad it does not charge my phone. I make multiply tires to no avail. Other times works like a champ
5,Works better than I expected. I have an iPhone 12 Mini with a Smartish rubber case which specifically states that it wasn't designed to work with magnetic charging so I was thinking I might have to return this charger. Turns out it's faster than the lightning cable charger. The magnets don't hold through the case but it does just fine with the phone sitting on top if you take a moment to place it carefully.
5,A small but powerful charger this wireless charging pad works perfectly with my iPhone XR. I went with this one because it is so tiny and minimalist looking. While the iPhone XR does not have the magnetic function that newer iPhones have I found that the device does a great job charging my iPhone even through the case.
3,Big dislike. Good concept but poor design. Will stick to conventional plug. Will return.
3,It‚Äôs fine to just lay my phone on top of to charge but it‚Äôs bigger than the Apple MagSafe charger so it didn‚Äôt fit in the stand I bought it for
5,Great by fast charging can‚Äôt beat it for the price
5,Great value and it works perfectly when I take my phone out of my mous case.  The case I have uses the mous magnetic mounting system so it throws the mag safe lock off a bit but when I take the phone out of the case I can hold just the cord and the charger holds the phone!  Very nice.  It‚Äôs not the chargers fault my case has magnets in it.
5,Works as expected. And I had to buy an adapter to be able to use in the car. Not crazy about the USB-C end.
4,It gets a bit warm but charges quick. Also it‚Äôs a bit bigger then the original MagSafe and not compatible with mag safe Accessories
5,Worked just as it should and the seller is nice.
2,I have Samsung phone and this product doesn't Snap on the back. Charging power seems to be alright I specially bought it for long video stream. Looks like it's time to return!
5,This comes with a 20w changing box and is usbc. The magnetic connecting is really strong and the charger itself it‚Äôs pretty small and clean. Good product for the price
3,Not as magnetic through a slim phone case as advertised still kept it as a resting charger
5,Easy to use and very coolHow it lights up in the back.  No more looking for the end of the wire before going to bed at night.
5,Muy bien me encanta
3,Carga bien y r√°pido pero es muy peque√±o
5,S√∫per excelente gracias por tener s√∫per productos
5,My first mag charger and it is great
5,Charger does everything as stated. I have a rubber case on my phone and the charger has no issue linking up and charging my phone. I purchased this charger for myself but as you can see my wife has taken over it so I can definitely see us getting another one soon!
2,This works however gets really really hot and isn't fast.  For the price its great but next time I'll spend the money on the apple product.
3,Don‚Äôt like that it doesn‚Äôt charge quicker . Thought it was suppose to be a fast charger
2,Have been using it for a few days now and it works great not sure about charging speed. It seems to be well made so hopefully it lasts too.UPDATE: This "magsafe" charger seems well built and has a strong magnetic connection but it does NOT Fast Charge my iPhone 13 Pro Max. I've run numerous tests with all of them returning charging speed rating of SLOW. I thought maybe it was the 20W charging brick that came with it so I swapped it for an OEM Apple 20W charging brick and the speed rating was the same SLOW... Therefore unless I received a dud these chargers do not fast charge and the listing is misleading.
5,Charges my new iPhone 12 mini quickly and easily.  Magnets strong enough to work through a case.  Easy to align with charger.  Nice that the wireless charging pad unplugs from the wall plug so I can use the Apple cable directly if needed.  Would buy again.
5,Love it! Definitely buy again!! Easier to play on my phone than when the charging cord is at the bottom! Charges seamlessly!
5,I absolutely love this product. It is kind of hard to use when you have a phone case but I have gotten used to just taking it off to charge at night. I like that I can still pick up the phone and use it while I am charging.
5,Packaged really nice and everything is elegant and instantly started charging my AirPods when I put the case on it.
5,It does exactly what it's supposed to and it looks nice too!
2,I was unable to get it to charge consistently even by laying it flat on my desk.  Charging while using is very frustrating.  After trying that for half an hour I had a 10% charge and a very bad headache.  Had I not trashed the box I would have returned it.  On the plus side it works well with my earbuds!
5,Just as ordered. Charger worked great. I love that they actually include a wall charger!
4,I like the fact that I don‚Äôt need to plug-in my phone
5,I really like this charger. It's simple to use. Charges my phones Samsung and iPhone very quickly so far it works great what I really like about it is the size does not take up much space.The charger is worth the price 100%
1,Wireless charger becomes very warm and starts to warm up the phone to the point the adhesive used to seal the phone starts to come apart from the seams.  Will be returning.
5,No need to remove case to charge. Plan to purchase another for traveling.
4,It‚Äôs not a true MagSafe but it does the job okay enough.
5,Product arrived quickly and easily snaps onto my new iPhone 13. Happy with my purchase!
5,Works great. Comes with everything you need at a much better price
4,I wish it had a usb cable
5,Gift
5,Came in an timely and orderly fashion. Product looks just as described and works with iPhone 13.
5,So convenient. Used it on vacation and it is great speed at charging
5,Me gusta mucho
5,Great product. Come with the charger block (unlike some others). Snaps right on my iPhone even with my case on. I can charge while I use my phone also. I bought a few more for my living room
5,Had a little problem at first with the adapter connection but after asking a question and receiving an answer everything was good (just needed to push a little harder).  Would recommend this product.  Worked great for my new iPhone 12.
5,This is so much more convenient than plugging in your phone or having a wireless charger. With it being magnetic to the back of your phone you can still hold your phone without the wire getting in the way.
5,Sleek charges well and priced affordable compared to others out there
5,Best wireless charger I have. Magnet isn‚Äôt that strong through my case but it latches still and with a MagSafe case I‚Äôm sure it would be 100%. Still highly recommend this charger it‚Äôs super fast too!
5,Looks great works great the cable might be a bit to short(1m)
5,Seems to work like an apple charger.happy with itüôèüèª
5,Works well built better than I expected. I expected it to be built pretty well but exceeded that. Haven‚Äôt had real long but was very straight forward to setup and use. Charges phone very well.
4,Works great cord could be longer.
5,Works as described. Able to charge phone with case on.
1,Really disappointed to review that this product no longer charges my iPhone 12. From day 1 any device we charged using this product ran very hot while charging but at least it got the job done. Now barely 6 months from purchase an overnight session on this charger only boosts my iPhone 12 battery maybe 15-20% higher while every other charger I own provides a charge to 100% in a fraction of the time. Do not purchase.
5,I love it! It‚Äôs easy to set up and works great. I would recommend it to I love it. Easy to use and works through my case. I would recommend this product.
5,I like the product because it small and heavy. It stays put on my night stand. Charge is great. I bought this one because my samsung one has died on me.
5,Works Great! No issues.  I like that I don't have to worry about wearing out the internal connector with the magnetic option.  Also works with the thin case I bought.  Thanks!
5,Convenient  great for my galaxy earbuds galaxy watch wont charge on it but i bought it for my buds anyways. Works well on my galaxy s21.
4,The cord is toooooo short!!
5,This works even thru the otter box case!!!
5,I like the charger.. I took good and Charges my phone perfectly and I saved a lot of money. It is almost indistinguishable from the overpriced Apple original. Also seems well built and made to last.
5,Easy peasy got here fast and looks good.
5,Works great and has amazing magnetic strength.
5,It works through my case. It's really smooth and works flawlessly
3,I use this on my desk at work so it‚Äôs not a primary charger for me. It charges slowly and gets hot kinda quickly. About what I expected so not terribly surprised. It does change with my Otterbox case so that is convenient.
5,Wasn‚Äôt sure I would like it..I don‚Äôt...I LOVE it!! Wish I had bought sooner.  Easy to charge while using phone as stays tight and securely attached to the back.
4,Very easy to use.
5,Very useful to have by your bedside and it‚Äôs small so it‚Äôs nice to take with you on trips. Definitely a purchase I‚Äôll use a lot.
5,Small does not take up much space. Comes with an adapter and many do not.  Charges quickly.  I love it.  I have a Galaxy S10. Recommend!.
5,It has a very strong magnet and keeps the phone in place while charging. I have another one that just falls right off and it's annoying. This one stays put!
3,Great product.It‚Äôs a little temperamental you have to have your phone sitting on it a certain way for it to charge. Fits perfectly on my desk. Charger box does not work as well if you replace it with a iPhone charger box
5,Fast charging and strong connection.
5,Works as expected.
5,its works great. no complain
5,I love this charger. It works perfectly with my iPhone 12 mini. It‚Äôs small and light for traveling. The Manet is strong. My phone charges quickly.
1,It got so so so so hot while charging the first time. Had to return. :-(. Also I emailed the seller to tell them about why I was returning and they responded‚Ä¶.‚Äùall chargers get hot while charging‚Äù ummmmmm noooooo. This way so hot I almost couldn‚Äôt touch it!!!!!! I‚Äôm not trying to burn my house down!!!!! Response from seller made me more annoyed. I won‚Äôt be purchasing anything from this person.
5,Excelente calidad y precio
5,Fast charge but you have to have it in correct position
5,The charger works both with and without a case. It sticks better without a case though. It charges my phone quickly which is nice.
5,Nice MagSafe charger comes with wall plug unlike Apple MagSafe and cost half the price. I wish I hadn‚Äôt bought the Apple one now
5,Excellent product. Just place your phone on it and it charges quickly. Much easier than carrying around a charge cord that goes bad
5,Works as expected. Used daily to charge iPhone 5 mini. Even works with iPhone 11 and XR. Magnets are strong.
5,Small flat you can lay it down on any surface phone sits well on the product and I‚Äôm overall pleased with the product.
5,Love this little charging pad just set it on it walk away and it fully charges within a few minutes
5,Great!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†It works just like advertised
5,No comment
5,Item worked great but bought to go in a car mount for my IPhone and it was to big to fit.
3,Yes it works. But it runs way too hot for me to be comfortable using it. Be warned.
5,Nice small Qi charging pad works best with IPhone 12 which has the magnetic capability iPhone 11 does not. So far I‚Äôm satisfied.
5,Exactly  what u expectthe magnet is not as strong but i dont care for that the quality is good
1,Overheats and does not provide reliable connectivity.  Wish I could get a refund but not worth the postage.
1,Just stopped charging. Ridiculous
2,Tried using it with our new cover for our phone as well as with the phone by itself and the charge really did not work. it seemed to work better without a phone cover on but the reception still seemed off. Not a lot of quick charging. Cable is way too short as well.
5,Great wireless charger. Fast charging and magnetic for iPhone 12 Pro. Great bang for the buck.
5,Love this charger!  Works great and yet small compact easy to pack if needed.
3,Just opened it. So far so good. Will update when I have used it more.
5,Lo que me agrada es la calidad del producto y la velocidad de carga excelente producto
5,Great magnetic charger for iPhone 12 at an awesome price! Definitely recommend to anyone!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†Great charging power easy access and charges phones and AirPod pros quickly very happy
5,We have 3 of these charger they work great! I would highly recommend this product!
5,this works well to wireless charge my Iphone 12 .  no issues so far.
5,Works great. Other than being thicker there is no difference.
5,Could have a little stronger magnet but seems ok. Using a case without MagSafe
2,It is difficult to find the exact spot to set your phone down on the charger so it will start charging. Charger leaves your phone very hot.
1,I did not disliked this product but was very disappointed when the one I bought for my daughter in law‚Äôs birthday gift was broken . I put good remarks because my husbands work great
5,Quick and easy to use. Saves wear and tear on the connector.
5,Works as described.  Much cheaper than the Apple version.
1,Stopped charging after 3 months
5,Strong hold. Works through case! So far loving it.
1,Charges fast but gets extremely hot don‚Äôt leave plugged in if you are not using or leave laying on bed etc bc gets very unsafe hot
5,Works perfectly and a great price! Highly recommend it.
5,Easy to use! You‚Äôll never buy another charger.
3,Doesn‚Äôt charge at 15w for iPhone. Seems like it‚Äôs only delivering 7.5w
5,Charger is well made and charged my phone quickly.
5,A+++ Product! Super fast charge through my case...love it!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†It‚Äôs very nice charger wireless for iPhone or airpods
5,Easy to use! Definitely buying another!
5,Easy to use. Fast charge
5,Really fast charging .. works great!
5,Simple yet powerful!
1,This charger is small and no where near as big as the picture! I purchased this for someone thinking it was gonna be big like my AT&T one and it is not! I was better off just purchasing one from A&T for them at $40! Only reason I didn‚Äôt is because AT&T had it in white and not black (mine is black and the person wanted black). I purchased this one thinking it was going to be the same size based on the picture. Definitely not!
1,Smaller than picture you‚Äôre risking damage to your phone.  Never reviewed anything on Amazon.  This thing sucks.
5,Works like magic
1,It was broken when I opened the package returning immediately
5,Easy to use
5,Works great iphone 12pro
5,Great product
1,Bought this charger back in Dec 30 2021 in less than 2 months it stopped working. This review submitted tonight February 22 2022 11:42pm. Took a picture of the location of this charger. Plastic Wrapper still intact with the charger as seen on the photo. Stick to genuine apple product specially chargers. Definitely not recommended. The charger doesnt even leave my table and just stopped working.
5,Great product
5,Nice product!
1,After opening ensure that you inspect it. I received mine used and it does not work.
5,Awesome product
5,great
5,Works great!
2,I don't think it should get hot while charging.
1,Nope. Magnet does not work. Barley feel the magnetic connection to the phone even with removing the case. Removed the film from shipping. It charges but no magnet. Sending it back.
2,The device broke day two.
1,Your phone has to be perfectly placed to get a charge. There are better ones out there.
1,Ordered the charger for my iPhone 13 pro.  Unfortunately on the front of the cover box it says compatible with all iPhone 12 series. That‚Äôs great but that‚Äôs not what I ordered.  It was a Christmas present kind of disappointed
1,I purchased two of the magnetic chargers for Iphones.  One of the chargers worked as expected and the second charger failed to work.  I returned both chargers for a refund..  I was disappointed in the quality of the products.
1,As others have said this thing gets your phone incredibly hot.  The other complaint is even without a case it barely charges.  The effective zone is tiny and the magnets are very weak.  Cannot recommend this one.
1,I chose this item because of the magnetic feature but it was a big disappointment. The magnet itself doesn‚Äôt even hold to myiPhone. The charger bearly even charges. 4 hours and it only went up 20%. The worst part though is that it overheats really fast and cause your phone to get really hot aswell. It‚Äôs cheap In price but spend the money on a different product instead.
1,It gets hot fast so does your phone if charging with an otter box on. I am not going  to take it off every time I need to charge.
1,Gets hot as hell!!! Cord is like metal!!
1,Never worked. Don‚Äôt waste your money on this piece of junk.
1,Wicked hot to the touch after just 10 minutes of my phone sitting on the charger. I have a metal magnet on the back of my phone for my car dash holder and I‚Äôm not sure if that is the cause of the heat. Regardless I was too afraid to continue to use it and threw it away.
1,Said it it was charging but never increased in power... maybe it was a lemon? I returned it.
2,Se calienta üî• demasiadoNo se si eso sea peligroso
1,Charger stopped working after three months of use.
1,It worked perfectly the first day the next day it stopped working
1,Stopped working in a month and a half. Don‚Äôt waste your money.
1,This worked great until it just stopped working after two months.
1,Delivery was on time and product looks and feels great but sadly I will be returning this product. It overheats my phone and had it charging for 15 minutes it only went up 5% and honestly... not willing to risk messing up my brand new iPhone so nope it‚Äôs a no from me.
1,This charger gets extremely hot after about 15 mins of charging to the point where it could be a fire hazard. Once it overheats it doesn‚Äôt continue to charge. I‚Äôd suggest looking elsewhere.
1,Charging power very low.  Difficulty getting phone battery to set on the charging pad.  Not easy to use.  I wish I had purchased a better quality and more expensive product.
1,A little disappointed when I open the package I thought the pad at the phone rest on the charge was going to be bigger but it‚Äôs tiny
1,Not worth a review
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I ordered a charger for iPhone 1313 pro and 13 pro max not for 1212 pro and 12 pro max
1,Stopped working after only a week. Don‚Äôt buy‚Ä¶
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†The USB-C would not stay in the adapter. Seems cheaply made.
1,I open the box and it doesn‚Äôt even smell fresh as if it‚Äôs been already open. Also the stickers were partly broken. Not impressed at all
1,Poor
1,Just stopped working after about two months of very light use.
1,Muy mala calidad
1,Does not work
1,Little to slow for me
1,Don‚Äôt waist your money because it doesn‚Äôt work
1,iPhone 11
1,This worked for 1days. Would never purchase again.
5,I liked
4,Since we got an iPhone 12 Pro Max we decided to see what this MagSafe feature is all about. The magnets are inside the phone and helps align the charger connections perfectly. This it does. The charger  sits flat on the counter and charges the phone wirelessly as designed. That's all I can say about the charger. If you want to buy a stand there are plenty that include a slot for the charger. The "safe" part comes from the strength of the magnetics helping to keep the phone from getting knocked around. Full disclosure: I'm a Samsung user my wife got the iPhone. I think the MagSafe feature is oversold and inconvenient (except for maybe an in-car holder).Now the key feature in wireless charging that is missing in MagSafe products:  You still need 2 hands to detach the phone from the charger! This defeats the entire convenience feature of being able to drop it on the charger grab it---with one hand---and go. Regarding other supposed benefits of MagSafe I don't think I ever knocked my phone off a charging stand and finding the right alignment isn't that hard. Also I understand wireless charging is still new to iPhone devotees but to me who has had wireless charging for the last 6 years I think it's pretty lame that at least the top of the line iPhone does not have wireless *Fast* charging which to be fair is only a little faster than regular. But still...... Luckily for those who prefer the iPhone can still be wirelessly charged with any of the countless other non-magnetic wireless chargers on the market.
3,You might be tempted to buy this because it's cheaper don't waste your money. This charger only charges at half the wattage of Apple's more expensive charger. It may have a magnet looking and acting like the real deal but it's not the real deal.This charger will work for your phone but you won't get the rapid charging you are expecting. I recommend you buy a meter and an Apple MagSafe Charger so you can see for yourself that the device only charges at half the wattage. You will see the same thing I did and send it back...like I did.There are 3rd party chargers that are worth the money read the reviews. I have one that charges watt for watt with Apple and for $10 cheaper. This one is not your charger.
4,This charger looks well made and feels like high quality electronics.  It comes with its own USB-C power adapter.  The magnet is strong and holds my IPhone 12 Mini securely. However charge speed is noticeably slower than charging with my 20W wired adapters.  Charger works seamlessly with my AirPod Pro which is nice.  One thing I noticed is that both the charger and my IPhone became quite warm when charging.  IPhone wasn‚Äôt burning hot but definitely much warmer than charging with wired chargers.  Specification says MagSafe charging is supposed to work through a phone case.  Since I don‚Äôt use a case that coves the back of my IPhone I wasn‚Äôt able to verify.All in all I think this is a good product for the price.  I will update review if charger breaks prematurely.
5,MagSafe it's the new wireless charging accessory launched alongside the iPhone 12 series last October. It's basically standard Qi based charging but at a higher wattage than iPhones could normally receive. There is an array of magnets embedded underneath the iPhone's glass back around the coil that charges inductively. There is a second set of magnets built into wireless chargers like this one. In the end it gives you two benefits- A) a faster recharge time compared to a conventional wireless charger and B) The charger snaps right onto the back of the iPhone so there is no chance of the coils not aligning properly.3rd parties can make MagSafe compatible devices but if they are not officially certified and sanctioned by Apple they will not charge any faster than the locked 7.5 watts you get from just any old wireless charger. But this product seems to work exactly like an official MagSafe puck made by Apple. You get the fast charging and the cool Apple watch inspired charging animation when you first connect it to your iPhone. This product also comes with a 20 watt USB C Power Delivery wall plug. This is great because you need that amount for MagSafe to work correctly and supply the full 15 watts to the iPhone 12. I'm impressed with how similar this product is to the one Apple sells. Keep in mind if you buy from Apple you will pay $19 for the wall plug and $39 for the MagSafe puck. So this product is a great deal considering how it's essentially a clone and a good one too.If you have any older iPhones this product will still technically work but it won't attach magnetically and it won't charge any faster than a regular wireless charger.
4,This works with my galaxy s8 phone and charges it in 3 hours. I like it because it's magnetic small and nice for travel.
5,So far so good! Just got the package and opened it and set up up (plug and play).  Charges my phone with no issues out of the box.  We‚Äôll see how it goes!  Brick charger doesn‚Äôt seem universal though and so I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs best for a stationery location and not travel.
4,Works with iPhone 12 even in the case. Perfect! However it is a bit difficult to out in fhd correct position and it does get hot.
5,Good quality and charges quickly. Would recommend.
5,Wonderful device and the wireless charging is still a thing that just blows my mind. Great buy!
5,Works great! Will buy another for my car!
5,Very easy to use and it packs nicely for travel.
5,I recently purchased an iphone and ordered this charger to go with my new magsafe case. The charger works great. It attaches very quickly and easily to the phone case and charges quickly. Once the phone is charged the charger stops charging so that your phone isn't overcharged. I do recommend this charger for anyone who has the magsafe case.
3,Not impressed with this charger. I layed  my phone on the charger on the night stand to charge last night. I use my phone as my alarm. When I woke up my phone was at 14%‚Ä¶  not cool if my phone had died and I was late to work.
5,This is an excellent charger for my iPhone 12 Pro. It quickly attaches to the back of the phone via magnets even with a thin case on the phone (although the connection isn‚Äôt as strong as without a case or using a MagSafe case). I really like the magnetic attachment so I don‚Äôt have to fumble around with cables or search for my non-magnetic wireless charging pad in the dark on my nightstand.  The charger has 4 small rubber pads on the back so that it doesn‚Äôt slide around on the table and it even comes with a power adapter that connects via the included USB C cable so you don‚Äôt need to buy one separately.Overall I‚Äôm a big fan of this magnetic charger and would definitely recommend.
5,Quick charging power. Works great. Great for travel and so easy to use. Need to buy an extra.
5,This works awesome. It works perfectly and easy to travel with.
5,Got this as a gift and it works very well. It fits most spaces without being an eyesore which is a big plus.
5,great charger! charges extremely fast!
5,Love it. Easy to use.
5,I got this as a cheaper alternative to the apple charger it works just as well and has a nice long cord. What I like about this one is is comes with the power block so you can use an outlet or a USBC plug. So many just offer a USB plug and I am already running out of spaces / hubs for those.
5,Love it
5,Great
5,Great. Works for both my iPhone and husbands samsung
5,Awesome MagSafe charger!! Quick delivery and great price
5,I‚Äôm loving it. Just wish the cord was longer
5,Fue para un regalo
5,Easy to use works great
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†It‚Äôs my first time try wireless charger.This one Come with a 20W charger adapter and USB-C cable  . I have iPhone 12 Pro Max. I feel easy to use and faster!
1,You get what you pay for. It does the job of charging your phone; however the magnet gets very hot. It only took a few minutes to start overheating. It will only charge fast for a minute or two and then is a slow charge.Definitely not safe if you leave it in a countertop it might leave some damage.I was going back and fort with the seller as they mail a flier asking for a review and get a $10 gift card. They got the proof of review and they stop responding to emails.Got luck trying to get a refund
2,The charger seems to work fine if you lay it flat on a desk but slides off your phone if you move it.
5,Packaged nice. Arrived fast. Works as described. Definitely magnetic!!**UPDATE**So I bought this for my iPhone 13 Pro Max.It works and does the job BUT. I will say this‚Ä¶ if you already have an Apple Brand USB-C charging block USE it! Or any other 20W charging block. Especially if heat from the block is an issue. This should fix the problem some are having!I am lucky enough to have multiple USB-C apple charging blocks and just used it and it connected and charged fast.
5,I'm going to keep this short because I don't think many words are necessary for such a simple device.Pros:It charges!It's magnetic.It's easy to use.It functions like the real thing!It includes a 20watt charger brick...something not included in the original.It has little pads on the bottom to allow for better traction on a table or dresser. This is huge for ensuring that my device doesn't slide off the table.It charges my headphones too!Cons:The cable included is only about 4 feet. This is challenging because I would like to use it on one side of my desk but I can't unless I get an extender.That's it.Overall I really like this charger. It's simple to use and works well. Charges my phone very quickly. I will likely purchase an extender to achieve more length but other than that it's great!
5,Excellent. I like it
1,This is too small to use for the iPhone 12 Max Pro. When the charger is connected you go to pick up the iPhone the charger falls off the phone. This is not strong enough to use it while the phone is in a case.  I had to return for refund. This would work good for a much smaller phone with no protection case
5,Charges super fast works as described. Highly recommend
1,I got this for my husband for Christmas and he used it a few times it heated up his phone so bad he could barely hold it after. Save your money and don‚Äôt buy this.
5,Why spend more -- or give Apple the satisfaction -- when a third-party device does the job just as well at a fraction of the cost?!A+
1,Runs way too hot. Not taking chances. Return!
5,Works just as well as the name brand for about half the price since it comes with the ac adapter
5,Buena apariencia
4,The cord is way too short.
5,Works great!
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Hreat
4,The wireless is super hand and don‚Äôt have to worry about kinking the charging cable now.
5,Works just like apple MagSafe for 50% less
5,Very easy to use. It would be nice if it came with something to help it stick to surfaces.
5,Haven‚Äôt gotten to test the charger yet but the magnet itself is very strong. Will update later.
5,It's easy to use and doesn't require much space
5,Great little magsafe charger!
5,Cute. Works great
5,Charges well and connects to phone easily
5,Love to just put phone down and not have to deal with any wires
4,It works and very convenient to use the magsafe
4,It is nice
5,Easily attaches to your iPhone. Great charging capabilites. Definitely recommend!
5,Super easy to use and works great!
5,Works perfectly. Works as described. Nice small and compact. Also nice neutral color.
5,It's a decent price for a solid charger would recommend.
5,This product works just as well as the OEM Apple wireless charger for a fraction of the price! I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for an alternative to expensive Apple accessories.
4,Does what it says. Wish it charged faster though
4,Works!
5,Excellent
5,I like this easy to use magnetic charger.
5,In many ways I do not understand the appeal of a magnetic charger as I have found the process to be that it charges more slowly and therefore less efficiently.However for the times when convenience trumps speed this is a really solid charger. I can use it when traveling and on both my iPhone and Pixel. This is the best wireless charger that I‚Äôve tried.
5,Seems to work excellently but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs technically equivalent to apple quality. I don‚Äôt have an electrical meter to tell that but it seems to charge fast magnetize strongly and work wonderfully.It has one feature that‚Äôs BETTER than apples version and that‚Äôs the rubber feet on the bottom. Non slip! Better than apple in that regard.
5,Fits my iPhone 12 nicely
5,Like the size of it easy to put in purse
5,This charger are packed like an original Apple yet at the price that is very reasonable. The looks of it is as good as Apple's. i bought another and sent one as a gift to someone.
5,I‚Äôve been looking for a great wireless charger I finally found a great one! This charger charges very fast and looks great as well!
3,Love the item! Identical to the Apple MagSafe charger! Charger is really fast! Easy to use and very good for traveling! It is not durable!
5,It‚Äôs actually magnetic and charges quickly
5,Great charger works amazing on the iPhone 12 snaps right into place like magic and immediately catarata charging the phone. It does get a little hot but all wireless chargers do. I was also able to charge an iPhone 11 with it obviously no magnetic snap as only the iPhone 12 or 12Pro have the magnet inside the phone.Hopefully it will last been using it for about a week now with no issues.
5,Who knew charging could be easier? This works perfectly for both my Samsung S22 and my wife's iPhone 13. So much easier than plug and unplug different cords and so on.
5,It works like it‚Äôs supposed to charging power is great and hasn‚Äôt caused me any trouble. This charger works well even with my phone case.Easy way to charge your phone. Recommend it.
5,This is a high quality charger. Capable of fast charging and magnetizes strongly enough to use the phone while it's charging. The charging pad is pretty compact for easy travel with this device.
5,awesome little charger works just like the MagSafe charger and 20 watt brick made by Apple.
5,Work as described
5,Simple no moving parts and it works. What's not to like?
5,This THREEKEY Magnetic Wireless Charger comes with a 15W fast charging pad a USB-C 20W power delivery adapter. It is compatible with power delivery quick charge protocol for wireless charging such as iPhone and Android phones that include this protocol. This wireless charger supports the iPhone 12/12 Mini/12 Pro/12 Pro max/AirPods 2/Pro charging dynamic pop-up window.  Compared with older models it's 20% faster.  I really recommend this product because it is easy to use and very efficient.
3,Gaming while using this charger overheats my phone and makes it lag which has never ever happened with other chargers before. I‚Äôm using the iPhone 12 btw and it‚Äôs still quite newI still got the pack and everything if y‚Äôall can accept returns. I need a better one that can charge my phone while gamingIdc if the price changes
5,Nice charger but it stopped working please let me return it and get a new one I love it
4,The item is great and is as stated however it will not stick with a very thick case or a defender case to be exact.
5,Works perfectly! And through my clear case‚ù§Ô∏è
5,Loved it quick charge
5,No
5,It works perfectly with my Google Pixel 5. By placing my phone on the charging pad you feel the grip exerted by the magnetic force of the charger which makes the battery recharging process very safe and convenient.This wireless charger recharges my phone quickly despite placing it with the protective case (the one I use is the Google Pixel 5 Case - Blue Confetti).The cord is not that long (approximately three feet) but it is long enough to be placed on your nightstand or one of the tables in your living room or terrace. Even if you use it on your desk the non-slip pads that the wireless charger has on the base will protect the surfaces from scratches or abuse. I highly recommend it.
5,Good wireless charger. Magnet is strong enough through my case. Highly recommend this charger. It‚Äôs super fast too...thanks!
5,Magnetic charger works with my iPhone 12 Pro Max
5,This is a great fast charger that I ever had. It charger the phone very fast and the price is very reasonable. I will highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to charge their phone for a short period of time.
5,I bought this for my wife and she loves it. It's a great charger. Works with iPhone SE and charges quickly. Even works with a cover on. Can't beat the price would definitely recommend!
5,I love how it is Wireless
5,good
5,My son is rough on all his chargers so I opted for this so he has to put the phone down to charge it! So tired of fragile chargers this one is a bit slower but still have it which is nothing short of a miracle lol!
5,Absolutely love it. It‚Äôs cheaper than Apples MagSafe charger but does the same thing.It‚Äôs very convenient and stays stuck to the phone very firmly so you can use while it‚Äôs charging.You do need to have a case supports MagSafe tho.Overall great purchase
4,It doesn‚Äôt get 4 stars because it heats up quickly. I don‚Äôt feel comfortable leaving my phone charging if I am away from it for longer than 15 minutes.
5,Buena calidad
4,The cord is too short for my purposes.
5,Quick charge and you could use the iPhone while it is attached!  Magnetic bond is amazing if you attached it to a battery you have full mobility while using the phone.
5,I'm writing this review after a month of using this charging pad. It still works well. It's easy to use; just plug in! Charger sticks to my phone automatically so I don't have to find the right spot to charge. Valuable price!
5,Great charger and very easy to use.
5,Works awesome with MagSafe case!
1,Always fussy as to exact placement of my phone on small charger plate. Became erratic in charging at about 11 months and stopped working well by 12 months after purchase!
3,I have to use it for my Sony Xperia 1 ii since I don't have a US charger. But it runs too darn hot and seems to take forever.
5,Works great to charge my iPhone 13 mini through a case
5,Great product and value.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†awesome wireless charger
4,It‚Äôs ok charger I was little excited the magnet holds the phone in place but from the other hand it would be so annoying when you grab your phone early in the morning once you wake up and this thing sticks to the phone so you would have to use your other hand to take it off the phone
5,It charges my IPhone 12 faster than regular chargers
5,Great product!
5,I have an older s7 that I use for things like using my flirOne which needs the older micro usb. It often sits wherever I put it down but then loses all charge. With this charger it is simple and easy to just set the phone on the charging pad. I really like that it is magnetic and makes a firm connection. Also since this is usb-c I am able to reduce the number of micro usb chargers I need. Also since the end of the cord is usb-c I can plug it into other usb-c devices to charge my s7. I'm sure this charger will also be great for newer phones.
5,Very good
5,My family recently upgraded our phones to the iPhone 13. This charger works great with the new phones ‚Äî with or without cases installed on the phones. I may pick up another for my office.
5,excellent
5,Very easy to use and works well
5,Super compact and comvenient for everyday use.
5,Amazing
5,Product works great. Strong connection. Fast charge.
1,Charger got very hot and made the iPhone very hot. Scary
5,Great product and good quality. Works as advertised.
5,Excellent product. I high recommended. Include cable and wall charger.
5,Easy to use  works just like Apple charger
5,Great charger!Leave it at my desk and my phone never dies now!
5,Great thank you!!!!
5,
4,Only feature I wish was a light to show its charging
5,Quality product and easy to use. You just need to put your devices on top of it and it just starts to charge.It is compatible with my iPhone 12 pro. The price is reasonable and I like its color looks very modern.
5,This is probably the best charger. It connects magnetically onto the back of the phone and you do not have to worry about the cord being ruined. It charges quickly and it is easy/small enough to travel with. For someone who needs a good on the go or house charger - this is the one!Thank me later.
5,This does just as well as the original apple charging pad. I bought the apple one and wanted a second for my living room and didn't want to pay what Apple was charging. This was a perfect option. If I find a need for another I will buy again.
5,This is fast!! No worries about bending wires or not getting connected. Perfect‚ÄºÔ∏è
5,Connects well as charges quickly!
5,Works great so far!
5,I love the color it works very well and saved money over buying OEM
5,Very lightweight and easy to carry. It could charge my Samsung S20 FE phone at a decent speed. My cellphone has a plastic back so the magnetic doesn't stick when I pick up the phone but works perfectly as a small charge station on my desk. It would be better if the wire is longer though.
4,This charger is so simple to use plug it up and put your iPhone on top presto it chargers quickly .It does not run hot .My iPhone charger didn‚Äôt work so I bought this and it powered on and I was able to get phone fixed this is a great charger I recommend it!
5,Es s√∫per r√°pido y muy bueno no ocupa espacio en el bolso.
5,We've been struggling with traditional wireless charging stands since we got iPhone 12 phones.  Now with iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max our charging stands simply weren't working.  The new camera bumps on both phones are much larger and they don't allow typical Qi Chargers to come in contact with phone and even if we could get them to charge they charged very slowly.  Simply not optimal.I could have bought the Apple Magsafe charger but you'd have to also buy a 20w Charging Brick so the total investment on the Apple side was $60.  I read review after review of alternative puck chargers which would charge as effectively as an Apple Magsafe and the THREEKEY Magnetic Charger seemed the perfect choice for considerably less.So we ordered two one for each phone.  They just came today and they're terrific.  We don't have Magsafe casese on our phones but they attach perfectly aligned by the magnets when they're placed on the puck.  And you get the appropriate Magsafe Charging indicator so you know it's working as its supposed to.Something so simple and honestly affordable is clearly the answer to our charging woes.  And they're so small they'll be great to take with us if we travel.  I'm sure please with these if you can't tell.  And I encourage you to give them high consideration if you're looking for a Magsafe type charger for your Magsafe capable iPhone.
5,This is awesome. The color is great and it has awesome magnetic power...
1,Disappointed charger! My IPhone got overheats even when it was charging for 15 minutes.... I will not willing to risk keeping this to charge my new iPhone 12 Pro Max any longer so it‚Äôs a no for me.
5,This wireless charger comes with an adapter. It takes approximately an hour to charge my phone to 80% full(18% to 80%). It works well even I have a phone case on.
5,Came very quickly compact and easy to use
5,Works like a charm
5,Works great with or without a magnetic case. Holds better with Mag case on.
5,I use this one for at least 2 weeks and i think it works good for me. I like the color and the material because it is lightweight so I can easy to moving it around. Also I think they have a safe function for charing your phone. I will not leave the hot heat after charging my phone but comfortable touch. The charging function is strong since you can charge up to full in around an hour. One thing i do not like about this product is they do not have a travel box so i can store it in.
5,i like this product. It is powerful to make my phone alive very quickly. Also it can hold my phone so I won‚Äôt worry about my phone will falling. It is compatible with bunch of phone brand. So just be confident to buy this product. 100% recommended.
5,Fast charge
4,easy so far
5,This charger is great Have had many different brands of chargers from other seller this one is by far the best!! the back has anti slippery unlike other brand I had before if wont stay on the table. It charges very fast as well. The magnet in the back us strong enough not to come off when you move around.
5,So far so good.  Looks to be well made.  I also have the Apple mag charger and it‚Äôs double the price if this one.
5,Works as designed
5,Gets a little warm but functions great and exactly as described.
5,I use this charger with a MagSafe case to hold my phone in my car. Double sided tape to the front dash and it works perfect without having to keep plugging in a phone to charge it and have cords laying around.
5,I‚Äôm happy to receive this product. So far living up to its expectations. Great price also.
5,This charger is a small size (which is great!) yet powerful! It works great with my husband's iPhone 12. I decided to try my Pixel 3 with the charger but the phone gets too hot while charging.But we really like the compact size it's fits nicely on my husband's bedstand. Definitely recommend for iPhone users!
5,The charger is well built and the magnetic connection is strong.
5,It‚Äôs magnet is strong enough to hold onto the phone. Charging power is awesome.My phone has charged more quickly. It‚Äôs good for traveling. It works well. It looks great for the price. Highly recommend it.
5,Upon searching for a wireless charger this had a lot of reviews and great price point. Even better it comes with a plug. It‚Äôs worth every penny.
5,So far very pleased with this charger puck. Came complete with the power adapter unlike the official version and available in black to better match my car interior. Yes that‚Äôs right I use it in my car via a q3 cigarette USB C power adapter and it works great so far. Used double sided 3M adhesive ring to affix to a Pro-Clip dash mount and it is rock solid while driving and enables me to easily switch between portrait or landscape mode! NOTE - on mine there were TWO protective clear films on the charging side of the puck that I removed. Until those were removed the magnetic strength was not as strong. Once removed my MagSafe case is FIRMLY attached while in use. Very pleased!
5,Super easy to use got one for myself & husband
5,I didn‚Äôt think of going wireless before and always think this is not gonna work for me because I always have a case on my phone this one works and works well charge almost at the same speed as my original apple 11 charger  so far so good no complaint
5,This MagSafe charger is excellent. It works perfectly. Less money than Apple‚Äôs and it comes with the charger. I like the rubber feet at base. It keeps iPhone in place. Buy it.
5,The quality is solid. For the money you paid this is a decent purchase and has almost same performance as the Apples Mag safe charger.  It does wireless charging and more importantly  It charges with a case without any problem. The wireless charger was able to charge even my iPhone 11 which didn‚Äôt support MagSafe. I‚Äôd definitely recommend it to anyone looking to save some money.
5,I love it ! Works for iPhone 13
4,Easy way to charge my iPhone
5,I had been using a Q charger that would get quite warm and the phone had to oriented in a certain place.  This new charger magnetically attaches in the exact spot and works without heat.  I love it. Packaged very well and looks great.
4,Nice  product
5,No issues thus far
5,I kept having chargers break in my phone because they seem to be cheaply made.  Anyway I really like this!  It comes with everything you need.  Latches right on to your phone.  So far so good!
4,It is a great product
4,It has nice strong magnet and also works for non mag safe products.
4,Great Charger! Charges fast but wish there was a longer cord to use!
5,I was worried that it might be slower than my regular Apple MagSafe charger but it seems to charge just as fast
4,I love how it magnetizes to my phone I couldn‚Äôt really tell if it was charging any faster honestly and it did get pretty hot. However it takes the whole apple lightning cord issue out of the equation.
5,After a few weeks of using this wireless charger with my new Iphone 13 Pro I gotta say that it's been nothing but praises!!! No complaints here...
5,Very nice product with this price. It is perfect for my iPhone 12 Pro Max and it attached very good on my phone even.
5,I have magnet safe case it has strong magnet and charges very good. Hope last long.
5,I like the fact that there are little pads on the bottom to prevent the charger from sliding around or moving. The size is great! This has become my new favorite charger!
5,I am very happy with this mag safe wireless charger. The quality is basically the same as an OG Apple one.
5,The charger is small and it is convenient to pick up phone while on charger
1,Very weak magnet. Had to remove my case for it to even attach.
5,Very sleek magnet works! Excited to be able to charge my phone on my bedside again.
4,The charger part of this is great. The magnets lock on solidly and it charges quickly. The one flaw is that it has just a 3-foot long cord which can‚Äôt be replaced. The outlet adapter is removable/replaceable from the cable but the cord is hard wired into the actual charging pad. It‚Äôs barely long enough to go from my wall outlet to my night stand and Too short to hold the phone at all while the charger is on it. Normally I swap these 3-foot cords with a 4 or 6 foot one but that‚Äôs not an option here.
5,This is nice and stylish easy to use.. anyone use magnetic strip/hold in phone case should not buy becoz all wireless charger wouldn't work with magnetic strip.. just experience but charger is fine..
5,Works perfectly easy to use and power charge was fast. Definitely use this while traveling
5,Excellent product.  Works great.
5,Excellent product.  Works great.
5,Simple and to the point this device is Comparable in quality to Apples own MagSafe at half the price and comes with charger even highly recommended.
5,Like the easy use and convenience..
5,Since I switch to MagSafe I thought this would work with the vent mount which it doesn‚Äôt. Incase if anyone is wondering it will not fit and you will have to buy the OEM Apple MagSafe. Other then that the magnet is strong. Since I couldn‚Äôt use this for the vent mount instead I use it for travel.
5,Look awesome and item is as described.
5,Wireless MagSafe charger that works through a thick case!
5,This charger is made of Really well it works like it should.
5,First look! So far so good! Strong magnet and it charges! Will do an update if something comes upUpdate! Not as fast as I want it to be only charges about as fast as the OG iPhone 5w wired wall charger.Only did short tests but even then the numbers just kept going down.1st test is stock wired apple wired fast usbc2nd test is apple 18w block with threekey MagSafe3rd test is threekey 20w block with threekey MagSafeGoing to contact to see if I just received a bunk unit. This is only 18hrs after opening the box
5,Works good easy to use. Had to take off case wouldn‚Äôt charge when in case. Don‚Äôt know if there is a case that allows use of this product
5,So far this product is working great!
1,The short time I put my phone on the device it was super fast in charging BUT I removed my phone because the device was emitting a lot of heat (HOT to the touch!!!)and I thought my phone would be damaged! I don't know if this item was defective or this is how it is. I am returning this item and hope Amazon looks into this sellers item.
5,Well I have only had this charger for about 24 hours now but so far so good! I‚Äôm loving it right now! Hopefully I will feel that way further down the road but if I don‚Äôt I will update this review. I love the pink edge on the charger. It looks so good! It was easy to get it plugged in & put my phone on it to charge. It came with a long cord so I could reach it from one side of a desk to the other with no problems. And seems to charge my phone pretty fast! So as of now I am a very happy customer!üòä
