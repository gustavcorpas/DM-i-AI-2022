5,We bought this to organize all the cords behind our entertainment hutch.  We mounted it on the wall the keep the cords off the floor so our robot vacuum can clean there without eating cords.  It's very well-constructed and sturdy.  It had two options for wall-mounting.  The outlet spacing was sufficient so that we only had to cover one outlet with one of the long power supplies the plugs in sideways.  Definitely look at the orientation and size of your power supplies to make sure this will work for you.  The higher joules rating is why we chose this over other power bars.  We're very pleased with this and would definitely recommend it.  I don't know why the ratings requested asked about traveling.  You could travel with this but I'd find something more compact for traveling unless I had a specific need for something so large.
5,This is a well made product made of metal... NOT PLASTIC. I hung it on the wall behind my desk. The plugs are nicely spaced so all those strange plug boxes fit. Very pleased with the product.
5,Stretches from floor to top of stereo rack!
5,Purchased this to put on the back of a computer credenza. It keeps all the pesky cords separated and out of sight. They could be a little further apart but for the most part it worked great!
5,I barely got this item and I was notifed to my email that I should share a review. I will try to ahare an update later. But chances are that I won't unless it stops working. Then I will talk bad about it. And if not that means it's working great!
