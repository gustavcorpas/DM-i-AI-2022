5,Installation is just as easy as any other Simplisafe device. Pull the tab push the button select a room. Done. After that used the stickies on the back to fix it to the wall and it hasn't budged since.It will give an audible warning just like the keypad as soon as the alarm timer is started. Haven't tested the actual alarm going off but I've been told it's extremely loud so I adjusted the volume down a bit so I don't have a heartattack AND ruptured eardrums if/when this goes off in the middle of the night.
4,We like that it was easy to install.Seems to be working well We donâ€™t like that when we talk through the cameras the sound is too low and garbled and useless! Also we need to have the app on 2 phones so that my husband and I can both operate it. Example:  I have the app go out of town and husband says home. If he leaves home  for a while he has no way to know if something has happened at home.Add the ability to share the account!
5,Easy to install.I have a walkout basement thatâ€™s finished. The control unit is upstairs and sound wouldnâ€™t be much do Scaraway somebody breaks in the basement. Siren I just sat on the table and with the motion detectors there it would be the first thing to go off  and scare them  back out the door.
5,So easy to install and SIGNIFICANTLY louder than the home base alarm.
4,Works like it should. Blends with my decor.
4,Easy to install and great to have for external alarm.
4,Bought auxiliary horn to augment the one Simplisafe  includes in the original alarm package which is integral to the systems main unit and which is woo fully inadequate.  Easily installed and programmed. Overall very satisfiedðŸ˜Š
5,I put one above my front door because statistically that's where would be thieves enter. And man I accidentally set off my alarm and I scared myself! It was so loud! It was super easy to install and set up with the SimpliSafe system.
5,Works as advertised. Not much to say other than it extends your Siren and notification sounds around the house.  I like that you can adjust the open-door chime and different volumes within the app.
5,is perfect for inside. We got it as the base station alarm is to quit. Now we 100% hear it in every corner of the house
