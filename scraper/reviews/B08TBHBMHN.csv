5,Easy to adhere and stays put! Mag is strong and holds my phone with zero issues. This product is a fraction of the price from others and exceeded our expectations. Would buy again. Would make a great gift!
4,I didn't think this small thing could hold my 14 pro max and it does really well. impressed and would reccomend. great deal if you don't need wireless charging
4,I needed a larger mount to accommodate my iPhone 13 pro max and MagSafe case. The magnet is legit on this one!! It holds very strongly. Unfortunately I have to detach my magnetic ring holder in order to use the mount. I haven't seen any mounts that don't call for removal of the ring holder however. If you're on the fence with this one just get it!
4,Fits good on my dash and is stuck on good! It holds my phone really well. The only downside is that you need to have a MagSafe case for it to hold your phone. It comes with a ring you can put on your phone but it does not work underneath the case I have yet to try it over the case but I assume it would work.
4,Tried different locations on dash but only sticks for a couple weeks then falls off with iPhone 13 Pro Max
4,I installed this according to the instructions.  Cleaned the area attached it and left it the requisite time before putting the phone on it.  Once that was done I put the phone on and it attached without a problem and was very secure.  HOWEVER I've noticed over the past few weeks that the glue that holds the unit to my dash is starting to peel a bit.  The mount hasn't fallen off but I fear it's only a matter of time.  Otherwise it's fine.  Dinged 1 star.
5,The magnet on this thing is really strong. Keeps phone right where you want it without a lot of movement.
5,Love this mount. Works great and easy to install. Also comes with extra magnetic ring in case you don’t have a mag safe phone case. I’m on the road a ton so having this to put my phone is great.
5,Shipper string magnet. Don’t need to hunt to find where to put phone on. Highly recommend!
5,Because my dash has a curve to it ... I installed it sideways (see pictures) and it is WONDERFUL and has a VERY Strong HOLD ... HIGHLY RECOMMEND !!!
5,I’ve been using this in my suburban and have had ZERO issues with it.
5,I love this because I can easily magnetize the phone to the mount while driving without having to clip something in while driving. Holds the phone great it has never fallen off while driving.
5,Works as described with my iPhone 14 max pro
5,Does just what I wanted it to do.Wish the ball head for the mount had more tilting range
5,Mounted on steering column housing with no issues. Strong sturdy and no movement. Pairs perfect to hold my phone will plugged into my aftermarket stereo for apple car play.
5,Love it buying another one for the other car
3,The sticky pad only lasted about six months of part-time use in my camper van. Peeled off on a long road trip. Also may be partially due to the fact that the magnet is so strong that it puts a lot of force on the attachment/sticky pad when you’re trying to pull the phone off the mount plate. I’ll try the last sticky pad and see how long it lasts
5,Holds my phone securely on the dash above the LED screen. Keeps me from searching the floor for my phone. Best phone holder I’ve had
3,For my iphone 13 pro max. Magnet had to be stuck outside the case.  If is flush with the surface and hollow in the middle to show the apple icon so did not take away free from the aesthetics. In trying to use it relying on the phones back alone that was a joke. The magnet hold to the stand pretty strong in trying to remove the phone you will rip the mount off. They give you several 3M stickers to mount the base it is useless with car curves and heat (car is a BMW sedan 16) If you try to moung it on top of the dashboard there will be no wag the phone is directed to you (not sure what was the logic in that) so you have to try to mount it vertically (well to see the screen) (I saw another reviewer comment on that thought you need to lie kn the roof with face downwards .was hilarious).  Anyway it IS A STRONG hold BUT too strong for the dismal 3M stickers and its mount angle design needed some common sense. I still liked the strength that I will try the vent mount..  You have to use both hands one to hold the mount and the other to pull off the phone to keep the mount sticker from pulling off.. That is in the few minutes  the mount adhesive stayed on.. Great magnets if I can keep the mount stuck on the dashboard .. I will be trying to buy their vent one .. Hope this one works let go of those stickers that can't stick to my car's dashboard.
5,Does exactly as advertised. Nice that it does.
3,I bought the product a few months ago. It fell during driving about one month in. I used the extra adhesive they include. That worked for another three months of driving. Then I didn't drive for a couple of months and within a few weeks of using the car again it fell again. Sigh.
4,I am overall very pleased with this mount. I have a note 20 ultra and I stuck the included ring to my case and it holds the phone securely. The adhesive holds to the dash well also. The only mildly disappointing thing is my phone shakes while driving due to the weight of the note 20. Other than that this is a fantastic mount
5,I am so happy with this car phone mount! Fits perfectly on my car. I used the adhesion and it has never dropped my phone. I love the swivel so I can look at my phone vertically or horizontally. I recommend this phone mount to anyone with a magsafe case on their iphone!
5,I have an iPhone 13 pro with a  MagSafe case from another company.The magnet has exceeded my wildest expectations for grip!  Not sure how they did this.  I originally bought another brand that would also wirelessly charge.  That one did not work for me and while the magnet was strong with my case this one is much much stronger.  I decided to forego the wireless charging aspect so now I just plug the cord into my phone and then stick to the mount.this product does exactly what it is supposed to do!  Remember that this magnet does not charge your phone wirelessly it only acts as a magnetic dash holder.
4,Ok so the good:This is exactly what I was looking for a strong magnet to snap to my iPhone 13 via MagSafe without falling or moving around. The magnet is great quality and is not messing around…once you find the right spot boom it’s not going anywhere. Also the 3m adhesion is strong and setup was easy.The bad: the actual screw that you loosen and tighten to mess with the angle is trash. Cheap plastic that you can tell is going to break. Honestly the mount can be used with or without it but I do wish it worked so that I could set a certain angle. Once unscrewed it’s easy for the screw to get off its track and annoying to try to find it again and screw it tight again. If they used the same quality that they did with the magnet and head of the mount on the rest this would easily be the best mount I’ve owned.Overall this is what I was looking for and I’m grateful to have found it!
3,Very disappointed with the adhesive longevity of this product. I’ve had this less than two months and I’m on my second adhesive pad and it’s already coming off my dash.
5,Really strong magnet even with a apple leather case on my iPhone 13 pro.I hope the two-sided sticky stuff holds it to my truck dash which isn’t a smooth surface.
5,Likes: it withstands the weight of my iPhone max and very easy to put it in and take off.Dislikes: make sure you know where to put it the first time in your car the adhesive is very strong if you want to relocate the car mount which is nice because it hasn’t come off with this heat.  Still 5 stars all together.
3,Sadly this did not stay on my dash very long in the heat of Texas this summer. I actually wondered whether it would work or not and the adhesive is just not strong enough. Having said that I am not sure any adhesive is strong enough. Just the same I would suggest a different product. If you live in the South.Tried leaving Cellar Feedback but it would not except the fact that it is defective. I would hope the seller sees this and reaches out as I would like to return for a refund.
3,I purchased this magnetic mount back in February and it has been great! Until this summer and it's been in the 90's + and inside temps much higher. The unit stayed stuck fine but when I placed my iphone 13 plus on it after being hot in the car it began to peel. 😔 I really love this mount very strong magnet just wished the adhesive didn't fail when it's hot.
4,I bought this to easily mount my MagSafe compatible iPhone case to my dash.  It works pretty well.  The only issue I had was finding a spot that was flat enough on my dash for the adhesive base to work.
4,Surprised how well it holds my phone! So far it has stuck to the dashboard very well. It also holds my phone really tightly I was pleased. It is a great product and a good price. I would recommend
4,This product has 5 stars in every way except for the adhesive pads that come with it. I have the iPhone 13 Pro Max and the adhesive won't hold. I properly cleaned my dash and used alcohol to make sure. I installed and let sit for 24 hours before using. The first time I used it (through all 3 adhesive pads) as soon as I removed my phone half way through the slide motion the mount came off. This is a great mount. But use 3M double sided tape for your adhesive. I promise it works better. If the adhesive was stronger I would give 5 stars. But since I had to use my own adhesive it only gets 4.
3,The magnet is a good solid one. The sticky stuff both held really well in the Arizona heat AND was pretty easy to remove without damaging anything.But the mount needs to be about an inch taller. There isn’t enough room to allow for many options.But if you are looking for a solid magnet to mount on a relatively straight forward flat surface without clearance concerns this is a good one.
5,The 3M double sided tape has been holding strong for almost a year through all seasons here in Colorado. Works great for my iPhone 13 with case no need for additional magnetic plates at all. Good purchase
5,I bought three of these for three different vehicles. Very happy with the results and if you have a MagSafe iPhone you don't need a piece of metal between the phone and the case as long as the case is also MagSafe ready.
5,what else do you need to know? this magnet is STRONG and will hold your phone securely.
3,The magnet is not strong enough to hold my iphone 13 pro in place
3,I wanted to give this mount a 5 star but the description said "No magnet required" and in the box there was what???? A Magnet ring that you must adhere to the phone to make the lock stronger. There is absolutely no lock if you have a case on. I mounted the phone with no case (iPhone 13 pro) and it was ok held but who the hell wants to get the phone out of the case every time you get in your car? So I had to buy a $50 Apple MagSafe case so that I could get the phone to stay in place. So... no magnet my A$$
2,Really excited about having a car mount that doesn't occupy an air vent and works with magsafe cases! Got the item out of the package and was very happy with the magnet. I peeled the backing of the adhesion tape and attached it to a clean dash. Yay! About 5 seconds later? Noooo!!!! It's on the floor. I removed the magnet head and screw head so there was no weight on the base and re-adhesed (new word) it to the dash. Yay! 2 seconds later? Noooo!!! Not sure what type of 3M tape they're using but I feel like I'd have better luck with masking tape. :( Super bummed. My old magnet mount was super difficult to get off the dash and had been stuck there for years. I need THAT tape... Tried to find a customer service form or something to reach out about the situation but had no luck. Thus! REVIEW!!! Bummed to find out I am FAR from the only one...For as much money as I paid for this mount the adhesive should be as good as the magnet. Really poor follow-through.
5,Would re-purchase and recommend
2,This car mount does not work as advertised. Supposed to work with the MagSafe Techron new iPhones and it doesn’t. My phone barely stays connected even when i take my case OFF and then it is still falling off all over my car constantly. You can’t even lightly touch your phone without it falling off  ending up under my seat etc. Very annoying. The mount itself also does not stick to the dash well either. The adhesive they sent barely works. The only reason I bought this was because the Apple store told me the metal plates used for other mounts can ruin your phone. The mount I had before with the adhesive magnet on the back of my phone worked a 100X better. I will have to spend more on a better quality one to protect my new iPhone 13.
4,Does the job iPhone 12 max locks on perfectly. Just wish it wasn’t so bulky or stick out so far.
3,The tape didn’t stay when I put it on my dash
5,Does a great job holding my phone!!! Looks so simple and minimal in my car. Other phone holders either don’t fit on my dash or don’t stick to my leather on top so this was perfect! Very convenient using MagSafe.
4,When I placed this on my dashboard it won't rotate to 90 degrees so the phone points to the roof of the car not straight ahead.  Disappointing because the magnet is very strong and it would have worked well except for that.
5,Satisfied with this product. Be aware doesn't work if you put the magnet inside the phone case (unless its a special case designed for that) but sticks directly to the newer iphones without case (and though not recommended I put a magnet on the outside of my case and it also works great.)
5,I have tried several magnetic car mount and NONE would hold my iPhone 13 Pro Max with clear mag safe Apple case.  This one does.  Its a pretty light weight unit so I was surprised that it held so well.  It comes with an O shaped metal ring which I do not use.  If I chose to use it the holding power would be even greater.  As it is this hold my iPhone 13 Pro Max just fine.
3,Great build magnet and adhesion! Only thing is the neck of the phone holder is too small for seemingly most car dash’s. I found a spot but it is not ideal and 2 more inches of stand would have solved that problem.Cheers!
4,It works fine but it took multiple tries to find a place in my car where the adhesive would stick. My previous holder stuck to the dashboard with no issues but this one would not stick to the same surface.
3,iPhone with mag case adheres well to the iPhone but after a few months the rotational ball loses all friction and you can no longer position the iPhone. It just hangs limp. I’ll have to buy a new one or give a similar product a try.
5,I bought this because of how strong the magnet is... which is great. Initially I wasn't happy with the rotation as it was too loose but then I figured out how to tighten it and I couldn't be happier with this holder. Great price and a great product.
4,My dashboard has little ridges in it making it not flush. I think this is the reason that the adhesive is peeling a little. Other than that it’s an amazing product.
5,2nd purchase for my second car. Both cars are working great. Just get in and snap it in. No issues so far and have been using these for a couple months. I attached the little ring on backside of my phone cover. It works and helps to attach to the holder. You just have to find a suitable place on your car where it will fit and not block any dials or buttons on your dashboard. So far attached to my Acura ILX and my Scion XB and both working with no issues.
5,I bought this needing something to handle the bumpiness of my car being that it's a show car on very stiff suspension and this thing holds up! I love how strong the magnet actually is and it came with a ton of extra magnetic stickers in case you don't have a newer iPhone. Satisfied customer!
4,It's been very useful. Stuck it on a plastic piece on my car. Magnetism has been excellent. Only complaint is the pricing. $20 for this thing is a joke.
5,I missed having the ability to be hands free and was tired of using suction devices on my window and my options were limited not wanting to put a magnetic sticker on the back of my phone like I had in previous situations.If you have a MagSafe case on your phone which is required without having to use the provided mag stickers you will have no problems with this phone coming free from its hold. Speed bumps Portland’s failed infrastructure and jerky driving creates no problems for this mount. Easy to align when connecting and great swivel action if desired. Immediately bought family members one after using mine for a week. Highly recommend this.
5,I use a MagSafe case on my iPhone and this mount works well with it.  I have one in my car and SUV and have not had a problem with the phone falling off.  Just bought another one for me newest car.
3,Used for about a 6 months. It worked fine for a while and held my large 13 pro max without issues. The adhesive that came with the mount failed quickly however.I replaced with better 3M adhesive tape and it stuck better. Even so I think the base could be a little larger for larger hefty phones.
5,This magnetic car mount works great for magsafe on iPhone 12s and iPhone 13s if you do not have a case. If you use a case that does not have magsafe magnets built in it will not be strong enough to support the phone so if you do use a case with dismount make sure it has magsafe capabilities. I just got an iPhone 13 and thought that the magnets on the phone itself would be strong enough to go through a silicon case but I was wrong and had to buy a different case that also has the magsafe magnets
5,I used this on my 2020 Tacoma  to mount my iPhone 13 Pro Max and it is a solid mount. I connect my phone so I can use Carplay and it charges faster with a wired connection. This MagSafe friendly mount has great magnetism and holds my phone even on the bumpiest roads. If you are looking for a MagSafe mount for your vehicle I highly recommend this one.Hope this helps.
4,I used a heat gun to heat the adhesive sticker and it lasted about couple of weeks before it started detaching. I then superglued it on; so far so good.Ps. I have a pro max so it is a little heavyRegardless of it’s flaws. It’s been super helpful for me while driving.I say buy it along with a pack of superglue.
5,I bought two of these one for each vehicle. The adhesive has held well over the last one month of use. The phones have never fallen off. We use with. Both an iPhone 13 Mini and iPhone 13 Pro Max. Even the larger heavier Pro Max sticks great.
5,Well I do like the magnets. It hold my phone pretty well. I got the magnet halo case too. I tried the first one to test them bought the second one for my passenger side… not to bad but pricey.
5,Perfect for my Tacoma
3,Magnet works great! The adhesion is so poor. We exchanged it because the adhesion did not work the first time but loved the magnet. But the sticker is just so poor even the second time the mount fell off. I won’t be buying this again.
3,The way it is designed you cannot turn the phone in any direction you want once it is on the holder. It works fine but I've used better ones with full motion.
5,Have been using this for a few weeks now.  No issues with phone falling off magnet.  Also no issues with adhesion of the holder to the car.  Very happy so far.
5,Love this thing so much in fact that I have two so far! I work with my hands a lot and don't always have pockets that I can or want to put my phone in. I just pop my cell on this and now I can watch Netflix while I craft or while I'm cooking. I will probably buy two or three more for other places in my home/ shed that I often frequent and want to magnet my phone to.
4,The adhesive wasn’t that good. I just used gorilla glue to hold it in place.
3,It works some as it should but so far with most of my cases I need to add the extra magnetic circle to when your not supposed too.
4,I gave this 4/5 stars as the base has a strong magnet that securely holds my MagSafe iPhone 12 Pro phone (I am not using a case with my phone). The magnet is strong enough to keep the phone in place while driving over rough roads and easily stays in place with no slippage during normal car driving.I took a star off because the metal plate that comes with it (which isn't needed if you are just securing your phone to the magnet) has very weak glue that doesn't stay on any phone on which I tried it. The metal plate detached from the back of the phones and was left on the base.
3,Worked well for 3 months in the winter. But as soon as the summer months began and my car got warm. The mount began falling off the dash and it couldn’t hold up my phone anymore.
5,I bought this mount for my 13 Pro Max and I love it. The design fits perfectly in the little cubby to the left of the steering wheel in my 2014 GMC Sierra. Almost like it was made for it. Sticks great strong magnet and very sturdy!
5,Bought two so I could have one in my car and truck. The adhesive holds really well and the magnets hold on to the phone pretty damn strong. I have to live up on one side because if not I feel the magnet will rip my dash off. No problem with bumps knocking the phone off at all. Really well build imo
3,I’m new to this MagSafe stuff so with that said I wasn’t really sure about any of this. I purchased this and found that the mag mount that I had for my other phone fit. So I pulled the mag part of the old non MagSafe mount off and screwed just the MagSafe part on and it fit perfect. At first it didn’t really feel like it had very good holding strength so I placed it on and pulled it off a few times and to my surprise it actually has a very strong hold on the phone.. So a week now and it has NOT dropped my 13 pro max and with a MagSafe case it holds even stronger where as when I had a case with an added metal ring to it it didn’t hold all that well but it did work.. Price? I just think it’s a bit much for a magnet
5,YOU NEED THIS DEVICE! It is everything that I could have asked for. Originally I was going to get a MagSafe one that charges the 12 or one that incorporates the Apple MagSafe charger (and charges the 12) but decided that I did not want my phone charging constantly. I researched extensively. This one sticks to the dash wonderfully (I did let it set for 12 hours like it recommends) the magnet holds it plenty strong for the mighty 12 Pro Max (almost hard to shake it off in your hand) and the ball joint is great and holds it at whatever angle you set and lock it at. Very impressed. I bought another for my truck too. I also ordered a vent mount one for when I am in a rental car or her car or whatever. It is also available in a flat mount option and another option or two. Comes with a metal plate for non MagSafe applications but I did not need it. It works AS-IS with any iPhone 12 model or with a MagSafe case as I have. Do it. This is the one!
5,It is exactly what you should get if you simply want a magnetic mount for your iphone 12. I have a pro max and always use a lightning cable for carplay so I didnt want a wireless charging mount as it would probably destroy my battery being plugged into two things at once. This mount allows you to stick on ur phone without needing any accesories apart from your iphone with a magsafe compatible case (that has a good magnet for mounting)… I stuck the mount onto my dashbord and used it immediately and have had ZERO issues with my phone falling off or the mount unsticking. They instruct you to leave it on there for 12 hours before use but if youre like me you wont have that patience. I tried it and it worked! Even so if your mount is having difficulty sticking onto your dashbord the mount comes with two extra pieces of adhesive 3M pieces which is great. Don’t believe any of the negative comments this mount is very well made and sturdy and will definitely make your life better.
4,This works with my case. I am currently using a moment case for the iPhone 12 Pro Max. This does connect though it’s not the super strong magnet I thought it may be. That being said it does hold the phone with no issues. The weight of the phone does allow it to tilt just a tad but it doesn’t affect my set up so eh.Good product and should hold your phone just not Superman strength with or without a case. Just make sure it’s MagSafe. And be aware of weight.
5,If the base be metal it will be perfect
5,This thing will hold your iPhone forever. I've been using it for more than 3 months and it definitely fit it's purpose. Suction power is super strong you can rest assure that your phone will stay there no matter what. I been using it for more than 3 months and is as strong as day one. I tried the ESR Magnetic Car Mount and it didn't last more than 1 month. Only downside of this product is that doesn't have wireless charging but I don't really think that should matter if you can simply plug your phone in. Overall 5/5.
5,So I had this as a mount in my Ford Taurus for about a year. Always worked great and never had any problem with my phone staying on the mount or the mount staying to my dash. About a month ago I got T-boned by someone running a red light going about 50 as I was turning left. Thankfully I was the only one in the car and didn’t get hurt. But my phone called 911 immediately and to my surprise my phone was still on the mount. The mount was still on the dash. Everything else in the car was everywhere it wasn’t before. A tremendous product and I’ll be purchasing a new one for my new car!!
5,I've never gone the magnetic route before and wasn't sure about this approach.  I have a great case I've been using with my 12 Max Pro but it didn't have the MagSafe Ring and the case kept the phone too far away from this mount to make a good connection.  I bought a magsafe case (Linklike [Military Anti-Drop] Compatible for iPhone 12 PRO MAX Case Clear [Compatible with Magsafe Charger]) and I was concerned that it would interfere with the inductive charge on my Anker phone stand.  Turns out it all works fantastically - the magsafe case plus this mount holds it like it was glued on and it still charges great on the Anker stand.I am HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY.NOTES:  Most adhesive products work best when installed above 75 degrees surface temp.  It is important to make sure the surface is clean. - I have a vehicle with metal on the dash so that was the obvious spot to connect but a highly textured plastic might give you some issues.
5,Works exactly as expected
5,I was pretty skeptical about getting this to work with the magsafe case but to my surprise it's perfect. The magnet is very strong and holds the phone without shaking or falling off. The adhesion is not great if you live somewhere that it is going to get super hot. I live in AZ so I had to use super glue in order for it to stick to my dash and not slowly fall off
5,El iman perfecto para el coche
5,Spot on exactly what I needed for securely mounting my iPhone 13Pro Max in my truck.  Securely holds my phone to the mount even with my OtterBox MagSafe phone case on.  No need to use the additional magnetic rings supplied in the box.  It’s much better than any of the vent mount products.  This one is absolutely legit!
5,I have a thin non-magsafe case on my phone and the magnet on this mount is still strong enough to hold my phone. If I go over a large bump the phone will fall off but that is likely due to the case not being magsafe. Even with the case 99% of the time works great.
5,Not sure how this could get a bad review. The adhesion sticker is hearty and it stuck fine (mid-winter) and is stable while driving. I have a Saturn Outlook dash and it stuck right away and isn’t too big that it blocks access to other car functions. Magnet holds strong during driving with Caudabe mag safe case and iPhone 13 pro max. For 20 bucks this is an excellent deal.
5,Replacing a Scosche in car with this and it holds much much stronger.  More flexibility in the mount mechanism and half the price.  Key is you need MagSafe case and/or phone.  I will be buying more of these just for mount purposes the many places my phone goes.  BUY.
5,Works great.  So far it sticks and holds up but time will tell.  I am happy with the purchase.
3,Had to buy new adhesive after couple days but besides that works GREAT
5,Magnetic hold is excellent. It works great for my 13 mini but you should consider all orientations of your phone before you Mount it. The shaft on the mount isn’t long so you won’t have a lot of clearance in some instances. I’d buy it again
3,I really liked this holder it actually sticks great to the back of my iPhone 13pro  but did not stick to my dash. My previous magnetic holder stayed on my dash for a few years so I know it’s not my dash maybe this one just isn’t as sticky too bad. I already threw out the box so I guess I’m stuck with it. So just beware and don’t throw out the box until you are really able to give it a Try and make sure it’s going to work with your vehicle.
3,I bought this mount for my Audi A6. Let me start by saying it's not a "bad" mount. It's sized well and adheres well. My only complaint is it's just not very sturdy. Keep in mind I'm in a VERY smooth riding car and still this mount just vibrates too much. There is just too much play in the design for my liking. I will be sending it back and going a different route.
5,I spent hours searching for a cheap magsafe type magnet dash mount and finally found this one! As long as you clean the dash properly before installation the mount will stick more than securely. I used a metal ring on my iPhone 11 pro and it holds more than enough when you align it right. I have no doubt this mount would hold any size phone whether it be a magsafe iPhone or any other phone with a metal plate/ring.
5,i love how the base of the unit is small so it can actually fit on the metal portions of my dash. the magnetic ring is perfect for magsafe. I use it with my iphone 12 pro max that has a magsafe case and it holds perfectly. been using this for a while now and this is my 2nd time buying it as well. one of my friends loved it so much that i decided to buy one for her as a gift. shes been using it too and loves it. great price
4,So - for my first and ridiculous complaint - I really thought that the stand had that blue ring around the outside and when I realized it didn't I was disappointed. :'(  You are allowed to ridicule me.My only real complaint is that I wish this was taller and more adjustable. I like the way works iPhone 12 Pro Max snaps right on and feels secure - but... the stand is so short that I had to position it way forward on the dash and my phone hangs past the edge so it limits maneuverability. If the stand was taller (and had that blue ring ;) ) it would be perfect.
4,Really like the small footprint of how it attaches to my dashboard. I own a 2018 Toyota Rav4 and have had difficulty with car mounts adhering to my dashboard because of the textured surface. I adhered this mount to the smooth surface of the hard plastic surrounding one of my vents. Phone stays in place with my MagSafe case. The only thing that is not perfect is that the swivel part of the mount doesn't stay in place when I remove my phone. No way to tighten it and concerned about how it will hold up with the wear/use
2,I wanted to like this as the magnet does seem powerful enough for Magsafe cases however the adhesive last not even one day.  I cleaned the location properly stuck the mount on the top portion of my dash and left for 24 hours as instructed.  Put the phone on and within the hour I did traveling it came off.  I have an iphone mini as well which is smaller than most iphones.  Tried the extra adhesive it came with only to get the same result.  Disappointed.
4,I placed it in my Gen2 Raptor.  However the magnetic hold does not work well with a MagSafe case.  I have to take my phone out of my case every single time which is an inconvenience.  My case is as thin as they come for those that are not leather.  It is Torras case slim case which is MagSafe compatible.  That’s the reason for 4 stars!!
5,I love this product!! I was worried about it not being able to hold my phone consistently but it is VERY strong in both the base keeping it in place and also the magnetic feature that 100% keeps my phone in place no matter what. I love this product so much that I bought another one as a gift for someone for Christmas!
5,I have the otter box mag safe case and this mount works with that case wonderfully. No extra stickers needed. Mounted easily with the attached adhesive in 70 degree Texas weather.. it’s sturdy. I drive a lifted pick up truck that rides rough as hell and I have no worries about my phone falling off.
4,Wasn’t right for my dash set up but love the idea of the product. Returned for refund.
5,This thing was way better than I thought it even came with the ring they stick to the back of your phone and it makes your case really stylish if you have a clear one ..projects style  Function and form I would definitely advise everybody to buy this one and the magnet is really powerful really really powerful it’s so satisfying to put this up on the Dash now
3,My phone case is MagSafe compatible and it would not stick to the product. Thank god for the one magnetic ring they give you to stick onto your phone case but still not what I wanted. The adhesive that is already put onto the car mount would not stick at all to the car. I had to take it off and put a new adhesive onto the car mount which they also provided. It did stick on the second time around.
5,I have done every style of mount...and this by far is the best one.  it's low profile not noticeable and just very clean in the car.  Highly recommend.  I only wish it came with an extra sticky mount.  Where i put it I would move it over slightly cause the phone does block the view of my screen in the car slightly.  so just make sure you love where you are putting it before you stick it.
5,I have an iPhone 12pro with a leather MagSafe Apple phone case and this thing feels like an extension of the MagSafe lineup. I have no complaints! I was looking for a phone holder that does not require you to add a metal sheet to the back of your phone this is it👍🏼
5,The adhesion of this mount is wonderful so far! It’s the perfect mount for an iPhone 13 pro max. It even came with a magnet to attach to my non MagSafe case which was the topping on the cake for me.
5,I wanted a car mount that was small but also worked really well. This one is just that. I live in a colder climate and it continued to stick in negative temperatures.The magnet on this works great with my iPhone 13 as well.
5,Works great strong magnets
2,Major design flaw: ADHESIVE SUCKS! And not is a good way. I followed all instructions explicitly and one week later it fell right off my dash. They need a way better adhesive. I know there’s better stuff out there because another brand I got off Amazon has stuck through 103 degree weather! Returned because it’s completely WORTHLESS without the right adhesive!
2,I have gone through 2 of the adhesions in about a month and a half. In the beginning the adhesive worked great after a few weeks it begins to peel off from the dashboard and no longer sticks. They provide 2 extra adhesive strips down to my last one in less than 2 months. Not worth the money and of course outside the return window. Have it a 2 star because the actual mag safe works great!
3,It holds on amazing to the phone on dirt roads and off-roading and such. It has never fallen off once. Well that’s for the magnets. The adhesive that sticks to the dash is not that strong and will fall off if it’s not on a flat part of the dash.
3,The magnet holds my phone just fine But the plastic arm is not very sturdy.
5,Finally a mount that actually lives up to its hype! I have an iPhone 13 Pro Max and I’ve tried and returned several magnet mounts. This is the first one to actually work as promised.
5,I don’t like a lot of bulk and hate vent clips. This one is perfect and works with my phone case. I got the MS-02 it doesn’t bounce around or fall off. Would 100% buy again.
5,Love this product!  It obviously doesn't charge the phone.....hopefully people read before leaving a bad product review.  I have this mounted on my workbench outside.  Love how strong the magnets are.....and the adhesive keeps everything locked into place!  $19 is a little steep for no charging capability.....but Im very happy with the product. I've used this with my iPhone 12 mini and 13 mini (with Magsafe case).  Sorry can't speak for an iPhone Max phone but based on how strongly this mount holds my phone.....I think you'd be fine with a Max.
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Most important thing to know about this is in my experience the magnet is good. It can hold the phone at any angle. However in my case I had one chance to get this thing to stick and it was there for all of two seconds. The adhesive is really poor quality which is a bummer because the rest of it is honestly well made. Just that piece of "adhesive" is bad.
5,I have tried several mag phone holders with no luck. I didn'tt want to spend $30 or $40 for a holder so I thought I would try this one. after a few weeks I can say it holds fantastic. Has not dropped phone once.
5,This magnetic phone holder is very sturdy. It does not take up a lot of space and is not at all cumbersome.
5,I was looking for a mount that did not hinder the A/C vents. I found this one and it has worked out really well!
4,This is a good item the magnet hold really good my phone with or without MagSafe case the only bad thing is I wasn’t able to put it in the dashboard bc never stick it in but works good in the windshield
5,This product works great and sticks to my dash even when on rough roads. Keeps my phone reachable and viewable.
3,this product is really good the magnet is very strong the only complaint i have on this product is the adhesive that sticks to the dash comes apart so far it came off 6 times u can put it back it will stick for couple of days and then falls off so for i got lucky when it did fall off i never had my phone on it normally when i wanted to drive in the morning i would notice if it came off or not and one time it fell under the pedal of the gas and i was trying to press the gas pedal but it was going down then noticed it was the mount i wish the adhesive was stronger  if it was it would have been the best product ever
3,I’m on the 3rd adhesive pad - they continue to lift up and eventually fall. The magnet piece is good - holds the phone well but it doesn’t matter.
5,I love Quarble's Magnetic Dashboard Car Mount! I've done a lot of research & even tried others - this is the Perfect Solution! It holds my iPhone 12 Pro Max very securely - I use a 3rd Party Mag-Safe case with no problems! Also I have limited "smooth" space on my dashboard - with the Quarble's base being only 1.5" wide & adhering so securely it's the Perfect Solution! I love Quarble's Dashboard Mount so much I'm purchasing their Air Vent Mount Pro Max. I like it's portability & stabilizing arm. It's the Perfect Solution! for when I'm driving or riding in other people's cars. I highly recommend Quarble!
5,Worth the money but needs extra stick tape in case the first one does not work recommend it it’s a good product
5,So far so good just make sure you put it on a smoth surface otherwise it won’t stick
5,I was looking for something compact that would hold my iPhone 12 Pro with Magsafe rather than the historical requirement to have a case with a magnetic plate in. Also I would rather avoid covering up vents with the vented option. It sticks well. I do notice some vibration of the phone while driving but this appears to just be the weight of the phone on the plastic mount i.e. phone is secure and the mount is secure to the dashboard too. Note that this does not do wireless charging. I knew that when I bought it as I wanted to avoid having a cable permanently dangling plugged into the USB port. The perfect product.
5,Very sturdy and the MagSafe is great!
3,I find it very difficult to find a place on a modern dash board where this will work because of its range of motion and it’s too short to use on top of the dash itself.
5,I’ve only used this for a week now so I hope the sticker to hold it up will not fail me when I drive on some bumpy road making my phone fall. Only time will tell if this will hold up.
5,This easily attached to the car dash! I was really wondering if it would be adequate to hold my iPhone 13 but it is! :)
3,It didn't stick very well given how heavy iphones are so I had to add extra layers of adhesive tape for it to work. Now it works but it doesn't look nice. I would eventually buy something else.
5,So the adhesive does not work at all. I was able to find a 3m sticky pad that most similar dash cams use to stick it on the dash. However you must let it sit for 20 minutes for it to be fully functional. It does stick to the phone decent enough and did not fall on me. But adhesive sucks.
5,This works exactly as designed. Make sure to clean the area and follow directions on applying the tape base. If it isn't clean or you use it right away it doesn't form a good bond and will not stay on as long. I see many reviews about it not working in hot places but its regularly 100+ where I am and I have had no issues.
5,I absolutely love this device! I use and depend on this everyday. My phone never moves or falls. I have a magnetic charging case for my iPhone so it strongly attaches. It is my best device!
5,Muy buen producto.. Perfecto para mi iphone 13 pro. Muy buen pegamento.. Asegurate bien donde lo pondrás..porque no hay manera de despegarlo. Lo cual me parece bien pues mi teléfono estará seguro. El iman muy fuerte. Excelente.
2,Worked great and as advertised initially but broke after a little over a month. See the picture. Ordered 7/11/22 and broke on 8/17/22.
5,No issues does exactly what it’s supposed to. Haven’t had any issues with the adhesion or the magnet holding my phone up. Great product
4,Works good
2,It worked great at first. The mount itself adheres well with the 3M sticker. However at about 4-5 months of use the rotating piece no longer holds its position. So your phone will fall any which way making the phone in viewable and the stand worthless.
5,Great product and will be ordering more
5,The product is good and a good value so 5 stars. IMO the stanchion should be about 1/2" longer to accommodate being able to tilt a phone downward with a greater range of motion without the phone touching the base. This would especially apply using it with larger phones. I currently us it with an iPhone 12pro.
5,I installed this in my 2013 Hyundai Elantra Coupe this a.m..  There is so much Road Construction where I live I figured that if the magnet could hold under our conditions it could stand up to most anything. It’s 18 miles from my Home to my Office. The phone was solid as could be. Minimal vibration etc. I like this mount as good as any I’ve ever had. It sticks to the Dash great. I’m using an Otterbox Aneue on an IPhone 12 Pro.
5,Will my phone stick to it strongly? YES!Do you need a case? NO!If using a case does it to have to be MagSafe? YES! If you have a non-MagSafe case the magnets do not work.Does it mount well to the car? YES!Does the mount leave residue when taking it off? NO! After adhering it to my dash I decided to move it peeled off very nicely.Exactly what I and probably you were looking for in a MagSafe car mount.
5,After searching hard to find a new holder for my car I settled on this Quarble device.  It works very well and holds my phone very strongly on my dash with the Wannap ring attached to the back of my case.
5,Holds phone without needing extra magnets! I drive a lot and have yet to see this mount drop my phone. Great quality too
5,This product works great with my magsafe iPhone 12 and magsafe silicone case.  It has adhered well although I did heat up the 3m adhesive a little bit first using a hair dryer. I mounted it upside down on a section of molding that is beginning to slope horizontly but is still solid with very little vibration while driving.  It allows me to mount the phone and plug it into apple car play in my F150 with one hand very easily which is great.  It also fits in well with the rest of the interior. I Would definitely recommend this product.
1,Purchased the product in January 2022. Nine months later the adhesive has lost its adhesiveness completely and fallen off my dashboard. When the product works it’s great. But the mount is now completely useless as it can no longer stick to my dashboard.One other minor issue is that when taking my phone off of the mount it causes the mount to rotate slightly. After multiple times of placing my phone and removing it from the mount the plastic screw that keeps the mount tightly in position comes loose and requires me to manually tighten it. Seems like the manufacturer could have made the screw portion tighter so this doesn’t occur.
5,Absolutely love this in my car works great
5,This mount works great. I was Concerned because I have iPhone 13 Pro Max that’s large and heavy.I’ve been using it a week now and it’s sturdy and holds up well.
5,It holds your phone tighter then a toddler will.
2,I liked a lot about this mount. It adhered well to the caar surface the magnetic connection to the phone was great and adjusted easily.I was bummed out this morning when I tried to use it and the plastic snapped.  I won't purchase this mount again.
5,I am extremely happy with this mount. It uses 3M tape so it's very sticky. The mounting surface was a little bigger than I expected (just under 1 1/2") but it worked perfectly with my iPhone 12 Pro and this case (https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B08MTB916M). The package contained a round plate as well but IT'S NOT NECESSARY for a MagSafe phone/case.  Just be aware that the the included plate does interfere with Qi chargers if you're using this on a non-MagSafe phone.If you're using this on a MagSafe phone and you have a 1 1/2" flat spot to stick it it's absolutely perfect.
5,Hooks on like crazy with a MagSafe case. Not the best if you have a non MagSafe  case but it will still hold
4,This works perfect for what I needed which is a dash mount for my 12 pro max. Only issue is that the double stick tape that came with it did not work. Used my own 3M double stick and it is now locked down.
5,Works great
5,Designed for IPhone 12 with or without MagSafe cases. I use it with an apple silicone MagSafe case and it is perfect. The magnet is strong and holds my 12 perfectly fine and that’s in a lifted Ram that rides rough and bounces around a lot. The other side is very sticky 3M that you can mount anywhere. If your not using this on a iPhone 12 with a MagSafe case then I would look into a smaller alternative that uses other metal plates for the case as this is big and made for the 12.
5,This is my third phone mount and this one is awesome. It holds the phone and stays put on dash. Best one I’ve found
5,Great MagSafe phone mount. Magnet is super strong and holds my phone very tight. 3M mounting tape is excellent. Clean area with alcohol prior to application.
5,For the price this product is excellent. Easy to attach and phone does not slip at all!
3,Magnets are strong but the mount is made more for vertical surfaces and not horizontal surfaces. The range of rotation is limited when used on a horizontal surface but works great on vertical surfaces due to the mount design.
3,The magnet holds good but the glue is horrible it couldn’t sustain the weight of my 13 pro max.
5,It’s magnet is strong and works great! I’m glad I bought this holder.
2,The foam sticky pad isn’t nearly sticky enough to stay stuck to the dash. The magnet on the mount is not strong enough to be used through a phone case. When I attached the ring magnet to my phone case the magnet was so strong it pulled the mount off the dash. Also with the magnet on the phone case the wireless charging won’t work anymore so I have to take the case off every night. If it wasn’t past the return window I’d return it.
5,I'm using mine with an iPhone 12 Pro Max with Apple MagSafe Case. It has been stuck on my dash for over a month and the iPhone hasn't once fallen off. That's pretty impressive for as small as the adhesion patch is. My only caution would be you need to make sure you have something smooth to stick it too. Pebbled dashes may not work as well. It is also very short so placement can be difficult depending on your dash arrangement.
5,Love how easy it is to set up and that it works readily
5,This magnet is VERY STRONG!!! Very well worth it!!!
5,I installed this in a 1997 Jeep Wrangler on a custom mount at the top of the dash. The included adhesive is sticking well to the enamel painted steel. The magnet is strong enough to hold my iPhone 12 Pro in place even with the bouncy ride of the old Jeep. It’s been installed for about two months now and my iPhone hasn’t fallen off once. Going to buy a second one for my wife’s car.
5,I use this for my iPhone 12 with case.  It holds strongly.
4,Awesome.....BUT....Had to heat up the sticky part with a hairdryer to get it tacky enough to stick to the dash but once I did it stuck strong and the magnet for the iPhone with the MagSafe case is strong and perfect. Love it. Makes me drive safer.
4,It’s good. Strong magnet but the adhesive only lasted a week. Same issue with other brands so I use a strong glue to mount it. Overall it’s very strong
5,Just as described works perfectly.
5,This dash mount works great. Magnet holds IPhone 13 great.
5,Perfect!  Not bulky like Steelie
5,Tried a few magnets out there on Amazon. This one worked perfectly on my iPhone 12 pro. Only flaw was that if your going to use a case. Make sure its magsafe compatible like the Apple ones and it will work perfectly.
5,Not much to write here. It works well and I love it.Got a second one for our other car.
1,I had high hopes for this.  The magnet is very powerful.  If only the base wasn't a cheap plastic that came off within 2 days of the 24 hour cure time.  Literally pulling the phone off because the magnet is strong pulled the base almost all the way off (yes I followed the installation instructions).  Once the base was pulled away it would not re-attach.  I will also say the piece that the magnet is attached to is incredibly cheap plastic.  I have used others (which I still have in my car and put my keys on etc are made of much nicer bases.  In short the Mag magnet is great the attachment is not. Waste of $
5,Magnet is strong but the mount itself is poorly designed. If you want to mount on a flat surface like the top of your dash it doesn’t have enough range on the swivel to allow your phone to rest 90° so I’m stuck mounting my mount 90° from where I wanted it to allow my phone to sit straight up and down
5,I have an older vehicle that has the console with a CD player and yes even a cassette player. Without selecting the "Front Dash" I had only a few other options for an area to place it.  It fit perfectly in the center area on the console below everything and did not block the use of any of the audio features of my car.  Very firm grip and easy to use.
5,The magnet is strong!!
3,The magnetism and adhesion were not as good as I expected.
5,This thing holds on STRONG! If it were a charging mount I’d buy five! As it is it’s still a great mount! Simple and strong!
3,Good suction but the adhesive is very bad. It would not stick to my dash and kept falling off due to the weight of of the phone.
5,Works as advertised
4,Actually works really well.  Couldn’t find anywhere to mount it in my model 3 buy I ended up putting it in the shower lol.Works perfect with MagSafe
1,This only stayed stuck to the top of my dash for less than 2 months in the Georgia summer heat. During that time I had to constantly apply pressure to keep it from pealing all the way off. Not worth it magnet isn’t even that strong either. Spend the extra money on one that will last longer than a few months.
5,Fantastic finish holds well on my dash. And the magnet holds my 13 pro max very tight. I’ve got a lowered truck that’s bouncy and the phone doesn’t budge. I highly recommend.
5,Works really well with mag safe cases.
5,Love this product!  I was able to easily attach it to my dashboard I let it set a day before using and now I just put my iphone  12 pro max on it  and it stays put. I am also able to us this product with a mag safe case with no issues. My phone is now in perfect view when using it for directions  etc.
5,Easy installation and pretty unobtrusive design.  I have been using it for about a month now with no issues. Phone with Apple MagSafe leather case stays on even over bumps and rough roads.  Build quality seems just OK but given that it remains in place it should hold up fine.
2,The magnet is strong but the sticky that comes with it fell off after a month.  Now I have a magnetic mound with know sticky :(
3,Nice new style MagSafe mount. I wish it was able to angle more though. In my car it always tilts slightly up and I’m unable to make it perfectly vertical. This is an issue depending on the angle of the sun hitting the phone. I’ll have to search for a different mount.
5,Best purchase from amazon in a while!  I was skeptical of the holding power at time of purchase but now that I have the product I am confident this baby will hold my phone without a problem!  The footprint is small and installation is a breeze.  Get you one!
5,I don't have wireless carplay so I need to plug my phone in.  All of the fancy wireless versions are not needed.  And the Belkin is expensive and large.  I wanted a smallish mount that would hold my huge 12 pro max out of the way.  This does that very well.
5,Does exactly what it says.  Holds the phone VERY securely right through the MagSafe case.  Old magnetic mounts can't get hold of the magsafe ring like this does.  Incidentally it fit right on the ball of my old magnetic mount which was already well secured to the dash.
2,I was really excited to get this product to replace my previous magnetic holder (which is AWESOME).  Unfortunately this doesn't have the magnetic strength to keep my new 13 pro max in place.  I drive a lifted Wrangler that's kind of bouncy but my other mount had no problem keeping my XS max in place and solid.  My phone doesn't stay straight and pops if I hit a bump or pot hole.  I definitely will replace with something else.
5,Pretty good and perfect size too!
5,Great quality super strong hold.
1,After carefully mounting in my car waiting the 12 hours so the adhesive sets I tried to use it to hold my phone on the dash. IT FIRS NOT HOLD! The circular magnet which is supposedly the magna is not the least big magnetic. Total disappointment. I’d rate this “0 stars” if I could.
5,Love how snugly it holds the phone even during  sharp turns or a bumpy ride!  My phone kept falling off or bouncing  with a different devise.
2,I stuck the mount on my dashboard and I waited the noted 12 hours for the adhesive to get as sticky as it was supposed to on the surface and I used it for the first time today after letting it sit overnight and it lasted five minutes before it fell off my dashboard. Super disappointed. The ring magnet portion itself was pretty sturdy it held my phone really well but the adhesive to the dashboard absolutely does not work.
5,I bought 2 different makes for my 12 pro. The other one is too small to match the internal magnet in my phone. This one is perfect and I like the soft rubber landing pad. If you have an iPhone with built-in magnet you'll need something this wide in diameter. Excellent item!! Thanks
5,As long as you have some sort of magsafe case this magnet will work great! It was a good purchase
1,The magnet was strong and could hold my phone but the suction cup would not stick to my dashboard. Every time I’d try to secure it and place my phone on the magnet it would fall over.
5,My very bumpy Jeep Wrangler is no match for this holder it sticks very well and doesn’t slip and is easy to use and pull off at ease
5,With an Apple leather magsafe case on a 12 mini this thing is nice and strong!Having never used magsafe nor any magnetic mounts prior I was half expecting something weak but nope snaps itself into place & holds firm. I have no concerns about my phone coming loose.
4,Other than weak double sided tape that need to be replaced with something stronger the magnet is plenty strong and there is zero wobble when driving.
3,The mount is great grabs the iPhone 12 works great... the adhesive didn't last a few weeks in the Texas heat... now can't use it at all...
5,Good
5,I have the iPhone 13 pro max and this holds it GREAT! No problem what so ever.
1,I purchased this for my new Apple 13 Pro and found the adhesive ring that is required to be glued to the phone will hold better the mount than it does with the phone. A number of problems as the ring stayed on the mount or my phone fell to the floor on the slightest bump in the road. Not cool. Not for those who have a slightly heavy phone.
5,I wish the neck was a little longer for my needs but it works well and I would recommend it
5,Very satisfied it does the job such a great product I bought two more of them.
5,This thing works very well for what it is keep in mind it does not charge your iPhone it is literally just a MagSafe holder for iPhone 12 series devices This thing stuck like a glove it’s not going nowhere in my amateur testing it did not move and shake it all.
5,Works like it’s supposed to. The MagSafe dock is fantastic.
1,I have purchased this item 5 times.  Love the strength of the magnet but the arms that hold the magnet are small and break.  3 out of my 5 have broken off.  Look for other options.  Do not buy this one.
5,This MagSafe Mount works great.  The hold is fantastic. I drive a Jeep Wrangler and it is not the smoothest ride but the phone has not slipped once in 3 weeks of using this.  Like it so much I’m gonna buy another one for my wife’s car.
5,It’s a decent mount and there’s nothing wrong with it at all. Perfect for what it advertises just kinda want a wireless charger and a MagSafe charger. Still probably best bang for buck MagSafe magnet that will actually work on the market from what I’ve reviewed available
2,This thing required my attaching a HUGE metal plate to the back of my iPhone 12 Pro Max case .  .  . BUMMER!  The dashboard mount had to be mounted VERY CLOSE to the front edge of my Hyundai Santa Fe dashboard in order for the phone to be at a decent angle for viewing.  I am sure that MANY folks love this mount but I don't!  The metal plate looked just AWFUL on the back of my phone and prevented wireless charging.  NO THANKS!!!  I gave it a 5 star rating for adhesion because I thought I'd never get the metal plate removed from the back of my phone case but when I did it left a permanent mark.  NO THANKS!!!
4,Was really hard to get to stick to the dash board! Had to heat it up first
1,The magnet that holds the phone is amazing. Very strong and held my iPhone perfectly.CON: I properly cleaned and applied the adhesive side to dashboard. Let it sit the recommended time before using and still only stay stickler for about 30 mins into our 8 hour road trip. Sooo frustrating
2,The mount just falls off the dashboard when I put my phone on it. It does not stick to the dash what so ever.
5,Set it up on my dash and let it stick for 12 hours before use. Holds my 12 Pro Max just fine and handles bumpy roads and freeway drive like a champ.Great versatile rotating head.Note: I do have a MagSafe compatible case
1,The magnet worked really well on my phone but the actual holder would not stick to any of the surfaces in my vehicle.
1,I have a MagSafe case for my phone . The magnet is not strong. One bump and my phone falls off . It should be noted I don’t have an overly large phone either - I have the iPhone 13 mini. I wouldn’t purchase this again.
5,Serves its purpose. I’ve been looking for a very simple MagSafe phone mount with vent attachment or suction cup and this it great.
2,This product worked great for a few weeks and then the adhesive started loosening. A couple days later it fell completely off and there’s no easy way to reattach it. Unfortunately I just missed the return window by a few days.I wish I would have bought a mount that uses a suction cup instead of adhesive.The MagSafe connection works fine - the mount is just kind of useless after the one adhesive sticker fails. I was using with an iPhone 12 Pro (not the Max which is obviously heavier). I do not recommend.
5,This works exactly like I wanted. Strong magnet. I don’t worry about my phone falling.
5,It hold my iPhone 13 made my life so easy
4,Heat doesn’t like adhesive
5,This works great in my Tundra for my iPhone 12 mini (along with my MagSafe Otterbox case). I live in Alaska and drive on very bumpy roads and it has yet to fall off. Purchasing one for my wife’s car now.
5,Great little mag nice compact doesn’t get in the way of anything.  Holds my 12 pro Max with MagSafe case securely and it looks as if it was factory installed. All and all great little product no bulk to the dash.
5,I just bought a second one for my other car. The first one I got works great. It sticks perfectly to the dashboard. I didn't use the magnetic plate for my iPhone 12 and it holds great my phone (with a magsafe case). highly recommend it.
4,Works great with my MagSafe phone case.
2,Tried to remount 3 times the way the instructions said to fell every time. The magnet worked great but the adhesive pads did not.
5,This is the third one I've tried for the new iPhone Mag lock phones.  This is the only one that seems to stick securely and feels like there is more "magnetism" than the others I've tried.
3,The product is great however I am having trouble with it sticking to my dash. I can not get it to stick for more than a couple of seconds. Any advice on how to get it to stick to my dash properly?
1,Buy beware! There’s no way this product works unless maybe if you live in the North Pole. I stuck this to my dash following instructions waited the 12 hours. The dash gets hot and this falls right off when you try to put your phone on it. The glue just melts. It’s a terrible cheap design. I don’t think this would work for anyone if it gets the slightest bit warm where you live.
5,This works perfectly with my MagSafe case on my iPhone 12 Pro Max. My phone is secure and has not fallen off even on very rough roads. Highly recommend if you want a reliable mount.
1,It wouldn’t even stick to my dash after 5 min….. it just falls off. Not worth the money at all. Such a bummer…
2,Product stopped sticking after 4 days of use… that should be enough to be said about this product. Looked like a promising device unfortunately didn’t live up to expectations.
5,Perfect for my MagSafe case
2,First off I want to say that I had looked at so many reviews to see how good the car MagSafe holder.  After having it for 3 hours I find out that it does not stick.  It fell off.  Very cheaply made and definitely not worth the money.  There is NO customer support.  They are flea market phone holders.  Don’t waste your time or money!
3,It worked great for a couple of months but the heat of July made the adhesive warp and it will no longer hold the mount up.
5,Nice hold.  I needed a 17mm ball joint magnet for interchangeability with other mounts such as arkon.  This seems to be more or less the standard size so I’m happy to find this.
5,I have a tacoma and it allows my to quickly set my phone onto the console without much ado .  Magnet is strong enough to hold phone without having it slide off.
5,3M adhesive tape holds the mount firm to surfaces.  It's a terrific mount.  I don't know that i'd recommed it for non iPhone users the included magnetic plate blocks the Qi charging bases of non-magsafe phones.
1,Worked great the first couple days when cloudy but the first sunny day it unstuck from the dash immediately and would not re-adhere even with the replacement adhesive
5,Mount easily to any flat smooth surface. Holds phone great even in a truck bouncing down the road
1,This mount is small enough to place anywhere in your car and the magnet is very strong. So strong in fact that when I remove my phone from the mount the rubber pad stays attached to the phone and completely comes off the plastic mount. Cheap poorly designed garbage. Returning… don’t bother buying it
2,I can’t get it to stick on my dash board.  Put it on and waited for 24 hours plus.  Put phone on it went on a couple bumps in road and the adhesive comes unstuck.  The magnetic stick great.  Don’t know any other way to make it stick
5,love it. Fits and works really well with iPhone 13
1,Product sucks. Phone always falls off of it and the swivel is very weak and wore out so it’s always down all the time.  Find something better.
2,Loved the product until I was cut off and had to hit the breaks. My dog slammed into the mount and broke it. The plastic design of the arm makes it very weak for repeated use.
3,Magnet seems strong enough to hold my iPhone 12 but going over a rough road or larger bump it falls off about 50% of the time... Just not quite strong enough.
2,The base doesnt stick to any surface in the car but i was able to pop out the ball socket and use it with my CD phone holder mount so not a waste for me… buuut make sure you have a different mount to use this with
5,Love the item i used it to suction my phone in car and still can connect my phone with charging cable so that I can use carplay. Good item.
4,Good product
2,The adhesion is not good at all. It doesn’t stick to my car.
1,Fell off after 48 hours without me even putting my phone on it yet.
2,The idea is great but if you’re using an iPhone modem after …say…a 6s the iPhone doesn’t fit because the height doesn’t leave space for the bottom half of the phone.
5,Works great. I have a third party MagSafe case and the phone mount works really well with it! Worth the money for $20! Highly recommend
1,This thing doesn't have enough adhesive strength to stick. Absolute garbage.
5,Really strong magnet. I have it in my bathtub to watch YouTube. Sticks really well! No extra magnetic plate needed. Just wished they had a suction version.
1,Mounting tape wouldn’t stick to dash phone weight kept pulling it off. Although it had a great magnetic connection.😆
5,Works great with an Apple case
2,Very strong magnet. Really like how easily the phone snaps to the mount. However the adhesive does not work very well. The mount fell of the dashboard with my phone attached several times. It happens mostly when the heater is on and especially if the ride is bumpy. I have a Jeep.
3,Magnets not strong enough. Phone keeps falling off under heavy acceleration
5,Strong magnets holds my iPhone 12 Pro while driving in tight curves or over bumps without any issues.Just purchased a second one for my other vehicle.
5,I have used it for a couple of days now. It fits perfectly on my dash and holds my phone with no problem
5,Bought for my husband and he really likes it.  Works great and strong magnet so his phone does not fall off.
5,the magnet is plenty strong to hold my 12 pro max in place and not even think about it falling off. worth the money for sure.
5,Adhesions was surprisingly good given the price. The magnet is quite strong. Great piece for the value.
5,Works great holds my iPhone 12 Pro Max using the MagSafe technology. This is exactly what I was looking for and I’m satisfied with the purchase.
5,Grabs the phone every time and doesn't let go until I pull it off.  Dash adhesive still holding strong.Great product.
1,The adhesive did not work and my phone fell off the dash. The extra adhesive pads were no better. The phone did not always stay on the magnetic pad and I struggled to place it as it would not stay. Do not recommend.
5,Bought this to replace an older magnetic one one in my car. It’s great very strong magnet.
5,Very strong adhesion to my phone even through my Spigen case. The included 3M stick tape adheres very well too. Good articulation on the ball joint.
5,Great mount for the price. iPhone 12pro max no problem with a mag safe case or with no case.
2,I tried this in my car where a previous similar phone holder worked great. The hard rigid plastic allows for no flexibility for the base to curve to anything. It worked for a week but I think the afternoon heat in the car pulled the edges off and made the mount come off completely.
1,Magnet broke.
5,This is great option to the more expensive one from apple. works perfect with apple mag case.
5,I like it. And so far they are the only one on the market with such a great product for iphone 12
5,Could not fit other holders in my car without taking up too much room. This fits perfectly!
2,The magnet is good and works with MagSafe and 3rd party MagSafe case. I'm not sure if I got a dud or what but the adhesive doesn't stick to anything. I tried on a brand new flat smooth dash panel and it wouldn't stay by itself. There's barely any stick to it at all. Huge bummer as the rest of the item is exactly what I wanted.
1,This phone holder has a rubber slip cover that goes over the magnet and slips on to the base. It is a strong hold but the rubber cover pulls off when you are disconnecting your phone and the rubber cover tore so it is no longer useable. This is a terrible design and would not recommend it at all. A total waste of money. Need to get my money back.
1,I installed this in my car (Audi Q5) and it does not stick to the dashboard at all. I let it stick for 24 hours before using it and it fell off immediately. Complete waste of money do not recommend.
2,I’m not sure if it’s just the material of my dashboard but this thing just wasn’t sticking to my car I figured the material used would be better than sticky adhesive plastic or whatever . But it lasted me a couple weeks then my phone went flying off the dashboard one day. Wouldn’t recommend. I guess you get what you pay for 🤷🏽‍♂️🤣
5,Works great even with one case for my iPhone 12
3,It was a ok device don’t like the cheep tuner cover
5,Best car mount I’ve ever purchased. Super strong magnet that works with my iPhone 12 MagSafe feature. Highly recommend!
1,Does not come with the correct car mount. Has additional adhesives for mount in photo provided on Amazon but no mount.
1,Used this once on my golf push cart the plastic holding the magnet broke so it is useless now.  The magnet could be stronger too in my opinion.
5,👍🏼 Works way better than expected. Attaches directly to the iPhone 12 with no additional plate or case. Very nice
5,This car mount is great magnet holds phone in place and doesn't let go. Works great for speaker phone too!
1,It did not work I left for the set amount time to stick did not stick to my vehicle dashboard don’t bother buying because when you try to refund they make you jump through hoops in order to get your money back please do not buy no I do not have a picture as it is back in the box as I am frustrated with the merchandise if it wasn’t for me spending so much money on something that didn’t work I would throw it in the garbage.
1,ZERO stars I received it a few hours ago for the past 6 hours it’s not sticking to the car.
1,I received damaged product. Its worthless anymore.
1,Product lasted for 3 days I have MagSafe case on my phone works on all other things but this is the only product that keeps dropping my phone.My truck is smooth and it still drops it. I’m not risking my phone breaking cuz of this.
1,Not worth the money don’t buy it. The picture of this product in turquoise is very pretty but when you get the phone holder it is black that is false advertising. It didn’t stick well to the dash and I ended up throwing it in the garbage. Not worth buying.
1,This Mount seemed very promising at first when opened. Great magnetic hold on my iPhone and 3M adhesive is strong. Then I attached it to my dashboard and attached myphone and it went downhill from there. My phone stays on the Mount but as you drive the weight of the phone makes the arm sag completely changing the angle you want your phone at making this Mount completely useless. I have to lift my phone back up to the correct angle multiple times while driving. Don’t purchase this if you want your phone to stay in one place.
1,I bought this after seeing positive reviews. I attached it according to the package directions to the dash in my car including letting it sit for 24 hours before use. It fell off 2 days later the second time I used it. Find something better.
1,For something so expensive you would think it would be sturdy. My last one cost me $5 plus an adhesive disk for the dashboard for another $6. This product is way overpriced. Terrible I will be returning it.
1,This drove me crazy!! The section was too much and it was very frustrating to get my phone off it. I often peeled the whole thing of it. And it finally broke after 1 month of frustration.
3,For well but the lock to keep the head from rotating isn’t great
1,The magnet was so strong that it ripped through the cheaply made cover of the mount and is still stuck to my phone. I'm going to need a tool to try to get it off. It's like it's super glued on. I can't believe they made such a strong magnet and such a weak cover that barely went over the mount. You will be disappointed.
2,I bought this for my car but the quality was pretty crappy. I returned it and bought something more substantial.
5,Works excellently with my Qi case. A lot better than I thought it would.
2,I’m not one to write reviews but this has a really hard time sticking to my car. Magnet is good.
5,Great little product for my MagSafe phone and phone case. Magnet strength is perfect!
1,It didn’t stick to my dash. Only lasted a few days. Bought my own adhesive and still didn’t work. My last one worked better. I only switched because of the MagSafe but I’m going back to my old car mount. It was a waste of money sadly.
5,No extra plate required. Holds the pro max perfectly.
1,Did not do anything it was advertised.  Didn’t hold phone didn’t adhere to the dash completely useless.
5,Worked as Describe and I am planning on buying another
1,I was very happy until it broke today. How is that possible to break after exactly one month? I pulled the cellphone and the whole mount broke. Yes! The magnet power was enough to break the base.
1,I follow the instructions exactly how it was shown I placed the car mount on the dashboard with the adhesive and waited 24 hours. When I came back the next day I put the phone onto the car mounts and it magnetized just fine. But as soon as I went to pull my phone off of the car mount the entire adhesive came off of the car. Then I tried again with the extra sticker that came with it and the next day it did the exact same thing. Do not purchase this product.
5,This thing is amazing. Great suction and holds the phone super tight.
5,Works for me in my pov and Mack truck.
2,Magnet is good adhesive is bad
1,I was not able to get this to stick to any surface in my car. The surfaces I tried were all clean and I waited before sticking my phone to it. The mount fell off as soon I started driving and I did not even have my phone attached to it. I will say that my phone attached to the mount very well. But that’s not helpful when the mount won’t stick to the car. I’ll be returning this.
5,Holds my iPhone 12 Pro Max perfectly.
1,I followed all instructions but the adhesive did not last. Disappointed as I liked everything about the design
1,Suction didn’t stick to the window and when it did my phone would flop off of it when I turned or hit a bump.
1,This didn’t stick to my dashboard and I missed the return window which is my bad but still annoying haha
1,The adhesive that comes with the kit is bad…I used the pre mounted 3m tape and the additional pieces they included and still couldn’t get the product to stick..I had to go buy my own double sided 3M tape to install product.
1,Every adhesive that it brought has fallen down i bought some and it worked for a little bit. But i tried cleaning the area very well and everything and it still did not work.
5,Overall great product no issues
2,Nice DM but actual quality wasn’t good. Rubbery plate I don’t think it will last long in the car
5,Love love love
1,The adhesive on this thing is not strong or big enough for my iPhone 13 Max Pro. The whole thing tell off within 5 minutes. I cleaned the area of my car glass stereo face with alcohol. Then I put yit on and pressed it hard for a few minutes. I let it set up over night in about 70 degree temp but the next morning total failure.
1,When I opened the box the product was stuck to the box because the plastic protecting the adhesive wasn’t even on. So now the adhesive is worn out and this is basically worthless now. Very unfortunate I was looking forward to using this.
5,Perfect
1,Worked great for awhile then it fell off my dash.
1,Don’t waste your money on this thing.
1,Adhesive is useless. Doesn’t stick to anything rendering the product completely ineffective.
1,It sticks great to the dash of my car but the actual magnet got loose after a month and my phone won’t stay put. It’s annoying but still works
1,Magnet good and strong. However the mount would not stay attached to my dash. I cleaned and dried my dashboard before attaching. Held mount firmly against dash for 30 seconds. It felt attached until I put my phone on the mount. It held for less than a second b4 falling to the floor. I’m sure it would be fine had I placed on the glass window or something similar in texture. Unfortunately my dashboard is too deep for that to be an option.
1,I've been using this with an iPhone 12 mini in an Apple magsafe case and it seems to work pretty well. The magnets are powerful and the adhesive seems strong enough. Obviously I don't know if the adhesive will hold up that remains to be seen. For what it is it is overpriced. I think a 9.99 price is appropriate but if the adhesive stands strong it'll be worth it!UPDATE AUG 8: the adhesive failed and it has fallen off. This thing will not work well in hot cars.
1,Box arrive in a horrible beat up condition and product was dirty. Also didn’t come as advertised. Just the magnetic puck and some adhesive. Not the stand as advertised. Definitely not worth $19.
5,Loved this
5,Works great
5,cool
1,Absolutely worthless. I bought a MagSafe case for my pro max to make sure this would work. It constantly falls off. I’m worried about my screen breaking when it falls so I will not be using it.
1,Its supper week
1,I was hoping this would have worked but sadly the magnets are not strong enough to hold my phone even with the ring installed on the outside of my case.
1,Product adheres well to iPhone 13 but DOES NOT adhere to any surface in vehicle.  Tried glass and at least 2 different surface types inside my vehicle and even attempted both adhesion pads that come with the product.  I would strongly recommend going another direction before you purchase this product.
1,Tried this on my glass screen on the dash.  Tried new adhesives they provided. Would not hold my iphone 12s.  A total waste of money.
2,Did he serve on the product is horrible how do use gorilla glue however the magnet is fantastic and it has a pretty low profile when it’s on your dash
1,Tried all over my dash. Doesn’t stick anywhere. Cleaned the dash too still didn’t work. Couldn’t even try the magsafe magnets lol
1,The magnet didn’t hold very well in my tractor I guess it may have been a little too bouncy
1,Did not work. Broken
1,I wanted this work but other reviewers weren't wrong: It just doesn't stick. I'm not a newbie when it comes to mounting 3M-style adhesive solutions but this just plain doesn't work. The glue surfaces are far too small and not sticky enough to hold the magnet unit. I didn't even attempt to mount the phone.
2,Good little mount but it won’t stay attached to my dash. I have even tried super glue but it keeps falling off.
2,The adhesive is terrible. Only stuck for 1 day.
1,Would be great if the adhesive held the mount to the surface…. Neither of the double sided tape provided with the mount worked. Followed all the instructions - left the car in the garage while on a trip for a week. Came home and after 2 days the phone along with the mount fell off… would not recommend for this reason
1,It is in the headline.
1,Does not stick to dash would not hold phone. Phone kept falling. Totally worthless. Threw in trash.
1,Worked great but after a month the silicone covering the magnet came apart.
1,I got this few days ago and was very disappoint!1) it was late on delivery2) the metal plate is TOO SMALL! So when I drive my phone fell off the every time when I turn! It got my crazy!
1,As soon as you put your phone on it it falls even if you leave it to dry for two days straight it doesn’t stick
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I really gave this zero stars. The post sale customer service sucks. To be honest this is just a cheap China joke. It was ok. Did the job but after several weeks before it just broke.
1,I bought this for iPhone 13 Pro MAx. It holds phone without the case but do not hold with the slim case. Metal plate inside case does not change suction power. Do not recommend if you have any case on the phone.
1,This thing is a piece of trash. Magnet is about the only thing that works on it. The plastic is cheap and the swivel head is not 360 and makes a weird angle. I will be sending it back. Not worth $18 that I paid for it at all. I’m also worried about when I take the tape off. It was basic 3m adhesive tape.
1,It doesn’t work with my otter box MagSafe case since that’s a legitimate brand I’m 99% sure they are lying about the compatibility
2,Magnet not as strong as MagSafe and the rubber is starting to wear off.
1,The magnet power is great but the adhesive is wearing off and it fell off my dash
1,This thing is a waste of money. Doesn’t even stick to my dash and keeps falling.
1,Product came already used. The box was already ripped and the sticky part was no longer sticky. Annoying.
1,The mount worked great for 3 months then suddenly the stem snapped otherwise a good product.
1,Just don’t get it it’s awful at staying in place and even when taped down to let it adhere to my dash it doesn’t work it just falls off. Very disappointing
1,Magnet school is we to weak for 13 pro max
1,This thing is junk. The plastic feels cheap the adhesive is useless. Don’t waste your money.
1,Used in my car and the manner is good but the magnet ring turns and won’t hold in place so the phone cans stay in landscape position as I need it to
1,The adhesive is so low quality it won’t stick anywhere! Don’t ever buy this!
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The adhesive didnt work AT ALL.  Very dissapointed
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Broke in 1 month .... right after the return window closed..
1,Tried several times and it would not stick to any part of my dashboard.
1,The “3M” adhesive that comes with it doesn’t stick to anything in the car… either dried out or junk… don’t buy.
1,Item is marketed as compatible with iPhone 12 in reality it doesn’t hold the iPhone 12 even when not using a phone case at all. Very expensive for no good reason.
1,The sticky part is fine couldn’t really give great review up that cause the magnet is so terrible I took it off after 2 days
1,I was super excited for this product but it does not adhere to my dashboard.  It has no function now.
1,The glue that sticks in the car is not good The thing keeps on falling. Try to stay away from this product.
1,Product would not stick to dash. The magnet is 10/10 but there’s no point if it doesn’t stay on the dash. As soon as I placed it it fell off with no load on the magnet.
1,Adhesive is crap- wouldn’t buy again even if it was $1
1,Didn’t stick at all. Cleaned off my dash and followed the instructions just to find out I wasted my time and money.
1,It didn’t stick at all to my dash or other areas I tried to stick it. Waste of money.
1,I already trashed it... does not stay on the dashboard of my Jeep Gladiator
1,I tried all the recommended methods to get this thing to stick and it just wouldn’t. Don’t waste your money!
1,Very specifically bought this because it said it worked with Magsafe phones but it does not.
1,adhesive sticks good and magnet is strong but it snapped in half.
1,It couldn’t support the weight of the phone. The adhesive is to weak
1,The magnet is great holds pretty good it just does not stick to the dashboard at all
1,lasted about a week and then fell off my dash... waist of money!
1,Item sucks. Does not stick well on your dash. The whole thing falls as soon as I put my phone on it. Horrible. Don’t buy.
1,DOES NOT WORK ON IPHONE 12 unless you attach a big metal plate on back of phone
1,The adhesive doesnt work! Waste of money.
1,Magnet works great but the adhesive stayed for a few weeks then falls off!
1,Didn’t stick to the dash
1,Not string enough to hold a phone upright when using car vents
1,The adhesive pelled and its not even summer yet!
1,Crap. Wound up throwing out. Didn’t stick. Cheaply made
1,immediately
1,Trash product.
1,Horrible waste of money
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 What the f is this
1,The adhesive material would not stay stuck. It worked for a couple days then would fall off. And after cleaning the surface with alcohol and using the extra 3M provided sticker and waiting a full 24hrs before putting my phone on it it still only lasted a couple days
5,I see a lot of people complaining that it's not sticking to the phone like the magnet is not working well if you do not have a 12 and up your phone does not have a magnet in the back of it as well as the silver plate that comes with the car mount you do not use that if everybody read the directions you'd be good to go but majority of the complaints on these reviews are people not reading the directions
5,Just what I needed. Definitely some strong magnets.
4,I use it on my iPhone 12 Pro Max and it hasn't fallen off at all when driving. Both landscape and portrait orientations hold on strong. I have a really stiff suspension car so feel a lot of the bumps on the road and its held strong. Adhesion is pretty solid from what I can see I live in California where the weather gets really hot and it hasnt come off of my dash like some others have.
4,Works perfect with magnetized case or directly on back of phone. Wish it would tilt downward a little more so the camera could face directly forward as I drive.
5,Works great holds my 12 pro super strong.
5,I have a 12 Pro Max with a clear Apple MagSafe case. It holds the phone okay. It could use some stronger magnets but it gets the job done as is.
5,This is a solid mount.  The actual mounting hardware is plastic and is solid as any other mount you will get.  I think people have unrealistic expectations of this thing being made of adamantium or something.  The magnet is very strong and works well on an iphone 12 and 13 magsafe case.  Use common sense as you would with any other adhesive mount.  Make sure the surface is solid and clean.  Let it "cure" overnight before putting weight or pressure on it.
1,Horrible. This is not even as good as trade show swag.Installed 18 hours before first attempted use.Adhesive failed after 5 minutes of use.If you read the fine print up in the description it says it’s not intended for in vehicle use… CLEAR FALSE ADVERTISEMENT. Look at the pictures. Should be removed from Amazon.
5,Let me just start out this review by saying I’ve been a long-time Scosche mount user. When MagSafe came out and I got the iPhone 12 I wanted to switch to a MagSafe mount but almost every mount I found was an air vent clip. I understand the usefulness of these but it’s a pain in the summer when I need the AC to hit me and in the winter when the heat turns my phone into a brick of hot iron.Enter the Quarble Dashboard Car Mount. It’s equipped with a 3M pad of sticky tape (I’ve never had issues removing this when it’s time to switch mounts) and can be placed in whatever convenient location you’d prefer your phone. The magnets are stronger than regular MagSafe. I drove around for an hour trying to hit every bump turn fast start/stop etc. and wasn’t able to get it to budge.I like how simple this one looks too. No huge branding no giant rectangle shape. Just a nice rubberized circle that blends right in with the rest of my car.I’ll definitely be purchasing another one of these for our second car. A great deal!
5,Magnet is strong with a MagSafe case. I had a clear case with no magnet and it won’t work.It also works on my wireless non MagSafe charger.On issue so far is the magnet mount moves when removing the phone. I will try to tighten the plastic nut some more.It’s 3 m adhesive so I have confidence it will stay on my dash
5,Works with iPhone 12 max pro will update over the next few weeks . But seems solid and mounted to dash with no problem so I am sold and will be ordering a second one soon.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 My case is pretty thin on the back and the magnetic hold just wasn’t strong enough. But when out of the case it’s really solid.Note: iPhone 12 mini with CellHelmet Altitude case.
5,As a matter of fact the magnet sticks to my phone cover so well that when I go to remove it it takes two hands. Seriously if you try to pull it off the base the tape will unstick from dashboard. Be careful and take it off the magnet carefully. I might use one of these on my motorcycle that’s how great the magnet is. Thanks but it’s messing up my console in my SUV from the tape. Lol
5,Works great for my iPhone 12 mini with MagSafe case. It’s a very low profile mount and looks pretty decent
5,Works perfectly through an Apple Magsafe case - great value for the money.
5,Have this in my police cruiser and it holds the iPhone 12 Pro Max well. I have had zero issues with it.
5,Stick well to dash and hold the phone tightly.  Worth the money.
4,Works perfect! Magnet is strong and the adhesive works perfectly. I just wish it was a little smaller.
2,Poor adhesion
5,Had this for a few weeks. The adhesive is strong and it holds the phone right. Good job!
5,I did not have a lot of space for my phone in my new police unit so I was looking for something like this.The small base fits perfectly and the magnet or suction on goes on smooth and soft and stays when I drive. It also comes off easily.It is made well!
5,Works absolutely amazing with a MagSafe case or an iPhone 12 without a case. They send a metal plate to put in the back of a non-MagSafe case but it didn’t work for me. Might work if you put it on the outside of a case but that’s dumb… but if you use MagSafe cases this thing is awesome and holds like crazy.
5,Nice to have a place to put my phone in the car where it doesn't slide around or have other problems
5,Bought this to replace my regular magnetic mount since I started wireless charging at home. Works great and the adhesive works awesome as well. Great product.
5,Already had a mount affixed to dashboard. Magnet fit so used that one. Holds my iPhone 12 Pro securely thru a MagSafe case.
5,I hate the suction one that falls of when its hot outside this one so far has been holding its adhesive prettywell! magsafe perfect thank you
5,Great hold fits just right on my dash which is the only place for a phone mount in my car I like.
5,exactly what i wanted. its sturdy good magnetic suction. will recommend
5,Doesn’t look much but it sure does the job. It does look a little flimsy so I hope it will last. My wife doesn’t like to mount her phone right in front of the air vent so this is a great alternative.
5,I love the minimalist footprint and this thing holds the phone very well.
5,Does it exactly what it says. Fits tight to dash. Strong magnet to phone.
5,I have the iPhone 12 Pro Max - this means a heavy phone and living in a cold state I hit a ton of rough roads. For 95% of the time my phone is able to hold on strong with it’s built in magnets which is more than any other dash magnet can do.Very sleek and amazing suction power!The adhesion stays in great too! I knocked it a bit while cleaning the inside of my car and it stayed put just fine
5,Bought this for my wife’s new iPhone.  If you use the correct MagSafe case with your phone it works very well with this mount.  When I upgrade my phone I will probably buy this same phone mount for my vehicle.
5,In the beginning I was not sure it will be easy to install and work nicely. It was easy and high quality. I loved it.
5,Great product for a good price compared to the other brands. The only thing that might be a problem to some (wasn’t for me) is the bracket isn’t very big or tall. Check your location of where you need to place it to see if you need more height.
5,For MagSafe phones and cases this works wonderfully. The adhesive stuck perfectly to my dashboard after a quick wipe with an alcohol pad and the magnets are definitely strong enough to hold up to bumpy roads etc while not being so strong that it's hard to take the phone off of the mount. The rotation has a pretty wide angle. My only complaint is that I wish the 'neck' was a bit longer for those of us who need to mount this on the top of our dashboard rather than the side facing toward us.I was pretty cautious about this given the reviews but I'm glad I bought it. If you're looking for a MagSafe car mount but don't really need a charger this seems to be the way to go. I feel like most of these 1-star reviews are from people using this as a regular magnetic car mount -- there are ones that I would imagine work much better than this if you're using a non-MagSafe phone.
5,I bought it for my iPhone 12 pro which has a magsafe case (Not an Apple case). it works very well and hold the phone very well. I am glad I bought it.  /is easy to put and take off the phone and is easy to turn the phone around for a different orientation.
1,Adhesive is a joke children's glue has a stronger bond than what is on the back of this. Magnet is not strong enough to hold a iphone 12 pro (Non-Max smaller version) without a case on. Save your money product is a scam.
5,Purchased this to be able to mount my phone to my dash while driving around. This has good magnetic power and I have had no issues with my phone falling off while driving. I can recommend this mount if you have the new iPhone 12's or want to use it with the mounting plate it comes with!
5,I’ve been using this for a few weeks now and the simplicity and quality are amazing !
5,Came with some extra adhesives and a metal sticker thing for phones without magnetic back.
4,The product is great but the build quality isn’t compared to another similar one I’ve tried. This Ike is made out of plastic which I feel might break at some point I’m the future specially sitting in my car in the hot summer weather.
5,I have an Acura RDX and had a difficult time finding a MagSafe mount that would work for me on my dash. Since my air vents are vertical and not horizontal none of the vent clips would work. This mount is perfect for me. Love it!
5,El poder de succión es muy fuerte se mantiene adherido a pesar del movimiento
4,I have this mounted on my 5th gen 4Runner on top of the radio trim just left of the clock. I wish it was an inch taller with slightly more rotation to straighten the phone and avoid the vent. Overall I’m happy with it.Will update as time goes on.
5,Excellent magnet is very strong and is perfect for a Magsafe case or phone.I use an iphone 11 with a Magsafe aftermarket case. This magnet is very strong and hold my phone on the dashboard.A++++
5,Got a new iPhone love the magsafe case & charger but it didn't work with my old phone mount. This works perfectly with the Apple magsafe case for the iPhone Mini 12 no need to put a metal disc on the back of my case or on my phone to make it hold. It's a little cheap feeling but works perfectly so I can't knock it.Would buy again if I need additional mounts for my phone or a 2nd iPhone.
5,This product provides the stability and sturdiness needed for the iPhone 13 Pro Max which is a very heavy phone in comparison to other iPhones.  I drive some pretty rough roads and it is no challenge for this product in keeping my phone secure and it does not require continual adjusting to keep my phone in position.  Additionally I have limited space for an adhesive stand but the size of this product and its stand does not require a large place to be applied.  I highly recommend this product especially to those who wish to keep their vents clear for cool air in the summer or warm air in the fall/winter (i.e. don't like vent mounts).
5,Better then the more expensive ones. It is perfect for my 13pro and Series 7 watch!
5,Having been using it for while now. And I love it. My phone never fell from it. I have an iPhone 13 pro and it’s quite heavy. I also use a magnetic iPhone case that is really important otherwise the phone won’t stay. Unless you use it without a case. It’s a great product sturdy easy to apply and Easy to use.
5,This is so strong! The magnets are great and my phone doesn’t fall off! I actually have this in my shower and I use it to hold my phone or when I need a mirror to shave I put a metal plate on the back of a big hand mirror and it works SO GOOD!!! Better than any of those tiny “shower mirrors” and nothing falls off!
5,After buying two duds elsewhere I carefully combed reviews and found this. It is a strong magnet and very secure for my iPhone 13 pro max that holds it securely without adding a metal plate etc. I have a MagSafe compatible case but not a name brand one so I was skeptical. Other mounts couldn’t even hold the phone without case but this mount is just as strong w case as it is without.Also the 3M mount strip is able to be placed more than once and remain sticky. Personally I’m not going to do that bc I have trust issues but the adhesive is high quality and guaranteed. That’s great since the dash can get so hot/so cold in a car in the Northeast.
5,I have a soft transparent case on the 13 pro and it wouldn't stick but the included adhesive metal ring worked great.
3,Would have given it 5 stars if all three adhesives that came with the item didn’t fail in less than one day. Tried three different positions. Only adheres to a smooth flat surface. Bought some heavy duty 3M stickers and cut to fit.Given that I spent $20 for this I expected all pieces to be high quality. Additional 3M double-sided stickers were $8. Actual price $30 with tax.That being said the magnetic power is amazing. If you use the included metal circle with the MagSafe charger it won’t budge. I literally have to hold the stand in place an pull the disk off while wearing gloves to protect my fingers. So if want a stand that will not ever drop your phone this is the one.In fact it’s so hard to remove the MagSafe I just leave it in the car. Kids can’t get it off or jostle it but be aware the metal disk is really thin another plus but it makes for sharp edges.
5,Had it for two months now my phone is an iPhone 12 ProMax and it holds better than other “better brands”. Definitely would recommend! And I don’t like to write reviews but this one deserved one! Recommend 100%
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Stays put even on bumpy roads. Magnetic car mount for iPhone. Adhesive backing.
4,Would be better if it had better range of movement. Otherwise gets the job done
1,Will not hold iPhone even without case. The phone just falls off.
1,It doesn’t work good work only one month
5,Hubby uses in work truck and loves it
5,This is literally the ONLY magnet that has held my iPhone 13 pro max up while I’m driving and even stays on when I go over any bumpy spots in the road! I am very impressed by it and have it in all 3 of mine and my husbands vehicles!!
5,This works perfectly fine! No issues with the phone not staying attached. My only complaint is the rotating angle isn’t great. I attached the base to my cars dashboard (only place that didn’t block any buttons or vents). Bc of the lack of angle rotation on the ball joint the phone screen is tiled up instead of flat. This won’t be a big deal if you are tall or sit high in the car though.
5,It’s a great iPhone holder. No clipping and pinching your fingers or searching for a small metal plate somewhere on the back of your phone. With this holder you just stick your iPhone right on. You can easily turn it horizontally without it falling and yet also easy to remove. The air vent holder was missing but that’s due to a brazen customer and I don’t really need it. It also comes with a MagSafe magnet to turn any case in a MagSafe safe. Although with my order also a part missing.But overall a great product.
5,I tried other more expensive solutions for a dash mag safe mount. This works awesome. Totally worth the money.
2,After about a month of normal use only once a day going to and from school it’s already lost stick. Wish I was still in my return period
5,I’ve tried many MagSafe mounts and this is THE strongest magnet. You will not be disappointed
5,I bought thus for our motorhome.  We've been on some rough roads. The adhesive to the dash and the magnet for the phone have been way better than any other auto dash magnet for regular phone cases. I love it.
4,I was hoping the iPhone 13 with a mag safe case would finally solve the problem of my phone not staying put in my car. The dashboard in my car has an obvious place to put a phone base however it is entirely curved with a fake woven texture. As a result the traditional bean bag mount slides off when I find one of the many pot holes that are endemic to New England. From the picture this looked like the base might be flexible enough to model to the task it isn't. The base is entirely rigid and the sticky pad isn't thick enough to conform at all to the dash or even to mold into the texture. That said since the car is 6 years old a pair of machine screws holds the base to the dash with only a minor amount of uglyness.The magnet is excellent.
5,I am happy w this holder. It has a small footprint which was important for me (almost NO surface area for a holder mount in a MINI Cooper). It looks a bit delicate but it has proven sturdy enough and almost all other mounts are so bulky and thick - I like its low profile! What I really want to talk about is the adhesion and magneticism: A plus.I have had multiple other mounts fall off or not adhere over time. I am so pleased that even on super hot days where the car is unbearably hot inside this hasn’t budged. It’s even on a slight angle. Maybe that’s a bonus to it’s lightweight build.I followed directions and do have a mag-safe phone case - I don’t think it would work at all without one. My phone hasn’t fallen a single time over the last couple of months. I’ve NEVER had a magnet mount work so well - phone has always bounced off sometimes with bumps. I have an hour commute and live in Massachusetts the pothole capital of America. Sometimes you hit a pothole so big and so hard your soul temporarily leaves your body and you feel compelled to apologize to your car. So believe me when I say - the magnet works great.
5,No issues with magnet or case. Actually very strong grip especially with my driving in a 6spd mustang!!!!! happy I bought it others kept throwing phone off when racing accelerating or sharp turns left or right. Thanks !!!!
5,Holds the phone well and it doesn't slid. husband loves it
5,I have an iPhone so I use the MagSafe case and it works perfectly.I have tried multiple products like this and this one finally does exactly what I want it to do.
5,Work excellent with MagSafe case!  Hasn’t fallen off not one time in my car when I hit my brakes hard or takes sharp curves!  Love this dash mount
5,Works great with my MagSafe case
5,If you drive a car and have an iPhone you need this product.
5,Works great
5,Holds my iPhone 12 Pro Max perfectly
5,Works just how it is intended to just make sure your case is truly MagSafe the first case I bought claimed to be then I got a MagSafe otter box and it sticks great. It’s nice tough that it also comes with the metal plates incase you have something without MagSafe
5,I bought this to go with my iPhone magnet case that I bought through apple. I have a truck and drive on a lot of rough mountain roads daily and this magnet holds my phone!! It has stand attached in my truck on these very hot days. I am beyond pleased and I do recommend this for your electronic device…
5,Not even on flat surface works great with 13 pro. Cleaned the area where your placing it with alcohol then follow directions. Works
5,Accidentally bought 2 of these and love the 1 I got.  Works off road and won’t make phone bounce.
5,I was just looking for a phone mount that I could adhere to my dash and this fit the bill. Also comes with extra adhesive stickers and phone plates. I’m using a MagSafe case so didn’t need the extra phone plates but it but will be handy in case I do!One complaint though is that the adhesive stickers that attach the mount to the dash pull right off when you pull the phone to remove it from the mount (that’s how strong the magnet is). So I have to hold the mount at the base when I remove the phone or else I will pull the adhesive and mount right off the dash. I am on my 3rd and last adhesive sticker. I did not have that problem with any other brands I have used in the past and yes I cleaned and waited overnight before I used it. :)
5,I put this up in my truck and waited a full day for the adhesive to set before I used it. It'll get hot in the AZ sun so the adhesive will be put to the test in the long run but the mount isn't sitting in the direct sun so it should work.No problem at all holding my iPhone 13 Pro Max with a silicone Magsafe case. In fact it feels like a stronger hold than some of the other magnet mounts I've used for my iPhone.
5,Have mine mounted on my 21’ center council boat and does not budge a single bit in rough waters! Love it!
5,I used this mount on one I already had stuck to my car. Unscrewed it off the stand and screwed it’s onto my original stand super easy. The magnet is super strong and holds my phone way better than my old one which was the purpose of the upgrade. I’m happy with it for sure!
5,Have iPhone 13 pro max with a mag safe case and it’s work amazing. Phone doesn’t slide or fall off even when driving on rough roads. I like that it has a swivel on it so you can adjust how the phone is facing.
5,High quality product good value no defects. Overall satisfied with this product.
5,You cannot just stick to dash and immediately use. It does come with extra mounting stickers.
5,This works awesome for my iPhone 13 pro. Holds well on dashboard with a magcase on my phone. I bought 3 of these so far. One for me the wife and my work truck! Recommend highly!
5,This mount is good and strong. Perfect.I would recommend it. 6 stars!!!!
5,It holds my iPhone 13 max with MagSafe case on dash with no problems. Seams to be very strong magnets and has good 360 movement. It’s only been a few days but so far it was stuck to dash very well
5,This product is perfect.  It's small in size and has both a powerful MagSafe compatible magnet and a strong tape to secure to your car's dashboard.  It also comes with extra tape in case you want to remove it and move it around etc.  Just buy it.
5,This mount is great. I may end up buying several more for in the kitchen at work etc.the magnet is very strong and the swivel provides great viewing flexibility.
5,Good strong MagSafe holder. Able to stick to various smooth surfaces using the provided tape. Great product!
5,I have an iPhone 13 and this mount works amazingly well with and without the Apple Magsafe case. Can't be faulted. Highly Recommended!
5,Sostiene muy bien el iPhone 12 Pro Max !!
5,El imán está muy potente y no se cae el teléfono hay que dejar que el adhesivo seque 12 horas para que no se caiga
5,Great solution if all you need is the holder and not the charging magsafe capability.
5,Holds the phone in place even vertically in the car.
