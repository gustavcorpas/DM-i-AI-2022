5,I bought it for my grandson and he loves it. Thankyou
5,Fire
4,I love everything about this keyboard well... maybe not everything. I got this keyboard because I wanted an upgrade from my previous keyboard. When it comes to gaming it is definitely the winner. When it comes to typing things like reviews on Amazon it starts to get really loud and obnoxious. I mean I love the keyboard and all it's just the sound that bothers me sometimes. When I'm gaming I don't really notice it that much. When I have my headphones off and I'm typing... JEEZ. I just use my old keyboard when I want to type up reviews. It's probably just a personal preference. I have no regrets purchasing this keyboard for GAMING. Other than that I would totally recommend this keyboard to gamers.

Firstly there's so much customization the downloadable interface is easy to learn and there are so many ways you can personalize your keyboard to make it your own. As I showed in the video there are already many default modes to play around with that are all intriguing. I love the random color mode! I had never seen this one in particular on other keyboards but that might be my negligence. The white backplate which I have seen in other keyboards creates a full RGB experience and definitely is something to look forward to with a keyboard. On top of all this I might grab some of the different Kraken keycaps for EVEN MORE COLOR! The native switches that come with the 60 are sooo satisfying and never cease to please your ASMR side. The keys have a very nice texture over the top which I highly prefer over the normal glossy finish that many other keyboards nowadays have. It just feels way more natural and provides less of a "sticky" feeling. There are really no complaints with the Pro 60. I am a fan of adjustable feet but that's certainly not a reason to pass on this beauty. It functions just as well without it and will probably last longer without them. Overall a very clean keyboard that not only looks great but performs even better. You cannot go wrong and might have to buy it for the fam!9.5/10 because there's always room for improvement :)
4,got the silvers and it is awesome so far. software isn't too bad you can't change the poll rate(mine would stay on 1000 mhz anyway) the description does not say it is hot-swappable but it is(comes with a keycap puller and switch puller) seems to be made from mostly plastic but has a nice heft to it. LEDs are bright and RGB(although some colors get 2 or 3 colors for each key but it's kinda cool. looks like the key is 1/3 red 1/3 orange and 1/3 green or 1/2 green and the other half red). On sale great value. one drawback from the LEDs is that the slow color changes are a bit choppy and not smooth. the keys are unbelieveably responsive. it feels like I bearly touch the key for it to activate. amazing for gaming. when I want to use a key it always works. have yet to have any issues with keys not registering. sometimes I do accidentally press a key due to the activation point but I am a neandertal with heavy hands. the keycaps themselves are wonderful. have a great texture home row bumps are low enough to hardly notice them. /The only issue I have is that some of them have the excess plastic from where they were broken off from the scrap plastic they were attached to from manufacturing. that is really the main thing that bugged me about the whole keyboard. So far pretty awesome keyboard though for $69.
5,I don’t use it. I bought for my grandson & he loves it.
5,I like the key board it’s just that I think they should make a better manual for the keyboard otherwise my favorite keyboard ever
5,Keyboard came exactly as described. Very easy to touch keys and not loud when pressed.My son bought this with his Christmas money for gaming on his Xbox. He is very hard to impress when it comes to most things especially for his gaming. He LOVES it and I haven’t heard any complaints.Would definitely recommend and buy again if needed.
5,Love the lights n easy to type n use
4,love the keyboard but you can just buy the keycap set from their website and put it on any board.  the speed silvers are nice.  only my second mechanical keyboard

The key lighting is what originally pulled me towards Kraken and they look amazing in person. There's a bunch of lighting customization options and it even has the ability to react to nearby audio. I attached a video of it in action; they keyboard will just jam out to whatever music you play it.The keys themselves feel really responsive when pressed.  You get that satisfying "click" feel without the keyboard being too noisy. It has been quiet enough for me to use in the office and the 60% design has helped free up desk space. With similar keyboards ranging up to around $200  the Kraken was a steal at this price.
5,Bought this for my grandsons birthday and he loves it. He is very happy with everything and the cost was affordable. He loves gaming and this was the perfect gift
5,I like this keyboard. Software is easy to use.Switched out USB to USB C.I use Type C to Type C.
3,Although this product is as described I’m still not used to the layout and typing functions.
2,I bought this product a while back because I REALLY wanted speed silvers and a fast keyboard for my competitive gaming. For the first few days it was GREAT. I felt good the keys sounded nice and it was overall enjoyable. After those few days (about 4) the keys started getting rattly and every time I press a key it makes a loud obnoxious springy sound. The keys don't even FEEL good anymore. I've been looking for a new keyboard ever since.Worth it - 2/10Advantage - 3/10Durability - -10/10Should you buy? - NO.
5,No alt f4 but still good
3,i have a green/black setup so i was excited to see in the reviews that you can change the solid color of the rgb. all of the colors looked great EXCEPT for green. its the only color that has this weird red patch on the bottom right. the keyboard itself performs great but for $100 this small minor detail with the only color i set it for was really a bother to me. it makes my setup look a little strange and it definitely doesn’t look right.the other solid colors are well solid. perfect. its literally just the green thats messed up.who knows maybe i’m just unlucky. good keyboard nonetheless.
5,Had this keyboard for a few days now and I can say that I love it! It took me a a little bit to get used to it but for big FPS games this is a plus. The space bar is super sensitive so it was hard at first not to touch it at all. Keys are very responsive
5,Got this for my son and he absolutely loves it he never puts it done he uses it for pc and Xbox gaming.
4,My son loves it
5,This keyboard is one of the best keyboards I've used the silver speed switches come feeling really smooth and the quality of the keyboard is a 10/10. The keyboard is hotswappable with optical switches and has RGB if you are interested in that.
5,My grandson seems to be very pleased

I’m a fortnite PC gamer and this keyboard is the best one I’ve tried hands down. I even plugged it in for my work laptop for a little and definitely had some heads turning in the office as well! The color scheme is just so nice and for $70 this is legit a steal!
4,Louder than expected.decent buy
5,This keyboard is really well made and the keys feel nice to the touch. It is great for gaming too. As I am a mnk player.
5,Bought this for my grandson‘s birthday. He thinks it’s awesome.
4,Amazing Keyboard!!! Not great keycaps but the reaction time makes up for it! worth the price for great gaming.
5,Great feel for gaming not the best for typing but doable
5,yes very yes
5,I liked the design but the keyboard is extremely sensitive.
5,I’m surprised this is $99 I’d expect $110 outstanding keyboard
5,Es bien accesible a su uso y para los juegos sus teclas son de buen dominio.
5,Feels good nice lighting
5,Solid nice small keyboard that does not take up a lot space given me lots of mouse room to game with.
5,The keyboard is good
5,This keyboard is really good!! Good for gaming and feels very nice. Would definitely recommend this keyboard.
5,Its metal and exactly what i thought it was gonna be
1,When it works its great however in less than a year its not working emailed support and its non-existent. You're better off getting a keyboard from a manufacturer that offers warranty service for the first year I hate to say it but Razer Corsair have the market there. As cool as this keyboard is if its not built to last then what's the point.
5,Love it  does a YouTuber use this keyboard
5,The perfect keyboard gamers  highly responsive and nice sound from the keys
5,very good
5,I revived the package the same day I ordered it. I love the feel of the keyboard would recommend
5,I purchased this for my son to use when in school and online gaming. He says it’s great and makes a big difference from his other regular keyboard.
5,This keyboard is so good!

1,I purchased this for my 9 year old son for Christmas. Well approximately 1 month after use the keyboard started smoking and noticed the usb-c input had became misshaped due to the heat. Now the unit is a paper weight.I emailed the company (Kraken) and gave them 3 weeks to respond. I received no response hence this negative review.If you’re looking for a reliable keyboard I would look into other companies such as CorseAir.Just my two cents.
5,Works perfect
5,My son really likes this keyboard. Recommended.
5,Overpriced but still really good

5,Amazing!!!
5,Its fast and small
5,Gift
2,Cuando mi sobrino se pone a jugar se escucha muy fuerte y es porque las teclas son corrientes
1,My son saved for a year for this stupid $100 keyboard and it broke in less than 1 month and half. Now I can't even exchange it or return it because the window expired 10/days ago. Ugh. He's so sad.
5,perfect.
1,This refurbished item is cheaply made cut off in the middle of gaming won't buy again!
5,This keyboard sounds great and has a great and feels smooth every time you press down a key.  If you are thinking of buying this keyboard DO IT ITS AMAZING. When I play games the keys respond much faster than most of the keyboards I've had which gives me a good advantage.
1,Stuck FN key on delivery keyboard hits random keys upon being plugged in.
4,Product ordered dircetly from Kraken.  Kraken Pro 60% Mech Keyboard brown switches custom keycaps.Honestly this is pretty nice keyboard but it is just a GK61 with a Kraken logo thrown onto it.  This means that you can save yourself a good chunk of change by opting just to get one of those.  But I do like the keyboard it is a good piece of hardware the switches feel great I'm just not entirely sure how much Kraken actually DOES.  Mine did not ship for 4 days and took another 4 to get here and they didn't even put the keycaps on the keyboard they just shipped them in the box.  So my new keyboard arrives that I paid a premium price for and I've got to sit here pulling keycaps out and replacing them.  Just sort of leaves me wondering what is the point of this?  I could buy a GK61 pick whatever switches I want and whatever keycaps I want.  I did most of the work on this one anyways so I just don't get it.Lastly the software is atrocious.  If you're new to 60% keyboards just working everything out will take some time and then getting used to using it will take some time as well and the software definitely does not help - not very user-friendly or intuitive.So pretty average keyboard but that's not to say that it isn't nice.  I'll be keeping mine and using it but next time around I will likely just build one myself or go with something that's not marked up because someone slapped a logo onto it.  Overall it is not a bad product at all.  The GK61 is a decent entry-level board from what I gathered the switches are decent quality as are the keycaps.  Ignoring the fact that you can buy all of these things separately it is decent but a bit pricey.
5,I really like this keyboard
5,It is very worth the money and sounds amazing
5,My only problem is very rarely when I first got it a button wouldn't work
5,very tac

The sound is perfect and it feels nice when pressing down on it!!!! You should definitely buy it if your thinking about buying the keyboard. Also the boxing was really good actually it was perfect it had the wires perfect and the keyboard was wrapped PERFECTLY 10/10 should most definitely buy
5,The switches are amazing
5,Worth the purchase great quality well made great packaging and fast shipping

5,I absolutely love this keyboard. Keycaps feel very nice and RGB is on point.
5,Bought this back in nov and it’s perfect the software works and all haven’t had any problems with this keyboard.
5,I love the switches of this keyboard. I also like how they use cloud keycaps but made it different.
5,Pros:+Amazing sound+Cool look+Variety of light modesCons:-port on left side(bad for right sided setups)-Font on keycaps are bad
5,My nephew wanted this keyboard for his PS4 for gaming. He likes the size of the board and how the color effects work. He is overall really happy. This does work with the PS4 so if you're looking for one this could be the one for you.
5,Great keyboard but switched to black keys the red it came with are wayyyyy to sensitive.
4,It's a great keyboard although I came to discover for half the price you can get a GK61 which is an identical keyboard (only the logo is different).However I think given the niceties they include it's not too much markup (PBT keycaps vs ABS alone make it worth the extra $50 although you could get a PBT set and put on yourself for around $30).I ended up swapping the silver speed (linear) switches my kraken came with for gateron optical browns as I missed the tactile 'bump' too much.At this point the keyboard is _almost_ perfect however mine has a slight slant to it causing a "rocking" when on a flat surface.  As it doesn't have legs this is hard to adjust for/fix - my best solution so far is trying to twist the board (like you would an ice cream tray) and as it's plastic it ends up going back to it's offset shape but this solves it for a few hours.I believe this is a defect in my particular unit (although I've heard it happen on others as well).  Not defective enough to send back for an exchange though (maybe i just need to plop a little putty under one of the anti-slide legs to solve for this or put it on a semi-squishy thing like a mouse pad).
5,Great but I don’t think I have sliver switch’s maybe browns
5,なんか押し心地がとにかくおいしいです。買って損はないですチェリーmxの銀軸とは全然違います。軽いです（押し心地）おいしいですありがとうございました。
5,Si lo que buscas es un teclado rápido  cómodo  bonito personalizable etc. Este es tu teclado el único contra que le veo es el ruido si hace un poco de ruido alto ( depende si te gusta a mi si pero es de gustos) pero es un buen teclado
5,Me encanto me lo volveria a comprar
5,My son is using this with his Xbox ! He loves it and loves how it lights up and changes Colours!!
