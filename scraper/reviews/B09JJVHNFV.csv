4,I like that they work I dont like the ugly colors.
5,My daughter has to have a darn iPhone and she was going through charger cords weekly so I ordered these just to save some money and one lasted her a month!Thank you!She just got her second one.Very pleased!
4,Typically if a product isn’t great I just won’t purchase again; however I feel this one needs to be known. I guess the durability and sturdiness is fine as none of them broke physically. The problem with this item is ALL 5 of them quit charging within 5 months of the time that I bought them!!! I don’t expect them to last forever but for each of them to stop working between 2-5 months is a bit ridiculous in my opinion. Perhaps I just received “duds” but won’t be taking any chances buying again to find out.
4,Product came earlier than scheduled and the cords came in great condition. Good quality for the price and how many you get but they seem like they can break if used too rough. Overall a great purchase.
5,I liked everything about the item.
3,Honestly I would do 3.5 stars if that was an option mostly b/c I don't have any issues with this particular charger due to me rarely using it. I only use it when I need to charge access my old iphone for some reason or may need it for my ipad.However I gave my best friend 1 and the 1st one barely even lasted 2 months. Honestly idk if using a power strip has any affect on this or not but hopefully that doesn't factor into that. My best friend only has 1 other item plugged into their power strip and they've tried diff. cubes for the USB port. I gave her an extra 1 that I had on hand and that charger Broke too barely even lasting 1 month. I thought the cube where you plug the usb part into on their part could have possibly been dead but nope that's not the case at all one bit. For the 1st charger that broke I did attempt to charge my iphone/ipad with it and worked very minimally but then it completely stopped and would literally NOT charge anything at all. And it has Nothing to do w/the outlet cubes either.Some cords barely even last a month.
5,I like the fact that they are different colors and the length is really nice; I recommend these phone chargers
5,These super long cords allow you to walk around pace do laundry - all while plugged in!  A must for the task master of the house!
5,For another member of family in nursing facility
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Work well so far. Just got them
5,For my kids
4,The chargers are great if you've perpetually got 4 kids and 2 locatable chargers. Having these on hand as spares / replacements / peace keepers may be the greatest sanity saver I have ever purchased on Amazon. Are the chargers durable? The only complaints I've gotten is that the chargers have gone missing. Nobody has complained about them being broken. I have not further investigated because well...we let sleeping dogs lie. All in all these are great. I'll be ordering more I'm sure.
3,They do the job but stop working fairly quick. You get what you pay for here. The colors are very nice and length is fabulous just wish they lasted longer.
5,Good for the price
3,Love the length of these cords but all of them only charge with the plug a specific way not like normal charger where no matter which way you place it into your phone it will charge
4,They are long enough but some of them only worked for a short time at four out of the five that came worked great and are still working
5,That the charger do not last and want my money back
5,My grandkids go through chargers like crazy.These ones have held up really good for them and their iPads. Worth the money because it’s less than in stores. Cord is long enough to charge while they are playing if needed. And with the bundle of colors I don’t have to guess which cord goes to which iPad or phone. Plus it gives me extra to have around in case one breaks.  Will be ordering again
3,Half of them did not work
5,I have no complaints since I purchased these charges.

The number one benefit of these chargers is the variation of colors. If you live alone white and black are fine. BUT if you have ever gotten into a rip roarer over whose charger is whose well these are for you. The second benefit of this particular buy is that all five cords are ten feet each. Watch out for other products that advertise 10ft and then pull the old switcharoo on you and give you multiple length cords.
4,My phone eats charging cords for breakfast. Of course I want them to last longer but they are a great value for an inexpensive cord and last longer than most I’ve tried.
5,Use for several devices the length is accurate work wonders traveling for Back seat use.  Great value for your money.

3,Few of them stop working! Rest is still working OK for long reach areas bought 3-4 months ago
3,I only received 4 in the packaging. Missing pink.
3,Son muy vistosos pero duran muy poco. Son finos y quebradizos
5,I just received these in the mail today. They seem to be as good as all other cords I've had over the years.
3,Loved them at first! After one month they all stopped working! I don’t recommend this product.
4,Love the different colors and length
5,Good value for money. I like that the cord was long

5,Let ve it!!!!
5,Great colors love the long cords as I’m never close to an outlet and awesome price for 5!!
5,The product shipped very quickly. It’s a five pack that came right away. My son took his favorite color before I could get a picture.
2,Only got about 2 months out of each one. they either stopped working or fell apart.
5,Very convenient 5 of these for such a great price. I bought these for the length since my outlets aren't close to my bed.
5,Great charger very useful and it lasts very long
2,One of them lasted 2 weeks
2,Stopped working within a month
2,Out of the pack of 5 of two lasted so far a week after receiving them. 1 just stopped working the next day and 2 actually broke off in my iPads. Waste of time spend a little extra and get better quality!

3,Our family goes through a lot of chargers so these may get lost before they wear out— although some already have worn out…buy higher quality
3,I have no idea if these are great quality or not! I buy them and divide them between my two children who are constantly losing or destroying them somehow! When they stop working they have spares until they run out and I have to order again!
2,I’m on my third one of the pack in a month. One wasn’t charging maybe a short. Another broke off in my phone. Let’s see if the others can hold
3,They’ll do but be careful if you smell something burning check these chargers. Don’t expect a great quality item. It chargers your Apple products but the cord is real flimsy and won’t last long. I guess that’s why they give you a bunch.
2,I’m a little behind on writing my review but I’ve bought these and the first one I used has broken within a week of using it. I have a few more left since I gave out a couple but personally I wouldn’t buy these again.
5,Great price good value
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 These are all beautiful. and they work amazing. Quality is amazing as well and length is perfect for the price!!!
4,Love these chargers
5,Not generic at all none broke yet and love the fact that it’s very long.
3,Do these charge your phone? Yes. But they’re flimsy feel cheap (not all off-brand chargers feel cheaply made but these do) and the part that plugs into your phone gets HOT after just a short period of time. I’ve used multiple brands of charger cords including Apple and several off brands; these are the only ones that heat up like this.
5,So far they are doing what I would think they would.
2,I dislike the fact that you have to wiggle the cord to get your phone charged.
2,The cords were long but they did not last they worked one day and the next they didn’t and they broke easily I had them about 1 week me and my kids
5,Loved the chargers
3,One charger only lasted about 2 months and it stopped working. So far the others are ok. Not sure if you’d want to purchase or not.
5,There are 5 cords and they are 5 different colors.  They are extreme long and durable.  The cords stretches over countertop and dinner room table with ease.  I have no issues with any of the cords.  I am completely satisfied with the purchase.  I would like to also say the deliver was extremely fast.  Thank you.
5,Now everybody in our households knows which cord is theirs and which is not!
5,These cords only lasted about 6 weeks each. They just literally stopped working at about 6 weeks into using them. The cord length is great but otherwise it’s not worth it.
5,I love the price so far I love the product and it really feels good to know if something does go wrong the company stands by their product.
5,I bought this product to have a supply of iPhone chargers for my family. The colors are nice and bright and the shipping was super quick. They seem to be of a good quality for long durability.
4,The media could not be loaded.
2,Only thing of value this product have is the amount you get for the low priceThe only negative experience it takes away from the value is that fact it TAKES *HOURS* for you phone to charge! My phone will be on it for two hours + and it would only charge between 8-12% from when it was previously.Don’t believe the hype of all the 4+ stars you would probably find better elsewhere
5,Me gusto los colores y lo largo y que cumplen con las expectativas y funcionalidad
5,Personal use at gome
3,One of them didn’t work out of the package and another broke about 2 days later. The ones that actually worked are fine. Nothing spectacular about the charging time.
5,Like the colors  great deal for money.
3,Did not charge properly. Not very durable. I like the colors
5,I liked the price of 5 chargers color coded. I’ve been wanting to get these for awhile. They are good quality and I hope they don’t get lost or stolen! Color coding great for siblings
3,Was very cheaply made. Not impressed.
5,Great item. So glad I bought them.
5,Love the colors and works so good last long and the length is amazing 🤩
2,Great price.  Had good reviews. Worked great for a week or so. But then A couple of them stopped working from one side.Not worth the cheap price. Go for better quality.
5,I ordered these for my iPhone because everyone keeps taking my cords! I like the colors and it was an awesome price. I keep the extras hidden so I always have a cord for home or auto!
1,I never leave reviews but this one definitely was upsetting. Its been a month and a half and they stopped working weeks ago. I just haven't had a moment todo this. I tried to return them but the window closed for any returns. On top of that the part where you put into the phone snapped off. Don’t recommend ***
3,Barely charges and some didn't charge at all. Length is good
2,Purchased as a stocking stuffer for my grandchildren.  Some of the power cords were duds right out of the package.  I tried them a second time and they just don’t last.  Very disappointing.
5,Good product and great price
5,With Christmas around the corner these charging cords are perfect! I tried one out and it works great the length is convenient and the kids each have their own color. No more arguing over chargers!
5,It’s a great deal!
5,The products look very durable and the mailing was unbelievable received a day before expecting it. Really satisfied service.
2,Well I waited to review these chargers so I could see how well they were going to work. I received them sometime around February 4th it is now February 15th and 2 have already stopped working. They are beautiful colors and I received them quickly after ordering. However I wouldn’t buy them again bc I don’t feel they are worth it if they only last a week each.
5,I just received them but will definitely let y’all know
5,Working great so far. Not as fast as an apple cord of course but definitely worth the money. Great length and nice color options to distinguish them
2,i bought these because i needed chargers for me and my siblings quick because all 4 of us were sharing one. After only a week of using mine i dropped my phone while it was on the charger on accident and it bent. I tried bending it back and the metal charging part completely detached from the plastic. It’s long which i like but not durable at all and very cheap material.
5,Awesome chargers
2,You get what you pay for….They break after about a month
5,I just love it the colors I’m very satisfied. I would recommend it.
5,Plastic coated but great colors
5,Brighten the colors.
5,The 10' cable are a must for home use.
5,Love the colors … have on different devices…keep everything charged
1,I don’t know if mine were a “bad batch” or what but none of them pulled energy to my cell phone .  So be careful when buying
5,Easy to order and register for lifetime warranty.
1,They all stopped working within a month of purchase. Initially loved the idea of each person having a different color charger but they are of Poor quality- I would recomm finding something else.
5,These are beautiful so far I haven’t had any trouble. Cheap for the price. I’ll update in a few months
5,Very good charging cords good length doesn’t tangle up.
5,I’m very pleased with product. The light bulbs are bright and work well. Excellent buy and value.
2,I’m in my 3rd one they last for a little while then randomly stop charging but I expected that. Also a very slow charge. I’m not angry because I didn’t expect more but I won’t buy again
5,Holds up for my toddles tablets!
5,Very good it just feels cheap
2,Didnt last long before they stopped working
2,Sadly we needed 3 so I thought this was a great deal. To good to be true. They all lasted (charge wise) less than a month.
2,2 cords did not work upon arrival. I didn’t return them as there were 3 others.. another cord just quit working within 2 months of ordering.
2,The 3 products  out of 4 seemed to work well.The 4th charger in the set did not work at all.Wish they could just send 1 out.Returning products can be a chore.Also seemed to be a return item.Shame on them.
1,Once a year I always buy a set of cheap chargers. I was excited about these ones because I liked the colors. Usually even with cheap charger sets we can get them to last at least a whole year before they’re all broken or no longer charge.Two of these stopped charging even after I cleaned the charging ports and the rest broke at the charging port. I was very disappointed. Don’t waste your money on these. With the lack of sturdiness of the charging ports you risk getting them stuck in your phone.
5,Love the colors
1,Cheaply made I purchased these in Jan 2922.Only one is still working.The ends break off in the phone. Lucky I have a multi tool I was able to remove it.Don’t waste your money.
5,Durable
5,Love the colors and the extra lenght
5,Love the colors and the cords are high quality
2,They for about 2 months and then they just all of a sudden get a shortage.
5,Great length and charges fast
1,Got the five pack two weeks ago I’m already on the third charger. Each stopping after only a few days.  Got two left and I don’t think they’re even gonna last a month. (Total)
2,They break very easily do not use for children Easily broken at tip would not recommend for anyone that doesn’t take care in getting phones off without pulling on it
2,I purchased  this thinking I would have enough for the family but after a week 3 of the 5 have stopped working.
5,Good
1,Just bought these chargers a few weeks ago. I’ve already had 3 break on me . Not very great quality. Do not buy if you are looking for long lasting
5,Works as expected.
1,We tried using these for iPads and they did barely charged at all. I tried using it for my iPhone and also barely got any charge at all. We do not recommend.
5,THE COLORS ARE BEAUTIFUL BECAUSE I SHARE WITH MY GRAND KIDS!!!!THANKS
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The product bent after less than a day of use. When you plug in the device it doesn’t always charge your phone and it requires adjustment. I’m like the length and different colors but It’s not durable or good quality.
2,I ordered these and received them on December 14th. Since then I’ve gone through three of them. They’re not durable I’ll leave my iPhone charging overnight and will wake up with barely 60% charge. Don’t recommend.
2,These chargers worked for maybe a day then just stop working. Don't waste your money
5,Product was fast shipping and the warranty is a nice touch
1,I’ve already gone thru all of the wires between 4 of us.
1,These are the worst chargers I’ve ever had. If the stem move slightly or if the cord moved slightly you lose service.
1,These do not charge your iPhone out of the package only two of them work and they take so long to charge the phone . I thought I was getting a great deal since we use multiple iPhones in my family . And the worse of it is that I can’t return them . Waste of money do not buy this product .
1,We have hardly used these and are on vacation.  This was plugged into an iPad for LESS THAN 5 minutes and then we smelled something burning.  This was smoking!  Thank goodness we hadn’t gone anywhere and smelled it before it started a fire.
5,Works well and durable
5,I like it
1,It breaks off in your phone you got to get pliers to get it out of your phone got 3 so for 2 does done it never again so mad .
1,Unfortunately these just don't work.  We had one that worked once or twice but he others never worked at all.  We went back to a higher end charging cable.
5,Great value works perfect!
5,Good
1,Failed cheap (overseas) knock off quality. Stop working - all multiple units in the package. Not a one time failure.
1,None of the 5 of my chargers work properly. It says charging when you plug in your phone but after a few minutes of charging it stops. It’s led to many upsets of having a dead phone
1,One of them stopped working after 3 days.
1,One out of four cords did not work.
1,The length is the only "good" thing about these cords. These broke down quickly and are not durable do not function after a few months and do not last.
1,Bought this pack for my 4 kids and myself.  After only 1 day of use 3 of the cords don't work!  Waste of my money.
5,As described and arrived fast!

Shame on Apple.
1,I just bought these chargers probably about a week ago and I'm already on charger number 3 because they literally stop working within days of use
1,Dislike the size.Would like correct size
2,Stopped working on our devices in about 2 months
1,All chargers stopped working within 6 weeks
1,3/5 chargers worked for a day or less
1,All broke after a week
1,Don’t last long I only have one left that works and haven’t had them but couple of weeks.
1,It didn’t charge and it broke as soon I unplugged my phone
1,This Is a I phone charger cable I am not happy because one cable is working condition all others does not work.
2,These cords are not 10’ They measure 6’
1,They didn’t work sending it back for a refund
1,They didn’t charge well and broke super easily
1,Within 3 months NONE of these chargers worked.
1,Don’t waste your money!!! All of the m stopped working within a week
1,I got these June 15th and the already stopped work. Horrible.
1,Pretty colors but will NOT recommendThe port on 2 of the cords bent within 1 months time.  I discarded them because as I did not want to take the chance of it breaking off into the port of my cell phone. . Not durable at all
1,Pure garbage.  Not lasting a week of use
2,Junk quality. Breaks easily
1,These are the worst chargers I’ve ever purchased. I’ve had them for about a month and out of all of them two I’ve already thrown away because they stopped working. And the others work when they want to. I’ll go to sleep and my phone is charging and wake up in the morning and it’s at a low percentage because the charger stopped working during the night. I have to constantly check my phone to make sure it’s still being charged. Absolute waste of money.
1,So I was a bit frustrated that of the 5 cables I got 3 of them broke incredibly easy. The piece that goes into your charging port broke off. The pink cord I used in my car and it overheated and almost caught fire. If this had happened in my sleep this would have been much worse.
1,The new cords are super long & bright colors are really easy to see! Exactly what I wanted. Of course they fit my iPhone. I don’t have any evidence of how long they will last but so far I’m super happy with them!UPDATEThey last about  2 months ! They will not change my phone now. I only hope they haven’t done damage to the phone. Don’t waste your time or money. I’m not sure what are the best kind to buy but not these!
1,Half didn’t work
1,No sirve. Se desconectan fácilmente dEl USB y delOtro extremo se rompió el conector pequeño al teléfono. Pésima adquisición .
1,Only received 1 paid for 5
1,I had the chargers for 1 week and every dad i would have to switch it out for a different one because they would just stop charging all together
1,Everything
1,I received these January 5th - today is January 25 and the cord I use most often is working when it wants to.  It’s used nightly for a couple of hours and only on the couch to charge my phone after work so not really durable or sturdy - but it’s been a Godsend for as long as it lasted.
1,
1,I love the length and colors! But these charge so slow even compared to other generic brands I have tried. Also I’ve only had them a couple of weeks and two of them already no longer work. On one of them the tip actually broke off! Super bummed. I would definitely return them but I’m not sure it’s worth my time to bother with it.
1,I bought these less then a month ago and now a few of them are broke!!!!I liked that they were 10feet & MFi. However they did not last and are already broken!  I am so disappointed.  These do NOT look durable or extra strong!  I would not buy these again in fact I will noT
1,No sirven
1,Didn't recommend. Bad quality.
1,I bought these chargers at the end of November I’m currently on my last one as the rest of them have all stopped working. Never in my life have I had chargers break so quick. How can 5 chargers not last two full months?? Save your money these are not worth it.
1,Bought a 5 pack of the 6ft long cords. All 5 cords worked less than a week some only for a few hours. Would not buy these ever again. Received a full refund.
1,One of the worst product I ever bought on Amazon. Bought 5 pack a month ago and already 2 of them are broken. Bad quality!
1,Broke off in phone after two uses
1,I bought these twice (my bad) I gave the benefit of doubt but they don’t last more then a week or two if your lucky.aDo not waste your money!!!
1,I have one charger left. One of them stopped charging within the first day and the other ones stopped charging within the first week
1,All of the chargers stopped working within a couple weeks. Some didn’t even work right out of the package. I tried contacting the seller.  They responded to me once asking for my order number and have ignored me ever since.
1,We used them for a while ad stopped working. Don’t wast your time and money with these items.
1,My kids are charging ipad with this cables and it's already says " not charging"2 cables are having issues. such a bad quality!
1,2 of the chargers stopped working within 2 days
1,Out of the 5 chargers we only have 1 left that works. All the others have no physical damage but they just stopped working
1,Don't waste your money Of the 5 three didn't work immediately Any of them took days to actually fully charge something and then eventually broke  After about a month
1,After one week one of my chargers got hot and quit working. Unfortunately with Amazon they want you to go to the nearest drop off to return the item. Very inconvenient!!! Wasting my gas to return an item that doesn’t work.
1,After almost a month the cords do not work .. I want a refund
1,They stopped working after two weeks
1,Glad some liked it but for me it was a total “L” (aka a loss). Will be returning for something better!! Buy at your own risk.
1,I dislike that all 5 items stop working within 2 weeks. It was not worth my money. I am very disappointed. Now I have to purchase more like these.
1,I had this product for 3 weeks and 3 of them are no longer working! I would not recommend no matter how long the cord is…
1,The charger started on fire while plugged into an iPad mini. Smoke smell burned the case fire while we were driving.
1,Items are not worth the trouble
1,Out of 5 chargers only two work now one broke the first time is was plugged in one never worked and the other one broke off in my daughter’s iPad
1,So one charger stopped working and then shorted out. Then before I could unplug it it caught on fire. Be very careful with this product!
1,Worst charger! Should be taken off the market is a scam! None of them work for me!  I need refund back..
1,Although they do charge apple products they don’t work well. Very very very slow charge. Flimsy - ends break off easily.
1,None of them worked and 2 broke when I plug them in
1,4 out of 5 of them didn’t work at all and the one that does work only works sometimes don’t buy this crap
1,2 broke with in a day.  Very flimsy
1,This product was ok for awhile. The original cord works for a few weeks. The second one is still working. The other 3 do NOT work at all.
1,Do not buy.  This part that goes into the phone broke off and I had to use tweezers to remove it from my phone.
1,They arrived. I’m excited. First cord lasted almost three days and the tip broke in my phone. Pieces of junk.
1,I bought this pack a little over a month again and 2 have stopped working already
1,2 of the 5 cords will not charge
1,Broke with ease I do not recommend these save ur money peeps!!!
1,I have had these a few weeks they all stopped working. Total Garbage. Don’t buy!!!
1,The tips came out of all of them after using them 3-4 times!!
1,I plugged my phone in and in just a few minutes the charger was super hot. I will not use these they are very UNSAFE
1,They charged for first 5 times then just quit working!  Disappointed !
1,Unfortunately these cords didn’t all work. 2 didn’t work at all one lasted 3 days. Not worth the money or time to purchase
1,they stop working in middle of charge
1,All 5 chargers didn't last a full week they stopped charging the interior wires are very cheap they break fast
1,These cords lasted two weeks. Don’t waste your money on this item.
1,Every cable stopped working within a week of use. Avoid at all costs

1,Cords stopped working within 2 months. Don’t waste your money.
1,Two stoped working
1,Haven’t had the cords for a month and none of them work anymore. A total waste of money.
1,The stop working after a week of working
1,These cords last less than a week each. So pointless. They just stop working/charging.
1,They dont charge fast at all and one of the cables already doesnt work!
1,This product broke on me four times.  I would not recommend getting this product!
1,Broke after one month of use. Would not recommend.
1,2 out of the 5 worked. Not worth it.

4,Very useful. 4 out the 5 is still working.
2,Loved the product but after two months only two out five still work
5,Loved one package with 5 different colors.  As soon as the package came in each of our family members claimed a color.  That means no more stealing the "white" cord from each other.  Great color great length excellent value pack!
2,These chargers aren’t it. They overheat. Won’t charge you’re phone if it’s off or dead. Disappointed
5,The wires work perfectly and they are durable . I like that there’s different colors to them and the size of the wires are useful.
5,En casa todos tenemos iPhone pero solo había un cargador que funcionaba me decidí a comprar este set de 5 cargadores ya que era una necesidad pero también un beneficio ya q pude escoger los pies de largo d ellos de 10ft y es lo máximo  ademas su carga es bien rápida y tienen unos colores fabulosos ya mi familia y yo no pelearemos mas sobre quien va a usar el cargador ahora jiji ya q cada uno tiene el suyo propio ☺️
5,Good quality for the money.
5,Very nice an works as expected

5,Durable flexible well made
5,My dogs puppy chewed through a cord with one bite. It is worth it to spend a little extra money for a more durable cord. Definitely not a good product if there is a chance it may be chewed on.
4,I ordered these cables for my iPhone & iPad as I like longer cables then the short ones that come with the cell phones.  I received my order in less than 2 days! Much quicker than I thought they would arrive. They came well packaged and in a resealable package in order to store the ones I am not using. I haven’t tried them yet but right now I have to figure out which color to use first!
5,These are working excellent
5,Fast charge
5,One of the chargers I received did not work but they replaced it fast!
5,Good price timely delivery love the length!
5,Easy and smooth order looked exactly as promised and arrived when it was supposed to. Can't ask for more than that! Good quality product too

5,Works for old and new iPhones. A package can last 2 people a year. I never need to buy more than 2 packages a year tops (for two people). This includes multiple locations in house office or car.
5,I have no regrets buying this pack of lightning cords!! The colors are great cords are long and the material of it is really nice. They are quality made and the price is great! No problems with them and all works well. Will buy another pack!!
5,Are these super sturdy and going to last a lifetime?? No. But are they worth the money?? YES! I am very frugal when it comes to cords I lose them/forget them a lot so I don’t invest money to get good ones. I’ve repurchased these twice and probably will again
5,👍

5,Love the colors and cord length
5,Quality chargers. I would purchase again.
5,Very durable and I just love the length
5,Excellent iPhone charging cable extra long and very thick and sturdy cable.
1,DONT WORK
5,My favorite chargers they last long and the cord is long so you can move far away and it won’t come out
4,Seem really cheap (don’t know how long they will last before they quit working) but they work for now (day 1) and you get 5 super long cords for the price of 1.  Charges kinda slow.
5,Wonderful deal on these. Great stocking stuffers

4,The chord I had didn't last very long. Lasted for about a month or so before the chord started to go a bit wonk.

5,You will not be disappointed with the speed of this chargers capability and the various colors allow everyone in your household to have their own.
3,3 del total me salieron dañados y no se pudo devolver pirq  ya habia pasado el tiempo de devolución 😞
4,Got these for my grandsons.  Now each onecwill have their own  cord.  Thanks
5,The media could not be loaded.
5,Bought for Xmas. Eager to give to kids. Individual colors will keep them from stealing each other’s!
5,Mfi certified charging cables for iPhone devices . I love that these items are durable and convenient for fast charging . The 10ft of sturdy non braided charging cable cords are just the right length to plug into any usb component . And I love the pastel colors . Also a great value for a 5 cables .
5,It is a fast charger
1,I tried to charge my phone with one of the cords and it doesn’t work
5,Literally obsessed
3,One of them stopped working in 1 week.
5,It works fine
5,Love the fact that they are re different colors and the price !
5,Each cube had a place for 2 cords to charge
4,When the children “misplace” theirs they “borrow” mine.  I’m glad to find an affordable set of chargers that allow me to continue my reign as the loser / loaner of chargers.

I am so happy I got these cords! They are 10 feet long and reach where I need it to. I literally have had no issues. I checked every cord when I purchased and all of them work. I am not sure about the battery life they seem reasonable. I do not keep them on the charger all night just long enough to charge up. Maybe 3 hours to get a solid 100 percent charge which is fine with me. Also it is great for my husband to use in the vehicle when he has customers. No complaints. Also upon further inspection they bare all the right mfi markings and are made well!
5,I’ve only used one of the cords but it works great and is the perfect length.
5,What are the won’t charge two of them I’ve already broken and as far as the other two go I have to keep plugging into my phone for it to finally start charging. Do not buy please they suck. In fact I’d like my money back!!
5,Charge really fast and pretty colors

5,Great quality love the colors & they all work great!
4,Good charging
5,I have to continually buy charging cords due to damage or being lost. Love the bright colors helps kids to find easier. The cord is durable. The wrapped looking ones break at the tip. These seem to be more flexible.
5,Great color selection! Bought these for our kids no more debates on someone having someone else’s charger! Feel to be of good quality.
4,Only 2 out of the 5 charges worked for me. I thought it was my phone at first but soon realized it was the charges. It sucks cause charges my phone fast.
5,nothing
5,The product is exactly what it describes. I love the length of the cords. The quality and amount of cords that gone in the pack is a great price!
5,The cords are excellent buy durability is great and the price is awesome
