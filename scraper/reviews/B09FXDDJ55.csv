5,It gets the job done so no complaints! Perfect for phones and tablets. Touches on both ends and has a cover. The color is cute and it grips good.
5,I‚Äôve had it about a month and so far I like it. No issues
5,These are just what I've been looking for.  I needed a stylus that wouldn't fall apart after a lot of us. So far these have held together beautifully. The tip of the stylus is made of a mesh material which holds together much better than the silicone others are made of
5,Does exactly what it says. Colors are cute and it comes with replacements
5,Love them
5,My daughter loves these stylus pens.
5,I have bought many pens for touch screens and I'd have to say these are my favorite. They are the perfect size for comfort not too bulky not too small. They have a smooth glide to them and the magnetic cover keeps the opposite side safe but is easy to take off when you want to. I would definitely buy these again.
5,Best ones I‚Äôve bought so far.
5,Works as stated easy to use.
5,Nice styles pen
5,I love these pens and gold that they come with replacements! Gave a pen to my mom since she just got an iPad and needs it for work.
5,This was a present for my 13 year old a d she love it. Thanks.
4,Tried to find the cheapest functional stylist for my iPad.  Works fine.  Might could have gotten the same thing at the $$ store...??
5,It is excellent!
4,My daughters love it for writing drawing and everyday app use on phones and tablets.
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†This pen is great! It has a metallic tip end and it has a precision tip as well. The magnetic cap is pretty good considering how well it protects the tip. I'm glad to have gotten it on sale! The color is really great and I tried it on my iPad (5th gen) and worked just fine.
4,Very small could be longer for people with long fingers works great for my granddaughter but not me
5,I like everything about  the product.  Worth the buy
5,Pens work on my android tablet & iPad. It came with 1 cap for each stylus that work as described just  wish it had 2 caps per stylus.
5,I really enjoy my stylus. It‚Äôs super cute stays cool in my hand and works. I have the second to my daughter for her school tablet she enjoys how much easier it is to use
5,Love it
5,My grandson is using it
5,Perfect for iOS or windows touch screen. Accurate.
3,I don't recommend them didn't last long
5,I love these üíï
5,Use them with my iPad.  When I need to underline things  It is perfect
2,I like the idea of this stylus but it only works sometimes. It gets frustrating to have to tap multiple times or press hard to get it to read the pen. My tablet easily reads my finger so I know the pen is the problem here. I really hoped it would work too because i hate leaving fingerprints on my screen.
5,Very smooth and easy to use. Writes really well on IPad.
5,The only thing that I did not like was the fact that it constantly rolled off the table.  So I wrapped a rubber band around it to solve that problem.  Other than that I think this is a great item!
5,It's perfect and easy to use. I actually like the little squeak when the ball slides across the screen.
5,We‚Äôll prices & works very well
5,I really Like The Color and The Fact that you can use it as a stylus and a pen.
5,Very pleased with speed of order and they work great on iPad.
5,These pens are very nice and you can't beat the price!  I would buy again or even for a gift.  I've used them for a couple days now and love them.  They are very sturdy and comfortable to use. I've used all the pieces and they all work great.  The cap even screws on to protect the disc part while not in use and screws onto the other end so you don't have to worry about losing it. The pens are very responsive. The wet even come in a nice box to me keep the extra pieces or pen you're not using.
5,Works great
5,Muy f√°cil de usar
5,This is the smoothest stylus I have had yet.  Just love them!
5,Easy to use
5,I'm not a digital artist or CAD designer so my needs are pretty simple. Just using for everyday touchscreen and the occasional signature. My hands have had a tough life. Between surgeries arthritis and tendonitis I needed something to help improve my accuracy better than the rubber/mesh tipped stili I've used in the past. These definitely do the trick. My only complaint if any is that it doesn't have a clip on one of the caps which would be convenient but for me not a necessity.
4,Love the option of various tips to use depending on the app I am on and it works great. The screw on lid didn‚Äôt really work well. If you screw it on all the way then you unscrew the entire tip when you remove it if you put it on looser then it keeps falling off.
2,The tip of the pen fell apart within 3 weeks.
5,I love it! Affordable and worked on my Chromebook (acer Chromebook 15) and my IPhone XR! Wasn‚Äôt missing any parts and were in perfect shape. Really good for everyday touch screen activities and beginner art :) Keep in mind that this stylus is shorter than an everyday pencil so if you have big hands that might a problem but was good for me.
5,I was very excited to receive these today for my digital learner. The fine point works so much better on the iPad than the one he‚Äôd been using which is especially important when he‚Äôs being graded on handwriting. I was disappointed that 2 of the replacement tips were missing but won‚Äôt be returning because of the time it would take.
4,I love this stylus. It works great. However this last order was missing all 4 of the tips. No easy way to get ahold of the seller so I will be returning it.
5,Bought it for my son who is remote learning. He is 6 and works great on the iPad. Great for wanting to make sure he is able to hold and write with a pen properly. So much more accurate then using a figure to write with
5,These work well as long as the screen on your phone is clean.  happy with my purchase.
2,N/A
5,Wasn't looking for an active pen. This passive disc pen works great for the purpose. Disc slides easily on the i-Pad.  Responsive and accurate. Haven't used the other tips.
5,THIS WORKS WELL PLUS YOU GET 2 AND EXTRA TIPS
1,The stylus pen end has a round disc on the end. Doesn't write at all on what I needed it for. Going back.
5,Theses stylus pens go above and beyond my Hope's and expectations. I am super pleased with this purchase. And I would recommend it to anyone.
5,They work great with all my touch screens! They came fast and a great value for the money!!!!
5,much better than i thought they would be and a full set
5,Fantastic stylus! Very easy to use on my Samsung tablet for drawing and games
5,These are different than dollar tree stylus pen. Thank you for offering this
5,Nice stylus and replacement tips. Loving it thus far.
5,Easy to use.  Fits my hand well.  Tip lasts a long.  I love them.
5,Works great in my iPhone. Has the right tip that I need.
5,This pen is easy enough for a 6 year old to use!
5,Works perfectly. I use it everyday.
5,They are great to use.
2,The pens work great but box came damaged and is missing one of the replacement tips.
5,Good value .
1,When I bought this item i thought I would be able to draw or write with it on my laptop. Does it click yes. But the whole reason I got it was so I can write out math problems ans share it with my students. On top of that they are charging me $11 to return in and I only gt$1 as a refund. Completely horrible
5,great
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†This did not work for my iPad. Waste.
2,The transparent head is useless I bought this due to the transparent head but it is very uncomfortable to use end up using the other side.
1,Cute to look at but they quality is not good.. Even though it has extra attachment pieces i didn‚Äôt expect to have to use them the very next day
2,Awkward to use ‚Äúpen‚Äù end ‚Ä¶ not as accurate as I‚Äôd hoped. Should have returned.
1,Does not write on my iPad only scrolls scam.
1,They completely scratched my daughters brand new tablet screen!  Super disappointed with these pens
1,I have a 2 in 1 tablet/laptop and I bought this to test the clear end of this stylus but it scratched my screen. the clear end works better but only if you don't mind your screen being all scratched up.  The soft end I don't think slides as well as I expected.
1,Only got one stylus and it states two pieces.
1,Pieces broke to fast for the price not happy
5,Great buy! Works well and you get 2 lol.
2,I got this to use with the coloring app on my iPad. I was using a stylus and it was hard to color when I saw this on Amazon. There is a plastic disk on the tip that is hit or miss. I find myself tapping constantly to fill the small color edges. Usually flip over to use the stylus part of this pen which is not the reason I got it. Also it states in the description that it is suitable for coloring apps and that's why I got it. Didn't need another stylus.
5,He held it comfortably in his hand with a fine nib and no trouble in writing fine print. It wrote smoothly without delay or delay was responsive and affordable.
5,My kid is using my wife's 2 in 1 Dell laptop for class and he was having trouble using his fingers. There are multiple pens for the Dell laptop on Amazon but saw this so I said why not? For less than $10 it has worked well so far so I'm happy and kids happy!
5,Update: I contacted the company and despite my having missed the return window they said they were going to refund my money in full! That is excellent customer service!They do not work on my kids chrome books for school and I didn‚Äôt discover this until after I missed the return window so total waste of money for me. üôÅüôÅ So bummed!
5,I actually bought it for my granddaugher's 10th birthday so she could use it with remote schooling. It works great for writing on her chromebook!
5,I have a travel tablet I use I like to draw and having these  Captive 2 in 1 disc pens really work great for drawing and doodling. I'm really happy with my new Stylist pens.
5,these worked great for the price with my kids doing online schooling this has helped so much and you really cannot beat the price and getting two is just awesome really love how this ended up working
5,For what they cost they are smooth.  They have just the right amount of weight to them.  Solid build.  Plenty of replacement parts.  You get two!
5,It is very convenient to use this pen. It's very sensitive. I hold it comfortably in my hand. The tip of the pen is very thin so I can write flexibly. The transmission speed is very fast without delay and without charging. Cost-effective very good.
5,Bought these for my daughter to use on her iPhone and she loves them. Packaging was also very nice!!
5,Sensitive and attractive
5,It was good for the price and really easy to use had this for a while and my digital art got better using this
5,Easy to use on touch screen
5,Works well.
5,Kind of lame that they don't have storage for the nubs though I have yet to wear any down. I love these fine point stylus for drawing on my android tablet and I like to have a few hanging around because what I really love to do is lose them.
5,This is awesome. My granddaughter just loved it.
5,It works great with my iPhone and iPad. I barely touch the screen with it and the characters appear where they need to be. My only comment is that the magnet that supposedly holds the cap in place has worn off or I lost it. The cap on that other end is lose now. :(
5,These are perfect for the price and you get extra replacement.  Loved my purchase
5,These pens works GREAT!  This is the second pair I‚Äôve gotten. Just so I can put one in Every room
5,Muy pr√°ctico
5,Very easy to use. Good buy.
5,Who‚Äôs they had them in more colors but I love the set I ordered
5,What a game changer to writing on my iPad. It‚Äôs like using a pencil right where you want it.  Very smooth and pretty sharp.
5,Works well and glides smoothly and easily on Ipad. Great price for what you get.
5,I don't have to clean my kid's screens as much with this dandy tool! My kids love using it.
1,This stylus won‚Äôt let me write on my ipad
5,Very useful with IPhone and iPad.  Useful using apps and writing texts or emails
5,Work well and precise
5,I love these! It gives you the two choices which is nice. The accuracy is very nice. They are very easy to use. They get a #1 rating. My boyfriend took my purple one and immediately fell in love so I will be making another order.
5,My kids love these. Only if they didn‚Äôt lose it the next day!!!!
1,It doesn't work at all with the program I use the program needs to use a pen that can be used over wifi so I forgot to return it on time because I am busy so if you need it to take notes in college it doesn't work. I use notability and you need one of the ones that uses Bluetooth I did not think about it and honestly it should have a disclaimer not for that type of app or program. I will keep it but I haven't really found a use for it I use an iPad to take notes
5,My daughter uses these for some of her games. I e used them for coloring/journaling on my phone
5,The size and weight are great and they do what they're supposed to do. The icing on the cake is the magnetic cap that stays on even when I put the stylus in my front pocket. It protects the stylus tip from bending breaking or falling out - all of which I've managed to do.
1,I thought it had a point so I could draw it does not it has a flat piece on the tip? Idk why but just not what I needed.
5,My daughter absolutely loves them!
5,She loves these she uses them to draw on her iPad . She loves that there are two pretty colors . I like that there are two in the pack period üôÉ
