5,ProsPackaging and case make it easy to store and transportExtremely easy to set upMultiple sizes for mounting threads and locations for threadsAll metal construction feels sturdy very important considering how many expensive items it will be holdingI don’t know much about prompter glass but the glass hasn’t given me any trouble on cameraIncludes phone mount to film with and phone mount to be tele-prompt with.ConsThese are extremely nit picky and aren’t really a big deal and may not even apply to you but…I wish the gap between the top and bottom level under the camera was slightly larger just so I could mount other gear there. It’s about 2cm to small to fit my audio recorder.The hood that attaches to your camera lens to stop light bleeding in is a great but I wish the cinching mechanism was different because it’s kinda cumbersome on the lensI wish the glass came with a velvet bag or something for when I store it. It came with styrofoam protectors to prevent scratching though
5,This teleprompter was a stretch for me since I am not a videographer. But it is so very fun to have and to be able to look into the camera for filming. I did need to buy a few things: female to male adaptor to fit teleprompter to tripod ($8) iPad mini ($300+) app - took 3 tries of $30 each to settle on one I liked oops. Other than that it was a great purchase and I am seeing uses all over the place (speaker intros kids school projects etc)
5,This is a solid piece of kit at a good price packs down nicely and comes with a good case. I had previously bought a cheaper type which was just plastic and would break on the first transfer to another set. The Glide Gear is well built well packaged and well priced
5,This is so awesome. I am so excited to get this and tried it out. So easy to put together. Now I can make professional videos where I am actually looking into the camera. I am jumping with joy. Thank you for such an awesome product that is sturdy easy to put together and at a low cost which teleprompters go for. Thank you.
5,This made my life so much easier! From unboxing it to setting up my iPad took about 40min but then it saved us a TON of time shooting videos cause I didn’t have to remember a thing.
4,Professional teleprompters can cost a small fortune.  This is perhaps the ideal budget option.  Using any teleprompter app on your tablet or smartphone this will get the job done and at a tiny fraction of the price of professional units.  However there are a couple things to think about before you buy this.First you'll need some extra supplies.  You'll need a good high-quality tripod.  This prompter isn't terribly heavy (fortunately!) so it doesn't need to be the most expensive one in the world but you are going to make your tripod very top-heavy so you'll need a decent one.  You'll also need a tablet with a teleprompter app.  Technically you can use a smartphone but the extra screen space you get from a tablet is really necessary.  Teleprompter apps range from free to fairly expensive but you should be able to find what you need without spending more than a few dollars.  Personally since I'm a solo operation most of the time I also use a Bluetooth "page turner" foot pedal device (as musicians might use) to control the prompter app.  And of course you'll need a good camera.  None of these things are included but you probably already have most of them.The quality of the prompter is good enough.  It works perfectly though it feels cheap in its construction so you'll want to be extra careful not to bend the metal parts or break the glass.  Fortunately the carrying case it comes with is very well padded so I've not had any trouble there.Most importantly it works the way it's supposed to.  The glass is held at the proper angle to reflect the text to your eyes while keeping it invisible to your camera.  Its functionality there justifies the little bit of extra effort it took to get it in working order for my particular circumstances.And it did take a little bit of extra effort to get it to work because there are a couple of design flaws.First the cloth hood you use to shield out the light obscures the bracket you use to mount your camera.  There needs to be a hole in the cloth through which you can screw the camera to the prompter but there was no such hole.  This is a relatively easy fix--just a couple minutes with a pair of scissors or a utility knife will get the job done.  But it should have been done by the manufacturer.Attaching the camera is also fairly difficult.  To attach it you rest the camera on the prompter (inside the hood) and attach a screw from beneath the prompter.  Lining these screws up while your vision is blocked by the hood is a nightmare so you may want to find a way to streamline the process for yourself.In my case (your experience will vary depending on which camera you use) my camera also rests a little too low so the lens is always at the very bottom of my text rather than the center.I solved both of those problems by buying a simple 1.5 inch 1/4-20 tripod extender.  It raises the camera to the correct height solving the second problem and also provides a much easier target for the screw solving the first problem (and decreasing my total setup time for the teleprompter from about fifteen frustrating minutes to about thirty easy seconds).At first I was a little disappointed by this product.  I was still using it because I found it to be the closest to what I needed within my price range but it was always frustrating to use.  However by adding a few extra accessories to it I've elevated it to one of the most useful products in my kit.  In that spirit I DO highly recommend it IF you're willing to spend a little time getting it the way you want it.  I wouldn't consider it ready to go right out of the box.
5,Setup when quick. Rock solid materials. I'm using a Canon R10 camera - I'm ordered a 15mm riser to move the camera lens higher in the light box to better align the lens with the location of my eyes.
5,I recently purchased the Glide Gear TMP100 Adjustable iPad Tablet Smartphone Teleprompter and I am very pleased with it. It was very easy to set up and use. The prompter itself is very lightweight and portable which is great for traveling. It also comes with a remote so you can control it from a distance. The prompter works great with all types of tablets and smartphones.
4,The teleprompter is of good quality overall. The velcro could use a little help to stick down better but you would only notice this if you pack it away a lot.  You will enjoy the teleprompter a lot more if you commit to leaving it out and ready to use as it's a bit of a chore to setup for a quick zoom meeting.One modification I would have personally liked is if the non-adjustable stop that holds your phone/tablet were adjustable. In my case when I setup the tablet I see a bit more of the bottom of the tablet than I'd like although thinking about it now I might be able to just adjust the tilt of the glass slightly to compensate.Also in my case the camera sat a bit low so the effect of "eye contact" wasn't optimal but I can probably fix that with about 50 different ways of lifting the camera up about 2 inches.The overall size of the teleprompter is surprisingly large but this is probably necessary to keep the weight on your tripod from being too far forward where the glass is.One surprising nuisance for teleprompting is how hard it is to get something to horizontal flip the image. If you have good wifi you can use Deskreen which mirrors a screen on your computer to a browser tab. If you full screen this on a tablet it's workable. To reduce wifi traffic I put my laptop on a wire to my router and use wifi for the tablet. This helped the image lag quite a bit. For whatever reason hardware devices which can horizontal flip are pretty expensive. I used a FeelWorld F6 plus which works but at 5.5" is quite small.If it says anything about the teleprompter I bought one then later needed another so I bought the same exact one. I considered making my own but after thinking about how much time/effort it would take and how likely I was to be happy with the outcome I realized it was cheaper for me to just buy it.Happy filming!
4,The TMP 100 is easy to assemble and disassemble. My only issue is the weight. If you plan to mount it on a tripod get a sturdy one; I thought my tripod would break while recording.
5,Having used this product many times since purchasing it I have to say that I'm pretty satisfied with the quality and build! I've been looking for a portable teleprompter solution for awhile and came across this one after reading several reviews. I was surprised by the quality considering the price. Though it advertises to fit smaller iPads if you unscrew the front holder part you can easily place an iPad pro on there. The best part is that everything fits in a lightweight carrying case making it so easy to bring around. Highly recommended!
5,As a producer in the broadcast news industry I have worked for years using professional grade teleprompters and this unit is right there with them. The quality is solid and the ease of use is well-- simple! Using this for professional videos is a game changer and will be for anyone who adds this item to their production. Would definitely recommend!
5,It makes me look good for my presentation
4,Great Teleprompter easy set up
5,Packaging was great and shipped on time. Comes in a great case for storage or to carry around.
5,At first I ordered a fancier and more expensive teleprompter. I sent it back immediately and got the TMP100 instead. Works exactly as it should iPhone attachment included. Great deal!
5,This is a great product for my business.  Great support documentation found on their website to get you up and running.
5,I've purchased a few teleprompters to find the best fit for my wide angle lens camera only to return them. Glide Gear's TMP100 was the only one I found that was large enough and didn't break the bank. Others claim to be compatible with wide angle lens but not in my case. My camera must have a wider angle than most.Let's go to the actual review of the TMP100. There are several reasons I like this product.1. Large glass actually larger than my tablet so my Samsung S6 tablet screen fits cozy with room to spare. And it's large enough to use a real wide angle lens camera2. You can actually adjust the glass angle at a wide range. Other prompters are fixed and others have very limited movement. The TMP 100 has a very good range of angle so you can find what's best for your use. And again I can't iterate it enough my wide angle lens camera sees a little bit of the top and sides of the glass but adjusting the glass angle some has helped eliminate that.3. The clamp for the teleprompting tablet/phone can be adjusted inward/outward. This works great because you can slide it outward if you're using a phone so you can see the screen towards the middle of the glass. It's also good to push it inward if you have a larger tablet so its screen will fit nicely.4. There's an included adapter if you plan to use a phone to record. This is essential now since recent smartphones have high end cameras built in. I feel that the hood gets in the way when you use this. I may not have installed it correctly though. I just got it and I may need to tinker around with it a little more.5. The construction and materials are solid.What's the bad?1. It's bulky and heavy. Is it really bad? I don't think so. With a large glass like that I expect it to be bulky and with the solid materials used I expect it to be heavy.2. You need a heavy duty tripod. As I transitioned from amateur/casual photographer to serious/not professional video taking you learn a few things. The tripod that you would normally have for everyday use will not hold a heavy load. Make sure you purchase a solid tripod with this product.Are these really bad aspects of the product? Again I don't think so. It comes with the territory.I will continue to use it and if I find any other raves or rants I will update the review.
5,I have some experience with a variety of other teleprompters. This one is made extremely well and certainly has design elements that are superior to the other brands. If you're looking for a portable teleprompter this is the one for you.Pros:1. Glass is fantastic material. Truly better glass than most out there and great reflectivity.2. The design overall is stylish and flattering. The cloth cover/shield is rigid and aesthetic unlike other cheap teleprompters.Cons:*I'm rather critical in all of my reviews so these are less cons than user experience feedback1. The extra screws on the left and right of the aluminum are designed to attach accessories such as mics and lights. Keep in mind that they are very easily loosened because it is a single 1/4" knob that screws into your ball head joint or whatever you're using to attach the other devices. What this means is that every time I tried to adjust the microphone the screw would slip and I would need to retighten. I tried holding up my small 5.5" feelworld monitor on the side: it worked with a few diy solutions but whenever i tried putting the npf battery in the screw would easily come undone and then it was difficult to install.2. The design is best suited for an iPad; anything thicker than an iPad would work but need other reinforcements to get it tight. I use a Feelworld 7 inch monitor with this. It works great but the edges of the field monitor is too thick to be held by the teleprompter's clamps. As a compromise I put a piece of foam on one edge to add some extra resistance so the clamps could clamp the edge tightly. When you have HDMI cords and power adapters connected to the monitor you definitely don't want it to fall so this was my workaround.3. Cost. I still feel that for a piece of aluminum... some cloth and velcro and a two-way mirror... I'm not sure why teleprompters even at the budget range are as expensive as they are. Even so to me it's well worth the extra $50 for this one when comparing it to other budget teleprompters. And certainly why even spend money on the $1000 teleprompters when this works just as well?Conclusion: Don't even look at the other budget teleprompters. This has all the design specifications and features and is extremely quality.
5,Although it's not quite as light portable or cheap as some of the other teleprompters available at the lower-end of the market I ultimately decided to splurge on the TMP100 and I'm glad that I did. It's solid sturdy well-built and the design feels a lot more versatile than smaller prompters which screw on to the end of a camera lens.One thing that is easy to overlook when shopping for these things is the reflectiveness and quality of the glass itself as the tint will reduce the amount of light coming into your camera. My lighting situation is not the best so I was worried about this but I was pleasantly surprised to find that the image really didn't look much different at all.
