5,Bought this to replace an old charging station my wife started using when she got her smart watch. I like this one even better than the old one.  It’s sturdy but sleek! The charging light flashes if the phone is not positioned correctly and is solid if it is correct then dims (shuts off) so it doesn’t disturb sleeping. I have a stainless steel band on my watch; it holds my heavy smart watch without tipping over even if the phone is not on the charger.  And only one cord to power it means all my other cords are not needed! I love this charger!
5,I received this charger before I received my new iPhone. One of the reviews was concerned because the camera lens keep phone from laying flat. My original phone was an iPhone 12 and it charged great along with my smart watch. The new phone came yesterday and even with the case it charges great!I’m very pleased!
5,I have only had this for a couple of days and so far it seems to do the job.  It is convenient to use and doesn’t take up much space.  I haven’t traveled with it yet but it would seem the fact that the watch charger folds down makes it easier to pack.  I am able to charge my phone with its silicone cover from Apple still on it.  It also allows me to use same wall plug to charge my phone watch and iPad so I remember to plug them all in at night.
5,I love that i can charge my watch phone & air pods at the same time. This is a must have product. Will be buying another one for my office!
5,The base could be bigger and add a spot for my iPad or IPod or both but otherwise perfect for my phone/watch/ear buds
5,Works awesome. Great buy for the price.  A lot better quality than I expected
5,Stand for multi device charging.I’m able to charge my Apple Watch and my Apple phone at the same time!It has a spot for AirPods also. It eliminated cords all over my nightstand and looks much neater.
5,Very good buy. Highly recommend. Works great! Fast charge. And able to charge multiple things at once.
5,M husband had multiple chargers on his night stand. I bought this to reduce the clutter. Works great. Did not need the airpod charger as he has hearing aids-but definitely like the phone/Apple Watch charger all on one unit.  Cannot comment on use for traveling as we have not travelled since purchasing it.
5,Charges my iPhone 12 mini Apple Watch 7 and AirPods 3 perfectly! I bought 2 chargers before and neither worked. This works great no bright light and charged my devices fast without getting hot.
5,Works amazingly. Make it so much easier to charge all my devices and it is so sleek.
5,The iPhone 14 Pro because of the camera bump doesn’t sit flat on the charger while charging it.
5,Everything you need to charge your items is right here! Less cords on the nightstand
5,This design is ideal for my night stand. The level place for the watch is a better design. I like it.
5,Great for work or home.
5,This is the perfect size! Doesn’t take up much room charges both my phone and watch! You can even charge AirPods as well! Really love how compact it is! I’m ordering a second one for my husband!
5,Love how easily this collapsed for travel. It charges both watch and phone quickly.
5,Great all in one! Perfect for kitchen or nightstand.  Because the base doesn’t fold down relative to the phone holder I wouldn’t say it’s great for travel.  But for home it’s awesome!!
5,OK bought this one as a replacement for another one. LOVE IT. There is only 1 cord to plug in and the one I had used all of your separate cords so there was a mess of wires. Not any more. I already recommended this charger to a friend. I would recommend to anyone who has an iphone Apple Watch and AirPods.
5,Compact but charges great! I love that it takes up less space on my nightstand than my other individual chargers. This charger is just what I was looking for.
5,My son loves it
5,This product is exactly what I needed and very happy with the purchase. The design is great and it is travel friendly. I’ve tried different charging stations and this one tops them all with single connection and fits well for iPhone pro max.
5,Very nice design. I like the way the iWatch sit on the charger flat. I have a heavy band and the weight would pull it off my previous charge which was at an angle. The LED indicator is small and times out after 15 minutes nice!
5,No more cords everywhere.  This is Trudy and compact and portable.  Perfect to end all the cords.
5,I use this to charge my phone and my watch. I’m very pleased with it.
3,The product works just fine but I had to put my phone upside down in order for it to charge which is a pain if you have to look at your phone in the night because everything is upside down!
1,Was defective when received. Never worked.
1,Charger simply not turning on when plugged. Returning
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             Great charger and awesome build quality.
4,So far so good. I ordered another charging station from another company that was terrible and wouldn’t charge. So at least this one charges. One star off because of how fast it charges it could be faster it’s a bit slow. It’s okay though because I usually charge overnight while I sleep. I need to upgrade my AirPods too I have the first Gen that don’t have the magnetic charging case but that’s okay I likely won’t be charging my AirPods here anyway. I usually charge those right after the gym downstairs. All good fingers crossed it stays working for a long while.
5,Its nice to have my airpods apple watch and iphone charging all with one little hub!
5,I like that this is small and doesn’t take up much space. It charges my Apple Watch just fine but even with the slim otter box case it won’t charge my phone unless I remove it. Not a big deal just be aware.
