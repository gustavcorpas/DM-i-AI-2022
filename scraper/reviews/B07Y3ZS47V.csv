5,Excellent quality for the price and very easy to pair BUT I wish MS had included an inbuilt stand for the keyboard at the back that would raise the back a little bit like most of the keyboards making it more ergonomic. I hope Microsoft releases a new version of this making it more ergonomic
5,I love this keyboard!  I have had for about two years now.  It works very well and does everything it is supposed to do.  No USB adapter to loose which is great.  Very slim and lightweight which works well for small desk areas.
5,Smooth keys. Nice full size keyboard with small footprint. I picked up one for my home pc. Thinking about getting one for my office desktop. Make sure you have the latest Bluetooth usb dongle for your pc. 4.0 or later. Haven't anything to say about battery life as of yet. Just installed it. Running it on Windows 10. My ASUS usb Bluetooth instantly recognized it.
4,Keyboard is sleek and its smaller than the MS wireless keyboard with fewer keys :( overall I liked it but thought of returning it as I couldn’t lock function keys. I can’t work without Fn keys.Googled and found I can lock function keys by holding Fn + Caps keys together for 5 sec. Now am good to go.
4,Sleek but wished there was a bit more key travel. For 20 dollars it’s a good deal
5,Only had it a week so I don't want to jinx it but here we go:  installed quickly keys are the right size and resistance and is working perfectly.  Great price as well getting a Microsoft keyboard for under $20 is awesome.  Additional bonus is the designated Microsoft Office key.
4,See sync above. A sticker or something would have been helpful. Can't figure out what key or combo would work to refresh a browser page
3,I owned this keyboard for about a week and the first day connecting it to the computer was simple but it loses connection after like every 30 seconds so it lags when trying to type characters. The keyboard after a few more days was having sticky keys- you would press a button and then it would hold the key.
5,My employer is finally going to let us work remotely 2 days a week so I needed a better keyboard to work with than the one that came with the Surface. I have dual monitors set up which makes it even harder to type off of the Surface keyboard. This new one linked up via blue tooth in a snap. It is a sleek looking keyboard to me and types very quiet.True no backlit keys but I am never in a situation where I need them lit and it helps on battery life.If I could make one small change it would be nice if it had the little kick stands underneath to raise it a little bit (it sits totally flat).Other than that I'm very pleased with my purchase.Also it allows me to unhook the Surface keyboard freeing up some space.
4,I've used this keyboard for a few months before reviewing. This is an excellent keyboard with a wonderful feel perfect size and solid arrangement of the keys. I spend 8-12 hours a day on this keyboard; I know it well. My only complaint is that the Fn key can't be locked on. I almost returned the keyboard but typing was such a joy I decided to live with it. My favorite keyboard highly recommended.
4,Does what I needed it for
5,I’ve spent 2 years in the basement working on my 10 year old keyboard. I finally snapped. The keys were flying. I accidentally sent some gibberish to someone on teams but I let of some pent up steam. Did I screw myself over for a few hours and have to work on my laptop? Yes yes I did. Do I have regrets? No I would definitely do it again. In fact I may dig my old keyboard out of the trash just so I can continue destroying it.This new keyboard is great. Paired right away and the keys are nice and quiet. It uses 2 AAA batteries (included!) so you don’t have any surprise charging needs - replace and go! 5 stars!
5,If you are hunting for a “quite” typer this is the one. I tested quite a few keyboards and this one is the most polite and quite.All other aspects are great too works as a modern day Bluetooth keyboard should. I use it on a mac too with zero issues.
3,Got it on sale but was disappointed that the PS5 does not support it.  :(
3,The keys are quiet and have nice travel. I want to like this keyboard but it doesn't have an on/off switch which is annoying but worse - the function keys default to non-F# behavior and there is no function lock to change this. This is probably perfectly fine for many people but I use those function keys often so this didn't work for me.
5,Provided as described. Works great with my Surface Pro 7. I use my surface pro 7 with a Contractor case with pen while I am out in the field. However having this case doesn't let me use an attachable keyboard. The Microsoft Bluetooth Keyboard lets me connect to my Surface Pro without taking the Surface Pro from the Contractor Case so I can easily go from a mobile situation to a Desktop situation. Bluetooth also free's up my USB slot to allow for transmission of PDF's between PC's. The only disadvantage is that the Keyboard has no off button. To keep from connecting to the keyboard while I switch from Desk to Mobile I have to remove the batteries.
4,A mix of positive and negative but mostly positive. On time delivery with Prime easy to connect and use via bluetooth. I'm pleased with it except for the fact that it is perfectly level. There are small round rubber "feet" to cushion and keep it from sliding on the desk but none that allow for angled use (you can't "prop up" the back). Thus my 4 star rating for "ergonomic". For short term use on the desktop it is ok but for lower more ergonomic extended use above the lap it feels strained after a while (I am on the computer sometimes 12 to 14 hours a day). This is probably a good thing since I need to get up and take a break once in a while anyway. It is not silent - which is ok for me because I prefer to hear the "click click click" while typing but some may not like it. The surface is easy to clean with very little open space around each key (so crumbs & "stuff" doesn't get in easily). There are no lights to indicate when you have caps lock on. No power on/off switch. It auto connects when I turn on my computer. It did stop working after about 7 months of use. Nothing I did would get it going again and I was going to toss it out. Instead I let it sit idle for two weeks off but with new batteries in it. I then decided to give it another try and it connected right away and has been working fine for the past three months. Guess like other electronics it needs to be reset periodically. Overall a good buy in my opinion.
3,The keyboard was immediately picked up by the surface! Pretty good keyboard but jo legs to tilt and puts pressure on wrist. I used  some 1/4” sticky pads to raise the far end giving me enough tilt.
5,I've always been a fan of most Microsoft products even if they get negative feedback but they do make good stuff!  The keyboard was very easy to connect to my laptop and home desktop which didn't have Bluetooth so I bought this on Amazon https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07V1SZCY6 and it connected right away.  So positive review for the keyboard and this USB bluetooth device!
5,Just worked from the word ' Unpacked'
2,I do not recommend this keyboard if you can afford a higher quality one.Three reasons why:1. The far-edge and the near edge (closest to your wrist) are completely even so it is difficult to type. In contrast most well-built keyboard for Windows or Mac are sloped towards the near-edge.2. There is no on/off button nor a caps lock light3. There is an inclusion of two new keys: a Microsoft Office key that opens your browser to the MS Office site and an 'emoji' key which are both completely unnecessary. What sort of professional who is going to be using MS Office needs a shortcut for emojis? The keys also change the regular position of the right-hand CTRL key which is not intuitive for muscle memory.Overall this keyboard is poorly designed. Spend your money on a better keyboard.
5,This keyboard hooked right to my Surface Pro with no problems. Very sleek. So far so good!
4,Feels kinds cheap kinda not. The plastic its made of makes it kinda feel that way. Reason I'm giving it 4 stars is two-fold.1. It goes to sleep after 30 seconds of non use then has to reconnect. I hate that feature because personally I'm not only just typing I'm using CAD software and its a lot of clicking with keyed shortcuts or the escape key.2. To me it seems a little on the expensive side for how cheap it feels.That being said it still is a nice keyboard the typing feels great keys aren't hard to push at all and they do what they say they do when you tell them. There's almost no delay in typing even though it's Bluetooth. The media keys up top are very very handy! I love them. I configured mine to open iTunes and it is beautiful.I just caution anyone who is looking at these to make sure that you don't connect too many Bluetooth devices to your computer. It may slow down response times. It's not anything to do with the keyboard itself that's just the nature of Bluetooth itself.
3,My style is very minimalistic and simple so it definitely fits my aesthetic! The key sounds are so satisfying. It has that quiet click every time you type and that actually helps me focus so if you want something completely quiet this isn’t for you.BUT what I didn’t know when I bought this that would not have made me purchase at all is: 1) it can only connect to one device at a time. To switch between my iPad (which it does connect to!!) and work laptop I have to disconnect the keyboard from one and pair it to the other. It’s an annoyance.2) it runs on batteries. It comes with batteries but idk how long they’ll last which also kind of annoys me because who really knows how long batteries will last.But if those two things don’t matter to you then you’ll have good use of this keyboard.
4,El teclado esta bien y bonito funciona a las mil maravillas pero tuve que usar unas gomas adicionales para elevar un poco el teclado por que definitivamente queda muy plano en la mesa y seeria genial que en las futuras versines incliyeran luces indicadoras del block mayus y el block number
3,Whose brilliant idea was it to place the lock key near the backspace button??I lock my computer an annoying amount of times by accident because of this keyboard.
5,This keyboard is compact and has a backlight. It allows me to type without reaching across my desk to usw my tablet keyboard.
3,Bought this keyboard as I really liked my son's Surface Keyboard but didn't want to pay close to $100 for one.  My needs were simple.Pros:- Bluetooth connectivity has been excellent!  I couldn't give up a USB slot so this was the #1 feature I was after- Comfortable with good key feedback- Lightweight and compact (although I would not consider it a "travel" keyboard it could easily accompany you on the go).Although the keyboard hit on all my needs I was not expecting the lack of some standard keys and moreover the significant impact to the way I work.  To make this worse I was under the impression that some/many of the keys could be configured so figured I'd be able to change what I needed.  More on that below.Cons:- NO PRINT SCREEN button!  In my line of work I use applications like ScreenPresso and Greenshot.  Both of these make use of the PrtScrn button- The lock button is inconveniently placed directly above the Backspace key.  It's far too easy to inadvertently click on this key and lock your PC.  It's a little irritating when you're flying along and accidentally lock your PC.-  The ability to configure the keys is a joke.  After downloading and installing the Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center I quickly learned that only the [Media] [Prev. Track] [Play / Pause] and [Next Track] were configurable!  I'm not counting the [CAPS LOCK] and [Emoji] as "configuring either of these is highly restricted and rather dumb (IMHO).  Could I configure one of the above media buttons as the Print Screen?  Yes!  However this seems really stupid.  Of course that could be my OCD talking.Would I recommend the keyboard?  Yes - but I would make sure the person was very aware of the above limitations.Maybe Microsoft will extend the Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center app to allow greater configuration...?!
5,I love this product! Connects to my laptop even after long periods without use. 10/10!
3,I don't hate it but I would not purchase again. When it comes to wireless keyboard though I didn't go this route I think it would be better to just spend the $100 and go for the Logi MX Keys. The build quality on this is subpar hence the price tag. The keyboard itself feels very flat almost as if you're typing downhill. It definitely lags though it has yet to interrupt any of my day to day tasks but it is noticeable and you'll know it's there.  That being said for office use etc. it has never once prevented me from not doing my job or getting work done..at the end of the day it works. I will say the hot function keys are nice if you're using it with windows OS. the function key to get to calculator is great screenshot/shipit emoji's etc. All are great/premium features on here that work well.
4,This is a fine keyboard and well made. As usual I had some issues with lag but that's fixed by a couple of things. First go to device manager and uncheck the option for Windows to control power for your Bluetooth adapter. Second and probably the most important move the bluetooth dongle away from any other USB connections. I'm lucky to have USB port on the front of my tower. As soon as I moved the dongle there no more lag! If you don't have that option get a USB extension cord and just run it from the PC to the underside of your desk close to the keyboard or simply just away from all the other USB ports.The only complaint I have is that there are no little stands in the back to tilt it up a few degrees. Easily fixed by attaching some rubber feet but would have been a nice addition.
5,I love this Bluetooth keyboard. I have bought several in the past and returned them because the keys were too uncomfortable or the Bluetooth connection is too finicky. These are great once you get used to them. At first I prefer keyboards similar to my MacBook Air so this keyboard felt different and awkward. After a month of using this keyboard I prefer this keyboard over my laptop.
3,Its a good keyboard. I just don't think I'll keep it.Feels solid and I like the way the keys feel.I don't like that there no "feet" to angle it up a little when using at a desk.The function keys seem off by 1 position. I use them all the time so this is a no go for me.So some weird connection issues. Sometimes it's so delayed from its (non comfigurable) sleep mode that it'll take 3 seconds or so to catch up. But also what I consider to be more of a problem  is I'll by typing while looking at my other display and go to look at what I've typed and there'll be a bunch of repeated keys. Almost like a stuck key. And not just 2 or 3 as if I held the key to long  I'm talking 5 to 8. It's nuts.  It'll look something like this: "ttttttesting one to thrrrreeee."No rhyme or reason.
4,El teclado muy bonito y se conecta super facil el unico incinveniente que le he visto y no es gran cosa pero no tiene indicador de luz de mayusculas y como programador en ocasiones me dificulta el ingreso de credenciales
4,This is a nice keyboard. Looks good handy function keys good size (not bigger than it needs to be) typing on feels fine. I would describe the feel of typing on this keyboard as neutral meaning that its character isn’t so unique that switching to it from other keyboards or when switching from it to other keyboards isn’t awkward. Some keyboards have such a standout feel to them that when switching keyboards you’re forced to readjust and the change feels awkward. I go between a lot of different desktop and laptop keyboards so it’s nice that with this keyboard I don’t feel like I need to relearn or readjust to it.Only complaint is the input lag and reconnect delay. This is Bluetooth’s curse. But I’ve seen worse so this is within the realm of normal but don’t expect better than normal.
5,Nice product easy to use and very confortable
2,Keys feels further apart on this keyboard that I frequently hit wrong letters when compared to using my Logitech or Lenovo keyboards. My hands started hurting. Maybe other people don't have this issue.
4,I purchased this keyboard to stuff in my backpack and it fits perfectly. The two features I guess I would have expected are back legs to tilt it slightly forward and an off switch or button. It works just fine but I wonder if mashing the keys in my bag will shorten my battery life and having to prop up the back is kind of hinky.
4,I just wish it had the little pieces that flip open on the bottom to angle it upward. It's a little too flat to type comfortably.
5,Looks good works well. Decent value. It's not fancy but it does the job.
5,Easy to connect.Perfect feel.Love it!
4,I like the fact that it directly uses the computers bluetooth vice having to constantly fiddle around with trying to find the adaptor that takes up a usb port.
3,The keyboard is of good quality and I did not have issues with Bluetooth connectivity. But I did not enjoy the keyboard experience itself. I was frequently hitting the caps-lock button. I think there may be some subtle difference in spacing. The lack of “legs” to incline the keyboard is a bummer. The flat-only mode doesn’t work for me except in those rare occasions when I am using the keyboard on my lap. If none of this bothers you it’s a good keyboard choice especially considering the low cost.
4,Design of keyboard is minimalistic and compact. Keys are nicely sized. The function keys are all reassigned as hotkeys for various useful things like volume control media control etc. If you want to use the normal function keys you have to hold down the Fn button. There's no Fn-lock.There's also no Number-lock. The keypad number keys don't have a secondary function like they do on normal keyboards. I don't miss this at all. I never use the secondary functions and always have number-lock on anyway.There's no LED indicator at all not even one for Caps-lock. That takes some getting used to but I think it's fine.The only negative I have for this keyboard is that the keys have too much resistance. It just takes more effort than I'd like.
5,I've been using Bluetooth wireless keyboards religiously for about a year and a half now in attempt to declutter my desk of wires. After the issues inherent in my previous purchase I opted to bite the bullet and go for the "name brand" option. Thus far I haven't regretted it. The design is easy comfortable and fits the aesthetic of the other devices I'm using in my war against wires.
4,1) it is nearly flat and cannot raise the back of the keyboard. 2) It is a short-pressing keyboard similar to the thinkpad laptops.Tip: The FN can be disabled by press and hold the FN and press Caps.
2,I purchased this Microsoft keyboard for use on a Windows 10 computer so had every expectation that the experience would be seamless but the keyboard did not live up to expectations.The Bluetooth connection is laggy and choppy even with the keyboard right next to the computer so that if you wait a few seconds between typing one thing and the next it seems to lose the connection then takes a few seconds for the keystrokes to respond as it seemingly reestablishes the connection.  If you use your computer intensively for example for programming this is more than a minor annoyance.I can't say whether that's a problem with the keyboard itself or Windows Bluetooth generally as I haven't tried other keyboards to see if it's only this device or a more general issue but that's not the only substantive problem.The Ctrl Shift and Alt keys also do not seem to work with the function keys.  For example while F1 works (by hitting the Fn-F1 keys) Ctrl-F1 does not work (hitting Ctrl-Fn-F1 has no effect) so there's no way use the function keys in combination with Ctrl Shift and Alt.  I've tried to see if there are configuration options or the like that would address the issue as it seems a major functional issue that I'm astonished made it into a Microsoft-branded product but to no avail.  Again if you you use your computer intensively such as for programming this is a significant issue.As a result of these (non-trivial) problems I can give the keyboard at most 2 stars and don't recommend it.
5,This product is great! It is SUPER EASY to pair with your DEVICE! There's no lag in connectivity. As soon as I type it's there on the screen! The shortcut buttons are phenomenal and make this keyboard so user friendly and efficient! I absolutely love it!
5,I love this keyboard. Not too loud. Compact. Would've been nice if it had backkey lights but not a deal breaker by any means. And most importantly feels great to type on.
2,Thought the Microsoft keyboard would be flawless but has turned out to be flawed. The keyboard looses Bluetooth connectivity with my computer and has caused simple tasks to take much longer due to waiting or having to reconnect keyboard.
5,What I love the most about this keyboard is that it is a lot more quiet when typing compared to other keyboards I have used in the past. The buttons are also raised more which feels great when I am typing. The size of the keyboard is standard - not too thick but not too thin. Pairs perfectly with my Windows laptop. The only thing I wish was different was that it could charge via USB cable. Instead it uses AAA batteries. Other than that very happy with this purchase and it's the best external keyboard I've ever had.
4,You cant use F1 shortcuts without hitting FN with it
3,Oh microsoft. This keyboard overall isn't great. It's ok for the sake of having Microsoft products on my desk but the keyboard kind of sucks. The keys have such a travel you almost need to slam every key to be sure you're pressing it. And because you need to do that it slows down typing speed. Next there's no Caps Lock light. Why?  For this price you mean you couldn't add a tiny little led for Caps Lock? . Also why can't I tilt the keyboard?  That's right there's no little feet. I'm disappointed in this keyboard. Glad I didn't pay full price. As far as the battery life goes I guess I'll see how that is.Overall build quality?  I guess that's where the money is spent. Its solid. Doesn't feel cheap.
3,1. Even when I turn the "go to sleep" option off in the settings it still lags at first when I go to type if I haven't been typing for a few minutes.2. The screen lock button is directly above the backspace button. I can't count at this point how many times I've hit it and locked the screen by accident. When you hit it the screen flashes for a second and it makes my stomach drop everytime. My first thought is my computer's crashing. It's scary when working on a large document or video editing project. I've taken to folding up a yellow post it in a square "c" shape to put around it so I hit that first instead of the lock screen.
1,I read the reviews about this keyboard lasting two months but I figured maybe it was just a handful for them. Nope. I gave it the benefit of the doubt. I received this June 24 2022. It’s now August 30 2022 and it’s no longer working. I changed the batteries twice. I tried connecting it to other devices but none of the keys work.Also no off button.The keyboard was great while it did work. Convenient with settings calculator and emoji keys. But the Insert and Delete button were very close together. I thought my mind would adjust after a time but it did take some getting used to.
5,Good for work from home setup. Easy set up and it works as it should. The typing experience is good.Update : If you can get a backlit keyboard. I use my machine after dark so I needed to upgrade to a more premium wireless keyboard with a backlight.If you only work during the day or in a bright environment this keyboard is great for the price. I keep mine around for redundancy and I occasionally use it (I'm using it to type this review).
3,Had high hopes for this keyboard. I love the design of it and use it as my daily driver at work. It takes such a long time to reconnect to my laptop via bluetooth. Whenever I walk away from my desk at work/ lock my PC it eventually disconnects and I will have to spam the windows key to get it to eventually connect. There also seems to be occasional input lag. Another issue that I didn't realize would be such a big thing is the lack of a print screen key it's more annoying for me since I use SnagIt otherwise this keyboard does have a shortcut for windows snip tool. So I end up using that instead most of the time. One other thing I noticed is that there's no option to disable numlock which I actually prefer.
5,UPDATE 6/28/21 - Taking off 2 stars the "A" and "S" virtually gone in just 14 months of use. I've had keyboards for 20 years that don't show wear like this. I've also had random problems with Bluetooth requiring me to re-pair several times.This keyboard is exactly what I was looking for. I switched from Logitech RF to Bluetooth and am very pleased. It is compact but not cramped lightweight but substantial enough to stay put and quiet but with great feel and response. Very close to what I would design for myself if I could have a custom keyboard. It used to look great paired with the Modern Mobile Mouse also from Microsoft I don't see it lasting at all.
5,Simple. It works.
2,Not reliable. Worked great for a couple weeks then complete stopped working despite new batteries and computer resets.
5,A perfect wireless replacement for my old wired keyboard. Set up took less than 5 minutes out of the box. Only thing to get used to is there is not any of the traditional lights for caps lock number lock or scroll lock. There is also no tilt on this so it sits pretty flat.
5,Instant Bluetooth connection. Good battery life. Lots of function keys for Windows 10
5,Awesome keyboard!  I replaced my cordless MS 5000 keyboard & mouse with this keyboard (and the MS Precision Mouse).  The results have been superb.  First and foremost make sure that you PC/device has Bluetooth.  I neglected to remember that I did not include a Bluetooth receiver when I did my PC build.  But $12 and a Bluetooth receiver later I was in business.  The keyboard paired immediately.  It has great feel with good key movement and resistance much better than my last keyboard.  It is very slim in design and appeals to my minimalist sense.  The only downside is because it is Bluetooth the lag for the first few keystrokes until it is awake and working.
4,I never received the item.  It was returned to Amazon during shipping so I went to Best Buy to get it.  Keyboard is like typing on a laptop computer keyboard but works great with my Microsoft SurfacePro.  I really like that it connects via bluetooth.
4,Bluetooth connection works well. The feel of the keys is a little dull but it works very well. My only complaint is that the function keys default to their secondary use you have to hit the Fn key with them to get them to perform as real function keys. That is probably handy for some users - but just not for me.
3,This is one of those products that you know right away if you will like it. I'd say it does the job just fine. I'm not crazy about the overall demotions. Seems the length is good. But the width a bit under 5 inches is a bit too narrow. It took  about  5 minutes to pair to my Dell computer but even after I dropped it once it kept its connection just fine. There's not a lot of bells and whistles with this keyboard but overall it's OK it'll do.
5,It's my first bluetooth keyboard and of course that alone blew my mind so much more flexible to use and will be great for travel with my Surface Go. Other reviews mentioned how "sleek" it is and I wasn't getting that - till I opened the box. It's really nice-looking.As a touch typist I found the placement of the keys just a little different for finding things like the Alt key without looking - many merry mishaps :-) as I get acclimated. But overall I'm very pleased.
4,The main selling point is the Bluetooth.  One less dongle to deal with. My only complaints which others have already expressed are the lack of Cap Lock feedback and the F4 key no longer repeats the previous action. For the price it is a nice functional keyboard.
4,Still trying to figure out if I like this keyboard or not... Overall fit and finish is beautiful seriously it's a nice looking keyboard. Here's the problem its thin and it has no kickstand to raise it... It is so thin it's a little uncomfortable to type. Kickstands to raise the keyboard would make it perfect. I have no idea why they skipped on them.
5,Great quality.  Light and 100% full sized keyboard.  Laptop style not desktop.  Bluetooth is smart and pairs nicely with desktops laptops tablets and even my phone.  Creates a secure 🔐 bluetooth conn ction with code generator.  Don't forget to press enter.  I kept typing the code and wondering why it didn't work.  Pressing enter solved it.
4,Easy set up and works perfectly just wish it had a keyboard light as a way to tell if caps lock/Fn key/etc are engaged.
3,The keyboard is well-made has satisfactory key depression sensitivity and the Fn functions which are typically used for shortcuts require Fn + selection of the "F" function in order to activate due to the introduction of more MS Windows functionality such as volume control video playback etc. as the primary usage of the top button functionality.  I find this particular keyboard subject to Bluetooth dropout frequently where the keyboard ceases to function even though the "Settings" indicate the keyboard is "connected".  This may have something to do with the Surface Tablet itself (1st Generation) or the keyboard.
2,This keyboard was okay for a while but I have run into more and more problems as time has gone on. I can attest to other reviews saying the Bluetooth cuts out as it does it regularly and is super frustrating. The keys are incredibly mushy and if you think you will get any satisfaction from typing think again. I mean this is a Bluetooth keyboard but the Bluetooth is not good. Just get Logitech or another reputable brand probably will be lightyears ahead of this piece of trash.
4,No Num or Cap light on keyboard you have to rely on your computer screen for that.
5,I like the keys because they are separated a bit and have the typewriter feel.
5,of the two I orderedone is top notch.one is worn badly (can't see the letters on the keys)I am going to check if there are peal and stick replacement letter decals at office depot or some place.
2,I'm not sure why but this keyboard seems smaller than the keyboard on my laptop. I don't like that the board is not backlit so you can see the keys w/o a light (unless you're a super proficient typist). Also there is not a "print screen" F key and most of the F keys listed don't make sense since the board didn't come with a user manual. I wanted to return it but missed the window. I would spend my money on another product not this.
3,I liked the design and feel of this keyboard.  If it worked it would be a good product. It requires a computer with the the most recent blue tooth radio (v4.0) and the latest operating system.  Bluetooth almost never works because of all of those incompatible radio versions out there. My computer is a couple of years old so of course it doesn't work. I tried buying a new dongle. No luck.  Now the keyboard sits in my closet. Maybe when I get my next computer it will work.
5,There is no light to let you know caps lock is on.  I love the keyboard though it is sleek and quiet.
5,Great little keyboard.
5,This little keyboard is a perfect pair with my Surface.  It makes working from home easy and I don't miss my office docking station.  Paired with the surface mouse... unbeatable.
5,I bought this to replace another Bluetooth keyboard that never connected correctly when I turned on my computer.  This one has worked great and has some function keys that I really like (snip a screen print and others).  I'm very happy I bought it - I use it with a Microsoft Surface Pro 7.
5,I really like the buttons on this keyboard. They just feel good on my finger tips. Plus I didn't realize it was bluetooth. I thought it was a wireless USB. Bonus!
1,This thing goes to sleep constantly. When I try to wake it up it sometimes wakes in a few seconds. Other times it takes half a minute. Very frustrating. My BT mouse does not have this problem. Tried changing device/system settings and no change.
1,Packaging was beautiful and convincing. Out of the box it paired with my laptop but would not connect. I kept trying to look up information on connecting this specific keyboard since the "manufacturer's response" to this issue on this page was not useful nor did they direct to any MS support platform for additional support. The manufacturer of this keyboard is "Microsoft PC Accessories" which is NOT Microsoft and is the reason there does not exist a model number for this product.I do realize that I purchased a "bargain" keyboard but I did in fact purchase a keyboard not a frisbee. It's actually less fun and useful than a frisbee; my dog doesn't like it either and gives it one bark.The actual Microsoft keyboard this imposter aspires to be is model number 21Y-00031. It is also sold on Amazon as well as at the actual Microsoft store and BB. It comes in Matte Black and Glacier. Happy typing!
3,Clean design but relatively mediocre quality. After a month or so of continuous use the keys get a little gritty to the push and don't function as smoothly. As others have mentioned there's also no print screen button and you have no idea if you have CAPS lock enabled or not because there isn't an indicator light. If you don't mind forkin' over another $50 I highly recommend the Logitech MX Keys - the difference in quality is well worth the price.
2,The keys work well and it's not as loud as some other keyboards I have.  It's not silent but also not overly loud.I only have 2 complaints: 1) there is no option to raise the back of the keyboard.  Maybe this is because it is so short from top to bottom and 2) there is no key to lock the FN-keys.  This is done using Fn + Caps Lock but is was hard to find and not intuitive.Still I would buy it again because the keys are well spaced and it doesn't take up a lot of space on my desktop.Update:Just discovered that there isn't a Print Scrn key.  That's beyond annoying.
5,Great value (I got a used one). It's definitely better than laptop keyboards (probably including Thinkpads). The travel distance is about 2mm. There's a slight sound when the key bounces back but overall it's a quiet keyboard.
5,I did not want to use up my only USB for a keyboard so I got this Bluetooth one and it works great. So far I’ve got no complaints.
5,Very comfortable and easy to set up. Bluetooth is a plus
5,Love this keyboard! Amazing quality and works wonderfully
3,The keyboard is pretty good but I had to add some sticky pads to the back to get the keyboard to angle towards me instead of being flat.  The keys are not as low profile as I like.  They are super 'spongy' and not as great as other keyboards *I've had.
1,Although the keyboard looks pleasing aesthetically if you use your laptop as a tower this keyboard will frustrate you when you are trying to log in to the computer and the bluetooth will not connect and therefore you are not able to log in to your computer. Literally everyday is a struggle to input my password. I am not sure if the same problem exists for tablets but my laptop is usually in tablet mode. Once you log in it seems to work fine but just getting to that point makes you want to smash it Josh Hart style and proceed to buy a better keyboard....which I may doI wouldn't in encourage this purchase if you are using it for office use. Maybe if you are on the go or your a student with a smaller laptop with a small keyboard you don't enjoy using than this may be for you since you have probably already logged in.Other than that issue that is major to me I haven't owned the product long enough to provide any other insights to future users.
1,Just got it today & would not connect to my device.  I've tried it 10 times & wouldn't connect.Yes bluetooth light was blinking for pairing.
4,Good size and functionality. It was a little harder to pair than I would have liked.
5,When you have run out of USB ports bluetooth is the next best thing. Reasonable price. Pairs well have had no problems with the board or mouse connecting.
1,The keys are all the same size and not spaced for touch typing.  Continuously kept hitting incorrect keys and the F key options do not match normal keyboard F key functions.  And even though USB and Bluetooth ports along with the Bluetooth devices being set on the system level to not allow power saving mode the keyboard itself would on its own unexpectedly.  After 5 minutes of reading an email it would be frustrating to begin replying only to have half the sentence written while the keyboard reconnected each time.  Checked all settings and the very little support documentation available for this device with zero luck.  After a month of usage chucked this thing in to the bin and ended up ordering a standard generic branded USB keyboard.  Better overall design has stainless steel backing and allows for better touch typing.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS HORRIBLE KEYBOARD FROM MICROSOFT!
2,I had great hopes for a Microsoft keyboard for my Windows machine but this keyboard is not all that. The keys are oddly spaced such that it's easy to accidentally find yourself a full row over from the keys you mean to be using when touch typing. Add this to my keyboard not actually being flat (the bottom right corner doesn't naturally touch my desk) and the lack of indicator such as a light of turning on caps lock which is a problem when you hit it instead of 'a' and you get a lot of typing and coding mistakes. Not a keyboard I'd recommend even for those with small fingers.
5,Love the size and feel of the keyboard feels like a full sized keyboard with laptop keys most of all doesn't use a usb port adaptor. I have yet to see another keyboard that functions any better at any price point.
2,Good keyboard. But it doesn't have the little fold out legs to prop it up at an angle. So the keyboard is flat all the time. Kind of annoying. I use a ruler to prop it up but it is not ideal.
5,I like this keyboard a lot -- it has excellent bluetooth connectivity and responsiveness (never once disconnected). I also like it because the keys are not loud. Great work-from-home keyboard.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS KEYBOARD.  You'll be throwing away your money because it will likely only start to malfunction after it's no longer eligible for return.  Within the first two months of use the Bluetooth connection began to lag (meaning it takes 2-3 seconds for a keystroke to appear on the screen - so very annoying) or drop altogether (so keyboard just stops working) even when sitting right next to the computer.  After many rounds of troubleshooting and changing batteries the only thing that works is to unpair and pair the keyboard to the laptop.  We have to do this on at least a weekly basis now and there is no discernable cause - it just decides to slow down or stop working randomly.  This is a serious product flaw that regrettably I'm only now seeing in other reviews.
5,Some of the F keys are different than my old keyboard taking some time to get use to.  Like it doesn't take up a USB port.  Works great.  Small yet still offers the options that a full size keyboard gives.  Would buy again.
5,I'm really digging the feel. Unlike most I'm digging the shortcut keys. I prefer snip tool over screen print anyway. :)
5,Bought it for my surface pro because I didn’t want to waste the USB port on an extra keyboard. Connects great! Even has an emoji button c:
5,Great travel on the keys. Feels natural.
5,My only gripe would be its not rechargeable! No more wires!!! Yippie!!!
3,Great solid keyboard.  However there are no lights for caps lock/num lock/etd. so you have no idea when one of these is on.  Also the battery life is claimed to be 2 years however i have had to replace the batteries every 2-3 weeks.
5,Work perfectly under linux using bluetoothctl.
5,Needed keyboard to game while on surface and has worked great.
2,Keyboard was working fine but stopped after about 60 days of use. Amazon support was not helpful and Microsoft even worse. There is no USB connection so a hard reset is not possible if the bluetooth connection fails. A waste of money.
2,I need another keyboard I cannot use this one anymore.Pros:Lightweight thin quiet looks awesome2 major cons:1. The lock button is above backspace. I am constantly locking my computer on accident.2. Constantly sticking keys. It will randomly lock keys and my typing will end up looking like this: looooooccckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkeeeedddd keyssssssssssss. This is forcing me to buy another keyboard. I have only had this for a few months
5,Very comfortable with just the right amount of “click” if that makes sense! Liked it enough to get a second one for my wife.
5,It was a easy set up with the Bluetooth. And I love my keyboard. Once it's paired you good to go.
5,Love this keyboard. Keys are quite but not silent and are easy to slam/type on. Love the number pad and modern design too. Setup with bluetooth and no dongle is a breeze.
5,Nice keyboard and the BT connectivity is great...better than wireless keyboards
5,Great Bluetooth keyboard.
3,The keys are not low profile and harder to press down than other keyboards.
5,I would buy this again! I recommend it to everyone!
3,It is frustrating how often this keyboard disconnects and how long it takes to reconnect at times.
2,The keyboard sits high off the desk. With a wrist wrest it isn't too bad but it is still higher than most of the low profile keyboards I find comfortable. The build quality is pretty low. The keyboard feels like cheap plastic. There are cheaper keyboards on the market with higher build quality. The size and shape of the keys feel very awkward to the touch. Typing with precision was very difficult.
5,If you need a keyboard purchase this product. Looks great and the battery life is amazing.
5,amazing keyboard lightweight minimal but it comes with different buttons like the snip it office emojis that helps you have the best windows experience.
5,Fully Bluetooth. No dongle. Just what I needed.
2,Bluetooth just stopped working out of nowhere. I just bought this only a month or 2 ago.
1,Keyboard is just OK and has a MAJOR drawback; the connection goes to sleep every 10 minutes or so and there is significant LAG on the reconnection. I type relative fast so I can get a full word or two punched in before letters appear - and the missed ones are cut off. It’s constant and SUPER IRRITATING.UPDATE; I still absolutely HATE this keyboard for the built-in sleep function. Found on MS website the sleep feature is built into the keyboard and it actually happens in only 5 minutes and not a single recommendation in SETTINGS with bluetooth device settings work - have tried them all and no luck. TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE
5,Blue tooth connected without any hiccups. Thank you.
1,After a month of using the keyboard it started creating problems. The first issue was it would just start typing one letter and would not stop until i restarted my latop. And in about five mins it would do the same thing. I stopped using it for few months and I Started to use it again. After one day of using it stopped working. My laptop said it was connected and the battery was 100% but the  Keyboard stopped working.
5,Excellent product
1,I don’t think this keyboard has a print screen button. F12 seems to do snipping but does not seem compatible with SnagIt. Normally I’d be stoked for a cool emoji button even if it doesn’t do anything AS LONG AS THEY DIDN’T REMOVE THE PRINT SCREEN BUTTON TO MAKE ROOM FOR IT.  Now that smiley face emoji button just seems to be mocking me laughing at how inefficient this keyboard is without a print screen button. I may change my review if I learn I’m an idiot and just can’t figure out how to make it work. If not I will be returning.**update:  F2 does not force the curser to enter a cell in Excel. Instead it turns down the computer volume. If you are a data nerd like me this is kinda a big deal. Excel - super important. Volume - not important.
2,This keyboard doesn't have the little flip out standoffs on it so it just sits totally flat on your desk. Makes it really hard to type on. Also doesn't have a print screen button.
5,Good value! Too small for big hands...
2,This is the worst keyboard to type on. The keys are far apart and they feel awful when pressed. I have very large hands and the keys are so far apart I have to constantly reposition my fingers. Bought this because it did not require a usb dongle. Not worth it at all.
1,We purchased this for a backup keyboard in case one fails during the pandemic. We had one fail and unboxed this one. It is bluetooth and had no issues connecting to a Chrome Book. However every number key pressed using the numpad was duplicated after a pause. For example typing "19" worked but as split second later "19" was typed again. This happened almost every time and with all numbers using the numpad. Pressing "1" would then type an additional "1". Typing 2020 would work but then "2020" would be typed by the keyboard a second later.We bought this 6 months ago but being a Microsoft brand we did not expect to have any issues.
1,This is the worst keyboard I've ever used. It's difficult to even write this review. The keys stick horrendously (not sure if it's physical or a Bluetooth glitch). I had to turn off the "repeat key" feature on my computer just so that a single delete wouldn't wipe out a whole document or email inbox. And still the Shift key often sticks making everything uppercase etc. until I pound on the key or something voluntarily relents. The placement of the Lock Computer key right next to the oft-used Backspace key was a bad idea and there's no Print Screen key.Dismally frustrating.Will try to return.
5,Very nice keyboard.  It works with my Dell laptop perfectly!
5,great keyboard only thing i would change is the ability to elevate the back to a higher position.
4,Pretty nice no frills BT keyboard for the price. Been using this at work for the last few weeks and I've been enjoying it. Paired up pretty quick to my work laptop and I haven't had any issues with connectivity since. I like the layout especially some of the Windows centric keys like the snip function. I do wish it had some LEDs on the caps lock plus a power/pairing indicator light.Biggest drawback is the lack of a dedicated F-key lock. Took me a while to figure out how to disable the Window functions on the F keys (press the FN and Caps lock for 5 seconds). Hoping MS can integrate that into the keyboard software at some point.The keys are a scissor type switch similar to laptop keyboards. Decent for the price not the best I've tried not the worse. Again I paid $20 for this so I'm not going to nitpick.As for Battery life I've read 2 years but we'll see how that goes.
1,Keyboard is trash. Fall asleep after 5 minutes and then takes forever to start working. I’ll click on it 100 times and i still wont turn. Rarely does it work efficiently.
5,Good keyboard. No wires.
2,Disappointed at the lack of keyboard horizontal adjustment.  No "elevator" taps on the back of the keyboard needed to change the inclination of the keyboard for better and more comfortable typing position.
2,First say using this keyboard for work and I discover there is no print screen button. Consider a return this is isn't tolerable or expected.
5,I wanted Bluetooth simple clean and this is perfect.
5,Great keyboard! Easy to set up and use. Soft buttons.
1,The Microsoft design team is at it again showing it does not think of real world experience. The computer lock button is right above the backspace key.  The backspace key is for us folks who don't hit the exact key when we type. So why not place the most annoying feature right next to the most used key on my keyboard. Thanks Microsoft for reminding me that I can't type by making it so I lock my computer 100 times a day.
2,Works great when it works! It often cuts out on me during meetings. I need to always have a backup connected for when it decides to stop working for 5 minutes. I'm overall very disappointed because I really love the product it just doesn't work.
1,This was a French keyboard with various French accents and the special characters were in different places from the QWERTY placement that I’m accustomed to using in the US. The keyboard also arrived in a box that was obviously meant for a different product. The box had a slot for a mouse but the mouse was missing.
1,Ok seriously no num lock on this keyboard.  You ask “who cares?” … well.. some software that we use kinda requires it…. So if you use Jaws.. and need your num pad.. do not buy this keyboard (after searching determined that really is no real way to activate it)
1,The keyboard seems like it is made well but the responsiveness sucks. Delay when you start typing. After about a month stopped working. No lights on it to let you know if it is connected working etc. This one going to the trash and moving on.
1,This is a terrible keyboard for one simple reason. It goes in what appears to be a "sleep" mode after a few minutes and it takes several seconds to wake. It is very frustrating to deal with. Especially when you need to type information in during a call or meeting. Should have just gone with a wired keyboard for a cheap option.
5,Great product! Very comfortable to use
1,I dropped in to see if I could still return this thing but I'm stuck with it.  It keep dropping the bluetooth connection plus it's not very comfortable to type on.  Spend a little more and buy a better one.  Or buy mine?
1,The keyboard paired with PC and worked for about one day then stopped working. Now Bluetooth on PC can't find the keyboard and I have spent about ten hours over three days trying to fix it going through all recommended fixes on the internet. Total waste of time and money. Furious that I cannot get a hold of customer service at Microsoft.
4,It's great to type on and battery lasts long; the only negative is that there is zero rise to it. If you don't like your keyboard sitting completely flat you'll need to pass on this or jury rig something to prop it up
1,I can't type anything without Microsoft keys getting in the way. The Emoji and MS Word 365 keys show up. It took me forever to write this review. Do not buy this keyboard!!!!
1,It is pretty worthless with it sporadically disconnects. I am so tired of removing and reconnecting I guess I will just buy a USB keyboard. This is JUNK. Today it isn’t even discoverable to re-add.Note: I have tried on 2 different computers so seems unlikely that it is my OS.
1,I took a chance on the lack of print screen and lost. There’s an alternate keystroke to get a screenshot of an entire but it stopped working after an OS update. I routinely take screenshots of entire windows and the snippet tool takes too long and always clips the window wrong. Alt PrintScrn was the fastest way and Microsoft took it away. Btw the emoji keyboard button is useless.
1,This keyboard never was very good about keeping paired with a device but now it won't pair at all to a MICROSOFT SURFACE!  Run away.  This keyboard is great unless you need it to pair.  I suggest you buy something else..  This has been a massive FAILURE.
1,The keyboard layout seems like it was designed by someone who never used the keyboard. I say this because of clues like the 'Lock' button being directly above the backspace button
1,It worked great for a 3 1/2 months. Now it won't stay connected or wake back up. I have to constantly remove it from PC and repair it ever time it goes to sleep.
2,Is not soft at all it’s hard as an old typewriter.
1,I liked everything about this keyboard except for it not having a print screen button until it stopped working in the middle of my work day while typing mid sentence. Batteries were fine and Bluetooth light was blinking indicating it was ready to connect. I couldn’t get it to connect again. It’s going back.
1,Keys get stuck.
1,You cant turn this off. So the cat types. If I pick it up it types. It is always on. Bad design.
1,If your device isn't made by Microsoft this may not connect. Good luck.
1,The keyboard continuously goes to sleep after 20 seconds.  There are no setting that allow for correcting the issue.Don't expect support from Amazon or microsoft
1,Worked fine until this morning.  Tried reinstalling new batteries etc.  Won't try to pair when pressing the bluetooth pair key.  Some kind of internal problem.  Is dead.
1,Un-usable. The long delay on entries showing up makes this keyboard useless.
1,I would be typing and see one of the last letters Ityped being repeated 15+ times across the screen.  Other than that it looks nice  Don't use for gaming.  Going to return it.
1,I have had it for 10 months and it now no longer functions!
1,Quit working and says I can’t return. Ridiculous. Don’t buy!!!
1,Keyboard keys sticking.  Return window closed less than 30 days of receipt.
1,After 4 and 1/2 months the sound control buttons stopped working.Otherwise a favorite keyboard.
1,Had to return it. There were missing keys.
4,This is my initial review for the Microsoft Bluetooth Keyboard Black and I'll continue updating it as I use it.Packaging:This Microsoft Bluetooth Keyboard came packed in a very beautiful box and getting it out of the box was a joy because it feels more like unpacking an expensive apple product when you open the box it raises the keyboard up and it has a small plastic tag that you pull. It arrived in perfect condition. I think it could make a great gift.In the box:You get the Bluetooth Keyboard 2 AAA Batteries already installed inside.Build Quality:It's made from plastic the build quality does have premium feel to it the base is plasticy but the keyboard have good weight to it.Design:It has a nice black finish with nice minimalistic design soft round corners. It's thin but it's very wide thoughSetup:It's very easy to set it up just pull the tag from the battery compartment as they come pre installed already you just need to pull the plastic tag and you're good to go it will start blinking for pairing if you have windows 10 device it will automatically find it through swift and connect to it other wise you'll need to add it via bluetooth.More info:I mainly got this for my home office as my current Razer keyboard finally gave up after 8 years. I like this one because it's Bluetooth as the old keyboard was wired but the thing that I really miss is the backlight keys which really makes a lot of difference while typing.The Keys on this keyboard has good travel distance of course not as satisfying as the mechanical keyboards but still ok. It's missing the print screen key which I used to use a lot and I think they replaced it with the emoji button which is pretty useless to me. Also no more num lock key but that was useless anyway. And I find it odd that they included so many shorts cuts but none of them has brightness control!The Good:- I like the minimalistic apple like design- Nice build quality.- Keys has good travel distance to it.- Battery lasts for a long time 2+ years.- Auto standby.The Bad:- It's a flat keyboard you can't raise it to rest your palms.- It doesn't feel like a $49 keyboard as the competition is fierce now.- Missing some keys like print screen and num lock.- No brightness control.- Useless emoji button could've been added on top not replacing current keys.- No built in batteries but they claim the supplied 2 AAA batteries last for 2+ years.Conclusion:At first I wasn't to sure about this Microsoft bluetooth keyboard but for $49.99 the competition is fierce but I think time will tell how it hold up I would recommend it for anyone looking for a minimalistic looking sturdy bluetooth keyboard.
4,The Microsoft Bluetooth Keyboard is definitely a step in the right direction for Microsoft.OverviewThe keyboard looks nice!  The keyboard has a very flat design and is fairly thin and lightweight.  The keyboard lays flat and there is no way to raise it up.  This can be uncomfortable for people who are accustomed to raising their keyboard to a comfortable level.  This reminds me of Apple’s external keyboards but that’s about the end of the similarities.The Microsoft badging in the corner is too large and draws your eye away from the center of the keyboard and towards the giant lettering.  Shrinking this badging down and dropping the white lettering in favor for recessed lettering matching the keyboard would have been a more appealing approach.  The material is plastic which is pretty much what you’ll find on the bulk of keyboards sold but this dissolves any illusions of premium Microsoft might have otherwise enjoyed.  The keyboard is powered by a pair of AAA batteries this is honestly a nice feature to see vs the non removable internal batteries that seem to be present in most electronics.SetupThe setup for this keyboard couldn’t be easier if you’re running Windows 10 that is.  Turn the keyboard on in range of your machine by using the bluetooth button on the back and you’ll get a popup asking if you’d like to pair the Bluetooth keyboard.  Clicking yes will kick off the process just enter the security pass code displayed on your monitor hit enter and you’re up and running in less than a minute.  Word of warning my first time setting this up there were 3 Windows 10 laptops in range all three hit me with a prompt to install my keyboard.I also paired this keyboard successfully with a Macbook Pro two Chromebooks a Fire HD10 tablet Android phone and an iPhone.  Connectivity worked very well with all.PerformanceThe performance is very nice.  The travel distance on the keys is on par with what I expected not too much not too little just right.  I personally found the keyboard comfortable to type on however I’m normally using a flat keyboard either in laptops or with my Apple external keyboard at work so comfort will be subjective based on the user.  The print screen button is not present but a new emoji button is.  This was a very odd choice for Microsoft and I’m not sure if its a good one.  This keyboard has a professional appearance to it having a smiley face seems to detract from that.Pros- Lightweight design- Great travel distance on the keys- Comfortable*- Easy to configure- Supports a wide array of devices- Replaceable batteriesCons- Missing Print Screen Key- Emoji Key- Badging is too large and distracting- Too much plastic does not feel premium- Cannot control keyboard height
4,Let me start by saying this keyboard is definitely one to consider. When connecting my laptop to external monitors it becomes inconvenient when my laptop is closed and I have to constantly stop my workflow to open it just to type. When looking for a wireless keyboard it needed to have two things: removable batteries and bluetooth connection.This keyboard comes with bluetooth 5.0  and in my time using it I am very pleased. There appears to be no lag when typing and the keys have a satisfying amount of key travel when pressed; They do not perform like those on the macbook pro 2016 on forward. Having bluetooth also means that you do not take away ports that would be dedicated to the receiver.Another benefit of this keyboard are the removable batteries. I dont fancy rechargeable batteries because normally you either have to replace the whole device due to degradation over time or take the device in to a special repair place. I think having removable aaa batteries eliminates this issue by allowing the user to replace them as they see fit and I am always pro consumer.Overall I am pleased with this keyboard. My only gripe surrounding this product would be with the layout of the keys. There is no backlighting or keys dedicated to controlling screen brightness of connected devices. For some reason Microsoft implemented keys dedicated to the calculator notification panel and windows media player. In my opinion these arent very useful keys and is a missed opportunity to utilize these keys for more important tasks.
4,PROS:> Very slim profile. Sleek looking keyboard> Pairs incredibly easily - I didnt use instructions at all - just hit the BT button on the back of the keyboard and then went into settings and found it on my laptop. Was paired in less than 2 minutes out of the box with very little effort.> Soft keys - very soft and quiet.> Very Microsoft oriented - there is an emoticon button an Office button snip it buttons that work very well for snipping. This is a great keyboard for Windows.> No latency issues. i do sometimes experience a moment of lag when I havent been using the keyboard for several hours and I click to use it (for example your streaming a movie and you click ESC) but that's it. it performs as well as a wired keyboard during all other times for me.CON:I could only find one Con - why in the world would you remove the Print Screen button?!? the Snip button works fine and is manageable but there are apps you cant snip in for privacy - they flag it and don't allow you to snip - Print screen always allowed you to get around that. It is necessary. If it had Print Screen I'd give it 5 stars.
2,Since the price came down so much I decided to give it a try and was initially quite impressed.  Despite a very light chassis there's no flex or rattle and the keys have a confident and repeatable action (compared to say some lower-end Logitech options where the key all rattle wobble and squish inconsistently).  It feels like a premium product with good build quality... which is why it was so regrettable I had to return it.In its minimal layout obviously sacrifices have to be made but it's difficult to understand the choices made here.  The two most infuriating is the lack of a Numlock button- when they bothered to give space for a 10-key numpad... removing the option to use that as navigation.  And the lack of a power button!  Be advised that online FAQs will claim pressing Function + CAPSLOCK will activate Numlock but this isn't true.  Additionally installing the Microsoft App only gives you extremely nominal customization of the media keys within extremely binary / limited options... you can't freely assign macros or do anything sophisticated.  With an Autohotkey script you can mitigate this making CAPSLOCK double as a numlock but you shouldn't have to and this is going to be beyond the ability of the typical user.Finally the power button wouldn't be an issue if the connection was reliable.  Granted it is more my BT radio than the device but after trying the keyboard with multiple PCs in my home and office it was only able to maintain a stable and error free connection with ONE computer out of a dozen!  The keyboard would disconnect and become unresponsive.  On a normal one with a power button you might be able to shut it down and back to cycle it... but with this you can only take the batteries out or turn off your BT radio (which may disconnect additional devices that are operating properly).Ultimately I switched over to the Logitech K360.  It's not even half as good looking and typing on it is unpleasant by comparison... but it WORKS which is more than I can say for the Microsoft.
4,Another great microsoft keyboard.  Years ago IBM was the only maker of great keyboards MS has filled that void.  I own lots of their keyboards.  I love BT and batteries... the batteries last so long its a non issue with these keyboards.  I love the feel of the keyboard...keys are sharp snap very responsive.  The speed is superb on par with wired BT 5.0 has come a long way.  Love the arrow keys easy accessable vs. crammed in vs. smaller keyboards.  slim and easy to travel.  hard to find a flaw with this BT keyboard!!
4,This is keyboard has the same 17 inch length as the full-sized keyboard on my desktop computer. It is compact in height and width but the length makes it harder to travel with than compact keyboards that don't have the number keys. The keys are fairly ergonomic with noticeable key travel but there is no way to tilt the keyboard up in the back so it feels uncomfortable during long typing sessions. It pairs with my tablet and my laptop easily and works smoothly. Uses 2 AAA batteries (included). You can use rechargeable batteries but you need to use your own charger.
3,The look and feel of this keyboard is great. However coming from similar sized keyboards I feel that the buttons require more force when typing so it gives a slower key travel (unless you want to have a bunch of missed letters when typing).There is a noticeable lag when waking up the computer from sleep. I haven't had this long lag with other non-Microsoft Bluetooth keyboards and mice. I can get upto 30 seconds of delay before a connection appears and that while my mouse connect instantaneously.. So go figure...The last complaint is the angle of the keyboard. While it is low profile I'd definitely appreciate if there was a slightly raised angle. But that can probably be a DIY fix.So to sum it up:1) Buttons require substantial finger force to be detected. Feels almost "gummy" to me.2) Takes long time to wake up and connect to computer after sleep.3) Lays pretty flat and has no kickstand.Microsoft has a dedicated driver/application to customize a few buttons. Highly recommend this. It's possible to customize the buttons with new commands and makros. Also note that the Office key works with a series of key combinations. For instance Office key + W will open Word and Office + P will open Power Point. There's a whole bunch of these shortcuts that can be used.Also as some people have complained about Print Screen button I found out that the media button can be programmed with Print Screen through the custom app I mentioned earlier.
5,I love to type and I'm really picky about my keyboards. I prefer low flat keys that don't make a lot of noise have soft action and a keyboard with lots of options and keys to save me effort. That being said this keyboard is really great. The bluetooth paired easily with my PC.  The only latency I noticed was the first time using it after/during setup.While it's true it doesn't have a Print Screen button it DOES have a Snipping button which in my opinion is far better because while you can capture the whole screen you can also just capture an area that you want.The emoji button is kinda neat but I haven't quite gotten into a habit of typing emojis except on my phone or maybe the standard :)My favorite thing about this is the look and the feel. It is low/flat and thin smooth and black and the keys feel lovely under your fingers. I"m very happy with this keyboard.
4,Microsoft's Bluetooth keyboard is a wonderfully sleek and nice looking device.  It's Bluetooth so it's wireless and it takes up minimal space.  I have it set up with an all-in-one PC and it fits the style very well.  Battery life has been excellent as well.  It's slim and modern looking.  Of course with most devices that look great the ergonomic capabilities aren't there.  I wouldn't recommend this as a work keyboard but it's great for occasional use and also great if you have a device hooked up to your TV.
5,I knew when I saw this we should have it. We have so many computer gadgets as it’s in my husband’s job area and because he really needs them for work. With a full numeric keypad it's definitely too wide to be a portable Bluetooth keyboard but it works great when a cord would either be in the way or inconvenient. My husband has used and tested it on our Windows home theater PC a Windows laptop and Linux laptop. It was easy to pair on every system he tried it on and he couldn't detect any lag or delay while typing. I noticed the keys have a smooth movement and are quiet but have a definite initial resistance then quick travel making it easy to feel with your fingertips that you've pressed a key. The keys look and feel like the keys on a higher-quality laptop. It's got combination function/multimedia keys along with several shortcut keys. Overall everyone who’s used it in our family is really happy with it.
5,I recently got a new all-in-one Windows 10 PC and didn't like the included keyboard. This one is PERFECT!! It's a nice compact size and really lightweight but super sturdy & durable. I love that it just connected so easily! This is the first Bluetooth keyboard I've used on a PC (I've used some with tablets and my phone before) and I'm hooked! Frees up a USB from the old wireless keyboard!
5,I got this because I hate my work laptop's keyboard so much. When I powered up this bluetooth keyboard I was pleased to see that Windows 10 recognized it and walked me through the setup process. This is much easier than the last time I tried to use a bluetooth keyboard on Windows many years ago.The keyboard is nice to type on if you like the square chicklet keys that everything seems to use these days. I can type much faster on his than the crappy DELL laptop keyboard.There are some interesting buttons included. One launches Office (yawn) and another is the Calculator (makes using the 10-key keypad nicer I guess). There is also an Emoji button (I'd never seen a keyboard with one of these) that pops up a Windows 10 emoji panel. I didn't even know there was one!The standard media player buttons are also there as well as "show all windows" "notifications" and a few others. Very nicely done. I like it a lot.It's just a bit too long to fit in my laptop case though.
3,The keyboard is nice tactile response is better than expected size is perfect and battery lasts for a a long time. There are a few drawbacks however which one has come to expect from a keyboard: 1) there are no light indicators - it is impossible to tell if the caps lock button is on or off which can be very annoying when doing quick messaging. This goes for the number pad and function keys as well. 2) Function keys cannot be locked like on the SurfaceBook keyboard so if you are editing cells in Excel pressing F2 to enter the cell for edits is now an annoyance. 3) there are no kickstands which is definitely not a deal killer but can make using the keyboard a bit uncomfortable.
4,Keys work fine. I like the no cords.  Perfect size for the desk.
3,This keyboard has a huge fatal flaw. It has no off switch. Once you pair it it stays paired unless you take out the batteries.
1,Does not recognize the first three keystrokes anytime you stop using it guarantees that your password will be wrong every time you login. Fails at the only function a keyboard is made for.
5,Easy to hook up to my computer and it works great! The less wires I have on my computer desk the better! I love how neat it looks now.
3,I'm running into some connection issues--worked fine with laptop but not my desktopno num lock key?  Kind of a weird change to the basic keyboard which I don't likeit is nice and compact but probably overpriced given what else is available.
5,This bluetooth keyboard worked out great! My son needed to be able to type things out for school on his iPad and it paired easily. It takes 2 AAA batteries which were included. He says the keys are smooth and it's a nice slim design.
1,Who was the rocket scientist at Microsoft who designed this keyboard layout? Only a moron would put the Lock Screen key 3mm away from the Backspace key. I fat-finger this key a dozen times a day and each time I have to re-key my password to re-enter my log-in session.Compounding this absolutely braindead decision the makers of the Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center application the app that is supposed to allow you to re-configure the keys does not support reprogramming the function of the Lock Screen button. But thank goodness I can the Start Media Player button (which I have never used and will never use).My next move will be to order some Superglue from Amazon so I can forever prevent this key from logging me out every 15 minutes.Caveat emptor. This keyboard may be useful if you have nanometer-precise typing skills or never need the Backspace key. But in my case it's an utter DESIGN FAIL.
1,- No NumLock key- No Print Screen key- Status of CAPS lock can only be guessed - no light whatsoeverBut you have a dedicated emoji key which will surely help you reflect your feelings towards this keyboard :)
1,This is easily the worst keyboard I have ever owned. Anytime your computer goes to sleep it takes this think minutes to connect sometimes you even have to repair it with the computer. There are no indicator lights no print screen no num lock buttons. Just all around a very poorly designed and thought out product.
5,This may be the best keyboard I’ve ever used. Keys are just the perfect blend of spacing pressure and response to allow error free extended operation. I am on the thing all day for work mixing intense CRM proposal spreadsheet and email / web activities for hours on end. Replace a new BT I picked up off Amazon that was literally a nightmare to use - terrible keystroke response causing constant errors redundant entries and unwanted operations. Not this one - this MS keyboard is as perfect as my imperfect typing skills will allow. Highly recommend. Ignore any low reviews. This is far and away the best BT keyboard I’ve come across.
3,No problem pairing it to the Surface Pro just look for the numeric code to input and don't forget to hit enter. Size of the keyboard is cramped but suits my needs. It will take a little getting used to. I would have thought it would feel like an upgrade to the Surface Pro keyboard. I keep making typos. Not very ergonomic but functional. Keys are slippery not tactile friendly.
5,Easy simple BT set up instant up and running wireless!!Quiet keys and feedback also a full size simple KBHappy Holidays Microsoft!Really like the recent Surface line of products too
5,My husband loves using this keyboard and it is perfect for a small or large desk.
5,Good and fast service thank you
5,keyboard is not lighted.so you dont know if cap lock is on or off if typing passwords that are hidden. i found that if you set throttle key to on the cap key either has hy tone sound or low tone sound when you are using caps lock.  two different tones come from caps lock
5,No complaints. Works great!
4,It's an ok keyboard but I wrongly expected it to seamlessly replace my previous old tired Microsoft wireless keyboard it did not.  I wrongly assumed my previous wireless MS keyboard was Bluetooth too but it is not. So if you buy this make sure your computer has built-in Bluetooth.  If it does not you'll need to buy a USB Bluetooth adapter in addition to this keyboard.  I'm kind of angry that $2 Bluetooth adapter was not included with the keyboard as was with my previous MS wireless keyboard and even with my wife's wireless Logitech keyboard.
5,You know bluetooth keyboards are not as responsive as wired keyboards.  Also the comfort level is not as nice as the wired keyboards.  However this is definitely a must try.  I love the soft keys and it is the best bluetooth keyboard I have.  Usually I like Microsoft products any way.
5,Perfect for my work desk. It’s minimized look took time to adjust the grip. But yes after working for 5 days I don’t see any connectivity issue. Quick connection with my thinkpad laptop. Very less typing noise.
5,Very easy and quick set up with Bluetooth usual Microsoft quality
1,Total lack of customer service. After about 3 weeks the keyboard would no longer connect to Bluetooth. I tried the usual remedies to no avail. I live in a condo with limited storage so I do cannot keep empty boxes. The vendor refused to replace or refund without the original box. It should be noted that although it is branded as Microsoft there is no model or serial number on the keyboard itself.
1,While it worked it was great but that only lasted a week. Then I could not connect. I have a bluetooth mouse from logitech that was connected the whole time. Tried to repair turned bluetooth off and on rebooted machine changed batteries nothing. There was an option to call Microsoft but based on some of the other reviews about thid issue I did not feel that is worth my time and just took the refund. Pulled an old logitech mini bluetooth keyboard for a tablet out of a drawer where it had been sat for probably five years. Turned on paired and working. Couldn't believe the battery still was good. Probably get myself a logitech now like I should have in the first place. How hard is it to get bluetooth right in 2020?You shold note that there is no on/off button on the keyboard or indicator of bluetooth connectivity which makes troubleshooting difficult. Also there is a battery light that comes on briefly when it you add batteries but then nothing.
4,i was skeptical to buy this because it's Bluetooth connection i prefer USB connection but i bought it anw cuz i had a usb one from an unknown brand and i had to return it because the layout of keys is weird (some keys are bigger some are samller than universal size).  unfortunately what i afraid is true the Bluetooth disconnect sometimes lagging response is real but i'm done i think this is the best you get for under $70 keyboards
5,I purchased this keyboard for my PC box. It was an open box condition like new and it was like new as described.I read a lot of the negitive reviews about this keyboard all of which I have not experienced The bluetooth is flawless after I paired it which was seemless I have never had it not connect or drop connection. I use my PC mainly for online meetings and I don't leave it on. I have never started the PC and not have the keyboard connected when the login screen comes up. The Windows system keys on this keyboard are great and well placed. The keys feel good and have a nice feel while typing.Now I will say that I don't do a lot of typing. For someone who is doing a lot of typing all day I would say there are better keyboards. This keyboard does not have any lift tabs at the back so its flat on the desk.As far as the gaming aspect of the keyboard goes I am not a gamer but in my opinion this is not a keyboard for gaming.I would recommend this for casual use of a Windows based system.
5,I love this keyboard. connection to the computer was swift and easy. prefer this to the Microsoft Wedge keyboard. the Wedge was too small and no number pad. which was a must have. the keyboard is easy to get used to. I highly recommend this keyboard.
3,Works very well. It is missing a caps key light and other basic lights.  It does not adjust to angle keyboard.
4,it is missing a light on the cap lock to show if you are in camlocks or not. Also the key to lock the screen on top of the backspace is really not at the right place. I keep on hitting it. Otherwise good quality and keys feel nice.
3,Le clavier est léger et robuste peut donc se transporter facilement. Design épuré mais pas particulièrement ergonomique.Irritant: Le Bluetooth se déconnecte rapidement ce qui est assez frustrant au début mais on finit par s'habituer (normalement on tape quelques lettres et il se "réveille" au bout de quelques secondes).
5,I love this keyboard. It never drops the Bluetooth connection and typing on it is awesome. I’ve achieved higher speeds than my normal average. The key layout is the best in the business. Just buy it. You won’t regret it!
1,Worked for one week and then randomly disconnected from my bluetooth and is no longer discoverable no matter what I do. Very sad considering the price tag. I got rid of the original packaging so not sure what to do now.
5,Works well Bluetooth only.Only complaint no rear height adjustment option. Will get over it.
1,Too small and not sure if an actual genuine Microsoft product
5,Really nice entry level Bluetooth keyboard. No adjustable height but long battery life and solid bluetooth connection.
5,This is an excellent keyboard. Working from home because of covid-19 I got this and when I go back to work I might bring it with me. Much better than the one I have from my employer!
5,Another solid product by Microsoft. Small light easy connections and quiet typing make this a great keyboard to have
4,Great keyboard. The key presses feel very good. I just wish the keys were backlit.
5,Microsoft quality. Well built.  Works well
5,Plug and play...c'est tout ce que je demande pour un clavier de bureau.
5,I collect synthesizers and they like to go MIDI through usb so i have no extra space to plug in a keyboard or mousethis is THE solution
5,Nice comfortable design for work and love that its Bluetooth so can be used easily with other devices
1,No caps lock light.  Constant disconnections.  Stay away.
5,Basic keyboard works well.
5,Decent if you do not want wires hanging around.Good for on and off web browing. Not ergonomic at all but it was expected anyway.
5,Great Product comfortable on the hands. Not super loud keys
1,doesn't connect very well
5,Everything as described.
5,Easy to connect- works great
4,No real complaints about this keyboard. It does what it needs to do and it’s pretty comfortable to use. I would say the only disappointment for me is that it does not have an indication light to let you know if the CAPS lock is on.  Everything else seems standard. Works great with MS 365.
1,It works fine at first but in less than a month the Bluetooth connection is not working? Who should I contact?
5,Very good product. Good quality and useful.
5,This item was easy to set up with my smart TV
5,Love it. Bluetooth helps to cut down on all the cords at my desk. Quiet buttons for typing. Easy to set up. Has good finger distance and has zero discomfort for typing. My ONLY issue is there are no raisers to tilt at an angle. Very flat typing so wrists are a little extended beyond comfort. It’s easy for travel but I’ve started to keep it at my office at work. It’s perfect for small spaces.
5,Je l'utilise tous les jours pour le télétravail. Le clavier est ergonomique et vraiment agréable à utiliser. 2 bémols : la touche cadenas qui lock l'ordinateur est trop proche des autres touches et malencontreusement on peut le locker en écrivant un courriel. Le 2nd bémol c'est la touche majuscule on ne sait pas si elle est activée ou non. Ces 2 bémols ne m'empêchent pas de mettre le maximum d'étoiles car ce n'est pas si dérangeant.
5,Paid half price because the box was damaged the form that came with it also mentioned “minor cosmetic damage” but I can’t notice any! Very happy with my purchase! Very easy to connect to my Microsoft surface tablet I love having the full size keyboard as opposed to the keyboard that attaches to my surface.
5,But fir the price this is a great keyboard ... Bluetooth is the way to go if you want wireless ... doest use up USB slots
5,If you work a lot with Windows and O365 this one is a great addition.The keys are optimized for the most used functions they are silent and feel like quality.It is not particularly ergonomic but would work well with additional wrist support.
1,Clavier ne se connecte pas à mon portable j’ai tout essayé sans succès .
5,Exactly what I was looking for at the price point.  Needed blue-tooth connectivity without the need for a dongle.
1,Blue tooth was very difficult to connect. It took too much time to connect and a lot of patience.Important functions such as CAPS does not have an indicator light so we don’t know if it’s off or on.No PRINT SCREEN button. There are additional keys added to this keyboard but they are completely useless.This keyboard is too flat it would have been good to have some support or a stand attached to the keyboard for more flexibility but that is not the case.Overall I give this item 2/10
4,It would be nice to have integrated legs to allow the keyboard to be tilted.
5,Very slim and compact.  I find comfortable enough no hand wrist fatigue.  purchased to WFH then bought one for my office.  connects seamlessly.  quiet keys but you know when you have hit them.i miss the backlit keys on my laptop though.
4,I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 as it does not have any feet on the back to tilt it slightly. That means it sits flat which takes some getting used to when you type.  Regardless. I recommend this and if Microsoft realizes their error I will purchase an update that puts legs on it
1,There is a lock button right above the backspace button and I'm frequently accidentally pressing this and locking my machine when trying to backspace. Placement of this button could be better. Not that the button is even needed.
3,It feels okay but there are no print screen key. Also if you do not type on it for a bit there is a delay before the keyboard responds when you type again is extremely annoying. I went through all the settings on the computer and turned off bluetooth power saving etc but there is still always that delay.
4,Bought this for when I work on the kitchen table as my laptop is on a stand and can't use it's keyboard. It pairs without any issue the layout is fine and it's very lightweight. The only issue I have with it is that there's no way to turn it off. If I forget the keyboard somewhere anyone -- including the cats -- can press keys while you're using the laptop. The first time it happened I thought I got hacked. :)
5,
2,Fine but too expensive you could buy other cheaper from lesser brands and the build quality would be the same.
1,After a few months keyboard randomly disconnects every 30 mins then doesn't work for 30-40 seconds and then starts working again. This is super annoying especially when typing up documents or working with video or playing games useless keyboard a 5$ wired keyboard is better than this.
