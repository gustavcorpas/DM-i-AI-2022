4,Easy to set up. We have a coaxle cable hooked into it then a HDMI running from the box to the TV. Sound is out of sync on almost every channel we pull in with the antenna.But the kicker is it DIED!!!!! Bought August 25 2021 and it died last night September 19 2022. Tried to unplug it for a hour and still NOTHING.
5,This little box is amazing!  I live in a rural area where it's been thought that satellite service was a must in order to watch television. I'm happy to report that's just not the case with my MediaSonic converter box. I have a newer TV with the ability to receive over the air channels alone. With my converter box I receive more channels with a beautiful picture. I can't imagine having to pay for programming now that I have my little miracle box!  I'm a big fan as you can tell! Try it and I don't think you will be disappointed.
4,This does what I needed it to do but the remote is garbage and unless you’re pointing directly at the box it won’t receive the signal. Even sometimes when you are pointing it directly at the box it still won’t receive the signal. Gotta push the button multiple times and that is incredibly annoying. Everything else with this device works great.
5,I had already bought 2 previous machines at a big box store. They barely lasted a month before quitting on me. I have been so pleased with this one that I got another for a friend and yet another for our back bedroom. Reliable and easy to use
4,I bought this primarily as a DVR to record the local team's football games off-air.For this review please bear in mind that one reason this unit is so cheap is because the Quality Assurance effort applied to its manufacture minimal. You can expect a wide variance in product quality. This review is about my unit in particular. Yours WILL be different or dead on arrival.I initially tested this with a 47" Visio flat screen TV. I was not initially impressed. There was some jitter evident in the image if one looked very closely. The first test recording "seemed" to have an audio issue. Otherwise this is a fine product of Chinese engineering. The screens were in good English by the way. The documentation not so much.The first thing about making recordings with this unit is that you MUST be getting a picture without dropouts in it (scrambling of the picture and/or audio glitches). If not you can forget getting useful  recordings with the unit. It's not a flaw in the unit it's the technical reality. I can only get a "perfect" image on a few of the channels where I live. This is disappointing but not the unit's fault.The most pronounced problem with my first test recording (which was NOT made with a perfect single). Had wildly fluctuating audio. This WAS a problem with the unit and is disappointing but read on.Next I turned off the unit removed  the USB drive I was recording to and plugged it into my new laptop. Here I found the following about Video Recordings which are placed in a subdirectory named "HBPVR":File type:  .mts  plus  .mts.metaCODEC:  MP2  UncompressedYup this unit provides a PERFECT recording. What comes in goes out. If you're getting a good signal you get a recording with all the original image fidelity. It looks _amazing_ on my laptop which has a 4K screen.Now back to the problems I mentioned at the start. The video jitter is _not_ present when I play back the recordings on a computer. And the audio dropouts are not present either. Unfortunately there are STILL audio dropouts during playback _on the unit_ even when there is an excellent signal. Further investigation showed the problem is with audio processing in the HDMI interface section of the design. I can live with it so I will keep it. As mentioned at the top you may not have this problem (it may be specific to my unit) or you may have a different fun problem.Other than that it seems to be a great little unit. And I do mean little. It looks much bigger on the Amazon site. The remote range and position sensitivity is not as bad as I feared from reading reviews. It comes packed in a tiny cardboard box with a carrying handle. Save it so you can carry it around if you ever need to!
5,worked great and liked the size
5,Works very good with my antenna box
5,I bought this because my previous unit died this unit is much improved having the external power supply/adapter keeps the heat out of the unit. The software has some improvements that make it more functional. The picture and tuner are great. This is a good unit if you're looking for a DVR to record over the air TV.
5,Good quality for price..easy to install..easy to use..Very Satisfied
3,I don't know if it is a problem with this gadget or it is all about anthems but few channels are stable.
4,Mediasonic Converter box to the rescue. Past day technology to make modern TV work.
3,This box was the perfect solution to my need: I have an older TV set and wanted to utilize it for broadcast reception. Installation and setup were simple no instructions were needed. I like the simple on-screen menus. It worked fine for less than 2 years and it failed. As it is inexpensive I ordered a replacement unit. Turns out the failure was not the box itself but the power supply. If the new unit ever fails my approach will be to find/build a replacement power supply.
4,I gave 4 stars because you will have to buy your own HDMI cord (the media control wire does not work as well as HDMI and there is a small delay between remote and box when using). I ordered because my living room smart tv does not have a place to put the coaxial cable (only HDMI/USB/media cords) and I wanted to use a tv antenna. This box fit the need. First one I ordered did not have a remote but unit was replaced quickly and now I have antenna tv and cut my cable bill over half by keeping internet only. Using TV antenna and Roku (for movies) are all the tv I need. Outlay of money was window antenna/tv box (if tv has place for coaxial wouldn't need)/and Roku.
5,2/19/21I bought my first Homeworx tuner about 7 years ago. It worked "flawlessly" (for such a low cost unit I do not expect perfection).  Last weekend a power outage finally took it out.  The new one is a lot smaller because they replaced the built-in power supply with a wall wart.While I'm happy with the new one (only $19!) I actually liked the larger one better for these reasons:1. It's easier to use a standard 2-prong cord than a wall wart power supply (cords fit better on plug strips)2. The larger box stayed put on the shelf better because it's wider and a bit heavier.The cord on the new wall wart power supply is shorter than the old power cord so I had to use a short extension cord too reach my plug strip.My new tuner does not have the DVR capability.  The old one did but I never used that feature so i saved $10 without it.You can see how they got the price under $20...external power supply and no DVR feature (which is just a firmware mod).I should mention that I live close to a metropolitan area and have line of sight to a big TV transmitter so I get about 35 stations with excellent quality.I thought about dropping this to 4 stars because of the change to the external power supply.  But... it's a great tuner for less than $20!  How can I complain?
4,The only issue I have is that if I leave it on with the TV off and turn the TV on later the sound is not in sync. It's just a matter of tuning it off and on again. This one doesn't have the playback ability.  It's fine for an old style  CRT TV I use in the Kitchen.
5,I bought this because I was told that it could pick signals form the air and turn them into pictures with sound and action.  Sure enough it did.  So if you’re like me and too cheap to buy a new TV and don’t want to pay for cable this is the thing.  I now get a bunch of stations for free and am using my savings to help fund my retirement
5,better than i expected
3,Back in the day a blurred speckled picture from poor reception was called snow.Using the coaxial cable connection to the TV will get you just that.This should work fine that way but I could only get a picture with an HDMI cable.For me its a wasted port but if you don't have a port to waste don't get this.
5,I had a Idoo brand that lasted 1 year. This is a much better quality from the get go. And It took 10 minutes to get it up and running. Pulls in more over the air channels. Now I pay ZERO $ for local channels!
5,Quick shipping time.  I had a little trouble setting up the digital converter. I called customer service it rang a few seconds and a human answered the phone and talked me through setup.  Very appreciative of Mediasonic’s assistance.
2,It worked fine for months then stopped working overnight. Spent hours in vain trying to diagnose the issue. Mp4 mp4 (av1) or avi files? It just says "Unsupported File." Online documentation lists them as supported files so I don't know what I'm missing to make it work.
4,This box is the only option for over the air channels on certain tvs ones without tuners. I had the previous model for 4 years and sometimes it sat for long periods of time... it recently stopped powering on. This is from cheap capacitors most likely... and common so I bought a few different brands but none worked at all. Gave up and got this one refurbished assuming someone already upgraded some of the cheap parts? Maybe. The funky software is something I’m used to now and the dvr function is pretty dope actually as long as the storage is formatted properly. I’d pay twice as much for a really nice tuner but this is the only good current option for me. Why isn't there a high end option for these? Someone start a kickstarter
5,Works great I hope it last
5,I got for someone in my family since they messed up their other converter box and needed a replacement. And it was the cheapest one I could find. And now I need one for myself since the one I kept getting from Wal-Mart would stop working after two months and I didn't want to have to keep getting one from Wal-Mart. So far the one from Mediasonic is working just fine so I hope I won't have to get another one.
4,Worked great until it didn’t. Bought May of 2021 and it just stopped working Jan 2022. Disappointed.
4,Bought this in Feburary to work with a TV with broken antenna input...converting antenna to HDMI output.  Device worked ok once hooked up but stopped powering on after 7 months.  Changed the power supply thinking perhaps that went bad but no luck.  Save your money and buy a better quality unit.
4,Wasn't easy for a 70 year old to put together.
5,Please DO NOT buy this.  I should have listen to the other reviews.  I was able to one my local football game last week and excited to use it again tomorrow to watch NFL play off game.  This piece of garbage won't even power on.  I have never been this pissed in my life.  And I hate writing reviews too.  Well this one needs it.Revision:I bought a new and different brand tv tuner and it too has a power issue.  Surely enough it was not the tv tuner after all...it was my wall socket that was bad :{For the one week that I own the Mediasonic TV tuner I had no issue and I was actually really happy with the unit.  Base on one week usage I want to make a revision and give it 5 stars!!!! *****
5,I must admit to being pleasantly surprised by this $19.98 item.  Note that this version does not include a record/PVR feature.  It is simply a device that lets one connect an OTA antenna to a TV which only has digital inputs.  Basically it is an OTA TV tuner which can output HDMI/RCA.  Given that I find it to be an excellent tuner.  It pulls in nearly twice the stations I was getting previously.  I have experienced zero of the problems described in the one-star reviews - I have no power issues no loss of memory no video/audio misalignment nothing.  At this point it is new so I can not speak to longevity.  From what I've seen so far my recommendation is just buy it.
4,Set up was easy good features the only thing is the remote it is a little laggy after you press power button but overall worth it
5,I paid $18.98 before tax in January 2021.  Just want to put that in the review because so many reviewers talk about what a value something is or isn't but never mention the price they pay so when prices go up and down as they tend to do on this site the comments still say "great value" even if the price goes up to a million dollars your review will still say that.  So it's important to share that info with one another.  And Amazon please do not censor.....censorship is bad mmmmkay?  But this product seems very good so far.  As I said in my headline the channels are very clear thanks also in part to my over the air antenna but certainly nice to have a remote which my last converter lacked.
4,Purchased for $21.99As with any tuner of this style it is extremely easy to install. I find the remote frustrating to use. You really have to push down the buttons while directly facing the tuner. But overall I haven’t had any issues so far.
3,This is the third one of these I have purchased. They work great but die at the two year mark like clockwork. Wish I could find a better alternative but there is not much on the market for digital tv tuners with an hdmi connection.
5,Now able to get several channels with antenna that for some reason my cable provider stopped showing. Set up is vey simple and direct.Shows up on smart tv as hdmi 2 so I can switch between cable and antenna with the push of a button.
4,It works. You really have to point well to use the remote that it comes with (no batteries included but that's okay). It would have been good if that same control could be a universal control so it could control the TV as well. I didn't find a manual inside the box so I'm not sure how to add favorite channels to the list just go to the page that has the favorites list menu (blank list until I figure it out). Called customer support but nobody picked up.
4,Distance is not as I taught it would be.
3,We still have TVs left from living overseas that do not have tuners that work in the USA.  One is in the family room the other the man cave.  Over the last several months I Mediasonic has batted .500 on quality control.  One device stopped working altogether another only received a handful of channels.  Replacing each defective one with the same model has worked.  So we've purchased 4 and returned two.  Given this track record and the relatively low cost of the Asurion plan for the device I also think adding the insurance just makes sense.
3,First remote is very hard to read and can't control your TV. EPG or electronic program guide isn't what I thought it was. It just shows upcoming shows on the channel you are watching. I was looking for one that displays a guide that shows all channels and what is currently showing kinda like plutoTV if you will as an example. But overall the unit works fine but the interface is generic.
3,This is not a cable or satellite box replacement but you may be surprised at the number of local channels that you will receive. That said you will need a good and well placed antenna (rabbit ears flat etc.) to get the most out of this converter. Unfortunately there's no on screen program guide so you are flying blind unless you know what you're looking for. You literally have to channel surf. This why I gave it only 3 Stars. Finally if you have an RF connecter on your television you may not need this item. One of my TVs only have HDMI connecters.Surprisingly picture quality is better than cable or satellite.
4,Item is as described received 4 days ahead of schedule. Will use this vendor again.
5,As advertised this product converts a digital TV antenna signal into an analog signal on the RF output to work with an old TV without a digital tuner.  Small and easy to set up.
5,Pros: EXTREMELY easy to set up; 5 mins and I was up and running. Not sure I understand why some reviews were slamming the set up. I am a 60 yr old professional woman - I set this up without help. Picks up all channels where I live in a Denver suburb. Quick scanning of channels. Have not tried record option; no need ... Yet.Cons: Only thing I have noticed is a VERY slight delay when changing channels be it keying in a specific one or surfing through chronologically. Now that I have adjusted not an issue. Just something to be aware of.
2,Should last longer than 10 months. Not recommended
5,This was exactly what I was looking for and it works great.  Easy to hook up and easy to use. No problems at all.
5,Very minimal and light. I would say it feels cheap but for what it is robust is not needed.
2,This box took a crap and won’t work anymore. One year and it’s dead
5,This converter box is a must have if your looking to continue getting free tv. The tv I bought did not have a cable hook up (saving money I guess) the ATSC converter box is the ticket. They are hard to find but worth the money if you can find one.
5,After couple months that i did not used it it does not power up any more. Now i dont have the access to local channels any more in my tv. Not even lasted half a year wonder how the warranty works for this need help.
5,Works great!
5,You'll still need a digital antenna for this but this converter box was easy to install and set up.
3,The unit itself works as expected. The main problems are with the remote and the unit memory.The unit doesn't respond to the remote like it should when the buttons are pressed. The other problem is the unit will put back channels that I have removed when the unit has been off overnight. This is quite frustrating because I don't happen to speak Vietnamese or Spanish and I have removed these channels for this reason and it is a tedious process to re-edit  given how the remote is so finicky.  Try one of the other boxes!
5,Direct replacement t for another brand that quit working during the football game :\  this is a plug and play for local  stations including sports especially if you've cut the cord from cable TV ugh.... past time for that people
3,It started out great - picked up several stations I'd never gotten before.  But two weeks later it dropped most of the stations!  I scanned again a few times but it still won't pick up all the stations it initially did.  VERY disappointing!!
3,Hw130stb homework did last a year before it stopped working. Would not power up !!
4,Good pic quality but had to manually go through and delete over 200 blank pics that auto scan picked up and numbers dont mach channels
5,Easy and great picture with a good digital antenna
3,Don' waist your money
3,Does not record properly. Get stuck when trying to replay.  Set recording for 1 hour or more records only 15 minutes or none at all.
4,Easy to install finds channels fairly quick still working on getting favorites to work.I stopped working no power after a few months 😐
5,I got a 1983 Trinitron that only has an RF out no composite. I was able to hook this box up to the TV with a regular coax and then hook up my antenna - now I get about 65 channels over the air. Setup was quick picture looks clean haven't had any issues thus far. Nice to get some life out of a vintage TV like this!
4,Live in suburban VA and can barely catch any signals. Give it for stars because the few channels I was able to acquire provided amazing HD resolution. Good quality bu not what I expected.
1,While this product did provide an easy enough means to connect my antenna to my video system it mysteriously died on me. Had it for less than 18 months. Not a quality I look for in my electronics.
3,I picked up just as many stations without.
4,It serves the purpose
4,The hand held is fragile. Sometimes you have to press the small (quite small) buttons very hard to change a channel. Improve on this and you have a real winner here...
5,The sensitivity of my 10 year old DTV is degrading and it started having trouble picking up the local PBS channels.  I got this tuner to see if a newer tuner could pull the PBS channels in and it does!  Well worth the investment.  Great deal especially with the renewed version.  The manual is not the best as it doesn't explain the loopthrough function very well.
5,This converter box rocks like no other! I am getting so many stations and they are crystal clear full HD and more.  I am so satisfied with my purchase and with Mediasonic I accidentally put my remote in a return antenna box and the store couldn't find it but Mediasonic showed true customer service and sent me another one free of charge. If you want stations and you them in HD this is the converter box you want to have it rocks!
4,bought this for our airstream to use when camping in areas where there is no wifi.  in our driveway it works just fine.
5,Works great we have two
5,Getting more channels than with my old one!
2,Picture and sound on 90% of channels not in sync different connections and troubleshooting suggestions did not resolve problem.  Tuner also didn't lock as well onto channels -another version of this tuner that I tried (another brand) was better but died after a year.  Returned Amazon refund was quick and easy.
5,Easy to install. Works great. So glad my old other company model stopped working so that I could learn about this one!  I bought a second to have just in case one of other converter boxes quits on me. I may buy even more as gifts!  I get lots of channels with no outdoor antenna only flat antenna. Try it; I think you'll like it
4,The value for this convert box is good the remote and its interface works very good. The channel search works well haven’t seen delays in the picture while watching my tv.
5,Our old TV at work was dead in the water. I ordered this and connected the good old outdoor antenna. The old dinosaur came to life. Picture and sound are great.
5,was what i needed for my smart tv to have a tuner
3,They really need to make these thing work a lot better. Especially for apartments.
3,It has RCA and HDMI which works out good for us using an Epson projector. The only complaint I have is the remote has to be pointed directly and in close range of the receiver added new batteries but still just not very powerful.
4,I had another old one it went dead. This new one is not able to get as many channelsso I don't get ABC NBC and CBC as i used to here in Southern Quebec.
4,Small Footprint.A good amp to boost antennasignal strength.
5,I cut the cord earlier this year and installed a Clearstream 4V antenna in my attic.  That worked really well for all my TVs.  However my projector did not have a tuner built in.  With this tuner I was able to enjoy the "Big Game" in my home theater.
5,Just plug a USB 3.0 hard drive into this receiver and you can record "over the air" shows which can be played back on the tv  or on your computer.I really like the "record while watching"  feature which allows you to rewind and  replay any part of the show that you have just watched.
5,This is the third one of these digital converters I have bought. This one seems to be the best. I cannot believe how small it is. Half the size of the first one if not more. Hook up is nothing. Certainly nothing compared to a new phone
5,This converter box works perfectly like no other! I am getting alots stations and they are very clear and fully HD. I am so satisfied and happy with my purchase.Thanks Mediasonicc.Will purchase more for my in laws because we are very happy with it.
1,Low quality. Stopped working right away. I think this company makes money from folks not wanting to take the time to return their purchases.
2,The picture came in clear even though I couldn’t get all the same channels that my other TV received. I added a signal amplifier to get the other channels and hopefully clear up the audio. However the channel was available but the audio on it and every other channel was choppy and sounded like it was switching between decoding types or something.
3,Remote to box terrible.  I have to move the remote around and mash the buttons to get it perform.
3,This is a nice box with new features I keep discovering.I can usually make the the channel changer work after a few tries but it shouldn't require this much effort.
4,The picture quality is great
1,I bought this July 7 I was happy with this at first but I've only had it a month and can't get it to work anymore. Don't waste your money.  I'm really getting fed up with electronics that break down a day or two after the return period is up.
4,Looks just like what was advertised. As soon as I get it hooked up and test it out I will update my rating.
5,Set this up to use a digital antenna with a projector. This was the perfect solution. Sets up easy can power the antenna boost from the front USB port and links up perfectly to the projector with the HDMI. Perfect!
4,No
4,Works great. Does what it is supposed to do.
4,relatively easy to use.
3,Remote must be close and pointed directly at unit
5,Was easy to install had instructions but were not needed. Easy to use!! Only thing I didn't like did not come with batteries for the remote control for the converter box. The TV works beautiful and Was easy to program as well.
3,Remote control no works on a long distance.The have to fix it
2,it didn't last a year. no longer works after eight months. won't turn on either by remote or manually. plugged in no signal light and did not turn on when i pushed the button on the box. i even tried to plug into a different outlet and no signal.
5,Working like a charm on my 15+ year old “old school “ Phillips TV! Had to get rabbit ears also...but so happy I now have 13 stations in my hilly river town with close buildings and trees to block reception.
4,Used to go from over the air coax from antenna to HDMI to tv.  Worked perfectly. Only drawback is now I need 2 remotes vs 1.
3,It did work  but if you left it on long term and came back voices didn't match the lips. When it went out I wasn't upset.
5,Very quick delivery and very quick and easy installation. Setup was very intuitive. Great price.
1,Broke in less than a year. Just stopped turning on
1,I’ve only used a coupe times.  Have it plugged into surge protector.  Get a storm and the stupid box won’t power on!
4,Good price. Used to connect HD antenna to tv. Easy to set up. Only dislike is having to have a separate remote.
5,In about 5 minutes I was able to hook up my father in law’s Old little tube tv out in the workshop. 18 clear channels! Neat device.
2,Dead after 6 months. While it worked device functioned adequately to tune broadcast digital channels. The interface is a bit clunky as is the remote control. Unit was easy to install.Can't recommend due to very early failure.
5,If you have an older analog TV this is what you need to make it work with the new digital signals. I have a 10 year old flatscreen smasung tv that still works great and this lets me use it again in my spare room.
5,I stopped paying for cable TV as soon as I had an affordable alternative for high speed internet. Nothing fancy with this. I plugged it in. I connected an antenna to it. Let it auto tune and I have had no issues. I will be able to watch local and national broadcast sports again.
4,The battery compartment cover does not stay in place well.
5,Easy setup
5,converter box works like a charm have a older tv that cant receive HD Antenna channels this solved the problem instantly!
3,I use it to get channels off an HD antenna to provide channels for non-HD TVs. It works rather slowly. I must use my TV's remote to turn TV off and on.
4,This works really well so I can get over the air channels. It was very easy to set up.
5,I order this for my in-laws there tv antenna  input broke off and only option was to get hdmi input and work well not bad for the price !😀👍 great space saver too!
5,So simple to set up. Plug in and play. Easy to set up favorite channels. Exactly what I needed.
5,Thank you
3,Ez install battery door missing on remote contacted Amazon got a $5 refund works ok
5,It is easy to set up plus easy channels scanning. I wish it also tell you what is actual TV channels not only stations phony channel such as; channel 3 from analog days as digital frequency is on frequency channel 35 to view channel 3.
5,This was a good buy. Set up was easy it has a good quality picture and you can record. It picks up numerous channels and came quickly. You won’t regret this purchase. I called customer service and they walked me through my issue. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
1,I had one of these from a different vendor [although they all look like they came out of the same factory] a year or two ago and it did the same thing this one did: Constantly locks up freezes and/or reboots. This one [and the earlier one] lock up while they're running and if I'm lucky reboot.Worse every other time I try to turn it on the LED [which stupidly is bright red for OFF and dim green for ON] goes from red to instead black [which apparently means LOCKED UP] and I have to unplug the unit wait a sec and plug it back in. How annoying.Finally even when it does run after running for a day or so it accumulates delay between audio and video leaving the two out of sync by about 1/4 sec.  How also annoying.I rarely return items to Amazon but this piece of junk is going back.
4,It improves my over tv performance.
5,It arrived before it was supposed to which was great. The hookup was simple andso far it's working like a charm. Not a problem at all. I'm very pleased with it for the cost.
5,East to install and auto search for channels was great.
5,Worked exactly as I expected
2,Bought this because the cable input broke on upstairs tv. Very hard to set up in my opinion and when you finally find the channel you’re looking for it’ll begin playing but sometimes will go out and the box will need to be unplugged and plugged back in. It is extremely hard to find the channels since they are in no way labeled like you might expect
3,It works fine with my outdoor tv antenna picks lots of channels just what I needed
3,Just received the items haven’t had time to hook them up yet that why I gave low reviews once they are hooked I will hopefully be able to Chang my reviews
5,This digital converter works great and gives you all of your local digital broadcast channels.
5,We purchased to use in our Rv and it works great
5,I have regular local TV so this Digital Convertor is great.  It’s smaller than my previous box (which was terrible and old) but wow it does an amazing job receiving local San Francisco channels.  I’m very pleased with my purchase and highly recommend it.
5,It did what articles said couldn't be done - convert F cable to RCA composite.
1,Bought this at the end of January and it already died kind of stinks nothing you can do can’t even return it and this was purchased for an older lady who has no cable in her house and lives in a low income area
5,Just what I needed
1,I used the same brand before and now I cannot get the converter box give me a picture on my TV unable to pull up the menu to program the remote.
5,It will allow my tv to continue to be used.
5,Works as designed and not bulky. Read the instructions and follow them and your setup is super easy.
5,works well.  Just need an cord that is not included for older older tvs..
5,Have a 46 inch Sony and tuner was not receiving over the air signals well.Bought this to by pass the Sony tuner and it actually worked better than expected.
2,It's not a matter of if but when. I've owned four of these converters. They are great when they are working. Each one systematically died without warning. I have since been using converters of a another brand. Hopefully I'll have better luck with those........
1,Remote control quit working and hardly even had this 2 months
5,Works great! It helps extend the life of my old TV.
5,haven't tried recording onto a thumb drive yet but otherwise it works well
1,We ordered this and used it for 4 months.  It quit working.  We have called the company at the customer service number provided 3 different times and they have never called back.  I also cannot get through to Amazon.  So here we sit watching PBS because we cannot get any other channels. I could never recommend this converter box to anyone.
5,Tuner was pretty much plug and play. It searched channels automatically and then I was watching free TV.
5,We were extremely please with this product. Extremely!
4,Worked well with old tube type tv.
5,Old tube TV in the shop with an antenna. Needed a digital tuner and this one works great.
5,Replaced cable company's box (and monthly fee) with this identical one and works great.
5,The box is great but the remote worked twice then quit working. Put new batteries in still nothing.
5,First day using it: it works well! Clear picture and sensitive tuner.
5,Easy set up and easy to use.
5,Like a new TV GREAT PICTURE with the HDMI cable (cable doesn't come with it)
1,I only needed a basic tuner to get an OTA signal to my Vizio display. Thinking this was a simple task I ordered this product - good price decent reviews. When I got the unit and hooked it up all was well until I tried to use the remote and explore the menu/settings/etc.. Either the remote I received was faulty the IR receiver was faulty or the processor in the box was lifted from an Atari. I'd push a button and have to wait several seconds to know if it registered or not. Trying to type in a channel would result in entering "777" instead of "7" since I had to repeatedly press the number. Trying to navigate the menu was next to impossible. Would not recommend and am returning this item.
5,This item is very reasonably priced and performs as advertised. I am moderately handy and set it up without reading the directions in about 5 minutes. Don't intend to use the record feature so cannot speak to that.
5,Easy installation! It gave me the ability to acquire a tremendous amount of channels having just an antenna did not.
5,easily installed and setup…good picture and color…
5,The picture quality is good and I am very pleased with the sheerness.
1,It does not recognize any external drive on any format through USB. Their customer service responded something like this: "well be happy for what is the way it is".Wasted money again as Amazon already closed the time frame for returning. So many worthless items invading amazon's market.
5,Im sure its good rating were good
5,It’s good buy it
5,Works well.
5,It does what it's set to do.
2,I could not make it to work with the antenna connection to the TV.
1,got this for my mother for her spare room. she just has basic cable no pay stuff.followed setup directions. screen showed it detected the cable tv channels.but when i went to display the channels blank screen.tried setup 4 times no change extremly frustrating since system menudefinity gives choice of cable tv. if its not gonna work with cable tv why give the choice!?its not like im trying to get a pay channel like hbo.returned device for money back.
5,Was easy to install. Quality picture. Many channels found.
3,Doesn’t work with analogy channels
5,Excellent product. Easy to install
1,I bought in Sept. 2021 it stopped working today Jan. 24 2022.  Power supply fine box just dead.  Contacted Amazon they say it's beyond the 3 month warranty return time.  No idea what caused it to stop working no storms/electrical issues just quit working.  Don't think I'll buy this Homeworx brand again.
5,couldn't be happier
5,Works great use with video projector for hi-def picture.
5,Easy to install works perfectly beautiful picture
5,Works perfectly. I am using a coat hanger for an antenna and I get a fair amount of channels.
5,So far so good.  Gave life to an old TV to use in my garage no complaints here.
3,Previous one from the same manufacturer stopped working after 18 months hoping this has long life.
5,This converter box is Well Worth the money and great value . I would definitely recommend this product.
5,It worked right out of the box!
5,purchased for my projector. Works great. Easy install. Easy interface.
5,Easy setup and signal meter to point antenna.
5,Very good product to keep tube TVs going
5,Works fine for me.
2,Still trying to get it to work. Plus No instructions. Please Note: My item was “re-certified” not NEW.I wouldn’t have minded I just hate to be misled (lied to).  Maybe it never worked I dunno.  Will I return it? No.  Just never use these folks again.  Hope your experience is a favorable one.
2,This seemed like the perfect tuner; cheap and feature rich.  But the audio lags behind the video between a quarter second up to a second.  It's fine for watching sports but very weird when seeing people talking on the television.
1,Stopped working 45 days after purchase...worst product evet
5,It is light in weight which makes it easy to connect
1,The converter box worked as advertised for about 6 months.  I used it to display over the air signal to my projector for football games.  Last weekend it wouldn't power on.  It looks like it's outside any warranty that Amazon offers.I'll try my luck with a different brand.
1,Very very poor quality and not enough. channels
5,Works great in the BR. Get a lot of channels.
2,The remote dose not respond too well
1,stopped working in under 15 months.  does not power up.  I would expect it to last a little longer before having to replace.  can I return it for a refund or replacement?
1,The box quickly stopped working and would turn off every few minutes. There’s no way to contact the seller for a replacement.  The remote is very difficult to use as the box isn’t very sensitive and you have to really push hard on the buttons. Very disappointed with this product.
5,Works great. A++ customer service
1,I purchased this converter box so I could watch local tv on my Vizio 4K tv and it works PERFECTLY! I just hooked up the antenna and the HDMI cable (which they don’t provide) to the converter box plugged the HDMI cord into the tv changed my tv’s input and the box immediately guided me through the set up. It ran through the channel scan and boom! I’m watching all the local channels. Highly recommend.UPDATE: Product stopped working about 5 months later.
5,I have a older TV model for my downstairs living room and I love how the box work with the antenna very reliable
5,Took a second to figure out how to delete channels but it also picked up 120 channels
5,Works fine
5,Small box works.perfectly!
5,Works great looks like if I had cable and I have and older model Sony flat screen t.v
5,I liked the product very much
5,Needed a tv tuner for my Vizio E-60 E-3 and that was exactly what I got.
1,Mediasonic is failing to understand customers expect a quality product especially on units that have been through a refurbishment. Tried to set up this converter box for a projector but couldn't even get to step 1: the remote control didn't work! I tried two sets of fresh batteries (confirmed "green" by a battery tester) no joy. Amazon made it right by issuing an immediate refund.
5,Gave up cable got this and it work awesome I get many local channels I never knew were out there. Awesome product
5,Old TV
5,Disliked the remote control had stop working
1,I bought 2 of these and after only 4 months both them have stopped working with in 2 days of each other. They should replace themWhat a waste if money. DO NOT buy theseThey got one star because I had to give it to them
2,Your products do not work without no Internet
5,I was pleased with this unit.  I may end up buying another unit.
2,Product was not what I expected. Didn’t get the same or mail channels than just an antenna alone.  Picture quality was no better than 720.  And then I’m using one more remote to watch tv. Total was up to 4.
5,was quick and easy to install directions clear and direct worked extremely well was delivered promptly
1,This unit only last a month and a half before crapping out.  Before that had issues with sound and video being out of sync.  Would change the channel and it would sync back up.  Tried changing the channel yesterday for this very reason and all of a sudden there is no signal found on all stations.  Tried rebooting and no luck.  Would not recommend.
2,Does not tune in channels.. tried 3 antennas all powered.. nothing worked.
5,Great
1,Worked okay until it broke after 9 months. Audio and video often were out of sync. Won't buy again.
2,This product would probably be perfect if it was Comcast compatible but it’s not so it had to go back - searching for a new one
1,Nothing irks me more than someone trying to pass off a customer return as “new”. As you can see by my photos this box was opened by a customer and the detached flaps of the box were inside the box. I will be returning this. I’m not paying a new price for a used item.
1,This product was knowingly purchased used. However it seems that the previous purchaser returned it with the wrong power adapter. It doesn't even go to this unit. This adapter prong isn't even for USA. It's in Russian. I'm hoping a return and new product  will work.
1,The remote didn’t work great which was frustrating but manageable. Now the box just turns off randomly in the middle of watching tv. Sometimes for seconds sometimes for several minutes.
1,Used for a TV that does not have a built in tuner. Installation is very easy. Signal strength from HD antenna is strong but this tuner frequently loses signal lock resulting in a blank screen. Restores intermittently or by cycling the power. This particular model is not recommended as it does not reliably tune even strong HD antenna signals
1,This is the second and last of these that I will by.The first lasted about a year before it crapped out figured it was a fluke the second only lasted five months.Don't waste you money; cheap Chinese garbage...
5,It works totally great 😊
1,Received it in June 2021 and died in October 2021. Don't waste your money. Follow up: got a new on per warranty and will not turn on in a week just like the first one. POS
1,Dont expect much more than a year of use out of this product. Disappointing
1,Purchased this product in July 2021 by December 2021 it no longer worked. It was great while it lasted but didn't last long at all!
1,i think it works pretty good i just wish i could have one remote for everything instead of having two because i cant find a universal code for the remoteUpdate after having it for a while it leaves the TV green do you have to always press either channel but and or volume button in order to have the TV and proper color don’t bother find a better one
5,Works perfectly
1,No picture could not get it to do anything but power up
1,My unit may have been defective. The power plug did not sit well since the initial use and would occasionally and unexpectedly reset power. It seemed like only a minor inconvenience for low priced TV receiver but eventually it stopped working altogether. Too bad because I liked the software and it worked very well when it did work!
5,Works great
5,It works great and the picture is excellent.
1,Works ok. Wish it would have came with better instructions. Also there is pretty noticable lag between the audio and video.UPDATE: The favorite channels that I have designated as favorites keeps disappearing. So many times that I have given up on having a favorite channels feature lol. Next time I think I will spend a little more to get some quality. This is garbage.
5,I like that it is simple to install and use.
1,Very glitchy.  Loses signal quite a bit while other TVs on the same antenna are perfect  I’ve had to unplug and restart it 3 times since I’ve installed 12 hours ago. May send back
2,Didn't bring in our local channels
5,On time and everything we're great
5,Perfect size light and reliable
1,Junk didn’t work right out of the box ! Not gonna even bother doing an exchange cuz will get another pile of junk ! This seller should be removed from Amazon for selling products they know is junk ! Returning this trash
1,I am not happy with this product at all. The main thing was the remote. It worked for about 2 mins and then stopped working all together. Waste of time waste of money
5,I like everything about this product.
1,Intermittent problem changing channels and transparent tinted face plate is super annoying with bight red/green LED.  Try sleeping at night with that thing blaring at you!
1,Failed after 5 months. Started switching channels randomly until it lost video with audio only. Currently waiting to hear from Mediasonix to see if they will replace it under their warranty.
1,Purchased this item to record sports over the air.  It consistently stops recording for no apparent reason.  Buy a different Make/Model.
1,Only worked for 8 months now does not get power. Tried different cords but still no power.
5,Very satisfied
5,works great
1,I used this box with a tube tv and the noise in the audio is louder that the actual audio do not buy. This is caused by improper RF shielding in the tuner from cheap construction.
5,Awesome
1,Cheap looking. Didn’t work.
5,Muy bueno
1,Just didnt work. Had to press control buttons repeatedlly. It would find channels and then couldn' save channels. Bad picture quality or no picture at all
1,Terrible. Complete waste of money. Worked poorly to begin with (very slow response remote difficult to get a signal from) then stopped working altogether just out of the return period. Remanufactured junk. No wonder Amazon recommends it.
1,The remote did not work even with new batteries.  Instructions are poorly written there is no explanation for how to sync your TV with local channels.  Pressed "menu" button and nothing happens.  Pressed several other buttons and nothing happens.
2,Obviously a used product missing cable.but it works .
1,Unit stoped working in 3 days. Forgot to return it in time. Amazon sent me another and charged me for both. Now I can’t return the broken one
1,Worked fine for a few months then quit working. Won’t power up even with a new power adapter.
1,I've been having issues with this system.  It shuts off by itself periodically and does not come back on unless i unplug it in and out.  I missed the window of return but I would not recommend this item.
1,After six months video is no longer working.  Need to reboot the box when video went out.  Such a PIA.
1,Don’t last long . Just about 6 months .
1,Its junk 1st one ..remote stop working after a few months so being a moron purchased another one burned again..it blinks on and out even when programming this one worked about 6 weeks.
1,Ridiculous bought this product doesn't work and the power cord doesn't even fit
1,pulled in 4 religious stations. Didnt pull in any HD stations
1,About this product tryed it would not even function properly Too small too light weight really not worth the money and the time trying to purchase this unit. This is why am giving one star.
1,Don’t waste your money. I hooked this up and within 5 minutes it was shot! Poor value stay away from this!
1,We got less channels with it than without it. We live in rural area that maybe why.
1,Didn't even last 6 months. Just completely stopped working.
1,Broke with only a couple of uses
1,It was much smaller than I thought it looked online but it's better that way and it works just fine no complaints
1,This tv box is not work in smart TV or any other smart  device  and I use in my garage  and over heat
1,Everything was fine with the product UNTIL it keep cutting off and on by itself and it was VERY FRUSTRATING ESPECIALLY when I was watching something good!
1,This did not work on my TV.
1,All the channels were scrambled. Never worked properly
1,Junk connections are loose and crappy .
1,This does not work at all case and point it's a scam
1,duro menos de tres mese y el soporte técnico del vendedor es muy pecimo no te resuelven gaste mi dinero.
1,This box doesn't work for Cuba or out of USA
1,Remote was dead on arrival.  The device can not tune to channels with out the remote working.
1,Lasted a month junk
1,The media could not be loaded.
1,worked for one day
1,Worked for less than 6months before it stopped functioning.  What a waste of money.
1,nothing it didn't work so i sent it back
1,Lasted less than 4 months and died.
1,Cheap enough but only lasted a month.
1,Did not pick up any stations. JUNK!
1,After scanning multiple times still only found 22 channels
1,the tuner is very poor at locking onto stations.
1,It's  cheap junk.
1,Keep looking.  Cheap.
1,I run a projector for tv and need this for local football games. These get used 20 times or less each year for 3 hours at a time. They ALL break after a year or two. Every single model every single time. Pay for the 3 year warranty and save yourself a little coin because these are all throw away items.
1,Sucks
1,Their website says to send email with photo of serial number etc and they will send the latest download but the email receives a mail delivery notice saying "Message Blocked". My unit is not working with an outdated firmware and is now worthless.
2,UPDATE: It's the wall wart that died borrowed a 5V power supply and the box worked again.  Now to buy a power supply to replace the dead one.Purchased on wife's account she doesn't like me to write bad reviews on her account.Converter worked fine gathered in a ton of OTA digital channels.  Then today it stopped working 13 months after we bought it.  Of course the warranty expired a month ago.  Wall wart putting out 5V I put new batteries in the remote no power light.  Broke the box apart to see that I'm getting 2V at the power input slot so something inside must have died and is sucking the 5V power down to 2V so it won't work.Maybe some other manufacturer can make something that will last longer...
2,i have bought one of these in the past also .All of these boxes seem to use the same hardware . I'm on my 7th one in 3 years .  they all overheat and eventually crap out after a few months.  Can't get the Koramzi one off military time for show times.  Flash drives eventually go bad in them . Recording times act up etc.  Anything you can think of that can go bad with these pieces of crap will. Luckily I only use these to watch a few shows that come on regular tv . Other than that I suggest Roku box and utilize a couple of streams. I use Amazon Prime and Netflix.  will.
2,I purchased mine in January 2020. Last month it just quit working.  While it did work I was able to pull in asian stations OAN station NBC Quest and several shopping type stations.  I was also able to pull in several Spanish-speaking stations those seem to come in the clearest but I couldn’t understand them.  Setting up was pretty basic I never utilized the DVR portion of it.  I cut the cable cord years back I don’t plan on going back to cable.  In short I was pretty much limited to two or three stations I enjoyed watching I never knew there was so much gold hunting going on in Australia or that Rick‘s Restorations did so much work.  I also noticed that the types of commercials advertised on over the air signals are a lot different than the ones advertised on cable TV and…that JJ Walker dude got old (his commercials seemed nonstop) but he still says Dynomite!!I plan on getting another but I won’t be going through this company. Maybe this is something that happens in general I don’t know but it sucked when it did.
2,The channel changing is very slow.  When you type in a channel number it takes about 5 seconds to change channels.  You can't edit or remove the channels that you don't want in your channel menu either.  You're stuck with them.  I've had better digital boxes. 2 stars
1,I have had this converter box for less than a year just like the previous converter box...my flat screen TV does not have a tuner built into it and can not select channels I refuse to buy a brand new television just so the indoor/outdoor antenna will work.... so a converter box is necessary....none of the converter boxes that are on the market today last for more than a year and a half to two years period and it’s not fair that The manufacturers of these converter boxes make them so that they break in such a short amount of time and you have to spend more money on another one
2,Purchase June 8 2020 The remote burned up buyers beware! My background is electronics.All of these are made in China and quality is hit and miss unfortunately I need one for my projector. I’m trying a different vendor maybe I’ll have better luck. But Mediasonic 2 stars.
1,This thing sometimes works which could give some the impression that it's worth twenty bucks. But the instructions dont explain half the functions which cannot be used anyway. The clock can't be set manually and remains incorrect after daylight savings time on all channels (there isn't a daylight saving function) and other things just dont make sense. You press "hold" to increase picture size and "epg" to erase a recording. Not intuitive. It drops recordings for no apparent reason. Of course you have to buy a separate hard drive to even make it work. I'm about to trash this thing. Not ready for prime time.
4,I was looking to "improve" my computer room by being able to hook up a digital antenna to my monitor. Since a computer monitor does not have a tuner built in I had to find a work around. This is where I landed.The Mediasonic does exactly what I need it to do. It is a digital tuner that has HDMI out so it can be hooked up to a monitor. You can also hook up a hard drive and record your favorite shows. That is a definite plus. The channels come in at HD quality but you also have to make sure you have an HD digital antenna also.One of the only downfalls is the "software". When trying to change channels or go into menus there is sometimes a lag. The channel could be changed but it doesn't change right away so you click it again and the channel changes twice. It is not ideal but at this price point I can understand.
3,Haven't got it to work. Whoever picks up items you want to return and I haven't been able to catch each other at the right time for me to return it. It could be my antenna or the area. Who knows???
5,Setup and working perfect. Very pleased.
5,Easy set up and works as advertised
5,Works great like if you buy a good antenna. Love the remote feature to control volume level through the box and not directly through the TV.
5,I tried one and liked it so had an associate order two for his needs.  Before finding this converter I had been using professional demodulators to receive off-air signals for a (broadcast) Emergency Action System installation.  Had paid as much as $2300 for one in the past.  These converters are essentially a TV receiver for digital television signals.  They offer an antenna-type output which can be used with older analog TVs as one would expect.  They also have analog video and stereo audio outputs.  In these installations I use the video output to feed a cheap TV and split the stereo audio outputs so that it feeds both the audio inputs of the TV and the audio inputs of the EAS system.  That allows verification that the proper channel is being monitored.  Depending on the brand of the EAS system it may be necessary to combine the L/R outputs and add an inexpensive audio power amplifier to have enough audio gain to satisfy the EAS equipment.  Performance is more than adequate to the task and the low price makes it reasonable to stock a spare.
5,Works as it should. No problems
5,I have a couple older TVs to use outdoors and in the garage I use this digital box with an outdoor antenna and it is unbelievable save so much money and it works perfect !!!!!
1,Highly disappointed died after one week!
5,Excellent product for the money if you need to use it for HDTV TV reception when used with a good amplified antenna (this is not included) does great job and easy setup i’m using it on a 4k smart TV.
1,The speakers work well but the video is washed out.Adjustments are useless and image quality is washed out.
5,Endless options to chose from and alot of it is free. I love it no more cable bill.
3,I disconnected my cable TV and switched to digital antenna and needed this for an older LED TV that had a faulty coax input. I ran the antenna coax into this converter box so I could plug into the HDMI input on the TV. The other newer TV that is on direct coax never has audio delay issues but this one with the converter box will have delays if I don't turn off and turn on the converter (takes about 10-15 seconds) every other day. It's not a huge issue but just annoying when you turn on the TV ready to watch then notice the audio delay.
1,It didn’t work!
5,Wow
4,This is a no frills device that works well converting your digital antenna signal to HDMI output. The UI isn’t the prettiest or most intuitive but it does the job.
4,Good value and it works what else can be asked for.
5,This is a compact unit that converted my old analog tv to digital when using an antenna. It sits well on top of my tv & the remote works well.
4,Used TV antenna connector for sat and converter for over the air signal.
5,Works great to get digital signal to an older television. This converter box picked upMore channels than just hooking up a new tv to the same antenna.
3,No codes to program a TV and functions are slow to respond but works great and picture quality is perfect just adjusting to slow programming
5,Bought 2 of these. Great for the money. No complaints at all
5,Great quality
5,Love it
5,It has been great!  Great purchase
5,Satisfied...easy to install easy to use easy to record what you want.
5,I cut the cord and bought a good HD antenna.  I connected the antenna to 4 tv's in the house.  THe signal was too weak so I did buy a booster which solved the problem for 3 out of my 4 tv's.  However the 4th tv which unfortunately is my main tv in the living room was a 2007 plasma Samsung tv.  Great tv by the way but I was unable to get any channels because my new antenna picked up HD channels and the tv could not decode those.  I called Samsung customer support and they were of no help so I did some reading and found out that the local network channels switched systems in around that time so the old tv's are UNABLE to decode them without this a STB (set top box).  This one was cheap so I figured I'd give it a try.So far it works perfectly.  If it craps out in a year or so I'll just buy another. Sure beats $50 per month to pay for cable for the basic channels that you can get for free.Installation:Connect antenna to input of box.  HDMI cable from box to tv.  That is all you need.  Very simple.  WHen you are on your tv you need to go to the hdmi port of course and use the remote provided to change channels once you have scanned in the channels.Hope this helps.
5,So this box plugs into hdmi or rca plugs is the solution to a smart tv without a coaxial plug.
5,We wanted to access local stations to supplement our Streaming devices.  All of our TVs but one had digital tuners in them so all I needed was a digital antenna. I live outside Nashville a ways and it is hilly.  Those digital antennae you put on the wall or in a window don't work well at a distance or thru brick walls.  I have a steep roof and did not want to deal with roof mount.  I got an antenna that could be mounted on a roof or in the attic.  I mounted it in the attic at the highest point.  A shingled roof does not interfere much at all.  I ran the antenna coax to an already installed splitter that used to be used for cable.  That meant I already had coax into most rooms.  I ran channel scans on the TVs and all the local stations and then some were found.  Had a Great HD picture.So now I needed to deal with my last 4K TV that did not have a TV tuner nor did it have a coax connection.  This is why I researched and bought this Mediasonic ATSC Digital Converter Box with a TV Tuner.  And here is the feedback:Received it in one day.  Packaged nicely.  Had all the parts and instructions.  The instructions looked complete but I did not need them for the quick setup.  I hooked the converter via coax to the antenna in the attic.  Plugged an HDMI cable into the TV from the convertor.  I turned it on and ran the channel scan.  I picked up 70 stations a pleasant surprise.  The HD picture is great and the response from the remote is fine.  I love having the channel guide.  I would buy it again and do recommend it.  I think most of the reception issues have nothing to do with the product.  It is all about the antenna and connections.  Attic or Roof mount antenna is the best route.  Beware of the cheap digital antenna you put on the wall or counter.  Those might work in the city.
1,Crappy not worth the money
5,This one works good get all channels
4,This product works fine for basic TV watching with the ability to pause. I wouldn’t buy this for much more then that. The recording functionality technically works but it makes Plex’s DVR functionality (which for some time has been a bit behind) look incredible. I’m a CS grad and I find the interface to schedule a recording confusing and awful. It lacks any sort of unified guide which is seriously annoying (yes there are technical limitations with ATSC guide data but it’s still possible and something my old Panasonic from 2012 could do). It also is not always in time shift mode so there is a significant delay when the pause button is pressed until it pauses and no ability to make it permanently enabled. The included remote also leaves a lot to be desired and most of the buttons on it are pointless (and it lacks any sort of learn function for TV power on/off).Having said all that for the price of the unit plus a 32gb usb stick prices in for pausing/rewind buffer it is very good. I find it works excellent for an older TV with either a poor quality ATSC tuner or else just for adding the ability to pause to older devices. Compared to my 2019 Sony it’s reception strength is as good and the picture obviously identical. Very low power draw and small size with HDMI coax and composite video. The fact that it doesn’t require internet and pulls guide data from the ATSC broadcast is nice for those who don’t have internet or traveling.TLDR: Great converter box with the ability to pause for short breaks. Not really what I’d call a DVR (or at least not one I’d enjoy having to use).
5,The first converter box we had died after three years (not bad for the price paid) but it was a NIGHTMARE to set up and I dreaded going through that again! This converter is so simple to set up my 1 year old granddaughter could do it (granted she is very intelligent!). Connect the cables plug it in turn it on (put batteries in the remote first!!) choose "channel search" from the menu that automatically shows on the TV when you turn everything on and enjoy watching many channels clearly once the search phase completes! I am SUPER happy with this purchase and the price.
1,I purchased two converter boxes on March 18 2021 & one box WILL NOT TURN ON as of July 16 2021. The box eventually did turn back on weeks later but two days before Christmas both of my boxes won't turn on and as of January 12 2022 I HAVE TWO NON WORKING CONVERTER BOXES. Extremely disappointed with this product.
4,This is a great tuner for a non RF input monitor. Makes great pictures on my 65" Vizio. Remote is overly complicated but usable
5,It was just what I needed for the excersice room but moving it around to face different areas has loosened plug in to box for the electric outlet. Easy to replace.👌 Worth every penny.
5,It works. If you are in an area that received Over the Air broadcast tv this box plus an antenna and hdmi cable will turn your computer monitor (with hdmi in and audio out) into a TV. Or you can use the white red yellow L/R/Video cables. Note I used a powered antenna placed outdoors for better reception.
4,Cheap and reliable
5,After the tuner on my Viso 2 year old TV stopped working. I bought this connected to the HDM OUT PUT and my TV works great.
5,The only dislike is the remote in channel selection rather slow...but functional...I had another brand could scan easily but the unit only lasted 6months ...this my second one I've purchased. Added a basement tv with Amazon Firestick works Great together with a rca yagi antenna I get allThe digital channels in the North San Diego area and LA area as well ! Great product!
5,GREAT!!!!!!!!!  I feel this one will be a winner the last ones were not well made different company's but made the same.YUK!  So far so good.
5,I love this product for my nonSmart TV.  Easy install-less than 30 minutes!
5,I like it it works perfectly
5,I just set this up for my mom and she loves it all you need is an antenna though but if you live in california you can get a cheap dtv antenna for 2.99 so i got that and it worked with the dtv box flawlessly. Tip: you can set it to channel 3/4 OR you have to change the input to AV to get it working. For me i changed the input to AV since the channel 3/4 option didnt work for the Vizio tv my mom has in her room. Great buy will buy again.
