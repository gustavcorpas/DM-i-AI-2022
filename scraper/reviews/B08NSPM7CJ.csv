5,Like the quality
5,the sound quality is very good. I used this for my old car's tape aux and it works well.
4,The adapter sounds great but when using iPhone compatible Bose Noise Cancelling earbuds the volume and stop/start/skip controls do not function.
5,I don't normally leave reviews but I wanted to share this one piece of information regarding this lightning to 3.5mm headphone jack.  This dongle works great for all aspects of the iphone EXCEPT the dongle will NOT allow you to use a wired headphone with microphone during a phone call.  The mic and headset will work perfectly for recording memos on the iphone teams meetings skype discord anything else involving a wired headset with mic but NOT during a phone call.  The description of the dongle after realizing this spells out all the wonderfulness that this dongle does do with music functionality so I assumed that it would work with phone calls but it does not.  I missed the return window and spent a lot of time googling causes for headsets not to work and opened a ticket with apple before realizing that I missed the description not saying that it allows for phone call operation (works for any other functionality as I mentioned above but not phone calls).  I assumed with the "Apple MFi Certified" notice that phone functionality was included but my mistake.  5 minutes before writing this review I saw in the questions section that they confirmed that this didn't work on phone calls.  All other aspects on the iPhone this dongle works wonderfully just wish I'd realized before purchasing that it didn't work on phone calls and I've missed the return window.
3,Last one only last 6 months losing sound. Other wise worked well. Giving it one more shot.
3,The adapter works great and sound is good but it’s not very durable. I dropped my phone from about 4ft and it didn’t even land on the adaptor at all but it snapped the lightning part right off. Fortunately it didn’t get stuck in my phone.
5,I purchased an inexpensive karaoke basic karaoke set that needs to be connected to a device and speakers.  I figured I can use my phone or laptop as a device but needed an adapter.  These work well.  I also have been using them to connect my wired headset to my old headphones and now I can watch kdrama without bothering my family :D
2,Works fine -- unless like everyone else you're using a case. Then the jack is just barely long enough to go in all the way. Just walking around it slips out enough to stop play. Immensely annoying.Too bad; the sound is fine.
2,Worked great on my iphone 11 until it stopped working. Now it's too late to return it. Maybe that's why they give you two!
5,They work
1,I have had this product for about eight hours.This product was easily one of the worst Apple accessories I’ve ever bought. Despite coming in a two-pack light use (AKA. Plugging in AUX headphones into my iPhone and listening to music with my headphones on as I walk around my home) was enough to snap the Lightning Cord Tip of the one that was functioning.YES the *One* that was functioning. The other despite no visible damage to the outside refused to work with any of my AUX headphones and was thus put back into it’s packaging.Out of the one that was functioning I suffered numerous compatibility issues which is a phrase I would never imagine uttering from my mouth about HEADPHONES. My AUX earbuds which I have never had an issue with and continue to not have an issue with only play in one ear. My normal brand of headphones in the twenty dollar range are impossible to listen to music on as the iPhone recognizes it as constantly lowering the volume. My more expensive pair of headphones which I have never had an issue with including on offical-brand iPhone AUX to Lightning Cord adapters— need to be nudged constantly to make sure it continues to play on both ears.This product is a scam and I’m requesting a refund.
5,Exactly what I wanted
3,The product does not work as well as the Apple brand.  I always have to wiggle it to connect well.  I should have returned it but unfortunately I didn't
2,Please don't waist your money...they worked only 2-4 weeks each
2,This dongle goes from volume level 1 to 4. There is no in between so I am doubtful of the Apple certification. I tried it with different headphones and they all had the same issue. Don’t recommend if you listen to things on low/med volume.
5,Good Quality works as advertised.
3,It's all right. It's great that they have a 2pk because one of the adapters didn't work at all and has faulty wiring. Other than that one the second one still works and I haven't had any issues with it.
3,As titld
3,Although this works fine with video and music I could not get it to work with phone calls
2,On 2022 iPhone SE ear bud volume control doesn’t work. Also I have to use the lowest volume since phone doesn’t recognize it’s pushing to earbuds. Also per desc mic on calls don’t work. Might work for car jack but get lightning earbuds instead of this.
2,So I had for two days and it broke off in my iPhone
2,No disrespect to the dealer but these adapters don’t work very well when they do work. The connection does not fit right and you have to constantly move them around to reestablish sound any little movement and you lose sound.  I used them on my Apple ear phones not some cheap headsets and they don’t seem to be very compatible. I didn’t send them back only because it wasn’t worth the effort.
5,Acctually works with iPhone 11 cause my other one would just shut off the music since it was not mfi certified
2,This will not work during a phone call.  If you are just needing it for listening to music you may find this to be a useful cheaper alternative to the Apple Brand.  However if you are hoping to use them to plug in headphones to make phone calls this will NOT work.
1,They claim to be Apple certified but they just do not work with my iphone.  While on a phone conversation the other party can hear me but I cannot hear a thing.  I tried this on 2 different earphones with the same result.  Don't waste your money.
1,These worked for about 3 days then the sound started to get robotic with glitches. After another day they said product not supported and didn’t work at all.
5,Perfecto
5,No complaints from me
3,Started having sound cut off from headset I think it’s not as durable as I was hoping but decent value for the price of two
2,iPhone SE 2020 here. It works for music.  It stops working when you make a call! The SE has the same chipset as what's inside the phones listed in this item`s description.  This is my work phone and I don't even use it for music or videos.  Disappointed.
1,It won't accept audio at all or it just isn't compatible for calls. Using it with my aux cord for calls was one of the primary reasons for getting it. It's not fulfilling a core function i need with headphones that it's supposed to work for. I'm now borrowing my sisters OEM one...
1,I played one of the things in my phone and it was not working correctly it would skip through videos pause the video and it just wouldn’t work
2,I bought these to be able to use headphones when I am on the phone but they do not work for that purpose. I can listen to music from my phone using this adapter but as soon as I call somebody the phone does not recognize it as an option. So if you just need it to listen to music in the car go for it but if you want to talk on the phone keep searching.
2,One adapter broke the first time I used it. The other seemed fine but returned them as a set.The metal part that inserts in the phone separated from the rubber cord.
3,Good quality but it doesn’t work while making a call.
2,Sturdy and works decent if you are just listening to music. Does create the occasional glitch-sound. But does NOT work if you are connecting this to a wired microphone for recording/podcasting.
1,The adapters worked fine but both of them broke within a month. Don’t waste your money on this trash unless you want to have to replace them every two months.
1,The lightening connector is not durable enough to use.  Both of the connectors broke off in my phone at the point where the connector meets the phone within an hour of use.
5,Muy bueno el producto
1,I have not ever bought these from you’ll before and want ever again one did not work the other one lasted 1 week. My grandson told me he had the same problem to not to order electric devices from you’ll. I want ever order this item again
1,I purchased and had to return this item.  They do not work like genuine Apple adapters.  The iPhone does not recognize it and will not allow you to route calls via headset on it.  Not sure why though.
1,These seemed like a cheap alternative to the original Apple adapters with faster shipping but they are completely useless and a waste of money. To start they constantly cut out it’s almost like the phone doesn’t recognize the headphones as being connected. I’m still using original Apple headphones but this adapter causes the cut out constantly and make them borderline impossible to use. However I managed to make it work for about a week before the lightning connector broke off in my phone. I am not rough on the product my previous Apple adapter lasted for nearly a year before needing to replaced but these didn’t even last a week. Just buy the real thing and you will save yourself so much headache and money in the long run.
1,Tried both of these adapters and both had the same set of problems:1. The aux receiver on this adapter doesn't accept the aux prong properly. It allows the prong to go in too far. It will not make a connection unless you pull it out slightly which means that the slightest pressure will break the connection again. You can use it as long as you don't move even a little bit.2. The lightning jack is loose. Even if it clicks it'll release with very little pressure. I tried this on an iPhone 12 Pro and an iPhone SE and both had this issue.3. All the plastic on the adapter is loose. There is a plastic enclosure around the end of the lightning cable; you can slide this off with your hand.The whole thing is garbage.
1,My wife & I got iPhone 11's recently and she really needed a way to use her corded earpods at work. I figured I can also make use of my old corded pods at a work station I have so I jumped on this pair of adapters. BIG MISTAKE. I normally scour the reviews before any purchase but the tiny price caught me like a glittery lure. Any stream plays for @3min and shuts down. NO idea why. All I know is EVERY other way I run my music on any device there are no issues. Plug this thing in and you get 5min tops before it stalls out every 30sec. Faulty terminal connections?  Imbedded malware chip? Who knows? A full week of diagnostic behavior and I don't care any more. I'd say **** the $4 but I'm so incensed now I want it back.
2,I have actually bought this item twice. I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt and try again. However the first time it just stopped working after a couple uses. The second one broke off in my phone after the second use. The third only played out of one side. And the fourth didn’t work at all. I don’t recommend
1,Maybe it was my fault for purchasing them in the first place but these adapters BOTH BROKE in less than 5 minutes *total*Again both of them broke in less than a combined 5 minutes. I did not realize quality could get so poor.
1,Avoid this product I had another aux to lightening converter that worked great. This one is cheaply made does not fully connect with my iPhone and regularly disconnects. Obviously just a poorly made Chinese product. Order from somewhere else.
1,You can pause your music but can’t play it. No volume control the 1st one broke the day of and there big and chunky. Just pay the extra and get the apple one. DONT CHEAP OUT.
1,I had this plugged into my iPhone and after two days of use the usb part separated from the cable. I have already wasted my money on this product so I am writing this help everyone else avoid wasting their money.
5,These are not genuine Apple accessories but for less than 1/2 the price of an Apple product it works just fine on my kids iphone se and iphone xr devices.
5,The product works perfectly for what I needed. The sound quality is great fits my devices great and the price can’t be beat!
1,Do you want a low-pitched hiss when listening to music?Would you like your "Apple Certified" accessory to have zero microphone capability?Aren't willing to spend $1 more for an actual Apple licensed product?Well then ladies and gentlemen boys and girls I present to you this garbage product. You're gonna love the way that it feels when you're out a few bucks for absolutely no reason at all. Absolutely stunning and brave.
1,One was crushed and the other wouldn’t even properly fit a headphone jack
1,This adapter would not connect an external microphone (Purple Panda lavalier) to my iPhone.  I purchased a two-pack of these adapters and tested both.  No joy with either.  When I contacted Purple Panda tech support they suggested I purchase the "official" adapter from Apple.  I did so and it worked flawlessly.  I'm pretty sure the problem lies with the design of these adapters (rather than me receiving two defective ones).  Accordingly the manufacturer should include some verbiage like "Will not work to connect an external microphone".  I'm not sure what "Apple MFi Certified" means but apparently it does not mean: "Works the same as the 'official' apple adapter".
1,This did not work with the iPad. I kept to then use on my phone —- it broke on the FIRST USE. The piece that goes into my phone broke off- and I had to dig it out. Not worth potentially damaging your phone!
1,In the pack of two one already didn't work when I opened the package (had already missed the return window because of a delay in getting my new iphone so couldn't test them earlier) the other one has broken after just one month of regular use. and the volume control never worked with multiple pairs of headphones only the stop/start function. very disappointed.
1,Don’t buy if you need for phone calls. They don’t work. But they work for music.
1,Both of these adapters Broke at the iPhone connector on the 1st use! I do put my phone in my pocket upside down so the connector is up total lack of engineering quality control management on behalf of this manufacturer.
1,Wanted this to work longer than it did tip off inside my phone! Only had for a little longer than month and now is it’s a wrap…. Buyer be aware!
1,This adapter works fine if you have it plugged in before you initiate a call.  However it will not work on a received call (even if it was already plugged in) and will not work if plugged in mid-call.  I have purchased other adapters that work fine if plugged in mid-call or on received calls.
1,The adapter broke in my phone after 3 uses on my treadmill.
1,Too stiff not flexible like OEM. Does not stay in phone. I threw them both in the garbage.
1,First one broke witching the same day I first used it AND the metal part got stuck in my phone. Second one broke within a few days and just gave out on me and didn’t work. Before they broke I realized that I can’t use my headphone controls with these such as changing the volume or pausing my music. They also for some reason don’t allow you to have audio if you’re on a phone call or FaceTime. You can hear the other person but the other person can’t hear you. Don’t waste your money like I did seriously these were the worst.
2,stop functioning in less than a month and cant receive calls.
1,Didn’t like that it was broken they both were broken and a waste of my time and money I don’t think I get another one of those
2,The plastic on the lightning end shifts on first use. Helps with the fit into phone with case but makes it feel cheap. The product does work as intended.
1,Idk how this has the rating it has - all you see are negative reviews w all the usual issues - drops out breaks one side etcWas drop outs for meReturning them and I highly recommend you do the same. If Amazon keeps having to deal w returns on low quality products they will be more likely to solve the problem on a larger scaleAMAZON - idk if they paid you to juice ratings but you’re losing money dealing w the returns. Don’t make a market for garbage. Think about all the waste…
5,The perfect one
5,Fit perfectly and works great just what I needed.
1,I purchased this to go with my new remote work head set. I couldn’t get the sound to come through. I switched and tried the second one same no sound to the headset. I was getting ready to return the new head set because I thought it was defective and I decided to try my actual adapter that came with a old Iphone. And the headset worked perfectly with my old adaptor that is actually a Apple product. I am glad that my headset works but disappointed that this product don’t.
1,These connectors are of poor quality. I have to pushed it hard into the headphone connector to hear any sound. If I let go it won't connect. Don't waste your money.
1,I am very disappointed in the quality of this product. I bought them several years ago and they were the same then as well. They don't work. You can hear no midrange when using them and the make a fuzz sound the whole time. These can't be Apple certified because Apple would never allow this junk. Both times bought these things (the second time it was a mistake as they changed the name of them on Amazon) they didn't work. Stay away or as I did buy the expensive but working Apple Official ones of these. Those work really well. DON'T BUY THESE!
1,The dongle didn't have enough space or wasn't built correctly to properly fit the audio jack
1,These are garbage. We recently upgraded to iphone 12s and wanted a cheap way to continue to use our wired earbuds on the plane but didn't have a lot of time to read reviews (which I normally thoroughly do). After just a day or two I noticed the connection would seem slightly faulty and you could unplug/replug the adapter from the phone and it would fix itself but a couple of weeks in the high pitched static they emit is constant and can't be fixed making them unusable. It isn't the earbuds themselves because they work fine plugged into other things without the adapter.
1,I am rarely ever motivated to write a product review but these are just absolutely horrible to the highest magnitude.  On the rare occasion these actually work they give awful sound quality.  Numerous times I’ve tried to listen to music and these will become disconnected from the slightest jostle and blast what I was listening to for everyone to hear.  Even further these do not look like their pictures.  They are obviously cheap knock offs.  Just shell out the money for something that actually comes from apple.
2,comes unplugged if you move your phone or the cord even a tiny bit. I have other brands of this and they do not do that. not worth money
1,I even tried both in case one was simply defective. These cables do not work with iPhone 11pro. do not buy these. Yes you'll save some dough but you'll just have to take atrip to the UPS store to retunr these. Save the gas and buy well I dunno yet. I'm going to try another brand wish me luck.
1,Very quickly after beginning to use this item the lightning plug part of it broke off in my phone. Seemed to be a good item but with part breaking off not so good. The adapter I bought at Walmart works way better than this one.
1,Plugged my headphones into the adapter and into my iPhone. Sounded weird and echoey like it was miles away. The headphones work fine otherwise so this adapter does not work well.
1,Absolute worthless garbage. A 100% waste of money. I’d send it back but I’d already taken it out of the packaging and thrown it away. Was using these with apple headphones and the sound comes through crackly but if you manipulate the connection you can yet it clear. But trying to take a call with them and you can’t hear the person on the other line at all. They now crackle constantly. A total waste of money. DO NOT BUY.
1,I used this to connect my phone to the aux cord in my car. I was very careful with it and it really didn’t experience much wear and tear. The first one started creating loud popping noises only a couple weeks after I started using it. Hoping it was just a fluke I connected the second one and after just a few weeks it began to do the same thing. Super disappointed in this product.
1,The audio didn't work when using
1,Product broke during my first use
1,They seemed to work for a short period but the connection is loose and will cause the music to pause and unpause randomly and cause the sound to glitch out unfortunately this renders them pretty much useless
1,Wanted to use this to plug my wired earbuds into my relatively new iPhone 12 Pro Max. All I get is some static and then silence. The earbuds are new and work fine otherwise.
1,it barely connects to my phone and when it does if you move it even slightly it kicks itself from the device. cannot be used when moving at all. one of them broke when i tried putting it in my pocket and i had to use tweezers to get it out of the port. horrible quality
1,Ordered the two pack and neither worked. My earbuds were brand new Apple earbuds and neither of these lightning connectors worked. It appears that this was due to poor craftsmanship on the connector. I always questioned whether I should pay the ridiculous prices that Apple charges for cables but at least they work. Am returning both of these and purchasing their Apple counterparts.
1,My daughter started using one Easter Day and within 10 mins it stopped working and I had to give her the 2nd one that came with the order it hasn’t broke yet thankfully.
1,They keep saying not supported so I have to flip it thrn it will work for a minute then say not supported again. Very frustrating
1,This item is terrible. both adapters broke within minutes or hours of use. The first one broke after just three hours of use any part that goes into the charger port snapped off and was stuck inside of my phone. The second one broke within three minutes of use after I removed it from my phone and went to put it back in. Will not buy again. These items are trash.
1,The cable itself if so thick and low quality that if you bend it to far accidentally it'll break the internal wiring and you'll be sitting down for two hours wondering if your headphones need to be replaced. If you can keep track and easily manage the dongle and not put it in your pocket or let it drop then it's fine. Other than that just buy the one directly from apple.
2,even though they may look like apple they’re not they don’t even feel like apple
1,I bought these to use for listening to YouTube tutorials other various talking only sources. I couldn’t hear at all. They are a waste of money.  Don’t even bother especially if you want them for talking on the phone or music. They don’t live up to the description at all.
1,Only 1 of the 2 adapters I purchased works.  Audio Jack does not seat properly in the other one loud pops and cracks when audio jack inserted and sound plays intermittently.  Any movement of the cord and audio fails through the bad connection.  The 2nd adapter works fine but paying for 2 to get 1 working adapter isn’t my idea of a quality product or fair deal.
1,Unfortunately I had to give this product a one star review. It wasn’t compatible with my iPhone 11 or my friends iPhone. Did not work at all with my other accessories. It sounded good because I could get two generic ones for the price of an Apple adapter. So of course I bought the Apple accessory and it works just fine.
1,I tried using this for my car's aux port. It worked fine for awhile only sounded weird if you really moved it around in the port. Yes the error message did pop up but it didn't stop me from using it. Just recently it became sensitive to movement and wouldn't work unless I held it in my hand. So this isn't a good product at all. It should be worth 1 dollar for 1 cable it feels cheap and doesn't last.
1,After just a month with minimal usage both jacks ended up not making proper contact with the iPhone jack no matter how you try to move it around in the jack to make contact.
1,Please do not buy this product. I paired these with a premium headphone that worked with a different adapter. It’s bad.
1,They started out great when i got them not even a week in the first one stopped working entirely tried another phone too nothing. Okay fine i bought a two pack for a reason. The second one didn’t even work. Needless to say your better off buying the name brand Apple one for a little more money cause at least that one will work for a long time.
1,I was only able to use each for 1 day. For the first one the sound only worked when being held a certain way. Otherwise it sounded tinny… started using the second one the next day moved and the lightening plug broke off. I’m going to be requesting a refund once I figure out how…
2,Poor connection from her headphone. Only one side of the audio works. Amazing junk.
1,The package has 2 one took forever to charge the phone and the other did not work and ipad was giving non stop intermitted beeps.  I was afraid it would damage phone or ipad
1,This product is garbage. I don’t understand why a company would waste money manufacturing this other than to scam people. The lightning cable connector sit loose inside of my iphone port and would need to literally be manually held in the perfect place in order to get mediocre audio quality.
1,Does not work when calling. Only worked for sound play from apps that too keeps making kirkir sound disturbance. I tried on iphone11 and my phone is brand new.
1,When I got these adapters one of them didn’t work at all and the other had a buzzing sound when it was plugged in. These are not made by apple or mifi certified they are cheap knockoffs. Do not buy.
1,When using 3.5mm earbuds with mic this product will not work for phone calls. Audio works when listening to music or video but if you try to use both audio and mic (for phone calls) it does not work.
1,LISTEN to these negative reviews. Do not buy this crap. You’ll regret it. Crackle. Cracking. No sound. Beyond ridiculous Amazon would even let this nonsense be sold. Beyond Frustrating how Amazon has decreased its product awareness over the years. Obviously anyone can sell anything and it be valid. Ridiculous.
2,Doesn’t work good  cheap .
1,After 3-4 days of using the connectors I have immediately run into issues connecting them into my IPhone XR where I'll need to wiggle them at JUST the right angle for sound to connect. One of the adaptors has stopped working entirely now.You're better off buying higher-quality adapters.
1,Product doesn’t transmit audio on calls. I mainly use headphones to call my boyfriend on messenger and this product doesn’t work for that. It also automatically plays music once it is plugged in which is annoying and often blasts out my eardrums.
2,These adapters failed within a month of ownership. Consider alternatives.
1,The product does not work if you plug in the jack One Direction it doesn’t work if you flip it over and plug it in the other direction then it works but you have a horrible sound quality
1,Usual Chinese quality. Audio connector stopped working five days after purchase.  Wish I did my due diligence and read the one star reviews before purchasing.  Perhaps some five star reviewers did get good products.  But the number of complaints suggest there is a quality control issue.  Returned.
1,This product stopped working within a couple weeks. Right speaker does not work anymore when using this adapter. The issue is not with the speakers or stereo. The problem moves with the adapter. Very annoying would not recommend. Adapter was never abused or dropped or stepped on. Literally nothing happened to it just stopped working.
1,They do not connect to apple products.
1,Just tried to use this for the first time and it does not work!!!!! Missed the return window but this is a piece of junk.
1,I finally got them in today. Once I plugged the cable into my Iphone 11 Pro the volume started to move on its own the music kept starting and stopping and there were crackle sounds and whitenoise in the background. TERRIBLE
1,Doesn’t seem very sturdy. Unfortunately it broke after one day of use.
1,Price and functionality was great however each only lasted a month or two.
1,Don’t recommend
1,Both of them broke almost immediately somehow I’m just tryna use the aux chord in my car. Which is something that does require movement in the chord I don’t know how they broke they just suck.
1,Broke on first use. Broke in a way that nearly required me to bring phone in for service. I don’t recommend purchasing.
1,The sound is great and my phone didn’t have an issue with compatibility but both broke within a week. The lightening charger end broke off of both into my phone both times within only a couple of days of use
1,Fits loose in the iphone charging port designed so it can't even be inserted fully. The sound is crackly and only plays for about a second at a time before the music starts just coming out of the phone speaker. Both adapters included were equally garbage. Don't waste your money!
1,Issues with feedback sensitivity if you touch it. When you touch the cable after plugging it in to the phone. It creates a static humming or buzzing sound. Doesn’t always capture a good sound. Wouldn’t recommend as I bought 2 packs of these
1,Didn’t fit into the jack well and sound would cut-out. After about one week of use the end of the plug broke off and was therefore unusable. Cheap gimmick
1,Very annoying if you are moving because it cracks all the time. When not moving there is static noise. Can’t use headphones with mic. One of the two break with very few uses. Please look for something with better quality. This is a waste of money.
1,Worked for music - didn't work at all for phone calls.
1,Will not play music. iPhone will constantly pause
1,Neither cable connector works
1,These made snapcrackling and popping sounds in the headphones. Did not connect well in my iPhone 11. Every time you moved you would hear crackling/fading  in or fading out. Very thin cord
1,Item doesn’t work. Device does not recognize it. do not waste money on it!
1,Worked for 31 days. Glad it was a 2 pack
1,Broke on first time removing from phone.Horrible sound quality
1,Only used this converter a few time and it broke already
1,They both broke within a week.  The lightning connector broke on both of them.  Total waste of money!  I guess you get what you pay for.
1,Product does not work. Awful cracking sounds when used. Cannot connect to phone calls and does not allow for video play on youtube. Stay far away from this product. Spend the extra money and get the apple one instead.
1,They are a crappy product After receiving them we used them for one day and then they no longer would work. No sound would come out of the speakers nothing at all.
1,super low quality don't waste your time buying it. invest in a higher quality one even if its a little pricier
1,Not sure why I didn’t get a replacement after the first pack. But since then I haven’t gotten any new ones. First pair did not work at all with my cables
1,I bought a 2 pack about 6 weeks ago to use to listen to music in my car. Both have broken with normal use. Don’t buy these.
1,This will not connect an iphone to a Wireless Go or any external microphone for video recording.It's just a little more expensive to get one that works properly
1,Only had for a month now and the plastic piece already came apart. The sound crackles and I have to carefully insert and take out because the plastic end piece already came apart :(
1,Both cables were faulty when I received them please save your money
1,Only one of the 2 pack worked.  Waste of money!
1,At least it was a two pack so I had a back up. I don’t recommend.Second one ate the dust a few months later.
1,Glad it came as a pair because the first failed just after ninety days.
1,Disconnects for no reason does not work
1,I bought these 9 days ago and they both are already broken. I’m not hard on wires and connectors. I do not recommend these
1,After about a week it seemed like there was a short in it because it had to be held a certain way for the sound to be working properly.
1,One tore  the other broke into my phone and almost broke my phone.
1,This dongle sucks worked fine for about 2 weeks and just completely stopped working. second one is just about broken and the dongle has to be in a specific position for the audio to play
1,it doesn't work. I have left feedback for the vendor but they have failed to contact me. I will be returning this.
1,You have to keep spinning the plug constantly because the sound cuts out
1,Does not work with headphones.  Wasted my money.
1,Bad sound quality didn’t even last me 4 months.... first one broke 3 months in and the second one only lost 2 weeks. Only buying from Apple now.
1,ive bought many dongles and this is easily the worst. they break off in the port and get stuck. dont buy this buy literally any other option.
1,I’m using my head phones from Apple and cannot plug them into any of converters I purchased. Ridiculous
1,I have used this maybe 10 times if that. Today this piece broke inside my phone. Wow.
1,After several months the mic would would not work on my headset through this dongle...  Pool quality and reliability.
1,Returning.  Out of the bag audio did not work when connected to my device.
1,Quality non-existent. Product is a totalSham. You should stop offering it.
1,Terrible quality. It's scratchy and doesn't even work unless I hold it tightly to my aux cord. Not even worth the money.
1,Item quit working. Began distorting music. Ear phones work fine without this item.Don't buy
1,The sound is all types of messed up and half way up that’s the highest volume and it messes up the sound period
1,Did not work for me on all Iphone products at a competition. Glad I had backup cords.
1,Useless
1,Made of good quality but doesn’t work with my  iPhone 12 pro. Tried both with different headsets doesn’t work with any. :(
1,These don’t fit well with the regular aux ear buds for apple. It causes sound issues and the volume control is completely non functional
1,No me gusto que sólo lo use tres veces y se me arruinó
1,Cheaply made? One came defective and the other one stopped working 2 weeks after. Do not buy this.
1,Neither one of them worked; like they weren't even plugged in to the phone or the aux cord.
1,Just tried them out and they don’t work at all. Package of two and all you get is static.
1,Upon arrival they never worked.  Tried on iphone 13pro max.Please get something else.
1,Sadly it does not work I’m highly disappointed
1,Must be very careful pulling on the cord because it pulls out easily from the Lightning connector.
1,Tried several of these. Average lifespan = one week. Some slightly more and some less.
1,It doesn’t work with iPhone. Connection is bad and get disconnected all the time. It is a peace of junk.
1,The item doesn’t work. Go with the actual Apple product rather than the knock-off.
1,I try it on iPhone 7 X & 12 and it doesn't worked
1,Used them twice and they broke. I have an Onn adapter and it’s going strong
1,Stopped working within a month. I hope the seller stubs his toe tonight
1,Not worth it
1,These converters broke and stopped converting/working within a week or two of LIGHT use. So disappointing
1,Sound will cut out if you so much as touch or bump the adapter
1,Piece of crap.  Broke the first time we used it.  Left metal tip in iphone
1,After 3 weeks I purchased both of them broke!!!
1,These say they are apple certified but they do not work with my iPhone. Do not buy.
1,Not very flexible sound quality is not the good has constant buzzing in the background of headphones not worth it
1,The quality was very poor. After the first day of use the sound deteriorated.
1,Solo lo pude utilizar 3 veces y se daño
1,Very cheap and weak build. Sound breaks when moved around and cannot use for audio in phone calls.
1,I should have bought originals when I had the chance.
1,Will NOT work for phone calls!!!!!!
1,Breaks in under a week
1,neither of them worked at all. ????????? dont buy
1,Low quality product
1,Neither one of them worked.
1,NOT compatible with I-phone SE!
1,Very disappointed neither worked in my iPad to connect my square reader.
1,These don't last very long. Probably better off with an OEM adapter
1,Crackling and Static
1,Don't buy.
1,Don’t work
1,These do not work at all. Save your few dollars.
1,ordered 2x. product simply does not work
1,Neither of these items worked
1,Phone says product not supported
1,Don’t work! Do NOT buy!!
1,They broke within weeks
1,This product failed within a week.
1,Dont work
1,One was intermittent and the other fell apart and did not work.  Bad Product
1,Didn’t work for any application with iPhone12. Waste of money.
1,This cake with 2 in a pack. The first one broke when I put my phone in my back pocket while plugged in - the terminal broke off in my phone. Got it out. Tried the second one. It broke when I dropped my phone at the gym. Piece of crap.
5,Works great.
5,Very well shipped
5,Works great!
5,Good value for the price. This product performs as advertised.
1,Picture says it all.
5,Item as described
1,No work iphone 12 pro max  y try in 2 diference device and no work I have last update IOS 15.1.1 for today I wrote this
5,Que sirve
5,good
5,Everything works well.
5,Works great no complaints so far
1,Connection is poor. Static. Bad sound quality.
5,These came super quickly work amazing and are well worth the money. If you need a converter cord get these! (And it comes in a pack of two!)
5,Not bad if you want to buy one ever my month.
5,I’ve only had them for a few weeks but I’ve had no issues so far. If they break in the near future I’ll update this review but as of right now for the price I’d say it’s a great deal.
5,Sounded like some people had bad luck with this but I didn’t have any. Works the same as apples except less flimsy. Okay sound quality. Possible bad quality control as seen in reviews some get great or horrible. Great value for money. Would recommend if in a pinch but long term go for AirPods and BlackPods.
5,Absolutely perfect. Love the value 2 for 1
1,Simply put neither of them worked (iPhone 13 pro max).
5,These little things were perfect for both my daughter and myself that have different sized headphones but iPhones. Bought them for a flight and it was perfect great volume and control
5,Good product! Does what it needs to.
4,I wanted to use older wired headphones (TRS) for phone calls while using the iPhone's built-in microphone.  As other reviewers have already out already this dongle does NOT allow for that.  It works great for music but for Phone Calls the sound reverts back to the iPhone's speaker. -- I DID find a DIFFERENT dongle that DOES DO what I wanted. -- https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LXJFMGF
1,Right out of the packaging just doesn’t work. I believed that maybe just one of them had a shortage and luckily it came with two. Man was I wrong. I even got a replacement 2 days later and that new one didn’t even work. Pls don’t waste your money.
4,So far they work with no issues.
5,Excellent item! Thank you.
5,They worked great. However I lost both of them. I will re buy.
1,Las funciones de bajar y subir el volumen así como las funciones del telefono (microfono y conestacion de los earpods) no se habilitan.
1,Me siento estafada pésima calidad no se dejen embaucar. La calidad del sonido es terrible y no detecta el control de volumen de los audífonos Apple originales. Se conectan como si fueran Bluetooth lo cual hará que se gaste más la batería por un accesorio 0 funcional.Irán directo a la basura.
1,No tiene calidad ni buena conexión. Es de "Certificado" es pura mentira.
2,No fue compatible con un iphone 11 pro ademas el conector se le desprendio la tapa.
1,No sirven no funcionan
1,Sonaba como cuando entraba un mensaje en las bocinas de las computadoras de principio de siglo
