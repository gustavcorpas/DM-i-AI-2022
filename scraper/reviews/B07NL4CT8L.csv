5,I have to say that i actually love this little computer and its GREAT DEAL!!! so I purchased the (HP EliteDesk 800 G1 SFF High Performance Business Desktop Computer Intel Quad Core i5-4590 upto 3.7GHz 16GB RAM 1TB HDD 256GB SSD (boot) DVD WiFi Windows 10 Professional computer) shipped very fast [ 2-day shipping ordered it sunday night and arrived Tue later morning] it was packaged wonderfully and booted up Fast about 15 sec   the set up process was very simple and easy. Once i got access to my desktop  I opened my *File explorer; to check everything was as advertised on amazon: the CD-ROM disk was actually DVDRW instead of just DVD drive  Very nice! it came with QQfamily mouse and Keyboard but i used my own. Next  i looked for the HDD and SSD and only found that it showed the 256 SSD and no trace of the 1TB HDD but i kind of had a heads up as the first review was written by someone who said they had issue locating their HDD in file explore and disk management but that they just opened it up and seen a wire loose and that fixed the issue. unfortunately that did not help me  I opened my tower up checked the connecting wires but it still wasn't seen in file explore  :( so I went into disk management  and there it was :) it was online it was partitioned but it was not assigned a letter  so i did what YT video said to do an assign it a letter and even formatted it  and i thought i had figured it out  til i restarted my computer after a windows update and then tried to install a game and wanted to install it on the HD instead of the SSD where my OS was and i couldn't find it  so back to disk management i go only to see that the letter i assigned the HD was no longer there SMH  so change drive and letter path 2 more times and to check if it held; i would restart but every time the same thing would happen..  so i just clicked on the HD - deleted the volume and went through the whole process with wizard thinking that would help. NOPE! So  i was frustrated at this point  so i went on YouTube and found a way to *Format a drive using Command prompt/diskpart and followed it step by step and it was so easy- the Video is by Chris Piedra* OMG! when i tell you it worked  i found it in file explore and when i finsihed i got the notification in my task bar asking what setting i wanted for that drive ( which i had not gotten once before) not only that but when i restarted my computer it was still there!!! so if you choose  to buy this lovely computer and can’t find the HD or see the HD just format it using Command prompts and diskpart and i am no computer expert at all
5,Received my box today. I spent about 1 hour open the box connect the cables turn on the power complete Windows 10 set up get Windows update and poke around.Here is what I find: CPU is i5-6600 @3.3GHz Max 3.9 (better than i5-4590 advertised) RAM 16GB  two out of four dimm slots used; 256 SSD boot drive 2TB Toshiba hard drive (better than the 1TB advertised). The 2TB HHD needs to be formated (to NTFS) and assign a drive name. The both drives are there after power cycle no issue. It has a so so built in speaker. No HDMI; VGA is fine with 27" monitor. no built in wifi and it comes with a USB wifi adapter. I connect the RJ45 for networking.  The boot time is about 20s. The SSD is used 35GB out of total 237GB after Windows update.  Windows 10 pro is version 21H2.  As i test the perf with a 4K youtube video the CPU utilization is about 5% memory usage is about 3.6GB.  Well exceeds what our casual use.  The box I am happy with this purchase.  Last this PC doesn't meet Windows 11 requirement. The Windows product key is not labeled on the box and you need to find it via command terminal and save it.  The Windows product key is needed in case the boot drive crashes and you need to reinstall Windows. The noise level is minimal but noticeable as it has a hard drive and a fan.
5,I purchased this as a 'backup' PC to supplement the main one I use. As my needs for this PC were pretty modest - Web browsing email MS office Zoom - I decided to take a chance on a 'renewed' pc to replace an old machine that was no longer reliable. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the device that was delivered at such a low price point. I moved over my existing peripherals - monitor speakers camera etc from my old PC and within 10 minutes I was up and running with the 'new' one. I took a quick peak under the covers and the components looked like new....a couple of small chips/scratches on the edge of the case was the only indicator it was not a new machine (other than the fact that this is an older model PC). Hopefully it will prove to be reliable in the longer term but after a couple of days it is a clear winner for me. I am not familiar with the refurbisher SJ Computers but they did a nice job here and I like the various options they provide for support should it be necessary. I will update this review if I experience any problems in the future.
5,This is the second refurbished PC I've purchased on Amazon The first was about 4 years ago I guess and that one was just OK.But this one is a GREAT deal. She'll be using it for browsing the web for stuff for her classes and then printing as well as creating reports. It's WAY fast enough for all this....however. This machine comes with a little WiFi USB dongle and...it was useless. I went and ordered an internal WiFi card and that solved that problem.Everything else was great. It looked like a new PC inside and out. I was a little surprised that I didn't have to enter the Win 10 key anywhere at least not yet. But they supply you with all that info so it's there if we need it.The only issue was that when it tried to update the OS it downloaded but then failed to update so it had to revert back. This happened to computers at work so it's not Amazons fault...it's a Microsoft issue.Anyway I was pleasantly surprised and very happy.
4,Was hoping to love this unit but although it came well packaged and on time I had troubles from the on set. I believe that I had a dvd reader and not a writer. It would read a cd/dvd but would not do anything else. If you put a blank dvd r+ it would do nothing. And the drive would disappear from the desktop. Then I got a clunky sound happening in the hhd. I exchanged this item as will review the replacement as I have my fingers crossed for this one.
4,Works good so far. Have had it 2 weeks now. It comes with a 200w PSU and I put a gt 730 graphics card in it. The gt 730 recommend 300 watt psu so I talk to the techs at SJ COMPUTERS and said it would be fine this card and the other components don't consume very many watts. Im not pushing it to hard either just messing around with some old games.
5,Have been most pleased with the operation of this machine after a week's use. But most importantly was floored by the excellent supplier support. Got the device on a weekend and installed on a Sunday. Minor glitch in setting up so emailed the company expecting maybe a reply in a few days...got a telephone call an hour later and they had me up and running. Later had problem with my printer and a phone call solved everything in minutes. For the price unbelievable service.
4,I received a HP ProDesk and not and Elite desk don’t know if that makes a difference comes with mouse and keyboard seen in pic and I aired it with the sceptre 24 inch monitor with built in speakers.Desktop has both SSD and HDD drive as stated and dvd rewritable drive. This is the 2nd day I hv been using the system and it keeps saying “check input” for monitor. The system is not Wi-Fi connected so I bought a Wi-Fi adapter which solve the problem.Processor is 3.30GHz intel core i5
5,I thought I would give it a try because it's highly rated and for the price a unbeatable deal! I need a basis computer to do my work and didn't want spend a lot. I've purchased a renewed tool before from Amazon. The experience was great.  It's easy set up and runs fast quiet and performs well and looks almost like new.  I am very satisfied with my purchase.
5,This is the 3rd computer I have bought like this (refurbished) same brand same unit and every one of them have been really great.  I have one at home that I've had for a couple of years now one at my office also a couple of years and just bought another one a few months ago for another desk at my office. This thing is well priced super easy to set up runs fast and meets all of my personal and business needs. Comes with a wifi card that you plug right in and works great when connected. This computer is not set up to upgrade to Windows 11 I wish they would cause I would keep buying them every time I needed one. But Windows 10 will be supported until 10/14/25 so I have until then. Great computer at a very reasonable price.
5,Nothing to dislike re the computer. The keyboard and mouse provided with  were of good quality.  I did have the keyboard and mouse having a really strong smell. Called their support. Immediately had a most helpful CS person sending out a replacement for those. Excellent support! Thank you.
5,Just wanted a computer that could handle my crafting machines without breaking the bank.My husband hooked to my flat screen tv the only thing was we had to by hdmi adapter no port. But it’s great! Thinking of getting a bigger tv though lol
5,I didn't buy for gaming so I'm not sure how it would be for that but I probably would have bought a different one if that's what I needed it for. Using it for just basic home computing. The WiFi is the older kind and does not support 5ghz. Also haven't needed Tech Support so that is good but can't comment on it since I haven't used it.
3,Came with a 240W power supply which will not support external graphics card. Reading reviews saw mention of 340W power supply and took it mine would too - my fault I guess should not assume anything.Not sure if the CPU/Fan thermal paste was replaced during referb or not. But in any case it was very dry / flaky and very brittle. Cleaned and re-applied new paste.The SSD is 256GB and is not an actual drive but rather a card inserted into the motherboard. I really like this idea and it seems to make the computer start up fast. I hope that the brand BTO will last.The HHD is 1.5TB which is sweet but it is a 2011 model and 5400 rpm. I wonder how many spins the platter has had or is it actually new-old stock? Bight side is it is a battleship western digital.Came with 16GB of DDR3 RAM.The inside of the computer is very clean. Either great job during referb or was kept in a very clean area. Very happy with this!A first had some issues with dual monitors in the display ports. My Bluetooth mouse was very jumpy on one monitor. Downloaded / installed the HP assist software that tells you about needed updates. There was an update for the Intel graphics driver and once that finished my mouse was very smooth and no jerky motions.Windows 10 Pro was really fresh very few updates required. Very little bloatware just the normal bs stuff that Windows throws in.System BIOS was updated. Most all the onboard components that required drivers were up to date. Used Windows Update to update out-of-date drivers and was painless.The keyboard and mouse are both USB "wired". I cannot recommend either of them.Overall happy with purchase but would not buy another.
4,It is fast but the lack of a wifi card may be bad for some.
4,Puter still running like a champ 2 yrs later so I purchased another 1. Purchased 1 for my wife 2 yrs ago and she has had no problems with hers and I don't anticipate any problems with mine. Only reason I didn't 5 star my purchases are - there are NO HDMI ports. However just purchase a Display Port (comes with 2 ports) to Hdmi cord and you are in business. Bought the cord off Amazon for under $10. I have both computers connected to TVs and they are lightening fast. I am using an Ethernet connection and sustaining a more than suitable speed with my ISP averaging 350mbs on both computers. The DVD RW is a plus and there are ample USB connections. Note: The keyboard is yuck and so is the WiFi dongle. Other than those two minor issues ... Xcellent buy.
4,really good computer
5,had to return. it was pictured as a tower. have no place to put it in my office. has to be a tower.
5,Computer was as advertised....technical help was responsive and sent monitor cable to enable using my existing monitor. Very pleased with purchase
5,Nice unit in great condition. Interior looked clean and new. Was packed well and proficient shipping.Processing speed is superior to my previous unit. Did add a wireless keyboard and mouse of better quality.
5,It was delivered on time and was in like-new condition as advertised. It has a smaller footprint than a full-size desktop which I had concerns about before I got it. However once I opened the access panel I was impressed. It has a recessed latched pull handle that removes the whole access panel exposing everything and no screws to unscrew or lose. Inside not a speck of dust literally like a new computer you can't tell that it's renewed/upgraded.Even though it's smaller everything is easy to see and get to so if you need or want to do anything inside it's awesome. You can see everything and get to it with ease. You don't have to be a contortionist or have tiny hands and fingers. The drives and optical reader (DVD) are contained within a rack that you just pivot upward to release and you have full easy access to them. Additional expansion slots to add what you like. If you should want to increase RAM from 16 to 32 GB there is nothing around them so removing and replacing them in the slots would be effortless. I was surprised how cool this computer runs even when using multiple high resource software at the same time with no lag.As for the USB Keyboard and Mouse USB WiFi Adapter. These are low cost and just so you have something. As low cost as keyboard and mouse are I really like them. If you use something else don't throw them out as others have said. Save them as an emergency back up or give them to someone. I have a Logitech wireless keyboard and mouse but still using the ones that came with this computer. USB WiFi Adapter isn't the best it's not real fast and not great for long-distance so I did buy a better one at the same time. There are a lot of cheap USB WiFi Adapters that stop working after 2-3 months but here is a low-cost $17 good one I use so can avoid the hassle.Just search amazon for -TP-Link AC600 USB WiFi Adapter for PC (Archer T2U Plus)- Wireless Network Adapter for Desktop with 2.4GHz 5GHz High Gain Dual Band 5dBi Antenna Supports Windows 10/8.1/8/7/XP Mac OS 10.9-10.14It increased my transfer speed from 300 Mbps or less and 3 bars signal strength to a transfer speed of 433 to 490 Mbps and 5 bars signal strength.All you have to do is connect a monitor the keyboard mouse and USB wifi adapter and power up. You do need to set up you user account like any new computer. This is Microsoft so it wants you to use a Microsoft account to have a better "online experience". But all you need to do is enter your login for a Microsoft email account or create one during set up. That step requires connecting to the internet and entering the password. Or you can create an offline user account like the old days. The rest of the setup questions are about your preferences and you're ready to go.Windows 10 Pro works perfectly. My daughter got one of these a while ago and wouldn't stop praising it so I got one. She gave me a heads up about the USB WiFi Adapter solution too. I couldn't be happier with this purchase.
5,The computer works like it should.  Comes  with wired mouse and keyboard.No problem with updates.  Computer was packaged well in the box.  No complaints.  Will probably buy another soon.
5,Sara was very helpful in making sure I was satisfied and offering support setting up computer.
5,Easy setup worked like a charm. Very fast. Used my own keyboard and mouse. For the money can’t be beat.
4,Bad wifi adapter and no dvd
5,This is a great PC better than what I expected and at a great price . Would recommend Amazon refurbished to anyone interested.
4,The computer is much better than I had hoped for. Was up and running within minutes
5,Opened the box (was a day late) and placed the newly restored computer on the desk then plugged in everything like the mouse the monitor and power cord into the computer. I turned it on and I had to wait for about 1/2 hour for it to initialize the Windows 10. When it was through with the first step it got my name and wanted a password (a secret for that troublesome thing) just hit enter instead of sitting there thinking of what kind of unique set of letters numbers and punctuation marks you'll use! Anyway the computer is working and doing what it needs to do quietly.
5,Way better then the POS laptop i had been using and the extra storage drive is great.
5,Something to understand before I dive into my review is: if you're thinking of buying a refurbished computer and you have little to no experience with troubleshooting basic computer issues then buying refurbished is not for you and you should look elsewhere and buy brand new. But if you can open up a computer case and know the basics of its components you'll be just fine.Now onto the computer. I received the desktop very quickly in less than two business days which I was very impressed by. It came in great shape with little to no wear that could be detected on the outside case. Despite the differences in the stock image the desktop is still a small form factor but also comes with a CD drive. It also came with a cheap keyboard and mouse. Like many of the other reviews say just throw these out I promise you they're cheap and not worth it. The wifi adapter is also meh but ultimately I bought another for $15 on amazon that works just fine. You really shouldn't expect free add-ons like that to perform well anyway just spend the extra cash and buy those things new (they're not very expensive anyway).Now lets get into the nitty-gritty details.I purchased the quad core i5-4590 model with 16GB of RAM and dual 256GB SSD boot with additional 1TB drive and Windows 10 Pro. Everything came as advertised. However when I first powered on the additional 1TB drive wasn't showing up anywhere not even in disk management. So I opened up the case and found that the cable was loose. Easy enough fix and not impossible that it could've happened during shipping. But I also found that one of the bracket attachments for the SSD was completely detached and free-falling around the case (as shown in the last photo). Not sure if that was an error during refurbishment but re-attaching was just as easy since I know my way around desktops fairly well. The computer also comes with no HDMI only DisplayPorts and VGA. But a cheap DisplayPort to HDMI cable for my monitor fixes that problem as well.The computer also performs VERY well. For being only a 4th-gen Intel processor the quad core i5 boosts great speeds (averaging around 3.5ghz and 25% utilization) and has handled everything I've thrown at it while also being very quiet. Whether it be streaming bigger programs like photoshop and lightroom DJ software and even gaming the processor keeps up just fine and the 16GBs of RAM has been plenty to support it. I've played a few games on it (the master chief collection being one of them) and it usually does fairly well. I do plan on adding a GTX graphics card in the extra PCIe slot soon though to optimize performance. You shouldn't expect an integrated graphics card to hold up against brand new games that much should be obvious. So if you are expecting that be prepared to be somewhat disappointed.Overall the computer is sleek shipped fast in great condition and has performed up to my expectations. For $250 this desktop is a steal. Despite being a few years older and refurbished it stands against all my tasks just fine. It came exactly as advertised and most poor reviews I've seen come from people who aren't exactly sure what they're buying to begin with.If you're looking for a computer that has good power behind it and can handle some heavier tasks at a bargain price this computer is for you. But if you don't know much about computers or you're not very sure what it is you need look elsewhere.
5,It’s working very well and very fast. I’m really glad that I got this computer
5,I got this for my sibling to try out and it worked great for their gaming. They love Minecraft and it ran decently and the prove was very good. I'm very happy with it and I hope it last very long!
5,There is no noise  levels  very quite
5,Quiet as a mouse and fast as lighting. Delivered in two days.. An excellent purchase. Easily hooked up my 5 external drives with the 8 USB and 2 USB 3 inputs. Now I can sort with ease.
5,
5,Product was a great deal for the money.  Will handle all your office needs.
5,works great was easy to set up it is a high quality product i am very happy it exceeded my expectations.
4,It seems to be working just fine for schoolwork and such. I don't know how well you can game with it. The only thing is that on the description AND pictures it shows a DVD slot. However when I received mine it didn't have it. It brings a WiFi USB adapter with a driver disk (that I can't insert anywhere) which thankfully I got it to work just by plugging the USB in otherwise that's really the only downside.
4,For a refurbished machine this was much better than expected.  My only complaint would be that it does not come with wifi installed so you have to use a USB fob.  Every time I turn on the computer I must reinsert the drive for the internet to work.  Bothersome but not really a deal breaker.  I don't do gaming but mostly use it for my Cricut photoshopping and various other tasks.
3,TL;DROne bad display port incorrect advertising on cpu incorrect model advertising (bad?) you have to pull the windows key after it boots and who knows what else I’ll find when the weekend comes. Didn't bother with keyboard mouse or usb wifi dongle.Full review:Right out of the gate one of the display ports is bent; it looks like the metal peripheral ‘shield’ is not properly seated – problem with this is it’s riveted to the case. I took a nylon spludger tool to push it back in however it’s still sticking out just enough to prevent cable connection/seating; the second port does allow a cable to be plugged in and does work. I purposefully spent an extra $100 for this second port and via hindsight; I should have just purchased a cheap low profile dual graphics card and saved the bill.Second issue: this is advertised as i5-4590 up to 3.7GHz; in reality it’s i5-4570 @ 3.2GHz – not really a big deal for my purpose (NOTE: “for my purpose”) but it’s still false or inaccurate advertising and the display port above increases the annoyance.Third issue: This is NOT an EliteDesk 800; windows reports model as ProDesk 600 Gi SFF which from my gaagling isn’t a bad thing – try it (the gaagling) and view the comparison yourself: HP EliteDesk 800 G1 SFF vs ProDesk 600 Gi SFFForth (minor) issue there’s no windows key that’s written and included so I had to grab it via cmd after it booted up. Reason? I don’t plan to use their disks as I have no idea where (or with whom) they’ve been.Don’t be tempted to pay extra for more disk space or SSD vs HDD – these are super cheap and you can get a reputable brand new drive (Seagate curcial etc) way cheaper than the up-cost they try to bait you in with. These are USED disks… would you want to use a used needle or used condom? These should be sold diskless but then it wouldn’t suit the avg consumer (and I wouldn’t be able to harvest the magnets).Windows does report 16GB of RAM. There are two disks (which I don’t care about but they’re there) 1 tb and one 250gb ssd which the os is on. Windows also agrees this is windows pro. Under the hood are 4 ram slots and extra space for additional peripheral cards (you can gaagle the form factor as I don't really care).I’m really not happy with the display port issue and I’m gonna have to tear this apart to fix it (I’m familiar with building PC’s however the avg consumer may find this unacceptable for a “refurbished” computer). I’ll reach out to the seller but they’re only 84% positive – maybe they can get to 85%? I’ll update this review as I don’t like leaving low star reviews before working with the seller – HOWEVER I feel for this price I shouldn’t have too AND for the avg. buyer you should know.Recommendation: Don’t be fooled by disk drive size or type; I would recommend replacing them anyways so save the money and get better drives which will be bigger (& NEW) compared the price increase. If you need more monitors buy a cheap dual monitor gpu. If you don’t know what I’m talking about you may be better buying a new pc from a REPUTABLE dealer / seller.
5,Windows 10 Pro
5,I received this computer today the setup was so easy and I am amazed at how fast it is. It looked brand new when I opened it up. All I can say for the prize is this is an amazing computer.  It is quiet I used my own speakers and the sound is great. It came with everything it said plus the Wifi attachment. Very happy.
5,Good customer service! And good PC overall for business
5,Working right from the box. No setup hassle and no crapware.
5,Having to switch the cable from my monitor thru an adapter wasn't my first choice but it works great
5,I needed a simple system that was fast and reliable and was NOT disappointed. The computer works great and so much faster than my old dinosaur PC. Maybe it was in the description but I was pleasantly surprised to get a mouse keyboard AND wireless network adaptor! It was a nice bonus I wasn't expecting for the price!
5,Great computer for the money
5,I've purchased several PCs from these guys and have been happy with every purchase. Fast delivery and an inexpensive reliable alternative to the high-end retail chains.
4,Overall I'm very happy with this computer though I would caution computer novices before considering this.The computer arrived on time and packed very well in a strong bubble wrap cocoon and overall was quite clean. Included in the Amazon box were two brand new-in-box Chinese items as described: keyboard and mouse. There was a power plug. There was also a USB wifi adapter plugged into one of the many USB ports in the back. One of the tabs covering unused card ports in the back was missing indicating the prior owner had some sort of additional item removed before shipping to me. No problem.The front of the unit has two USB 3.0 ports and two prior generation ports. The rear also has two USB 3.0 ports and four more prior generation ports. There are two display ports in the rear along with ethernet port headphone/mic and two of the older types: serial/vga? The front also has headhpone and mic jacks. There is no HDMI port.I hooked everything up: two monitors keyboard and mouse and fired it up. Windows 10 led me through their setup process including wifi networking. Nice. The machine immediately recognized (I think...) the two monitor setup; I didn't have to do anything (display port to HDMI). I've been using generally low-end laptops for years so perhaps my expectations are low but this machine is a significant improvement for me. I don't do much on my computers; I run Office Quicken Chrome and various google apps like google play music stream movies do some photo editing and that's about it. No gaming. This machine with the solid state primary drive boots up VERY fast. I've encountered no lag whatsoever with multiple programs running. My laptops on the other hand...I encountered no fatal problems with this unit though as I began installing software transferring files etc I learned a few things that prompts my caution against computer novices:1) The included Chinese mouse/keyboard should probably be tossed. My mouse was defective out of the box. Don't count on these in any way.2) The included USB wifi adapter is S L O W and essentially garbage. Obtain a better one first or just use ethernet.3) My CD/DVD drive was not plugged in; I had to open the box during my troubleshooting to fix.I had solutions for all of these items and figured them all out pretty quickly so in the end I got a great machine at a great price and am very happy. For those that want a plug it in and turn it on product refurb options like this are probably not for you. I'm not even close to a 'computer guy' though and I figured everything out just fine. I knocked one star off due to the CD/DVD drive not being plugged in... the useless USB wifi adapter and mouse in my opinion aren't really an issue but the CD/DVD drive should have been plugged in.Now how long will this work flawlessly? To be determined!
4,i  wish it came with a manual. I had to go online for assistance It worked with my existing monitorGood value for the money.  I use it by my Ham Radio Station to look up stations I talk to onQRZ.com
4,The product arrived as advertised and ahead of shipping. Apart from a few quirks (more on that in a second) it runs very well and is very quiet (at least when it's turned on).Now for the quirks. The case seems to be a bit off-centered. The CD drive tries to open but never is able to. Looking at it it appears that the door is obstructed by the case. I don't use CDs anymore so this is not necessary but some might have an issue with this. It also is a bit tricky to plug USBs in--I have to wiggle them quite a bit but once they are in they work fine.The only real issue I have is with the audio. I work from home and need a computer to make calls but I could not get this computer to recognize my company-issued headset as both a mic and speaker simultaneously. I had a friend who is much better with computers than me look at it and contacted both Amazon support and the seller but was never able to solve the issue. I was able to find a workaround by installing a Bluetooth receiver and using a Bluetooth headset however.Also while the computer is quiet when in use as I said as soon as it is turned off or put into sleep mode the fan starts blasting. I have not found a reason for this yet (I'm assuming a BIOS issue) and I was able to resolve this too by simply turning off the surge protector I have it plugged into when not in use.TL;DR: an overall great product with some minor (though extremely annoying) bugs.
5,Performs very well. Fast and afforadble.
5,I loved this machine it was everything I wanted up until it died a few months in. I was supposed to have a year warranty but when I contacted the company they said they didn't/ wouldn't honor it it had nothing to do with them I guess. There wasn't any warning it just died. I took it to be fixed and got a new motherboard installed which was supposed to fix it. It didn't. Got more work done also didn't fix it. It still doesn't work and no one can figure out why.So I had to get another computer entirely. I honestly just wanted this computer it was what I wanted but it died after a few months and customer service just suggested I get it looked at.Needless to say I wasn't and still am not happy. I was left with a computer that can't be fixed and still had to get a new one.
5,I swear by HP products as that's all I own But this refurbished model is fantastic as far as performance and even some gaming
4,Refurbs are what they are but as an streamlined everyday PC (Office Internet media) it IS great for the price. Thank You for that.The Keyboard sent with it however was clunky to say the least. Not bringing it up ASAP is my fault but finally as it kept getting worse...when I did try to contact for solution (within grace period) my only real complaint is that there was no follow up no reply no contact of any kind.Otherwise again is dependable so far more than does the job.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I love it  when I got it was making a weird noise  so I open it up and it was a loose cable  I moved the cable and everything was just fine .Have been using for work for a week already and haven’t had no issues with the machine yet ! The wifi Connector work super fast
5,Great desktop computer.  Home use and will enjoy the Terrabyte of storage for pictures.
4,The computer I purchased did arrive in good condition and on time.  The keyboard included was cheap and flimsy but no big deal.  However within 3 weeks of setting it up The Solid state drive containing the Windows operating system shut down and apparently self destructed.  The computer refuses to see the drive at all all the way down to the bios.The other drive is set up in such a way that it will not allow Windows to be installed on it at all.I attempted to contact the seller and although they did give me a number to call for their tech support no matter what time of day you call you always get an answering machine with a generic message That they're all busy and can't talk to you.  Even after leaving my name and number they have not once called me back to discuss options or offer help.  Cannot express my disappointment in either the product or the seller enough.Edit:  eventually contact was made with the company and they replaced the entire computer rather than just the solid state drive.  They even upgraded the data drive to two tb.  Whether this was a mistake or an apology I do not know.  I waited to ensure the SSD wasn't going to break down again after a month or so before updating this review.
5,Clean very responsive and fast. Very good for my needs. Would recommend
5,Outstanding product.
5,Didn’t have any problems and set up quick with my two monitors. Very happy with it!
3,Cd drive would not open and fan never stops and super loud.
4,This is a great computer for the price with only 2 small negatives in my particular case.  #1: Two of the 4 feet on bottom of the case were partially broken.  #2: The SSD drive was smaller than the 256 GB promised.  The one I got was 222 GB.  Not a deal breaker but I would have liked to have received the extra 33GB of space just not worth sending it back for that since this is not my main computer.  Had it not been for the issue with the SSD drive I would have given this computer 5 stars instead of 4.The positives:  The computer works great & is fast!  It was very easy to set up and worked correctly right out of the box.  It came with a basic 2.4 GHz WiFi adapter & a Display Port to HDMI adapter that I did not see included in the description as coming with it so that was a plus.The cheap wired keyboard & mouse that comes with the computer are satisfactory for short term use but most people will want to upgrade to a better keyboard & mouse.  As soon as I used the included keyboard & mouse to set the computer up I plugged in a USB Bluetooth adapter and swapped them out for a good Bluetooth keyboard & mouse and couldn't be happier.I have this computer hooked into my entertainment center and networked to the other computers that I have in the home and use my 82" 4k TV in the family room as the monitor for it.  Watching 4k YouTube videos & 4k Netflix via an HDMI-2.0 4k cable between the computer and the big TV is just awesome.I don't think that you can go wrong with this computer.
5,Replaced my old HP tower so far its working like its supposed to
5,I was hesitant to buy a refurbished computer but looking at prices I couldn't build myself one for less than double the price of a refurb (I've built or had built my last 3). That being said I am NOT a gamer or a big computer person per se. I use the internet for email and reading comics mostly. That being said I didn't really see a need for anything fancy or even brand new so I gave a refurb a shot. I'm quite pleased with the result honestly. This is the fastest computer I've ever owned (probably has something to do with the SSD) and even adapting to windows 10 hasn't been as awful as expected.I double checked everything when it came in after reading the reviews but everything was connected and well attached with no loose bits. It started right up. The mouse and keyboard are pretty flimsy and I'm quite sure you have something better but hey a backup never hurt anyone right? I have not tried the WiFi adapter because I direct connect to my router but it does appear pretty cheap as well. I didn't expect anything from those however so no skin of my teeth.I did have a minor issue with the cd/dvd drive not being able to pop open unless I removed the faceplate of the computer. I purchased through Sunset Micro and their technician was very helpful and even willing to replace it if I didn't want to do the fix myself (turns out there was a slight mis-manufacture with the frame of the case itself and I ended up bending some tabs back out of the way and the problem was all fixed!). I'm good with pliers however and all is well now. I give their customer service an A+ for helpfulness and for clear communication.I have been running the computer for over a month now and I have no complaints. If any issues arise I will update but I don't anticipate any.
4,HDMI converter needed for dual monitor. (It has only one.) Satisfied.
5,Came pretty much as described a 4-core Intel i5-4570 @ 3.2 GHz with 16 GB of RAM.  Interior was very clean when I opened it not any dust apparent it looked brand new (picture of interior attached).  It had a 256 GB SSD boot drive and a 1 TB hard drive both configured properly and loaded with Win 10 Pro.The included keyboard and mouse were a brand I had never heard of before "BT".  I didn't bother using them.  The motherboard did not have wireless but it did have an ethernet jack.There was one problem when I first booted it the sound would not function.  I went into system/sound and the output sound device was set to "SB220" which normally means a SoundBlaster addon card.  I changed it back to the other output option "Realtek Sound Driver" and then the sound worked fine.The power supply was only rated for 240 watts so it's a bit small if you want to add a graphics card.  The system was idling at about 30 watts power draw.  The CPU was rated as 84 watts TDP but I didn't perform a stress or load test.The PCIE slots for graphics cards were half-height/half length i.e. you can only fit a 7" or 150mm length graphics card (see attached pic).  With the limitation in power supply and graphics slot length you are probably limited to an Nvidia GT 1030 or an AMD Rx-550 graphics card.  So if you need faster graphics than that this isn't the system for you.  The built-in Intel graphics ( Intel HD Graphics 4600 350 MHz to 1150 MHz) were fine for the simpler games that I ran (King's Bounty Crossroads Hearthstone and HOMM3).The system is very quiet I can barely hear it.  I should perhaps have given it a 4.5 star rating since the sound was improperly configured but it was easily fixed.  Overall I am very pleased with this purchase.
5,Surprised at the power for the value. Nice combo of ssd and hdd. Sufficient memory and processor to handle creating files and slicing them for 3d printing. Great valued little workhorse.
2,USB ports didn't work disconnected cable inside PC  same as optical drive not connected.Also broken piece of USB connection inside one of the USB ports...luckily I caught it before powering up . .Had to remove pieces see imagesAlso included USB wifi is crap...20mb and 1 mb speeds ...my internet is 500mb and 20 uploads speeds . Wiif is crapGet what you paid for  USB mouse and keyboard and wifi USB didn't recognize had to grab a Ethernet cable and it didn't fit the ports on the bottom dont line up very well..DP USB and Ethernet ports not aligned from rear io shield..Had to tweek the mother board screws and standoff to make fit. See picturesAfter 2+ hours of fixing this it only gets 2 stars...maybe better luck next purchases ...
5,Good for the money
4,Good value.
5,Bought 2 of these couldn't be happier.  I'd rate myself an Advanced Novice when it comes to computers so I was a bit concerned about the set-up process on a renewed unit. (my nightmare was a blinking DOS prompt staring back at me).  Not at all - could not have been easier.  A couple clicks a bit of info log into the home network and voila'.  Whisper quiet super fast boot-up (thanks to the solid state drive) and for my office-type needs - it's speedy.  The unit has sufficient specs to be viable for at least 4-5 years (general office-type use).  I was surprised it shipped with a 'Tenda' mini USB wireless adapter to help in the set up process. Nice touch. It's a simple 2.4GHz N-150 Mbit so you'll likely want something better for long term but it's sufficient to get you up and running.  The system software (Windows 10 Pro)  reached out and updated itself with no effort on my part. As others have noted - no HDMI port so make a note in case you need to invest a couple bucks in a new monitor cable. (VGA or Display Port). The keyboard and mouse aren't as bad as everyone notes - they're not wireless but they're perfectly functional. Time will tell re reliability but I'm a super happy camper at the moment.3/30/21 - Addendum - the keyboard and mouse are indeed c-ap.  A couple weeks in and both have failed.  So... if you aren't keeping your old one(s) invest a few dollars a new combo when purchasing this system.The system itself is still purring like a (fast) kitten - outstanding value.
5,First thing the vendor matters.  Some of these rebuilt computers aren't as well refurbished as others. I've bought a handful over time. You see some disturbing stuff with the poorly prepared units.  I got this one at SKYTECH you can't beat them. I'm sure there are many others but those guys are tops.  Also if you're a Prime member it would pay to use an Amazon supplied  machine not just an Amazon approved vendor. There is a BIG difference.Second thing for most HDMI is the standard. HP uses a video display port not to worry the adapters run around six bucks. Get one when you order your machine.Thirdly and most importantly BUY ONE.  You will be thrilled!  the i5 configurations with 16MB RAM and an SSD are real performers.  My daily driver is a i7 gen9 with 32MB RAM and I hardly notice the difference with daily computer and audio work.  Even light image processing is within this machines ability. As a school and work machine this is a screamer.If you watch a lot of video online you'll notice the lack of a video card I watch tutorial stuff which suits me just fine at lower resolution. But you can't expect a "cinematic" experience without a card.  Still a doable upgrade after kicking the tires some.My daily driver gets a lot less attention these days.  I am comparing this $250 computer to a $2000 computer. You can hardly notice the difference for daily tasks. I use mine as the basis for a  home recording studio.
5,This PC is older but still pretty zippy considering.  Perfect for a bit of online shopping and email.
3,The computer is working just fine.1.- HD does have some weird noise I thing it will not works too much... maybe 6 month or so...2.- SSD is working just fine I hope it will work for at least 2 years.3.- RAM is the promised amount it is not super fast but it is usable.4.- Wi-Fi adaptor is an external adaptor if you are thinking into use a Linux Distro be sure you upgrade your Kernel to 5.x before to try to install the driver it will save you some time.5.- DVD reader/writer works but it gets stuck some times... be patient6.- You will find some scratches into the case I personally don’t care much about that but if you care maybe this is not your option.7.- Keyboard and Mouse are good enough to setup your computer but I suggest you to find a good keyboard and mouse as soon as you can it gets hard to use with the time (I have one month with them)8.- Windows 10 works just fine in this computer it takes about 40 seconds to start up without additional software/services installed9.- It has no HDMI port but they will includes you an adapter in my case that’s fine if for you it is not maybe you should take a look for another options.10.- Linux startup takes about 25 seconds I’m using it as a local server and the performances is good.I’m giving it 3 stars because I will need to change some parts earlier than I was expecting also because Keyboard and Mouse are not fully functional and I have external adapter for HDMI and Wi-Fi.For someone in elementary school or custom small projects this is a great computer.
5,Using for work in gift shop office. Very user friendly
4,The good: this product arrived sooner than expected was packaged well and in good condition booted up very quickly (thanks to its SSD boot drive) and performed well* after setup.The bad: the accessories included (keyboard mouse and WiFi adapter) are of poor quality. Relying on the WiFi adapter I struggled to even download drivers and small programs (no problems after using a powerline Ethernet adapter instead so it’s not the PC laptop next to PC had no issues so it’s not the WiFi). I didn’t expect much from these accessories so it wasn’t a major fault or disappointment but if you would be relying on WiFi for this I strongly suggest using a better adapter.Mixed: I had issues that may not pertain to other buyers. First off Windows didn’t allow me to activate it (cited a “major hardware change” and mentioned it was likely a changed motherboard) and asked for a product key to do so. I contacted the seller about this and got a response (and the needed product key) on the next business day.*I will say that I decided to return this product due to compatibility issues with a digital drawing tablet (Huion Kamvas 16 Pro) and animation software (OpenToonz). After trying different drivers for the GPU/tablet and different software versions of OpenToonz I could never get it to work properly like on my laptop. This is a relatively niche setup so I can’t say this is a reason for most people to stay away.
5,The SD drive does boot it up RIGHT NOW!And somebody finally decided to put in a SATA drive with real capacity.I don't do anything to make a computer work very hard and this has never balked at anything.I wish it had a CD/DVD writer instead of just a player but oh well.I also wish it'd come with max memory but nobody ships with that. I asked about some customisations (like more RAM and such and they told me that the boxes were already in Amazon warehouses so they couldn't do anything like that. Seems reasonable.Tech support is quick to answer. Takes some work to get a really straight answer out of them sometimes but they will help. (I think one weekend I got a janitor just goofing around on his break but Monday morning they came through.)The memory it uses is hard to find for some reason. Crucial was out but Amazon found some Crucial sticks that I snagged up. (Just before the price jumped another 50%)Everything inside is nice and open. The drives are easy to get to for cleaning or installing more. (Once you figure out you have to kind of reef on the tray to get it open.) Good access to expansion slots. 2 display ports is nice. No HDMI port. Just VGA (and the 2 DP's) I have one monitor on an HDMI adapter and another with a DP input.  both were just straight plug and play with no adjustments necessary.All in all I'm really glad I bought it.
3,Didn’t come with HDMI port
5,Arrived early by a few days. Real nice packaging very clean model. Ditched the mouse and keyboard immediately and used the BT and wifi adapters only until I installed the card I bought at the same time as the computer. Included was a really neat display to hdmi adapter which I currently do not need but is a great addition to my adapter collection. :) Also purchased alongside was a usb3 card reader with extra usb3 ports. Booted up connected my microsoft account and I was online. Boots up and runs fast with the ssd for the os and the 16gb of memory. I am really happy with this product and should get one for the wife. Swapping out the hard drives or installing a card in this model is a piece of cake. One clasp holds the topside cover on and the expansion slots are accessible beneath the bits holding the drives fold out - really pretty slick. Never been a fan of HP based on the quality of their inexpensive home computers I thought they were junk but this workstation is awesome. All the documentation you'd ever want is available online and through the HP site itself. Am considering maxing out the memory to 32gb and  getting a nice graphics card but those are upgrades for later and they are not a necessity for me at this point as my gaming is pretty lite. The one I was sent was a hospital lease and must have not been used much at all - it was extremely lightly used a few minor surface scratch-marks and a little bit of a sticker gouge - other than that it looks brand new. I would buy this unit again.
5,This PC was an awesome choice for me. Keep in mind I’m NOT using it for gaming. I just wanted to replace my current core duo pavilion. So even though this is comparable to a three or four year old PC it’s a lot faster than the one I had been using.I was a little worried after reading a couple of the reviews but for 250 I didn’t mind the gamble.I was very pleased when it arrived! Inspected the inside and it was clean. Nothing looked old or worn. The wifi usb isn’t good at all but I already had a decent one lying around. The keyboard AND mouse were HP brand so that was a cool bonus. And I even added a low end graphics card (Asus geforce 710) and firewire card (Texas instrument) with NO problems at all. Just make sure they’re low profile!!I will say WIN 10 is finicky with old drivers. If you do get a blue screen loop with windows after installing older hardware/software on it it probably is an incompatible driver. But that’s not anything to do with the PC so I’ll leave that there.I mainly run photo editing and music editing software so that’s why I wanted to get the extras on the side.So far so good though!I just couldn’t justify spending well over 500 dollars on a computer that I was using at home and mainly just for hobbies. So it’s great that I was able to get something better than what I had within my budget. Thanks!!!!
3,So far the system is working good  the only part that i was unsatisfied with is the fact that  it didn't have a internal wifi card. It uses a external wifi dongle that was supplied
5,Really impressed by the refurb quality from Amazon. Don't expect to be playing the top games with this but for any other non-3D intense softwares this is fantastic super fast PC even works great with AutoCAD latest version which i was very surprised to see given that the company required a dedicated graphic card.If you just wanna use this for every day tasks (at lightning speed) watch movies and Youtube this is more than enough.
3,Computer great. DVD drive not great.  Hangs up on chasis!  Cannot update to windows 11  but I'll stay with windows 10!
5,System is lightning fast. Boots in 15 seconds. If it would have come in the original packaging i would have not known it was used. It was that clean. It came as advertised. What was not clear was the DVD. It arrived with a DVDRW. Love the layout of this computer. Everything is easily accessible. Expansion will be a breeze. Bought a 2 pack of 4K Ultra HD Display Port to HDMI adapters to hook up 2 additional monitors. Super cool. i am a video fanatic. The intel 4600 integrated graphics card with 2G of shared memory will handle all your streaming and DVD needs. It has 4 Expansion slots for a dedicated card if you need more for gaming. I am not a gamer so I don't know how the 4600 will handle them. But this system handles all my needs lighting fast. Could not be happier. Bought mine from Quality Recertified. Great job gang. They even did all the Windows updates before shipping. So with the included Network dongle that hooked up instantly.... this thing was screaming right out of the box. Get yours while they last. But not before I go back for seconds. My wife wants one too! Heres to 2021!Came back for seconds and Quality Recertified  did it again! Better than expected delivery time and Received another clean as a whistle desktop. My wife is very happy! Happy wife happy life....or so the saying goes. Everybody's happy.....you can be too! Quality Recertified will see to it. Thanks again gang!
3,I purchased this desktop PC because I am needing to replace my old HP computer. I came across with this HD Elitedesk G1 SFF and by looking at the specs it is definitely a steal for $250. I do know a bit of computers and know how to do basic trouble shooting However when I received it it was DOA and would not boot up so I opened the case and removed the 2nd drive and I got it to boot up but it is on backdoor image which means I have to set it when it boots to go to first out of the box boot up. I check the specs and this machine I've got is not the one as advertised it has different processor. I contacted the seller and Im impressed with the customer support they have provided and since we are in the Covid 19 crisis the replacement was sent using ground shipping. After a week the replacement came and works for a day and when I boot up next day my windows would not boot properly and for some reason there was a problem with the Windows image and spent hours trying to reset and fix it but no luck it would not recover the Windows 10 system image. I have gave up and sent this back to Amazon for refund because I am not getting any luck with this machine. I will still use the old machine I have and will buy again next time. I am still considering this model to get despite of the trouble I had with this. If you don't have any experience with fixing or doing a trouble shooting with computers then I do not recommend this one for you because you will get stressed out if there is a problem.I gave 3 stars for fair ratings.
5,My computer is very good...your work is excellent
4,This HP computer works fast and efficiency so far But it can't download Window 11. Bad keyboard I can't type numbers. That keyboard is not made by HP. The mouse's cord is too short but it woks. I have too buy my own HP keyboard and mouse with a longer cord from the computer store at a low price. I should get an exchange or refund with the keyboard that is not a HP keyboard. I'll wait and see if the HP renewed desktop computer breakdown before my warranty ends
4,Everything I expected. Good value and fast.
2,It works better than the last two refurbished computers we purchased. However I have had to use an external DVD/ CD drive because the one that came with it will not read any CD we put into it. It just load perpetually. We purchased this for my sons school work and all his lessons are on DVD so it kind of fails. As for gaming it depends on the game. It will run mine craft and if you very patient it will run Portia.
5,Works great no issues.
5,Looks and runs Excellent I would buy it again.
5,I bought this PC to replace my old laptop without breaking the bank. I had a little trouble getting it up and running but I called the provided tech support number and got great help there. It's working fantastically now and I absolutely love it. It runs super quiet and cool.I'm hoping to play some older games on it so far I've stated up TES III: Morrowind and it's running great.My only complaint is that it was not factory reset when I received it so I had to do that myself but all that cost me was a little time and it's not enough of an inconvenience to drop my rating.
5,Stallion Tek of Upper Marlboro MD provides outstanding conscientious customer service.  I needed to upgrade my desktop to Windows 10 in order to install TurboTax 2020.  I spent several hours unsuccessfully attempting this and finally decided to order a refurbished machine with 10 already installed.  The day the replacement computer shipped I tried to install 10 one more time now choosing a different option that did not retain all the original files and it installed perfectly!When I contacted customer service at Stallion Tek and explained my unusual circumstances and that the box was unopened the agent stated "Sometimes things like that happen" and that he would refund the ENTIRE cost including sales tax and the return shipping cost!!  I consider this customer support above and beyond the norm!I had selected this machine because of the very positive reviews and have no doubt it is an excellent computer.  To be able to return it at no cost to me was truly a gift and very much appreciated.  After reviewing their website and my personal experience I can recommend you check them out for all your computer needs.
5,Great spec's on this computer with a fast boot from the SSD drive and great storage on the 1TB hard drive (D:/). Also came with a DVD Writer drive. It was pre-installed with the most recent Win10 version just before shipping ready to use after just a couple of minor updates. Arrived packed carefully in multiple layers of bubble wrap. Included USB keyboard (5.5" x 17.5" & riser feet) & normal size mouse are light weight but functional. Bought for my wife and she really likes it!
5,OK Soo I wrote eariler due to the package going missing in the mail... I have bought 4 of these after buying the first two i wanted one more for my home ( Two kids that both game and two adults... who game.. WOW UO COD Fortnight and so many games will run without lag). I just recieved the one lost in the mail (thats why i bought another) so ill be returning that unforantly. The ram is O.P. (overpowered) and the i5 is good with the 2400 intergrated graphics card. I use it but if you run any games settings on high then i'd buy a card but again gaming at mid works well the rest of the computer can handle whatever else. Mine has two open ram slots so thats even upgradable. For the money you cant go wrong. Buy a wifi card btw. The little one i got with it sucks. smh buy one for 20 bucks. CPU is totally worth it tho. (Even after all the hopes for kid went a little delayed but as it is for kids. Ill get the other kid one when asap after i beat cornavirus (God willing)
5,Recieved this faster than expected was well packed booted right up out of the box. I have a low profile core 2 duo windows 7which I wanted to upgrade from.  I like the low profile computers and this one so far has more than met my expectations.  I can't vouch for gaming expectations since only gaming I do is a virtual world and old Sega emulator games.  It handles the virtual world game fine without video card in.  though I did put a nvidia gt710 card in it 3 days after i got computer that came from amazon.  Both work good.  I love how fast it boots up.  Getting used to windows 10 i did load a windows 7 shell because I'm familiar with it.  Also liked came no adware or shareware bloated in it.  It has run flawlessly so far. Only thing was dvd/rw did not work when  I booted it up.  When I installed the video card unplugged and plugged DVD  back in works great now.
4,I have had  two reconditioned computers and have long use. Was easy to set up and is running all of the programs I have added to it. Really not effective to rate a reconditioned tower a few weeks after putting it in service. So far is doing everything asked of it but have only had it a few weeks. Appears that it will take the Windows 11 update.
3,Packaging was not good. Mouse was on the bottom so it got broken keyboard was coming out of the box it was in and keys were popped off. CPU was in fair condition and is working so far. I guess you get what you pay for.
4,The computer boots up fast and has plenty of storage. Unfortunately it does not have a high end graphics card but for everyday work it is very good. Photos picture it on end but feet are on the bottom so I had to rearrange my space to fit a horizontal computer.
5,I bought this as my upgrade to a Win10 computer.  This computer is loaded.  A 256 SSD for Win10 and Software (APPs) plus a 1TB HDD for files.  It has 16 GBs of RAM for fantastic operation of multiple APPs and fast Internet media operations.  It boots up amazingly fast using the SSD.  User files are routinely saved to the User folders on the SSD.  To keep that drive for APPs and not becoming overloaded with various data files it is recommended to move the files from the User folder on the SSD to new forlders on the HDD.  A USB WiFi dongle is included to provide WiFi connectivity.  The overall condition of the refurbished computer is excellent.  It is an amazing bargain for anyone wanting to upgrade to a high performance Win10 computer at an affordable price.  Save your money to get the APPs you want to run.
5,After reading a few of the poor reviews I was hesitant.  But for the price I figured what the hell ill give it a try.  I already had my own HP 23" monitor keyboard and mouse so the computer itself was all I was interested in.Package had a corner smash in a little so I was immediately worried.  but when I opened it it was packaged with sturdy Styrofoam guards to keep it from moving around and/or get smashed.  Cool lets fire this baby up. maybe 20 minutes and I am surfing the web and checking emails.  I went ahead and paid for the Microsoft 365 at 99.95 yearly.  Comes with Word Excel Microsoft Chrome google Chrome and all kinds of other extras. I am using computer now to write this review.  Now.... I have only had it for 3 days but so far it is working flawlessly.  knock on wood. As long as it keeps working I would highly recommend this product.  very satisfied.
5,Needed to upgrade a 10 year old Windows 7 machine to Windows 10. Could not find anyway to legally upgrade to Windows 10 for under $100 so I started to consider a new computer. Ran across several refurbished computers from Amazon for around $220. After a lot of comparisons I decided on this one because of the SSD system drive plus a 1 TB data drive. The 16 GB of RAM was also better than others in the same price range. After I ordered the computer it was delivered for free in about two days. Nicely packed and protected. Set it up in about 5 minutes and have been using it since. It is very fast quiet and is a major improvement over Windows 7. With the SSD system drive it boots very fast. I would recommend this to anyone that needs a solid desktop computer for almost any purpose. Probably not for gaming but that's a different category of computing.
5,the unit worked right out the box took me about 5 min to set up. Because of other reviews I opened the side panel to make sure nothing was loose after shipment (nothing was). Upon startup Widows updated and that was it; all my accesory components were recognized and were functioning immediately.The small down is that the WiFi dongle is slow; I installed a much better one (about $20 on AMZN)
5,I searched and searched...if you need something with some processing power this is it. This was a great fit for my home office. I don't mind the size of the "small" tower since I mounted it under the desk.
5,I bought two of these. Iv needed a new PC because the other one i had iv been using since 2010.  Iv had my eye on this one for a year now. I was also looking at a Del one that had 2Tb but the reviews threw me off.This computer comes "Extremely well packaged" i wanna compare the big bubble they put around the computer to a pool floaty lol Just because thats what came to my brain as soon as i opened the box. I might sound like an idiot typing this but the computer legit looks brand new. There's no dings or scratches from an old user. (when i read refurbished i thought it meant they took old computers people used and cleaned them up and upgraded the parts. But now I think it means no one purchased these computers so they're not used they just upgraded the inside parts.)
5,Works well
4,Never had an SSD drive before and I can only say Wow! Boot up only takes a few seconds.  The 1TB HDD is more than adequate for my needs.  I was so impressed with this machine that I bought a second one.  As for gaming I am an older gamer who enjoys strategy and naval simulation games. In this regard I have found these machines to be quite speedy for my purposes. Plenty of videos are on line explaining how to inexpensively transform these machines into decent gaming platforms. That is what I am doing to the second machine I purchased.
5,My laptop died and I was only using it to monitor security cameras and stream podcasts. I have another computer that I use as my primary system. I saw this online and thought "as long as I can play a podcast or see a camera I'm good". Turns out this thing is almost as good as my main computer! I'm not a gamer and I'm sure this thing would choke on a current video game but it works fantastic for everything else. Boots faster than any other computer I ever had can run multiple programs with EASE and barely even makes any noise. I can't say enough about this. I didn't want to do a review immediately in case any problems popped up but I've had this for a month and a half and it's been running around the clock absolutely ZERO problems so far.
5,Transaction on point very good product preform very well Thanks !
5,It's a perfect computer for my kids to play games with. A few games were graphic-intensive and my laptop was really struggling. This computer wasn't much of a step up but it allowed me to buy a $75 graphics card to add to it and now it works much better. I'm sure if I got a more expensive card and computer it would all work a lot better but for what my kids use this for - it's more than adequate. I even run a Minecraft server for them in the background on this machine and it all works great.The computer is built probably from spare parts from other machines - and you'll be able to tell that it's not brand new. But it has everything that was advertised and I feel lucky to have found it. So I definitely recommend.
4,I've always owned HP computers and this is my seventh. It's fast easy to use and takes up little space compared to the old style. The problem I have with it appeared after I installed my old (but comfortable) Windows Office 7 program with its 500 plus files. It loaded just fine but now whenever I open Office 7 it takes about 20 seconds to go through something it calls its "Window's Configuration Process". You'd think Microsoft would have that all figured out since Windows 7 is just an older version of their product. But I guess not hence my 4 instead of 5 stars.
5,First time I have purchased a refurb PC from "Amazon" and this reseller did great.  The PC specs were accurate and the proper RAM OS and HDD were installed correctly.  I have had this over a month now constantly on and have no major problems.  The one very minor problem I have had is that it will not automatically turn on after a restart.  It will get hung up and just stay on until I do a hard power off.  Then it boots right up.  I can do a power off and that works fine.  The only time that its noticeable is when Windows does an update and it keeps restarting; so I have to physically power off and on for the next stage of updates.  However I would definitely buy from this reseller again.
5,Working just fine right out of the generic box. Packaged nicely nothing missing. I'm not using the keyboard or the mouse but they look like new. Wi-Fi Dongle was packaged in a small padded envelope not stuck in one of the ports like one review I saw however I'm saving it and using the one that I already have. When I powered it up It the set up process was just like a new computer and was done rather quickly. All drives are visible and seem to be working fine. I am overall very happy and will update with any issues that may occur. It is OK to buy renewed go for it.8/8/2021 Update. Still working like new no problems to date. Upgraded to 32GB RAM nice and quick.1/19/2022 Update. No issues to date. If it fails I'd buy the same model again so I can have spare parts.7/4/2022 Update. No problems to date.
4,The recon HP EliteDesk 800 G1 is a superfast small form factor desktop PC with solid state drive (SSD) running Windows 10 and Office software that greatly speeds up the process using Windows 10. This PC I received was upgraded from Windows 8 to Windows 10 but the installed Windows 10 runs superfast. When the EliteDesk 800 arrived it had installed a very slow older Realtek wifi USB 2 adapter which I replaced with a more up to date Netgear AC1200 wifi USB 3.0 adapter stick with built-in antenna. This allows the internet speed to to get up to 200 Mbps for almost every session. This recon. HP EliteDesk is NOT new as advertised but is reconditioned with some minor scratches on it and traces of old leftover files and software on the disk drive. Overall I give it 4-stars due to wifi adapter needing replacement and vendor's misrepresented condition.
5,The computer came in working condition. Better than I had anticipated. It looks great works great and it came with windows 10. No complaints.
4,As others have noted this is not a new computer. The first one arrived and worked for a couple of hours before I got the blue screen of death. I emailed support and they were very quick and helpful. When they indicated I should send it back for a refund or replacement I took a day to think about it and reviewed other new computers. I decided to go ahead and try a replacement. My replacement has worked a week now and I have every indication it will continue to be great for what I need. I am happy with this computer ;)
4,so far the unit is working as expected. I have not had much time with unit to conduct a good review
4,Cat 6 plug doesn't work. They taped wifi USB dongle to it that works well. I didn't  contact them because everything else works well. Good value.
5,I have been very happy.  Easy set up. Perfect solution for main family/tv computer.Used to use a laptop.Thank you.
5,My refurbished PC arrived as promised with correct configuration.With only Windows 10 installed it took 5 seconds to boot it up due to ~250GB SSD hard drive and 16 GB RAM. This is like flying compared to crawling with spinning hard drives. Having tried it will only buy SSD devices.
5,A great computer for my needs - internet simple office.  Lightning fast good size for keeping under my desk. I don't play games so I can't rate.
4,Works great as advertized... the only reason for the 4 stars is that I thought it would have a better output for the speakers.. I guess you just use the headphone jack?? could be haven't done enough research but it doesn't seem obvious
4,Obviously this isn't a gaming build but I needed a 3rd PC for working at home during the pandemic. The SSD decent RAM and processor and dual monitor capability make this thing amazing for under $300. I paired it with Viewsonic 22" monitors that I got for $99 ea. Everything worked great right out of the box except the TB harddrive was invisible. Had to use command lines to format create partition and assign a drive letter then it worked great. I'm no IT guy but found instructions online easy enough. That should be done prior to shipping it out so I'm docking a star. It is super quiet compact everything you need for standard computer tasks absent HD gaming of course. Starting to wonder why I've ever spent $1200 on PCs in the past!
2,The machine itself is in great condition and seems to run fine.  Everything looks like brand new.  The issue I have is that the main description says it is a 3.7 GHz processor and it is actually only a 3.3 GHz processor.  The specs a few pages below on the sales page is more correct.
5,Excellent product at a great price point. Highly recommend!
5,As an older person it is easier for me to work with a desk top. My last one whore out so I needed this one and it is fast.
5,I have another HP Elite like this and ordered this as a backup machine.  Arrived in great physical condition.  I looked inside to see the SSD HD and interior clean as a bell and no loose cables etc.  Booted up into windows successfully in no time flat with my MSN ID.  The boot SSD on this computer is different than my other machine and more reliable!  The problem with these old computers is HD hard drive fails eventually.  That's what happened to my original HP Elite refurbished after about 3 to 4 years.  The SSD boot drive is a great idea! If your storage hard drive fails the machine should still be operable...and you could install another HD if it fails.
5,As a ham radio operator we often need a station computer to go with our radios. I chose this thinking I would be limited. In all actuality it's now one of my better PCs. I have yet to have any hiccups after torturing this thing for about a week.Also I have had zero issues at all. Keep in mind I am also using this on zoom calls running videos backgrounds. But let's not forget I have 3 monitors hooked up to it.I am honestly waiting for the FBI to knock on the door because I feel like I scammed someone by getting such an amazing deal.Just so you know the keyboard and mouse are on the low end. I always use mine own for that portion anyways.
4,it does make a strange noise when starting up Kinda like me waking up. But it is fast and works well. Only been using it for 1-week.  I would have given it 5 stars  but it advertised Windows 10  but I had to purchase Wilndows @ Staples and install.  The new Norm.
5,What is there NOT to like? First off the shipping was so lightning fast it was plum ridiculous. It was here in a couple days. Straight out of the box turned it on. IT BOOTS FASTER THAN A GREASED BALLBEARING DOWN A SLIPPERY SLOPE OF ICE. I have never owned a PC so fast. I first wanted to check and see that all was true to the sales ad. The boot hard-drive is there and the 1TB is there. The RAM is 16Gb. All is well. No glitches. This is a very powerful machine. Like others I got a different keyboard and mouse and will just store the ones they sent for spares. I am very very satisfied.
3,This refurbished computer had some issues that should not have passed inspection before sending out after being refurbished.  The corner of the motherboard was bent downward.  I had to saw the metal case and widen the opening in order to use the ethernet port.  The 2 usb ports underneath that port are unusable because of alignment.  The first 2 weeks went well then the SSD drive died leaving me with no operating system.  I replaced the SSD drive and was able to replace the Windows 10 pro.  Fortunately Microsoft works with you.  I spent an extra $50 for another SSD drive in order to avoid the hassle of sending it back.  So far it is humming along with the repairs.  Buyer beware.
4,The second time around is MUCH better than the first.  This computer seems to be functioning perfectly.  The replacement was shipped promptly and arrived on the appointed day.The reason for four stars rather than five stars is a reflection of the inconvenience of having to ship the first one back.  But Blair Tech did a fine job of remedying the situation.
5,I researched renewed desktops in this price range pretty thoroughly.  This seller offered the best bang for your buck. Prompt delivery. When I originally received I had 3 issues. 1) Windows not activated/no key. 2) Hard drive didn't show up.  3) I5-4570 instead of advertised I5-4590.  I emailed seller.  Took several days for them to get back to me.  During that time I mounted/assigned hard drive.  Took me a minute to figure out.  I bought a cheap key and activated windows.  Still a very capable computer and a good buy even though not as advertised.  I notified the seller as soon as I realized each issue.  Though I had solved 2 out of 3 they sent me a call tag and as soon as I shipped it back they sent me one that had no issues.  Very happy with product.  Makes  a pretty good media desktop.
4,Computer is very fast and just as advertised. The wi fi keyboard and mouse are cheap. I used others and it works great.
5,The first computer's HDD was loud.  I emailed the tech support and they instantly replied with my options.  I wanted an exchange and it was very easy.  The next PC is great and has been working well.  I'm using it at work for a lab equipment driver so don't need fancy specs beyond a big HD.  I would buy again.
4,IT IS WHAT IT SAID IT DOES....
1,I was billed for this product on 15 Aug of 2022 and within two weeks I started having problems with the keyboard not printing letters in format or completely not printing.  Calling tech support got me nowhere as they wanted to connect me to some site I had to pay $1.00 refundable which would give them my card information as well as my email.  I tried changing the keyboard with the same results so it's not with the keyboard.  I would trash this desktop computer and get a different brand if not for the fact that it's a long process to change over my virus protection from one computer to another.
4,The unit arrived with a damaged DVD drive.  The supplier responded immediately by sending out a new drive to be installed.  The computer is significantly faster than the one it replace.  I was thrilled NOT to have to deal with a ton of adware on the machine.  I'm not so tech savvy so am still trying to get the DVD player to 'auto-start' a DVD when I put it in the drive.
5,Worked out of the box. Better speed.
5,Before you laugh at me I'm 76 and my eyesight isn't always what it should be. The only problem I have had with getting it up and running is finding the power button. Black on black isn't something I can find easily but thanks to a YouTube setup video I found where to look for it and could finally make out the button.  Setup has been easy. I love the speed and my only regret is that I haven't purchased one long ago!Next stop new glasses!If this changes as time goes on I will update the review.
5,Shipping was fast. I got the machine opened it up and everything was really good attached to the right place components didn't get lose or anything. Computer set up was super fast I guess it's because windows has already been installed. I was skeptical when I saw this one on Amazon. I bought refurbished items all the time this computer came looking like new item. Computer boots up very fast compared with my laptop even it took time to turn it off but with this computer 3 seconds done. I will definitely purchase this again when my daughters need a computer it's super quiet and fast!
5,Todo según lo esperado. Buena maquina. Veremos con el tiempo
5,We really did not need all the bells and whistles for our secretary computer. At that price level  this machine is exactly what we were looking for.  HP quality and low price.
3,The noise level is low and the tower is cery slimline it fits right on top of my desk. The system is very fast and works great! My issue was when I recieved the unit the ports were not lined up properly forcing me to buy a seperate docking station so I could hook the eathernet cable up. Also this only has a set up for 1 vga monitor but since I added the docking station I can use 2 monitors. Other wise this unit is awesome for the money. My core processing speeds are well above what is advertised. I work from home and this system handles multiple programs at one time like a charm. It is a great value for the price and runs like brand new!!
5,I have been very happy with my purchases from SJ Computers.  They have all arrived on time very clean with no unexpected defects (given these are refurbished). The value is unbelievable. A working i5 PC with a licensed copy of Win10 Pro for under $250! With SSD! In a nice SFF case! Not to mention the 1TB HDD DVD-RW drive mouse keyboard and USB WiFi adapter. There is still plenty of life left in this hardware for web/email/producivty uses.  I would not recommend it for a 3D gamer the power supply and thermal specs do not lend themselves to intense gaming even though some have successfully thrown low profile GTX 1050 and 1650 cards in them. Apart from that this is a great deal.
4,Easy setup. Nothing fancy. Great PC for the price.
5,I am very satisfied with my refurbished HP desk top. I have no problem with the supplied key board and mouse;they work great. Previously to buying I looked at some very similar products in my local area. They were costing over double the price with way less features. With the 256 GB ssd and the 1 TB hdd  & 16 GB memory this is a GREAT buy. Best and fastest computer I have ever owned! And great support from the vendor on getting my windows 10 registered and running.
4,So I have no dislikes with the computer.  The computer is fast and so far it has done everything I want it to.
5,This computer was easy to set up Install updates and  hook up to Wifi and fast start up and super fast
2,Bought a renewed HP EliteDesk 800 G1 SFF Desktop Computer with low price. But the PC fan made constant noise especially at night. Found out the SSD SATA card was the Chinese cheap brand I've never heard of. That was the reason I returned it.
4,This is an excellent value it came on time and looked brand new. I have ran multiple programs at the same time photoshop excel and two web browsers. The computer did not come with a wifi card as advertised. Still saved serious money and just bought an external card.
4,Been buying refurbs for years and have built many new PCs from scratch for retail sale but this is a real peach until I get around to a final monster custom build.
4,The PC has pretty good specs for the price but there is no HDMI port.We had to buy two different adapters but the monitor still got no signal from the PC.An old fashioned VGA cable worked until we bought another cable of HDMI to Display Port and that solved the problem (after a week of delays and hassle).
4,Bought in early January moved files et al over and it has been working well since.  I swapped out the 1TB HD for a 3TB with no issues.  The only complaint is that the on/off button sticks sometimes but I have mastered that and the dvd drive isn't the greatest but otherwise well worth the purchase.
4,Product price is the best. Works fast. Their WiFi usb dongle is very bad quality. Looks like legacy 2.4 WiFi client.  Get a new USB WiFi and it completes the pc. I replaced the hard disk with my old ssd. Opening the computer is pretty easy.
5,Super fast compared to my old 2015 computer.  The difference is amazing.  It may not be gamer fast but its good enough for youtube and basic stuff.  My old one was like an old riding lawn mower  this one is a Lamborghini. I can only imagine how fast gaming computers must be.  I highly recommend this PC.  Great condition.  I replaced the same model that got fried by a storm.  Until it got fried it was great.
3,Arrived damaged. I can't use the cd rom and it wasn't aligned properly I had a hard time plugging cords in the back. If I didn't need this for work (other tower died) I would have returned it.
4,The sticker for the activation of windows was covered by a refurbish sticker making it very very difficult to activate windows.  Using alcohol it took some time to remove enough to read and activate it.
5,The HP EliteDesk Computer replaced an older computer that I was using.  Upgrading to the EliteDesk was like coming out of the dark ages over what I was previously using.  The EliteDesk Computer is SO quiet.  I never have to shut it off and when I reboot it takes no more than 10 to 15 seconds.  I intentionally bought this unit because it has 256GB of SDD memory that stores most of the boot data....which allows it to boot quickly.  I am extremely happy with this purchase.
5,Bought this for my mom to do taxes. It works good so far. Great price! Was delivered faster than expected.
2,Replaced a low grade 14 year old Acer lap top with this desk top PC.  It’s so slow I’m going back to my OG and using this as a backup.
5,It’s plain and simple. It is what they advertised and it works extremely well. No complaints no regrets.
3,Ordered this as it looked like a great deal for refurbished PC. I bought it in September of 2020 and set it up in December. It was quick to boot while it lasted but within 8 months the processor died. It was only used for very basic things in the browser like eBay and email. Very disappointed to lose money like this.
5,The computer was as stated with all advertised accessories.  I had it setup and running in 5 minutes.  Lighting fast no problems with Windows was easy to setup all of my apps email chrome.  I couldn't have asked for a better computer.  Will update if any problems come up.
5,This computer was purchased for online school for my child. It had some issues when it arrived but the seller responded quickly and resolved them. In my opinion if a company stands behind their products you can not ask for more.
3,the pc itself works great its fast boots up in seconds because of the 256gb SSD.  Every now and then I hear it make a grinding noise but its not very often.  Cosmetically the tower looks a bit beat up I opened the side panel to checked out guts of the computer and now I can't get it to fully close and one o the displayports is damaged so I can't connect one of my monitors into it I had to use a displayport to VGA converter and connected it to the VGA port.
4,The computer is good but came with missing WIFI PART. I was able to get a new one sent with 3 day shipping
2,The stats and other hardware seem to be operating fine for now but the SATA drive I received with the unit was in its death bead loud overheating. a check of the hard drive it showed was from 2009 and had some remaining data on the drive its self from its prior life. I contacted  the seller and asked for a replacement hard drive and the complied. the replacement drive arrived yesterday its a 2011 Seagate unit that had not been formatted and contained data. I formatted the unit so I could safely check the drive. Shortly after beginning the check the hard drive died and is showing a fatal error.  I have not contacted the seller for another replacement because I don't put much faith in storing data on a unit they send me.  my advice would be to buy a comparable pc with a smaller SATA drive for cheaper and replace with a SATA drive of your size and choice. for the record the SSD drive installed works great so far. I understand that this is a bargain refurbished unit but the state of the SATA hard drives is almost unusable.
5,Computer was packed real nice.  Shrink wrap and foam packing inserts.  At first glance it looks new.  Just a small dent in the side and the front has a small scratch.  Works great.
5,Headline says it all.  Fast setup everything works.  Operational in an hour.
5,This is the fastest booting computer I've ever had.  The boot drive is an SSD and the data drive is 2tb.  With 16 gigs of memory I don't see how this gem could be bogged down under heavy use.  The computer is refurbished but looks and works as new.  I liked this computer plan on ordering a second one to run CoinOps and connect it to my AtGames Legend Ultimate Arcade cabinet.  Would recommend this computer to anyone that has a need for a fast reliable computer.  Plus using refurbished equipment is good for the environment.
5,I bought this refurbished HP desktop to replace my aging Dell. I am very happy with the system so far. It is exponentially faster than my old Dell. I credit that to the Intel Quad Core and a twice the Ram. Set-up was simple and I was up and running in ten minutes. I use it for graphics and as an author. Definitely improved my productivity.
5,This computer arrived a few days earlier than the expected date. It was well packed and had minimal cosmetic damage.The computer runs very well and I have it up and running for one day.It was supplied with a brand new usb keyboard and an optial mouse along with a usb wifi adapter.I would buy without any hesitation.Thank you.
5,Unfortunately first order was undeliverable after a week of waiting but that must be caused by its carrier and not their fault.  Its refund was quickly made so I ordered similar model again.It's been working fine since I got it. I mainly use it for entertainment purposes and do not need a top of the line spec. This will do the job with about a half of the price.
2,I bought this for a backup unit  because I thought my computer was shot  but I took the panel off and cleaned it up / out and it is  working again so I never even plugged this in yet ?  it looks good  I like the space it takes up  but I truly can not say anything about it yet .
5,Excellent product! Was unsure about buying refurbished but love this refurbished product after buying. Great for everything that I've had to use the product for.
5,This PC was incredible for the price. Set up was a breeze. Computer is fast! It recognized the Wi-Fi network my printer monitor speakers and camera. I would and will recommend this PC to friends. If you’re looking for a PC this is the one to buy.
5,The computer was almost a week early. It was well packaged and works wonderfully
2,This was a great little computer...SSD drive for the OS and a secondary hard drive for back up. Ran fast and was good...until...Christmas Eve. I turned it on the monitor and it was just a black screen. It was more of a secondary back up computer...so I didn't use it all the time...which also makes me upset that it only last 9 months. Took it to Staples and they tried to fix it but they couldn't. They said I'd be better off just buying a new PC. So now I am shopping for a new pc
5,So far so good.  Excellent value for the price.  Extremely silent and excellent speed.
4,General business work and a driver of my house WiFi system. Faultless and a bonus of Windows 10 pro which is so so intuitive it's scary.
4,Item was packaged very well very neat and clean inside and seems to be exactly as listed. We'll know more in a few weeks as I put it through its paces.
2,The WD 1.0TB drive failed already.  Darn. Report displays errors. The machine will not boot without the F1. Was a reliable machine up unto yesterday.  :(  Delivered March 31
5,After reading the reviews I was expecting to have to somewhat fix this PC once it arrived. But I was pleasantly surprised. Although it arrived without a mouse it booted up and seems to work fine. I loaded it up with MSoffice allowed the automatic Windows 10 updates to run and I have zero complaints. It's absolutely perfect for my needs.
5,The PC was delivered on time and works great! A good deal too.
5,Bought this to replace an older Windows 7 machine. Just using it for web browsing emails general home office use. Price was right decent performance and haven't had any issues.
5,The computer came as advertised in really good shape.  I am using it for coding projects and general hacking projects.  The DVD drive wouldn't open when I got the machine but an email to Memory Solutions solved that.  They were quick to respond and sent me a replacement drive that works perfectly.  Good people to deal with.
5,I was a little skeptical but it shipped fast in good packaging. It came with everything in the description and booted up just fine with everything it said it had and included contact info for any issues. It lays flat not on it's side but I should've researched that. It was a great buy though I'm very happy
5,arrived well packaged and in good condition. no problems with anything included so far. I DID have to get a cable to be able to use the tv hdmi as an input for the computer as it has display port. has several usb 2 and 3 ports both front and back. Pleased with the purchase.
1,Just bought in January and am getting errors during updates that system is not compatible for Windows 11 now only 8 months later.  When buying a PC I would expect it to be compatible to future Windows upgrades.  Also has been crashing periodically and giving me a Windows error.  Has happened 4 times in a month.
5,Works great. As advertised...... Thank You
5,It works great I put my guy 1030 in it.
1,We received the PC today. It was a quick shipment received a day earlier than expected. But the 2 display ports and 2 USB ports were not aligned correctly rendering them useless.The freebie mouse included with the PC is not working correctly. The right click button is a dummy.There is a long scratch on the side panel.I have included photos to show the defects.5 Keys in the keyboard had fallen off...possibly my the mishandling of the package by the UPS guy...we heard a huge thump outside our door and when we went to check it was the box being dropped off by the UPS guy :(We tried to reach the customer service of the company but it was busy the whole time and couldn't reach anybody for support.Amazon customer service stepped in and we have started the return/replacement process.I hope the company reads my review and sends a good quality replacement. We really don't want to go through this again.Review update:We received the replacement today. The service was quick and the replacement arrived in good condition. Everything seems to be working great as of now.The customer service credit goes to Amazon only. We were not able to reach the seller and no one bothered to call us back about the damaged order. Thank you Amazon!!!
5,this is a deal here with the ram and SSD HDD alone it is worth every penny add in the processor speed and the small form factor and it blows most deals out of the water now with the windows 10 pro its perfect for office use or you can install a low profile graphic card like I did and can do some gaming or graphic design work (what I do). no problem.
4,Its not bad for the price. Bought for working from home. Everything is great except I didnt realize the processor is an too old to run certain features like virtual backgrounds in zoom. But the only fault I've found so far.
1,I bought a refurbished computer from this company that arrived on 2/23/2021.  I set it up as instructed and turned it on. It worked for a little while but now I have the following error codeRECOVERYTHERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH A DEVICE CONNECTED TO YOUR PCAN UNEXPECTED I/O ERROR HAS OCCURREDFILE:\BOOT\BCDERROR CODE: 0XC00000E9THIS PROBLEM CAN HAPPEN WHEN A REMOVABLE STORAGE DEVICE IS REMOVED WHILE IT'S IN USE OR IS FAILING.  PROPERLY CONNECTING ANY REMOVABLE STORAGE AND RESTARTING YOUR PC MAY FIX THIS PROBLEM.What does this mean? We connected only the mouse and keyboard included with the PC at time of sale and a 20 in ViewSonic monitor that we already owned.  We  didn't connect any storage devicesZero satisfactionUPDATEAfter a couple of emails back and forth  I  get an email telling me to remove the hard drive and memory and reinstall. Of it doesn't start then my hard drive failed and they'll cross ship a new one for me to install.If I knew how to do that I'd build my own computer.At this point I just want a refundUPDATE #2: they sent a replacement computer and so far it's working fine.  Fingers crossed
1,I followed the printed setup instructions that were sent with the computer exactly. When I powered it up to start it would not boot. The solid-state drive was completely dead. The dead drive was supposed to contain the operating system which kept it from working. I removed the solid-state drive and checked it in the computer that I was replacing which was only being replaced because it was  6 years old with no other problems. It showed that no drive was installed just like the refurbed computer that I just bought that it came out of. I had a copy of Windows10 and decided to see if it would load on the 1 tb drive of the computer that I just bought. It did load and works but is not very fast without the ssd drive.I have no complaints with the computer other than the fact that they sent me one with a completely non-functional boot drive. I feel that they did a very poor job of quality control inspection if any on this unit before shipping it. I want to keep the computer because I have not found any problems with the computer it's self and it works properly but I think that Amazon should contact me and send me solid state drive to replace the damaged one that I paid for leaving me one drive short in the computer that I purchased.
4,This refurbished pc works well for my son for eLearning but we realized the sound doesn’t work or we may need something additional for it - he tried headphones and no sound.
2,The PC runs ok except for the appearance of front bezel was very scratched dusty and discolored.  I have purchased two of these PCs before and they were not much better quality than this one.  Would like to see if I could receive a replace front bezel and that would make me very happy and would improve my rating of the vendor and product.
4,Not bad for its price. Tried taking out the hard drive so I could copy and existing one to it and the ribbon broke. Was able to force it in so it works fine as long as it doesn’t move. Buy another WiFi adapter. That one included is garbage.
5,It is quiet and works great.
3,The PC came with a defective 1TB HDD. The solid state drive worked fine so I was still able to boot up and use the PC. I contacted the seller and was told to return the defective drive for a replacement. Luckily I can do the replacement myself but it was still an inconvenience I shouldn't have had to deal with. Besides the hard drive issue I am quite happy with the performance of the PC. It runs quickly and the solid state hard drive makes it silent and boot ups are so much faster than a system with a conventional hard drive. I was apprehensive about buying a refurbished machine and I infact did have an issue but still happy with my purchase and feel this system is a good value for price and performance.
4,No power for games at all but endless memory
1,Be careful before your purchase!We were happy with product until computer hardware completely failed suddenly with a 1720-SMART Hard Drive detects imminent failure error. Failing Drive: SATAO (Dark Blue) Failing Attribute: #00. Computer now is extremely slow and basically nonfunctional. Not worth it since we've only had it for a year.
5,I have absolutely no complaints about this... It was ready to run strait out of the box and it has more memory and software than I realized when I bought it. Seriously... Refurbished doesn't mean cheap. This thing is profoundly up to date. I'm enjoying it.
5,Had a minor issue with windows. Called and was fixed quickly.
1,Refurbished. Would not come on. Called the number and the technician had us try several things and nothing helped so he told us to send it back. Easy return at Kohls!
5,Works faster
4,Everything worked right out of the box. Not a tech person but am very happy with this purchase.
5,Read some reviews saying that the computer arrived needing some internal components plugged in possibly disconnected during shipping so I opened it up but everything was good to go with mine. I connected it to the monitor and everything worked perfectly. This PC performs better than any computer I've ever owned!
5,This computer works well. It has plenty of memory and runs quietly. The only problem I found was that one of the little rubber feet on the bottom was missing so it can wobble a bit. It arrived much more quickly than I expected. There were some dings in the box but they didn't seem to go through to the machine.
5,Great price no problems out of the box!!
4,What do I like about this unit:  See the title.  What's with "Thickness" and "Sheerness"?
5,This product is being used for work and sxhool.
2,I received the desktop computer I've been waiting for all week. Happy!  I could not believe my eyes.. this computer has zero hdmi ports. Tons of USB's and other ports not one hdmi. Unhappy.  No point in even powering it up. It is useless to me as I cannot hook up my monitor without a hdmi port which comes standard these days. It must be an antiquated rebuilt HP model which wasn't mentioned in the description.  Now I have to wait until Tuesday to have it picked up for return apparently it takes about a week to get the money back on my debit card. Then I need to find another computer that satisfies basic needs order it and wait another week to get it. I am very disappointed and don't have time for this.
3,The actual PC itself is wonderful. So quiet and easy to set up. However the peripherals that came with it are like something out of a Christmas cracker.....from the early 1990s. both keyboard and mouse are hard-wired and feel like they've been rescued from a warehouse sale.If only the actual computer came with wireless quality accessories.
3,Did not come with DVD Optical Drive as listed and shown in the online picture of the item
5,Out of the box looks in good condition. Hooked it up fairly easily for a non tech person and it is operating very well. Meets my expectations. Did not buy for gaming and did not need tech support
3,It was listed as an i5-4590 but it came with an i5-4570 at a 3.20GHz instead of a 3.30GHz. I know it's a very small difference and it doesn't really affect much but for them as a seller continuing to do this would I guess in a way help them and cut costs maybe..? and in the end it is different to what they said so I don't fell too happy.
5,Came well packaged and protected. Plugged it in and worked great!  Loaded all my programs with no issues.
4,Fired right up transferring bookmarks suck 10 sucks. 4 ram slots wasted by 4gig sticks.Good value small size. Cant use full height vid cards.
5,Very impressed. I needed a basic computer for surfing the internet and some of my crafting needs. I love how fast it is. Every thing has been working great. It was so worth it and the price was great!!
2,Although the PC worked well for the first few days latterly I could not get it to boot up. Every time I tried it showed that it was attempting to boot from the hard drive instead of the solid-state drive which contained the Windows 10 software. To overcome this problem it suggested disconnecting the hard drive which I tried doing but it didn't cure the ailment. I therefore had to reluctantly return the errant machine.Earlier I had sent the seller an email asking why in spite of my loading a multitude of documents photos and apps the hard drive remained empty. They never bothered to reply which didn't inspire confidence. When the machine worked it was also very noisy due to fan vibration.
5,I love this PC it is sob fast and a great value. Looks new!  Had a slight issue and the problem was handle so quickly! Communication was fast and friendly.  I will buy from here again!
5,Worked as stated refurbishing Team graciously did NOT pack it full of unwanted application debris on the Windows 10 pro install.  Thanks to them for having the good sense to keep it a stripper!  Whisper quiet fans.
5,Boots up fast and responds very fast on the apps.
5,Great computer for my son to play games on. Works great and we have had no issues with it running online games! Worth every penny! I mean the keyboard is really cheap and mouse also but he wanted some gaming ones so it is no big deal.
5,This is the greatest product we have ever purchased the boot up is super fast the shut down is fast and loading programs is faster and opening programs is a whole lot faster the first thing was setting it up was a breeze and it only took me about less than 2 minutes to get done with the setting up process and then getting to the actual desktop so far I haven’t ran into any problems.
1,I bought this computer and April 2021. Set it up and immediately had some problems. 2 USB ports were loose. Then kept getting “non-system disk or disk error replace and strike any key when ready”. Then keyboard (not the one that came with it) wasn’t working with computer though it did with my other computers  computers. Called Amazon who attempted to link me to tech support multiple times. They called me back and I spoke with a “specialist” (not sure who he was with) who couldn’t help me. He said no worries he’d link me to another specialist at HP. I was forwarded to a voice mail recorded message saying log onto my HP account which I don’t have. Not the way I wanted to spend my day off. In any case I called Amazon back later on in the day Period the agent told me I could get an exchange but to expect that it’s refurbished and I should probably expect problems. In any case I thought I would try and exchange one more time before getting a refund. This is the first time I ordered anything refurbished. Not a happy customer.
5,Easy to set up runs well. Very quiet. So far so good!!! Thank you!!!
3,Has old graphics. I thought I would be able to add card but has no good slot. Buy only if you know that it will serve your purpose as-is. No scope to augment later. Not suitable for gaming or any heavy processing.
3,Ad said it came with a DVD rom/burner and it did not have one at all. Has had some technical issues that I was able to fix after some time.
5,Overall it’s a good deal for your every single dollar for its configuration. Except the HDD 1TB got bad clusters/Sector I still waiting for their resolution for the 1TB HDD.And very good customer service from gentleman Mr. Lohidh for the replacement and facilitating the process for easy.
4,Very easy to set up and works great
5,This is a great computer so far came up nicely and easy set up. It's hard to write a review on something like this when you have had it for such a short period but for the price it's as advertised.
5,Greentoptech did an excellent job refurbishing this PC. I encountered no problems getting Windows registered and everything set up and operational. The specifications of all components (processor RAM hard drives) were as described. Wired keyboard and mouse included. This PC is an inexpensive powerhouse.
1,WellIt worked for a few days.But now I get this “SMART hard drive imminent failure”.  When waking from “sleep”.Probably need to return it I suppose.Just great…..
2,I got unit quickly & was packaged well although the box was somewhat broken open during shipping.  Came with USB Internet Connector not built in wi-fi  Issue the DVD drive  At first I thought it was the drive not working...  NOPE  The drive had NO Plug in wires for Power. There was No data/power cable wires  attached to the dvd drive  nor did I find any extra wires for the connection.  The unit in general looks good & fast. But DVD issue I can't run anything that needs a disk (programs)...  NOT Happy Camper!  I will be sending back if things don't get fixed!  By having the proper connection plug wires sent to me asap.  Kind of a Crappy wired keyboard/mouse.
5,Customer it good
5,I bought this for my grandkids to use for fun and school work. It worked great right out of the box. Super value.
5,Forgot to buy a mouse pad* haha!I received what I ordered.Smart packaging no damagesAll accessories were includedPlugged into the wall hooked up a monitorTurned it oninstantly on the computer.Received within 2 days of shipping. And for what it’s worth the refurb looks and performs brand new
5,Worked great right out of the box very pleased. Bought for my child and they are very happy with it.  They use it for gaming with no issues.
5,Works great
5,This computer works as expected. I just got another renewed computer from Amazon that wouldn't display after two days so it makes me appreciate this one a lot more. For the price 5 star
5,Had issue with a drive but company sent new one out right away and was up and running in no time. Very fast PC and I am 100% happy with purchase!
5,Out of the box A1. Runs smoothly very pleased with this purchase!
3,The ssd literally caught on fire and fried the motherboard. The sata power line comes off the motherboard rather than come straight out of the psu so now the whole thing is garbage.
5,Good Buy I converted the system to LINUX Mint and it works great. Replaced old harddrive that was dying.Overall good buy!
5,fast delivery--good  price- good for family - Frank in customer service was very helpful during startup
4,Performs well as an general use PC.
5,Started right up responded quickly and updated to current Windows 10 with no problems or delays. Excellent fast display a vast improvement over my old laptop. More than I thought I could get for the money.
5,Works fine for my use.  Great value and delivered as described.
5,Some computers these days are very expensive. I do not need all the bells and whistles so this unit was the perfect fit for me.
2,I don't have time to deal with contacting the company and all the trouble shooting.  I just ignore it but I wouldn't purchase again.
5,I was mistaken in my first review and the HDD is what it says it is -1TB. If I could see a way to see the first review I would remove it. The seller called me right away and showed me how to see it:) Way to go!!!!
1,This product never came with a power cord to the tower??
5,After I realized I needed a WiFi booster everything went great! I’m loving it!! Only downfall is it’s not really loud
1,I was moving and didn’t open this HP computer shipment till this week. I was surprised to find this is a refurbished unit. I hired a professional IT person to hook it up. We discovered it does not have an internal WiFi connector. Instead a USB WiFi adapter was enclosed in the box. That adapter was unable to connect this unit to my home set up. The shipment had not paperwork in it no manual no set up instructions. So now I have had to buy a new USB WiFi adapter and get my IT guy back to try and get this computer working. If I could I would return this shipment for a refund as it is not what was advertised on Amazon. Due to my move status I’ve missed the 90 day return period. Hopefully tomorrow’s round 2 of the installation process will be successful but I am having doubts.Very disappointed
4,Good value!!!
5,i need a activation code for my windows. i tried the one on the tower but it seem the numbers are short
5,With the exception of downloading large files (300mg) it is very fast. The transfer process is fantastic! I transferred files that were over 400gb in no time!
5,I bought this to set up in my home officer for studying/simulating purposes. It was super easy to set up and get everything installed glad I bought this.
2,I received it quickly kept was easy to set up and worked great. 28 days layer I start it up and get a blue screen with I/O error and it can't connect to drives. I called Support # and was sent to voice mail so I sent an email to them as well. Hoping they respond quickly and make. I will update review with outcome.
5,It’s very fast and everything works great. The only thing it was supposed to have WiFi and it doesn’t. I had to run a cable to it.
5,Great renewed PC from Quality  Certified! Computer came nicely packaged and worked perfectly right out the box! Truly plug and play! Would recommend this seller to anyone! A+++
5,Great for price!  Everything as advertised (hardware & software). Easy pain free set up.  No issues minor cosmetic case scratches.  Would buy again!
1,The worst - Nevermind the finger prints all on the mouse - Not even windows 10- Missing security updates - A spy machine  No way to contact the seller - Screen blacks out -
5,had to bye a graphic card to play certain games but works great
5,Love this computer.  It's fast compatible with all my present peripherals no issues with installing Windows 10 Pro.  Works well integrating with my present computer.  So far so good.
5,Does everything they said. Not very load at all.
5,a little hard drive noise but super super fast!!!  No issues so far and I saved a lot of $$ buying reconditioned.
5,Machine came quickly very efficient build for this hardware platform.  Performance is great and I really appreciate that you good folks are giving extended life eol hardware (So much better than throwing it on the scrap heap!).  And...YOU CAN'T BEAT THE PRICE!!!  Please keep up the fine work you're doing!
5,So far so good. Works great. Had Windows 10 installed but I changed to Ubuntu 20.04. I gave up Windows years ago.
5,This computer was very clean with no marks on any kind on the outside and packaged very well.
5,This was a refurbished product but it runs like new. Came with keyboard mouse and wifi adapter.  Great desktop for a great price.
5,Arrived quickly and in perfect shape. Looked brand new inside and out. Works perfectly so far. Would buy from them again.
5,Great PC... quick as a whistle response time... Very Great accommodating seller.. all for a great price.
5,The CD players region had not been selected before it was shipped out. Besides that it appears to be a great machine. Well worth the money
5,I'm not going to lie I was amazed how new it looked when unboxing. Also new mouse and keyboard. Everything worked when setting it up and runs great. A+ so far. Thank you!
5,So far so good. Works as well as expected.
5,As described. Only issue thus far is some USB issues with what should be compatible peripherals.
5,Everything seems to be working really well.  Has Windows 10 Pro which was a great add on value.
5,Added an M2 nvme memory with adapter to help it run fasterno issues si far.
5,Lightnimg fast. Windows came installed on the SSD drive. Was worried which drive before arrival. I'm sure this computer brand new tower alone was probably over a grand. Dont feel like It was so cheap I stole it but Im pleased and surprised with this purchase of a used computer.
3,It works. Old connections on the back. I thought they would at least update some of the connections so you didn’t have to purchase cable converters to connect to newer Peripheral’s.
5,I thank God for Amazon for selling good products.  God bless Amazon for their wonderful products and customer service.Working excellent so far and very fast.  Specifications as advertised.
5,I did not have use for keyboard and mouse that came with the purchase.
5,I was scared at first to order a refurbished computer but this has worked perfectly since I bought it a month ago.
5,Very Satisfied!
5,it's worth it every penny!! it's doing what is suppose to do. Smooth like New Brand!! On Time.
1,I purchased this PC twice. The one purchased on 4/15/21 lasted until July. The one purchased on 7/5/21 died today 1/12/22. I understand that it's refurbished and won't last quite as long but the fact that both machines bricked themselves within six months? I'd go elsewhere. We own a small retail store and are left rebuilding our files again. (Lesson learned. Use the cloud.)Both machines were decent until they became unusable hunks of metal. I don't know that I would have used them for serious gaming but it was fine for what we needed it for—internet word processing etc.
5,Excellent computer! Does exactly what I need it to do.  Thank you!
5,was tiered of my old machine locking up and taking forever this is the cure.
5,The computer works very well and the price compared with others sellers is the best.
1,When i got the computer it did not work it was  a bad one right up form the start
3,We have a had a few issues since receiving it we contacted support and received immediate response initially but then nothing.  It won't restart properly from the prompt   it must be manually shut off and rebooted.We have only had it 5 days but we shall see how it goes glad I bought the extended warranty.
5,Works great. We're happy with our purchase.
5,I don't game and didn't tech support. All is well.
3,As the saying goes you get what you pay for. No problem so far
5,I like it works really well still going strong has it for about 2 months
5,Windows 10 and the HW Match pretty well. Outperfoms older I5 some low spec i7.
5,Very fast and easy set up
5,It is in use as a POS server at a restaurant 24/7.It hasn't broken yet.
5,Very good computer for the price. Upgradeable and very reliable. Super fast too
2,Keyboard is warped and Shift key is broken.  Had concerns with buying HP again after numerous quality issues in the past but thought I’d give them another try.  Seems nothing has changed with their product quality.
1,This Computer's main hard drive has worked fine so far but the secondary 1 tb drive failed at 10 days in so I contacted the seller but never received a reply so I assume I will have to buy a replacement secondary drive install it and hope that the hard drive was faulty and not something in the computer that caused it. Either way I transferred several files to the drive that were lost and can't get back. I blame myself for that but I won't purchase from this seller anymore. I've been a Amazon Customer for years and this is my first 1 star review.
1,Upon receiving the hard drive everything on the outside looked great. Hooked it up to my monitors and tried to turn it on to get started with the setup process and nothing happened. Held the power button down for 10 secs nothing 15 secs nothing and even 20 secs nothing. I even switched out the cords because I thought maybe that was the problem. Nothing!!!!! It would not turn on!!!! I called the number provided on the hard drive and got a voicemail for customer service!!!! I spoke with a Amazon representative who tried to help me troubleshoot it and still NOTHING!!!!!  I will not be purchasing from this company again!!!
2,Update... Wifi adapter completely stopped working.no tech support can fix it...... Easy to set up only quirk was did not detect many wifi signal during initial set up. Once I skipped the wifi connection and it finished setting up all the usual wifi connections were there.
4,The product was a good value for the money.
5,7yr old but don't let that scare you.  Not sure if they refresh spec's but the system started and runs perfectly.  Very pleasantly surprised.
5,Computer came in a timely manner.  Everything worked properly.
5,Home office and work. I am very pleased.
5,Product was what I was expecting.  No issues.  Thank you.
2,Did not come with activation key anywhere on pc other than that pretty okay pc case was scratched up a little also
5,I am enjoying my new desktop ALL is good!
2,I ordered this unit as a computer for my elderly parents. Before I go further let me assure you I am very tech savvy (it is what I do for a living). There was no wifi on the computer and no adapter supplied (the description said wifi). The display ports and several others on the back were partially covered by the back metal piece rendering them useless (they were all advertised in the description of the product).
5,Works great!! Fast!! Just using for work
5,Works great
2,Processor in computer not as listed. Small difference.
5,Problem free computer booting up and operating -  item as described and excellent customer service - recommend
5,My unit had some minor cosmetic damagebut functions just fine. All specs were as described in the description. These are great for the price.
5,I Purchased this computer for a dual monitor trading setup and have had absolutely no problems with the received product and it’s performance.  This is a great value for the price I highly recommend.
1,the computer i got ran very slowly. i bought it as an upgrade to my laptop since it had faster hardware in every way then my laptop and the same windows and it ran significantly slower. I dont know if it was just a bad computer or if it is just a slow computer.
5,Great computer like new.  Thank you.
5,No complaints
5,Good and reliable computer
5,Good features.
5,A well-rebuilt quality unit.
5,ki
5,Love it very fast
5,FAST PERFORMANCE
5,Great price no problems
5,nice machine for the price
5,Good value for the money.
5,Personal home use it was what I wanted once my technician checked it out he said it was a very good unit.
5,Great deal
5,Excellent working
5,Great speed.
1,Update: I have had this computer for just over a year and it is TRASH. It freezes when trying to do more than one thing at a time (browser and word document) I would HIGHLY NOT RECOMMEND.Great computer for the $$$. It does what I need it to do. School light gaming and teaching virtual school. I needed to buy an adaptor for HDMI plugs and ended up using an Ethernet cord because the WiFi adapter was SLOW! I found a good deal on a monitor local. The mouse and keyboard that came with it are garbage but I wasn’t buying this item for them anyway. I would recommend if you just need a good all around desktop.
5,okay
3,I liked the price. I did not like that the main storage drive is much smaller then the other installed drive.
5,It boots up super quickly everything is working great. The tower case looks almost new. Thanks
5,Lightening fast!
1,Well for about a month I was very happy with this computer until of all days on tax day I sat down to file our taxes and it decided that it was no longer going to recognize the hard drive and kept going to a blue screen and then a black screen stating there was no hard drive installed. Needless to say I was immediately panic stricken and had to go to Best Buy and purchase a laptop immediately not just to file taxes but also because we have a business and cannot function without a computer.
5,Great price. Super fast
5,Very satisfied
1,I thought the computer was fine until I tried to install Norton Security.  Norton would not install - keep sending an error code.  After 2 days of trying I contract Norton.  Their technician said there was something wrong with the hard drive.  I did not transfer any of my data to this computer.  I gave them access and they showed me all the files that were left on the computer and the computer had a virus.  They said it would take 3 hours to clean the computer and remove the virus.  It would cost me another $99.00.  I have Norton on my other computer so this install should be free.  I was not about to pay them to cleanup this computer.  I returned it to Amazon.
5,Everything was as described. Good PC.
1,The “blue screen of death” appeared Oct 25th. Return window closed Oct 1st. Lesson learned: don’t buy refurbished without extended warranty . This machine acted strange ( not booting right calling for different screen resolutions freezing up) and I thought about returning it before 90 days were up but did not. My loss. If you buy a refurbished machine at the first hint that something may be going wrong within 90 day return window- return it.
5,I am very happy with both the price and the product
5,Very nice upgradeable pc for work or fun
1,There has to be a better product out there and the seller of this particular item should be ashamed of themselves.  This unit is garbage plain and simple.  I have put it away in the closest in case one of my two computers die and I need a replacement until I get a new one.  Buy from another seller.
1,Bought this unit in October of 2019 had it for a year computer started to make trouble had to force it to shut down and reboot worked for a some  times ! Unit quit blue screen said it will go in self repair mode never rebooted again !Brought to local repair company turned out the SSD was bad cost me $ 278- to replace SSD and save data ! Also came with broken off nut for monitor plug was somehow flimsy connected but worked !I regret not to buy a new Computer !!
1,Got my first one because I wanted the SSD and the HDD hybrid. First month it was a little noisy with the fan but okay I could deal. Friday it would not boot up gave me 4 beeps which is usually a motherboard issue. Ordered the replacement one. it came in today and wont boot. Says Non-System Disk or Disk Error. Now they say they will just refund me my money when I tried to order a replacement.
1,This computer worked great for light everyday use (email browsing etc - no gaming) for 8 months. It started giving me the blue screen of death out of nowhere about a week ago. I’ve run every diagnostic possible and it can’t find any error. Now it gives the BSOD immediately on startup and since it didn’t come with a recovery disc I’m completely screwed.
1,Product was supposedly checked to be in perfect working order.  When it arrived and installed the start up button was sticking.  Would take 2 or 3 tries to get the start up button to pop out and the computer to turn on.  Also when tried the DVD the button would light up but the DVD would not open and would just make sounds. Shipping box was fine on the outside and the product was packed very well so have to assume is was poorly inspected or checked by the seller before putting it up for sale.
1,The computer was shipped w 1 small piece of bubble wrap. VERY loosely packaged in box. You could hear something inside of computer rattling around when I removed it from box. Had lot of horizontal lines running through screen when hooked up. When I got it setup and tried to restart it I got a "BOOT FAIL" message and had to turn off the computer and restart it that way. BTW- NO HDMI PORT!
1,The USB wifi adapter does not work for more than 5 minutes without kicking me out and reconnecting. Customer support has not helped horrible unless you have the capability to hardwire this to your modem do not purchase
1,Did not power up made noises then quit
2,Drops internet every 5 minutes. The computer is slow and is constantly dropping the internet. I will try to contact seller.
1,I needed a new computer. the price was right and it had the Amazon certified refurbished listed so how could I go wrong?  when I got the machine the disk drive would not open the wifi didn't work and the machine had trouble loading from the internet.  Don't really trust the refurbished with Amazon certifaction.
1,Probably an ok PC. Not a fan of the free live spider included in the box. Spiders aren't really my thing and I couldn't find this feature listed in the description. Currently debating on whether or not to send it back or burn the box and all its contents. Leaning towards the fire option.
5,Lovely and Beautiful
1,not a good value
1,After having this PC for just two days it crashed on me. When I started it up the screen was black with the text “BOOTMGR is missing.” I tried restarting several times with the same result. Do not waste your money buying from this seller clearly the computers have not been thorough examined or “renewed.”
1,This computer would not start. I could turn it on but it just made strange noises and never showed me any kind of picture on my monitor. I have been trying to return it but have been unable to get anyone from Amazon on the phone or return it due to Kohl's and other return places being closed due to the coronavirus. I am looking for someone to make this right but have been unable to get any live person on the phone to help me.
1,Less than a month and quits working. “No boot option”. Tech support wants me to take it to a computer repair shop and pay to have it repaired or buy another hard drive. The worst customer service. Should have read the reviews.
1,Apparently they don't use new hard drives when refurbishing and no testing. Arrived with hard drive down on 1st boot. 2 emails and 5 days to hear back from thier support. Avoid Skytech others on Amazon do much better
1,I only wanted a journeyman computer to do basic tasks.  This was a piece of crap.  I finally installed a solid state hard drive.  It works okay now but I deeply regret the purchase.
1,Worked got it all set up the next day got and error called tech they sent me a file to redo windows did that still had problems....guess what it got returened!!!
1,System not working properly. Operating system crashed on the 2nd day. Planning on requesting return/refund upon my return from 1 week vacation out of town.
1,It died and not even a year . Just swapped out power supply and nothing.
1,Started up just fine long enough for me to spend 4 hours Christmas Eve setting it up. Only for it to not start back up again after it was the primary gift for a very disappointed 13 year old. Will never buy refurbished again.
1,The computer would not boot properly and the supplier was unable to assist with fixing it.  Shipment of a replacement is taking much much too long after the problem was acknowledged.
1,It crashed within 1/2 hour after I started it up.  And does not work at all now.  It was a big mistake to buy and I do not recommend it to anyone.
1,See above!
1,TERRIBLE SERVICE.  NEVER WORKED.  DON'T DO IT.
1,It only lasted a few months and now it boots with beeps which I google to learn it's a bad motherboard.
1,Crashed and unit has NO recovery disc.  Stuck with return shipping fee.
1,This cost me a day of business and paying an IT person to set up! Will not be purchasing anything "refurbished"  from anyone other then a local in person service again.
1,I actually can’t write a review for this as it arrived damaged. The box is all ripped up so I haven’t even taken it out yet
1,My  computer crashed the second week I had it and have had to return it.  When it worked it was great.
1,Had to send back the $300 paper weight. D.O.A.Didn’t bother getting another refurbished as my time is more valuable. Thanks but no thanks.
1,The computer would not boot up and it was covered in dust inside and out. It was returned. Don't waste your time.
1,Bought 03/18/21. Hard drive failure. Computer crashed after 5 months. Minimal use only.
1,Stopped working within a month no return on email call center was no help
1,This product was not as advertised.  Did not have a DVD as they claimed. Returned it only to find out that they charge a 25% restock fee.
1,Computer doesn't work after less than a year of very light usage. Only the fans turn on now with nothing on the screen; hardly used computer.
1,Don’t buy such recycled computer they won’t last. Mine showed problems the first day I bought it.
5,I ordered this computer to work from home...emails browsing the web etc and it does the job!  System is pretty fast and priced very well!  Only thing is that you would need a cable to connect to the monitor.  Would definitely recommend for anyone working from home!
1,Arrived with defective mother board
5,Todo me gustó del equipo totalmente recomendado
1,
5,Price and Material quality is awesome!
1,Not good for gaming
1,I was sold a computer with a bad hard drive
1,Failed to work  returned for credit.  Wouldn't boot & failed to have signal on two working monitors I tested  so returned.
1,Mouse came broken in several pieces
5,Great product
1,Died after 6 weeks.
1,My second straight piece of refurbished crap. Would not turn on Never again!!!!
1,My husband received this broken and had to return it.
1,I purchased a Windows 10 Pro OS 64 And received an OS 32.This is computer is unable to install Windows 10 updates therefore This PC doesn't meet the requirements to install and run Windows 11.It doesn't even run Windows 10 I am directly wired to cable hi-speed Internet and every time I log on I immediately lose connection.Because I am unable to complete the Windows 10 updates I can't install Windows 11 either. I log on to the Internet and am immediately dropped.System is built on a 1998 baseboard.
5,Working great so far initial set-up same as brand new no issues for me. No bloatware just normal microsoft trials etc.  Unit is clean and appears to be very lightly used. New drive is a plus. Would recommend.
4,I was skeptical about a refurbished PC but so far so good.  The machine is in good condition.  The setup was super quick and easy.  It is fast and very quiet.  Let's hope it lasts as while.
5,Very satisfied with the computer and the installation of the OS
5,I bought this computer to replace my old desktop. It is a great value.
5,This Pc can console stream for ps4 & PS5 % any xbox
1,If I could give this 0 stars I would. After using this for just 9 months for work and nothing else it completely crapped out. I've had Macs my entire life and never had a problem and 9 months of this piece of junk and it no longer works. I will never purchase an HP computer again.
1,The home computer only worked for one day and I haven't been able to get in touch with the seller very disappointed at this product I have gotten no service from this product it want boot I  need a replacement or a refund from the seller or Amazon I went back and read the review and found out that this kind of stuff has happen more often than normal. Again very disappointed and dissatisfied being a long time Amazon prime member this is first time that I have been badly let down in the purchase of a product you approved of from a vendor or third party
1,this product was not as advertised; did not have wi-fi.  I returned it within 4 days and have not received my refund in more than 9 days.
5,I've had this PC online now for a couple of weeks now and so-far-so-good!The unit I received was in great shape; no physical damage to the case no missing screws or covers etc.  Upon inspection of the interior everything looked good; no unplugged cables dislodged boards etc.Upon first power-up it booted without any issues. I went through the Windows setup it did an update and then was ready to work.  Since Windows OS is installed on the SSD it boots very fast typically about 10-15 seconds.  The Intel i5 Quad-core processor is plenty fast for my needs as is the 16GB of SDRAM and having a 1TB hard-disc drive gives plenty of reserve storage capacity for programs data docs videos and pictures etc.I'm using dual 22" wide-screen monitors so having the two "Display Port" video outputs made monitor connections very fast and easy (using two DP-to-HDMI cables).Overall I'm very satisfied with the unit.  Only time will tell how well it lasts!
5,I needed this system as described and it is.  It came in one day ahead of time with every product description correct. Since this is summertime in Texas I let it sit overnight to acclimate to the temperature and started to hook it up the next day. Everything worked except the wifi which just needed a reset and it did.  I am very pleased with the outside and inside of the unit and the price I paid for the unit.  Bingo.  And no Microsoft Bloatware.
5,I read the review. Be ready for taking care of it yourself.  Thing is? It worked perfect followed everything said.  It is now a standy by workstation to write and develop code. No games needed.All software Extra was installed easily network added.yes network dongle was replaced by high speed but they tried.
5,This is a great buy.  computer is very fast and smooth.  The case is in very good condition.The keyboard is also  good.  The only issue  was the mouse was very worn but I have aspare and a mouse is very cheap and insignificant to replace new.  Overall very happy.
4,The computer is fine... the one I got was refurbished claimed to come with windows 10 and an SSD boot disk. It did not. It did have a 1TB drive but no OS and no boot SSD.  Seller did not return messages and only option was to return it. I needed a computer badly and did not want Windows 10 in any case so I kept it and lost on the SSD. BEWARE. Item was shipped and sold by RefurbishedPC Store
5,We have it hooked up  it came in perfect condition and arrived a lot sooner than expected.  We have been busy so we haven't had the opportunity to use it as of yet.It's absolutely beautiful.
5,Frank at customer service took care of me and helped me through the issues I had. Appreciate a great company fun to work with and great product!
5,Good value for the price very affordable
3,From the specs on Amazon you might think that it is steal deal but it is not mentioned on the description that it is an old generation processor 4th. Processor is slow even and overall pc is good for daily ms office work. If you are looking for photo/movie editing software to be installed please don’t buy this pc.
4,this computer is good stuff! for the money. i just wish it had a little better dvd/cd rom in it. but it is much better than my old one. and cheaper... thank you!
5,Great Product little bit damaged from outside but everything works Fine and great.
5,The product came as advertised and c'mon for the price this is a steal 16gb ram 1tb hdd and its I5 dobe done done thank you
5,It is very quietfast and obedient!
5,I am satisfied with the desktop computer no problems at all. Now I am enjoying my computer.Thank You.
5,Frank was great.  Very good customer service.
5,Fantastic computer and super-fast service at a great price. Thank you!
5,when I got the computer the DVD drive was not working 1 message to the vender and a replacement drive was sent Fedex. Simple swap with the dead drive and everything now works great. Also this PC boots very quickly due to the SSD system disk. SWEET
4,Computer is fast and great value but mouse AND DVD player were broken.  Replacement parts were sent out promptly BUT had to pay out of pocket for DVD player and then got voucher for credit which apparently only applies to certain items.  Still trying to figure out which ones.
5,I was so upset when my old computer died.  I took a chance and thought I see what Amazon had available.  I found what I wanted and ordered it.  I am so pleased with my purchase.
5,Works great out of the box. Exactly what we were looking for! Thanks Lisa!
5,I updated from  Windows 7 to Windows 10 with this computer. I had delayed because friends told me it was a difficult transition. It wasn't with one exception. I had used PC Matic for a number of years and it has worked well. I called PC Matic this last weekend to add PC Matic and was supposedly transferred to a technician. He told me that the Windows Program in my computer would stop working and was only a temporary program.  As a result he could not install PC Matic. What I needed was his technician to install large portions of Windows that did not come with my installation. There was a $60 fee for this service. Then I should have a yearly subscription that would cost $150 per year.  This sounded like a scam. But then why would PC Matic be involved with something like this? SO!  2 days later.  It was a scam. During week days I went back to PC Matic and they installed their program on my computer. Everything works great .Is my Windows 10 a temporary partial installation?
4,VERY HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT
1,N/A
5,Definitely the bang for the buck extremely good offer
5,It was easy to get it going and it has been working well.
1,Don’t waste yer money
4,as a refurbished computer goes these are clean and in excellent condition inside and out.  A nice workhorse computer for on line tasks with plenty of hard disk space (it really has a 1TB hard drive). Add some basic programs and its good  for most every student or home/office needs.  It has NO HDMI video feed (for your big screen hi deff TV)  but you can get an inexpensive converter cable to convert its hi deff "DisplayPort" video output to HDMI for about 6 bucks.I am quite happy with the video quality and overall performance of this computer.  If you need a desktop computer this one is hard to beat for price (about 250 bucks).  video performance and out of the box hard disk space.
5,UPDATE: After 6 weeks of operation at 28 hours average per week the 1TB HDD failed! This is the first time I have had an actual HDD fail on me in 50-yeers of computing (starting out in CP/M computers). Will see how the support is for it...I have found this Refurbished HP Business Computer to be the BEST VALUE in computers right now! I highly recommend this computer for the None Gaming Computer User though it does well on games too!I have 4 of these computers on my Home Network and they have been flawless performers. Great computer at a very good price. I have given 2 of them to family members for their use and they have no complaints!When you can get a 16GB RAM computer with a 512gb SSD Boot drive with Win-10Pro and 2-TB Data HDD VGA port 2 display ports 10-USB ports (4@3.0) Internal DVD-RW for around $320 that is a heck of a deal!The earlier computers have been running every day on the network for 3-years without error!
5,Love it for game and other things
5,Work
5,Purchased this for a computer lab where it is used by many people. Works just fine. Needed for simple tasks and is capable of more than it is used.
5,I had some problem first but they handle it very well!
3,When I first got this computer there were a few things I noticed. Firstly the side panel was loose and there was no screw in the back to (rather uselessly) keep it in place. Okay its refurbished. Slight problem. The other being the dented in heat sink for the CPU fan. Again refurbished. The last post-opening issue is the PSU's cord is way to small but that's easily rectified. Of course mine was a pro-desk instead of an elite-desk but considering I dont know the actual differences I don't know how much a cheat that is.On to launching the pc of which it started fast! And straight to the setup for Windows 10. It's nice and straightforward with a digital key activation at the end. Keep in mind that you'll need an ethernet cable to have access to the internet until you can download the necessary Windows updates to use either the built in wifi or an adapter (I personally used the latter).Checking the pc components everything is as promised. The cpu is indeed an i5- 4th generation 16gb ram 256 (a slight bit lower but that's expected) ssd 1tb(again a bit lower) hdd and everything ran fine the first day.In terms of using graphics heavy programs such as modeling programs or recent video games this pc will definitely not be for you *unless* you spend an additional 300 or so dollars for a dedicated low profile gpu. It should excel at doing pretty much anything else however.Enough of the good stuff heres the bad. Yesterday when I received the product the computer ran as expected and was as quiet as a sleeping baby. However when I started it today a thumping noise could be heard from the case. After putting my ear to it and feeling where the thumping was coming from it became increasingly clear that it was the hdd. It generates a loud thump whenever it writes or reads files. I've had a pc do this in the past right before the hdd failed and became a useless piece of metal so the one that I got is likely going to end up being the same way.In terms of support I've contacted skytech USA llc the company that appeared on the box and this store page as I purchased it. They've stated they dont even know what this computer is.I've contacted astsys the company that has their support stickers on the computer. There hasn't been a peep yet but I suspect they're closed at the moment so I'll wait until tomorrow to get a response.Lastly Amazon tech support suggested a return and refund. I was hoping for a replaced hdd instead but if astsys doesnt respond I'll take their advice. I'll update this review once I take either option.TL;DR Great when it works but remember that its refurbished and something might go wrong the very next day or 3 months out. Play smart and get the additional warranty and hope for the best if you're going to purchase this.EDIT 1: Maybe my edit will save this time. Anyway Astsys answered back and offered a pre-paid replacement for the faulty HDD the very next day at 6:00 AM. They were quick and understood the situation immediately answering every query I threw at them along the way. I'm hoping the new hard drive will work but the support is definitely admirable! Because of this I'll up my review score accordingly.EDIT 2: Got the new hdd. Right off the bat I'm disappointed to see yet *another* Seagate Constellation. But I gave it a chance slid it into the tray nice and easy booted the computer and! *drumroll* it had the same thumping noise the old one had only slightly quieter now. Is this a Seagate classic? It's still loud enough and constant enough to be greatly annoying. I'm going to contact support once again with images of the innards to see if they cant find anything wrong with the chassis. If they suggest another replacement hdd I'm going to refuse and just buy some other one to throw in there instead. I'll be deducting the review score for now. I'm sure the Amazon review verification team love me by now with all the edits I'm throwing here.
1,Product is advertised to include Windows 10 but a label on the back says it is Windows 8. The case has been spray painted with black paint. Whoever did it didn't bother to mask off the rear connectors or the labels on the side. As a result paint has bled onto the connectors and onto the labels. A USB dongle is included but there is no matching hardware--the included keyboard and mouse are both connected via the rear hubs. I have not opened the case but I am expecting to find something amiss. Very sloppy work. [I will update this review tomorrow after opening the case.]Update: I could not open the case: it was spray painted shut. This is sloppy refurbishment work at best.
4,GOOD FAST SYSTEM FOR A LOW PRICE !  5 STARS
4,Everyday computing  checking e-mails  social websites  surfing.Though the harddrive is making some weird noise not sure if that's normal.  Also with reading other reviewers  I agree that the WiFi card is not very good.  Have to reconnect once a day.
1,Don't buy this unless you want to deal with a headache. BUY FROM SOMONE ELSE!!
5,My new P.C. for gaming which my mom calls everything nintendo-xbox=nintendocomputer=Nintendo everything gaming is Nintendo.  Well this P.C. works better then whatever Nintendo my mom keeps talking about.  It's a good starter computer I also bought a graphics card to add to it.
5,Power cable was bad out of the box and Tech Support got me up and running quickly!  Thanks!!!
5,This computer is FAST!!The cabinet does not look shiny and new but it’s what’s inside that counts.It runs quietly and quickly. I’m very happy with it. I don’t use it for gaming but the way it navigates through my needs makes me feel confident it could handle gaming.
5,Really nice and works great and great price.
1,I need reliable equipment
5,Great price works well
5,I bought the computer for work (at home) and it’s been a breeze to use. It arrived on time and was well packaged. The computer itself had one barely noticeable scuff but other than that it’s basically brand new. It’s super fast didn’t come with a ton of bloatware connected perfectly to my monitor and was ready to use. One thing I will mentioned for anyone looking to buy this computer is that it only comes with a female VGA port and the “display” ports which look like they’re regular HDMI ports but are not. So if you’re buying a monitor as well then I would suggest buying a VGA cord that has both male ends. Other than that it’s a pretty awesome machine
1,IT SAYS IT HAS WIFI AND DVD IT DOES NOT HAVE THAT EVEN THOUGH PIC AND HEADING SAYS IT DOES.WHEN I CALLED THEY SAID IT WAS NOT INCLUDED BUT COULD NOT GIVE REASON FOR ANYTHING. THE PERSON I TALKED TO I COULD BARELY UNDERSTAND PITIYFUL
5,so far so good
5,We are very happy with our new computer.
5,My old HP desktop died due to a power surge.  Was scrambling to find something affordable in a pinch and stumbled across this.  This is a great desktop for a used PC.  I mean it is super-fast starts up immediately. allows me to get stuff done without all that lag.  As others have said get rid of the keyboard it came with and use your own.  Has enough usb ports on the front and back if you want to do a wireless keyboard and mouse.  It was well packaged and nothing was loose or broken in the inside.  I love it and would definitely recommend it.
5,Excellent.  Only problem with setup was that there was no wifi ability. Luckily I had an adapter from my old computer and that worked.  This computer is super fast.  It loads from startup in a few seconds. I've never seen anything work so well.
2,the thing worked for 2 days third day boot up says no disk in drive or nonsys disk replace disk and hit any key to boot tried to call customer support and put on hold  which after 45 minutes disconnected. sent email recieved no answer
5,Used for home office. 16 gig of memory and a fast  SSD and additional drive.
5,The computer failed after one day. The tech support was good to send a replacement and it's been working great ever since. Thanks!
1,I bought this computer and everything was fine until 2 weeks later when it was not fine.The computer refuses to boot and there is NO boot disk or NOTHING in the box just the computer which is now NOT booting up.Very bad practice and you have wasted a week of my time already.
5,No dislikes. Product was easy to set up and begin using.
5,Surfing the net in a few minutes. Fast start up. Installed my wireless keyboard and mouse. Very happy.
5,great computer
5,Got it to do photo editing. It’s fast enough and had plenty of storage. The solid state drive makes it boot up very quickly.
5,Great buy for those who still want a desktop Tower Unit..
5,Use it all the time. Very fast. Works great
5,Thanks.
5,It is hard to believe this is a refurbished/renewed machine. It came in pristine condition and started up flawlessly! I opened the cabinet when I got it to make sure everything was still in place and was pleasantly surprise to see how exceptionally clean it was inside and of course everything was where it belonged and was all connected!The only MINOR complaint I have is the rear audio outputs do not function. Not yet sure what that is but I'll find out. Otherwise I'm am very pleased with this computer. It really came to me looking brand new!I do not use my computers for gaming but I suspect this would have been great for that purpose.Update. It appears to have been "operator error" regarding the rear audio outputs. I misread the symbols and found I had the speaker plugged initially into the wrong jack. Once corrected everything works great now.
5,So far so good. Noise level is minimal unlike my previous pc. I'm pretty happy up to now.
2,It worked for about 2 weeks . However did return item and got my money back.  No more refurbished computers
5,When it was delivered and I tried to push the start button the PC would beep and shut down before booting. I had to open it and reset the Bios battery.The boot drive was just the slow HDD. There was no SSD in the machine as advertised. For someone who doesn't know how to identify the type of drive installed they would just have thought the PC is really slow. I contacted  seller somebody replied within a few hours and I received a SSD 3 days later.I had to install it and they had forgotten to send the cable with it so I had to use one of my own. I contacted them again and they send a wire 4 days later.Overall the PC performs really well with Office Photoshop CS5 illustrator and even inDesign.The keyboard mouse and Wifi dongle are basically unusable but for the price that's what I expected.Most people will need to buy a decent Wifi/bluetooth dongle and a display port to HDMI converter (unless they have a screen with a Display port but that's very unusual) in addition to a keyboard and mouse. That's an additional $50-$100 you have to anticipate.If I had no knowledge of how to troubleshoot power failure and install/swap the hard drive I would have returned the PC. It's good deal if you're a bit tech savvy.
4,Item as described. Arrived in good time. I have been using item for a few months now. It does everything I try to do with it. Loads faster than my newer laptop. I used speakers wireless mouse  dual monitors PC speakers USB headset all without issues. The only thing that concerns me is sometimes when I start it a black screen with white writing pops up with a beep and says an IDE device has failed and seems it doesnr recognize my hard drive. Then I restart it using the power button and it's fine. Would buy again but would feel better to solve what's up with the error.Because of that issue I am not sure I would reccomend the item though.
2,Product in good condition. But started to dont work well after 3 or 4 uses. We just installed google chrome on it. Return and refound were easy.
5,I bought this system as an inexpensive upgradable all-around PC. It's been very solid with the exception of one problem but the seller was right on it and solved the issue promptly and with zero hassle.I should clarify that I'm fussy about computers and my needs are very specific. What I want is a reliable upgradable standard computer that gets the job done with no complications. This does the job.The system itself comes a not-cutting-edge but perfectly capable and speedy processor a solid SSD a spacious hard drive and an optical drive for those legacy applications. The two DisplayPort video outs will handle monitors equipped with DisplayPort or as in my case monitors with HDMI with the addition of a simple and inexpensive cable. There are 10 USB ports of which 4 are the blue SuperSpeed - 2 each on the front and back. The drives are easily mounted and swapped out being on a rack and access to the case is by a simple no-tools-required latch. The system came with 2x 8GB dimms leaving 2 slots for upgrade which I did. It came configured to boot and use the OS (Windows 10) from the SSD which is faster than having it on the HDD.I was initially surprised that the wifi is a tiny USB stick rather than an internal card - I made sure to put it in one of the blue SuperSpeed ports. It only picked up the 2G side of my wifi network rather than the 5G - but all it said in the product description was "WIFI" so I'm okay with that. I was prepared with a wifi card with 5G and antennas but it honestly hasn't been necessary. I have no idea how that tiny little stick does it but is works better than the card did antennas and all. The 2G connection is more stable at this range from the router and it's been more than fast enough with no dropouts. Yeah it takes up a port but there are plenty. I'm impressed.Most appreciated of all was that it came with Windows 10 and that's it - as in no none zero stupid annoying adware bloatware manufacturer crapware or worst of all "trial" security software always flashing urgent "buy this or else" notifications that slow down the system so badly that a real virus would be preferable. Just bone-standard pristine Windows 10! Thank you for keeping it simple! What a savings of both time and annoyance!If these are the advantages of a "renewed" system vs. a new one I'll take the renewed thanks.I did have one issue. The optical drive did not work. I tried everything but it would only spin up never read discs. I got on Amazon's "Problem with..." system and had a chat reply in minutes offering a replacement external at no charge. I asked for an internal instead and they sent me an internal instead. I really appreciated that the seller took the risk - it would be understandable that a consumer might not install properly leaving the seller with another issue - but they took me at my word that I could install it and showed up the next day. It swapped out easily; it's in there now and working fine. Thanks again!All in all I highly recommend this product and seller for anyone in need of a good solid PC for a good price.
4,Light use for home office.  Works fine so far.  Very happy with sellers prompt replacement of parts.
5,Easy to install... works well and fast... good price and value compared to a brand new computer !
4,Runs games at low settings. Roblox and stuff is pretty good. Everything runs fine
1,2.5 weeks to receive a completed piece of crap not as pictured or descibed  no dvd  let alone the size of a dvd  no 1TB HDD no wifi  WARNING dont buy this
5,I like it
4,Setup was easy. Nearly tossed the wi-fi usb in the garbage as it's so small. Not a gaming computer just a good basic computer.
4,Desktop was as described. Set up and running with no problems.
5,This pc is fast and quiet. I wish I had bought it sooner. My previous HP chugged along but did not have the ram this does. Meets all my needs and then some. I must mention it not only runs like a new one but was blemish free.
5,Haven’t tried games but works great for net surfing email and so on.
5,Really happy with speed and price! Works great with Adobe Photoshop Lightroom! Very fast boot! Fastest computer I've ever had!
1,After one hour of use.  It fails to boot has message about imminent failure.
1,I just got it set up.  Well sort of.  I find it hard to navigate. My old computer was so simple. I might get used to it yet.
1,After one hour of use.  It fails to boot has message about imminent failure.
