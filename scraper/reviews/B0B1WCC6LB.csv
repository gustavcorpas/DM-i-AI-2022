5,Got for my son birthday present to go along with switch sports. So much more fun!
5,My son uses every piece for his Switch Sports Game. He loves it!
5,Easy to use lots and lots of fun. Definitely worth the purchase.
5,Works well
5,I really like this set as long as you have the game that goes with it it works wonderful
5,I love all of the options that this set provides.  I have both a soccer player and tennis player in the house and this meets both of their needs. The rackets though obviously smaller than real tennis rackets provide a more realistic experience than just swinging a controller. It's a nice change to see the kids sweating in front of the TV instead of playing sedentary games. Eventually my hope is the other accessories will encourage them to try out the less familiar sports and perhaps get them to try those in real life as well.
5,This is a pretty cool kit which my daughter uses with with her Nintendo Sports game. Has great accessories for tennis golf  sword fighting  and leg straps for games like soccer. The items are well constructed and easy to attach. Definitely elevates your game experience. All the pieces are well made.
5,This is a great variety pack of accessories for the Nintendo Switch.  One of my favorite ideas with this pack is the kids will get up and move around more utilizing these accessories.  They were packaged well and arrived in perfect condition.  Now for the fun to begin!
