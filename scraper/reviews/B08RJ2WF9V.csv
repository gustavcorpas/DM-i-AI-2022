5,I‚Äôve bought a few of this style in other brands and had issues.  I‚Äôve been using this for nearly 2 months and so far it‚Äôs GREAT!!  I don‚Äôt use it for headphones but it‚Äôs great for my Apple Watch & iPhone!  It‚Äôs good enough that I‚Äôm buying a 2nd to have one at work and one at home!
5,I have a slightly chunky case on my phone- raised area around the camera. It fits my iPhone 12 Pro perfectly though. I love that there aren‚Äôt multiple needed cords for all the different charge spots. It charges my phone very quickly! Highly recommend!
4,Phone ear buds & watch charging at the same time.  I‚Äôve ordered two-one for my office & the other beside my bed.  It eliminates wires & other charging devices.
4,I like that it‚Äôs got a nice sturdy build not flimsy and cheap.Easy to use right in my nightstand. I am able to just drop cell and earphones and go.I‚Äôve only had it about 2 weeks if anything goes south I will update
4,Not as strong of a charger as I thought it would be. Definitely not a fast charger if you‚Äôre looking for something quick. It does the job if you leave it sit over night. Not a bad buy though.
5,This product may be a little more than some other brands but it works great!  It charges right through my case which is just silicon and charges my Apple Watch series 7 perfectly.  I like it so much I bought my husband one as well.
5,Very easy to just throw your electronics on the stand and it starts charging. The only issue I‚Äôve had is that my otter box for my iPhone is sometimes tricky and doesn‚Äôt charge but if you put it in a certain position it does okay.
5,I love this charger for it does exactly what they say it will do.  Great quality and easy charging all on one unit.  No messy wires.  Easy to travel with.
5,This is so awesome for apple people! My daughter is a teacher and took her watch charger that came with watch to school. Needed something for home. This is the perfect fit. She has compatible AirPods and uses for her phone watch and pods nightly. It is a must have for anyone with all the devices. I am pleased that it‚Äôs still just as powerful over a month later. Winner purchase for sure!
5,I have not used for travel yet but I am a fan of this charger for keeping my cell AirPods & watch all in one place charging and the best there is only 1 cord/outlet to deal with.
4,I received my charging station without the chord hence the 4 star rating- however when I reached out to customer service they replied and shipped a chord ASAP which I‚Äôm happy to report!Also note this does not charge an iPhone 8‚Ä¶I think I was a little confused by the compatibility details in the product description.
5,It's a compact charging station that utilizes height versus width. This allows it to fit in more narrow spaces. I keep mine on my desk so I can have my phone and AirPods charging while I study after getting home. It's also the perfect viewing angle so I can use my phone while it is on the stand. Definitely not for travel though.The setup was easy. Just plug the cord into the wall converter and the stand. I also love that the indicator lights for everything are on the front of the stand so you don't have to guess if anything is charging.
5,It works so far. ‚ÄúRapid‚Äù charging doesn‚Äôt really seem to be a thing but it does charge my phone even through the case- which is nice. I saw some complain that one of the three charging stations stopped working after a time. I like it overall and I‚Äôm going to order another one off if it continues to work.
5,Great product works well love that you can charge your phone and watchYes I would recommend
5,This stand works great! I had a similar one before but it stopped charging my phone or would be blinking in the middle of the night. This charges my phone easily through my Otter-pop case (without the pop socket on) and the charging lights are in a spot that don‚Äôt interfere with my dark sleep! Definitely recommend!
4,Customer service was great. Initially I gave a poor review. Without making any request for an exchange Customer service reached out and sent a new unit. Working with iPhone 13 max with folio case and Apple Watch. Great service and 3 in 1 charger. Would recommend.
5,Only had it for about a month so can‚Äôt comment on longevity but it charges super quick and looks great on my nightstand. Love it
4,This docking station is cute and functional. It travels easy and charges all it says it dies at once. The only issue is that it charges my phone pretty slowly but I am very happy with this purchase.
5,Works great charges fast compact easy to use all you need to know.
4,Can be summed up as a Jack of all trades but master of none. Good if you leave your devices to charge overnight however if you‚Äôre looking for fast charging this isn‚Äôt it. Charging for my Apple Watch series 6 has been really slow in comparison to the standard 5W Apple Charger.
5,This clears up so much space on my nightstand. I looked at a lot of these and this was the sleekest looking one. I use it to charge my phone at night but it seems to charge pretty fast.
5,Love it. Charged phone watch and pods with the use of one wire. Unlike others you don‚Äôt have to run wires inside it so it will charged all three items at once. It‚Äôs sturdy so does not easily fall over. It‚Äôs nice to be organized on my nightstand. Recommend if you have apple products don‚Äôt know about other brands.
5,I love mine- charges quickly and saves space from several wires. Absolutely recommend
4,Quick shipping multi purpose is nice.  Phone seems to charge a little slow but overall charges everything.
5,Well this was amazing until it wasn‚Äôt! Now the watch charger doesn‚Äôt work. So I‚Äôm back to multiple chargers. Disappointing.Updated- company contacted me to resolve the issue. A+ customer service
4,Can‚Äôt get the back part to work but I love this product
5,I love how little space this takes up on my nightstand! Works great with my AirPods watch and iPhone!
5,It‚Äôs does work.
4,After my original review their customer service team reached out to me and offered a couple of options.  I could get a new unit a refund or a credit towards another product.  I like the product because it's one of the few solutions where the charging areas are in-line front to back rather than side by side taking up less space on my nightstand.I opted to try a replacement unit.  It was shipped out promptly and I received it a short time afterwards.  I set up the new unit and placed the phone on it.  It has been a few days now and I have not woken up to a blinking red light. So I think we have a winner!The reason I favor this unit over the others is that it's narrow and the charging areas aligned front to back rather than right to left. If you have limited space this is the one you want.
5,I bought the light blue one and it‚Äôs exactly like the picture! It charges my watch and phone super fast. I have not been able to use the charger for the headphones yet because I can‚Äôt find my case. But it‚Äôs has simplified my mess of wires next to my bed and that‚Äôs the most important thing for me!
4,Cable is too short but overall it‚Äôs ok 4 stars
4,Works great for my AirPods and Apple Watch but my phone case is a Loopy and unfortunately it won‚Äôt charge with one of these cases.  Also won‚Äôt work with Pop Socket.  üòû
5,All parts work great
5,But it turned out to be great. I honestly don‚Äôt have any complaints. I have an iPhone 11 air pods pro and an Apple Watch 6. They all charge together perfectly. I‚Äôm so happy because I‚Äôm a very picky want everything perfect kinda person. Lol.. Very handy!
5,I am very pleased with this charger. It works for my iPhone Airbuds and Apple Watch 7 and it takes up very little space on my nightstand. The caveat is that when I read that its charger for the Apple Watch was rated at 5W I made the incorrect assumption that this would support fast charging. It doesn‚Äôt. The charging rate for my watch is less that one-third of that produced by the mag-safe unit that came with the watch. This is not a big problem for me since I generally charge my watch overnight.
5,I like everything so much I have told 4 of my friends and they love theirs too.
5,Works great
4,Very nice product - it feels well built.The watch and phone sit well and easily.The pod case sits on a flat area and you have to be a little careful that you have it right.The charging is slow but not a problem if you sit your devices on it overnight.For me the slow charge of the watch (+15% battery in 30 minutes) is a drawback.And the cable is too short.
4,Seller contacted me and sent me a replacement. Made it right.It flashes red instead of solid light while charging. Did t start till after 30 day return policy. Bought on 04/20/22-stoped working 06/13/22.This was a ‚Äòno‚Äô for me. It would be easy to use while it worked. Does not really fast charge as my original cable and Apple block does.
5,Amazing! I put my watch headphones and phone on it!! All charge fast looks super sleek and feels high end!
5,It is perfect for all of your charging needs!! It is pink so I love that about it however it keeps all of my things charged and all you do is set them on there! It is the best thing ever
5,I ordered this product based on other positive reviews. This charger does not disappoint. It holds my phone securely and charges my iPhone air pods and Apple Watch quickly. The best part is it doesn‚Äôt take up a lot of space on my nightstand and there are no messy wires.
4,The phone charger worked great but the watch charger had a lot of issues connecting to my watch or if I removed my phone during the night it would disconnect my watch and it was frequently dead in the morning still. I recommend buying something that has you weave the original watch charger into the port.Updating my review in 2022. I wasn‚Äôt going to ask for a refund because I still use the phone charger part of it in my kitchen but the company reached out to me and offered me a gift card or updated model since it didn‚Äôt work. I accepted because recently the phone charger portion has been glitching too and making a high pitched scream but I‚Äôm updating my review from 2 to 4 stars because of excellent customer service. There is a very real chance I just got one glitchy product but the company response improves my opinion of the product greatly.
3,Aesthetically this product is very clean looking.  It‚Äôs nice that it charges the phone watch and earbuds in such a small footprint .The issue for me is it charges on the slower side of the scale despite claiming to be fast charging . A lot slower than me charging my things individually from a wall plug anyways.
3,I love this cute little charger for next to my bed. So easy to set up and doesn‚Äôt take up any room at all. The only reason I gave it three stars is because it doesn‚Äôt work with my AirPods and I was really disappointed. But great for the phone and the watch‚Ä¶ If you have and if you have AirPods Pro it would be perfect
5,Charges phone and watch at the same time!  Works well!
5,This device took 3 plug ins and turned into 1 plug in eliminating the power strip on my bed stand.
5,Works as advertised.
4,The only thing I don‚Äôt like is that it beeps in the middle of the night  or at 4 am early in the morning  when my watch is charged. Very annoying.  It doesn‚Äôt stop beeping  till you take the watch off the chargerOther than that it charges great & fast.
5,This works perfectly for all of my Apple devices. The only thing that would Make this a lot better is if the cord was longer but overall happy about my purchase!
5,My daughter took it from me she liked it so much.
5,the part that charges the iPhone does not work
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†.‚ë†The iPhone can be charged vertically or horizontally. ‚ë°The Apple Watch can be placed on it (magnetically) and is very convenient. ‚ë¢ You can also charge the third generation of Apple headphones wirelessly. (It's not shown in the video because I'm still using the second generation!)!
4,I‚Äôve had two so far and within a month or two the product stops charging my watches. It‚Äôs so disappointing because it‚Äôs such a nice idea I‚Äôm not sure why it stops working.UPDATE: The seller reached out to me and tried to troubleshoot and offered every solution under the sun to help me - trading in for a new one getting a different model getting a refund etc. they were incredibly helpful. My husband has one of these chargers and his is still going strong has had it longer than me. I must have bad luck apparently.
5,I like the design it‚Äôs easy to pack when we travel.
3,This charger is perfect for what I needed except that now when I put my phone on it makes really weird electronic noises. It‚Äôs been getting worse as time goes on not sure how to fix it or if I should still be using it with the noises
5,Great product: it charges well and fast I like the way it looks and it doesn‚Äôt take much space.
4,it works when you put the phone directly onto the pad. If you have anything but a super slim case it will charge slowly or won't charge at all. It works but I need to check in on the charging progress for it sometimes quits and I need to take the phone off and put it back on. I cannot easily take the thick case off and put it back on.
4,The jury is still out on this one because I‚Äôm not sure why my phone gets so hot when it charges. Although it does charge fine my watch my phone and my EarPods I‚Äôm still investigating if it‚Äôs damaging my iPhone 12 pro max.
3,The charger will not charge 3 things at once.  Doesn‚Äôt do a great job charging the Apple Watch.  Takes forever.  It will overheat your AirPods.  I set a timer to remind me to remove them before that happens.  Does a pretty good job charging the phone.  All in all it‚Äôs a better stand than a charger.I‚Äôd send it back but too much trouble.  I really wanted to love it.
4,So far not too bad only been a month or so. Very nice having all three items charging at once. The head phones do get a little hot though and if the phone isn‚Äôt on perfectly it won‚Äôt charge.
4,Between my fianc√©e and I we have wires and everywhere for everything. I wanted something that would streamline my nightstand. I thought I had found it! My only issue is that my phone does not charge with its case on. I guess it doesn‚Äôt fit? Thinking of returning and continuing my search.
5,Bought my husband and I both one of these chargers and they do an awesome job. We are able to leave our otterbox or caseborne cases on our iPhone 13 pro max to charge it!!! Really appreciate being able to buy a great charger for a reasonable price.
5,I love this product. I wanted a simple wireless charger for my apple watch and Iphone to use by me bedside. Most of the chargers I've viewed have bright lights or the watch charger portion is an arm off the side of the charger so when updating the apple watch would have given off light. Not something I wanted to deal with since I'm a light sleeper. The Hatalkin charger has the watch rest on top so no light is directed into the eyes and the base of the the charger has only two small lights to indicate its charging-I can handle that! I haven't actually tested the speed in which it charges since I use it for overnight charging but for my purpose it works great. I do take my Iphone out of its cover to charge because I use a wallet case which is slightly bulky. Overall I like that it was simple to set up and use and so far it charges really well.
5,Great product and love the blue color
5,Good charging power does not cramp my space or ruin the decor. Travel friendly
4,Well it worked great for almost 3 months. Now the watch charger will charge than stop. And start again. Causing watch to keep singing. Can‚Äôt sleep thru it. Tried chatting with associate on troubleshooting that went no where at all my watch charges fine on my other chargers. Expected more than 3 months of use-------after reaching out to seller  replacement was issued and is working again  time will tell how long but they did fix the issue
5,Charges my iPhone in a case with no problems as well as my iWatch and ear buds.  Easy to pack and takes less room on my night stand than my old charge station.  My wife has a case/wallet kinda bulky and charges her iPhone easily.  Would recommend this charger.
3,Cell phone charging area stopped working after 2 weeks.  Still charges my watch and AirPods though which is why I wanted it in the first place.
5,This is awesome!It‚Äôs heavy duty and I had zero issues. Plug it in and it charges. I recommend for sure!!!
4,Very good compact design standing on night table but not so much for traveling. The only flaw that I find with it is that it does not charge as fast as it‚Äôs announced. We have iPhone 13 Pro Max and it takes a pretty good while to charge the phone the 7 series watch and the AirPods Pro. I‚Äôve tried charging our phones without the case when I‚Äôm really desperate to get a better charge time which improves a glitter but still doesn‚Äôt charge as fast. Maybe in the future I‚Äôll make comparisons for better understanding. About the design it‚Äôs very good as it sits on our night stands. Not so much for traveling though because you cannot fold it in anyway. Overall it‚Äôs a good product.
5,I like it all around
5,I love everything except it‚Äôs hard to tell if the AirPods are charging when docked.
3,The charger heats the phone and apple watch a lot. I have an iPhone 12 pro and an apple watch 7 41mm. Heating reduces the life-span of the battery. I used to have it to charge my devices overnight but now i'll leave it at work for emergency charging only.For casual use that might be a good option but not for continuous use.
5,I was looking to declutter all my cables and came across this beautiful 3-in-1 charging stand for my iphone watch and soon to get earbuds. I love that it is wireless charging and it looks pretty at the same time. Bravo!
5,Received this super fast! It works great and doesn‚Äôt take up much space! Definitely recommend!
3,I wanted everything in one fast charge for phone and watch. While it IS compatible with the new Apple Watch-it doesn‚Äôt charge it fast.
3,It charges well when you ensure everything is just so and I was happy until I dropped it once and the wire snapped off with it.
3,Charges fast but if you slightly misalign your device it gets very hot very fast. Even properly aligned I can still feel the heat.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†There are a lot of things to love about this charger. For starters it is a TRUE wireless charger for all devices. The past charger I owned (which was $30 more expensive) I had to use the charger that came with my apple watch stuff the cable throughout the charger's casing and plug it in in the back. This one comes with a charger already embedded and it is a true plug and play. Regarding airpods I could not use my previous charger without having to remove my airpod's leather case since you have to physically plug in the case to a stand that had a lightning cable sticking out. This charger again is truly wireless and the airpods fit very nicely in the back without the need of having to remove the casing. The final straw for my old charger came with the purchase of my iPhone 12 Pro Max. It was very flaky when it came to charging a phone that big. When i purchased a leather case for it it would no longer charge it at all. I thought I could not find a charger that could handle the phone and leather case combination until i got this charger. Not only does it handle the leather case it handles it 100% of the time without having to reposition the phone or anything. This is the first charger that has not had that issue. If you think it couldn't get any better the fact that is is so compact makes it even jucier. When I travel I usually left my 3-in-1 charger behind since it was so big but carrying this one is even easier than carrying the three separate cables and blocks. This is the best charger I've come across. If you are having any doubts don't. This is it. Stop looking.
3,I had to stop using this. It started making strange noises when charging my phone and watch. Customer service reached out to me. Said I had s as defective product. Offered to send me a replacement or different model or a gift card. Since I had already ordered a different model to work with MagSafe chargers I took the gift card offer.
5,I love this charger because it solves my problem of having wires going everywhere and not enough outlets. One wire does the job and all of my electronics get charged in one location. It is a bit bulky to pack for traveling but if you have the room it wouldn‚Äôt be a problem.
5,I love it! It's compact easy to use I can charge all of my devices and the wireless feature is so convenient!
5,This has saved so much hassle and cords!!! Buy it!!
3,I liked this charger so much I bought 2 more for relatives. However it has been only 8 months and the front charger stopped working. I have tried everything- unplugged different location restarted my phone etc. The watch port and back charger work fine. I have been unable to find anywhere I can contact the company.
5,I tried a lot of chargers but they unable to charge my iPhone Iwatch and AirPods together. However this worked like a breeze!
3,I was excited about this product when I got it charge my phone just fine don‚Äôt have an Apple Watch yet so I don‚Äôt know about that part but it would not charge my iPods I sent them an email when I get this product still haven‚Äôt heard anything it‚Äôs been two weeks
4,While it is nice looking and great design and it will charge an AppleWatch 7 and iPhone 12 but it is not a USB-3 fast charging wall block.  I used an adapter on the wall block and the 3-1 did not charge at all.  So it‚Äôs a conversation piece next to my 3 cords that I hoped to eliminate.  In the picture the black one is the 3-1 charging block and the USB-3 is white‚Ä¶please note the difference if you are looking for fast charging for new Apple devices
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I have Watch Series 5 version 8.5.1. It will charge to 98-100%. Now here‚Äôs my problem. Once it reaches this charge it‚Äôll just stop like it ‚Äúdisconnects‚Äù from the charger and go to my Lock Screen/password screen. Then after a couple minutes it‚Äôll start charging again and go into night stand mode. It charges like normal after using it for the day but once it gets to 98-100% it starts doing thisEditing my review: I‚Äôve been in contact with the original seller and they sent me a new charger. My watch is no longer doing this so changing my review to 5 stars (although I don‚Äôt have a charging case for my AirPods but that‚Äôs okay)
4,Condensed cable free form factor for charging multiple devices: 5 stars. Speed of charging phone: 5 stars. The spot where the Apple Watch goes: 3 stars. It is very SLOW to charge the watch. What takes minutes with the original Apple Watch charger takes hours with this device. With that in mind it‚Äôs not a bad device and it DOES charge everything I stick on it. The cable mess this replaces is worth the price but don‚Äôt expect super-duper charging speed with all devices.
3,This charger works really well for my iPhone 12 and charges it up fast although it doesn‚Äôt charge my AirPods or my Apple Watch SE does anyone know how to fix this?
5,This is perfect!  The only thing I don‚Äôt like is I have to take it out of the case because a disk I have for my car.  I still love it!
3,I like the design but charges my apple watch very slowly.
5,I like the charger speed. Even when i put all accessories it charges at same speed
5,This is a great all in one charger perfect for my IPhone 13 max
3,I bought 2 of these one in pink and one in black. They don‚Äôt seem to be fast chargers like it states. They also get very hot.
4,Not Happy. I packed this charger for travel and the plug in the back bent and rendered the item Unusable. BAD design. Very Dissatisfied. I will not buy again.‚Ä¶..Seller contacted us re: our dissatisfaction and offered a replacement at no charge. Received promptly! The service provided improved my opinion and I now rate at 4 stars. Thank you to Hatalkin for your follow up and consideration.
3,Being able to charge my phone with out a case. I have to unplug it and plug it back in order for it charge my iphone..
3,Absolutely loved this and recommended it to friends.  Today the lights won't come on.  Very sad.  It was a little expensive so I don't want to purchase another one.  I had a white one that blended in with my white kitchen counter tops and wasn't unsightly.  Bought it in May of 2021 and it's now June of 2022.
3,Take away: hopefully you get at least 8 hours of sleep each night if you use this station to charge your phone cause that‚Äôs what you will need to make sure you get a full charge! Does help condense chargers which is nice.I got this to help my nightstand look less cluttered with so many cords and chargers for my phone and watch. At the time of purchasing it I had the iPhone 8 Plus which would charge and even with the case on so that was cool however it would take 9 plus hours or so. Like that‚Äôs a no go! now I have the iPhone 13 max and it still is just as slow. Although my watch will charge in a flash.. I haven‚Äôt used it for AirPods because I had the first version of AirPods that were not supported with this but I did recently get a new pair that are now supported and am sure will work fine. Crossing fingers it is not as slow as the phone charger.
5,Easy to use & power is great!
5,Perfect size! Perfect color!  Love it!
4,Had an issue with the charger for the watch.  Had a bad review without contacting customer service.  However after the bad review I was contacted by the management of the company.  The company replaced the item without any hesitation.  The new product was sent without any charge with extras for my hassle.  I could not ask more from this company especially taking their time to actually read the reviews and take care of their customers.  I will purchase more products from this company.  Highly recommend.
2,This heats up my phone and my watch way more than any other wireless charger I‚Äôve ever used.  Not always with my phone but often enough I have to be careful and check it regularly. It always heats up my watch though. I am not able to put on my watch after charging for about 15 minutes after taking it off the charger because it‚Äôs so hot it hurts. It also takes more than 24 hours to charge my AirPods it‚Äôs just not worth it at that point. There is something wrong with this charging stand and I don‚Äôt trust it to not damage my devices.
5,I like that it is compact . Only 1 cord needed  and it is included .
5,It looks and works great
5,Very compact and cleans up the charging wire mess.  Phone and watch get warmer than with their apple chargers but doesn‚Äôt seem to hurt them and charges them very fast.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†First impressions: I placed my Apple 4 Watch my Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max and my AirPods Pro on the HATALKIN 3 in 1 wireless charger and they were all charged simultaneously. I have tried other chargers like this and typically one or more of the devices (typically the Watch) is not charged. To my pleasant surprise not only was the Watch charging but it was one of the fastest charges I have experienced. This is a fast charger for the 3 devices - my iPhone 12 Pro Max (with a MagSafe case) my Apple Watch and AirPods Pro. It has a couple of lights to let you know when it is charging. They are soft enough not to disturb your sleep. I am impressed by the quality design build and because of its smaller footprint it is a great space saver eliminating multiple wires. It comes with a type C power cable and a QC3 adapter (Kudos! - some companies don‚Äôt include these anymore). It is built with over-charge over-current over-heating protection etc. and a warranty. I am looking for what not to like about this charger and I can‚Äôt find any. For the price and quality it is a great value. If you are looking for a safe fast charger that is well made/looks good efficient and convenient then buy this! Please click on the ‚ÄúHelpful‚Äù button below if you find this review informative.
5,Since having Apple products the phone the watch and the AirPods have any convenient charging station has been nice easy to use easy to dust and overall easy to use
2,I thought this item would be great because I have an Apple phone ear buds and an Apple Watch and they each require three different plugs. I realize this is very slow to charge versus using the original chargers that come with the devices. When I put my phone to charge at 20% battery for 20 minutes it only charged to 26% versus using the original phone cord which charges it from 26% up to 80% in 20 minutes. Great concept to have one device for three different items and it is better for travel if you‚Äôre not looking for a fast charge.
5,Good product
5,Charging everything together less wires uses  less space on nightstand
5,I‚Äôve wanted to organize my nest of cables fit quite a while but always back burnered it.  Well last week I moved into a new place and after plugging in all my devices to a surge protector my OCD went into overdrive. There was no way I would be staring at 10 cords hanging down and a surge protector on the floor. I searched Amazon for a multi device charger and there was a plethora to choose from. However most of them still used multiple cords plugged into a single charging bank. That was not going to cut it. Then I found this Hatalkin 3-1 charger. The feature that made me choose it over the others was it uses a single cord for all three devices. Sold! Even after I bought it I had my doubts. Well after waiting a day for it all my reluctance was put to rest. When it arrived I took it out of the box unplugged the ‚Äúnest‚Äù and attached long charger component to base unit. I plugged into surge protector and placed iPhone Apple watch and it worked!I don‚Äôt own Airpods so I placed my Mophie charging case on that spot and to my surprise it charged it. Although manufacture doesn‚Äôt specify it will probably charge anything that can charge wirelessly. The charging is fast too. This will charger will change your life...well at least organize it.
5,It works great! Exactly like the description!
5,Worked reasonably well for 2 months and just stopped charging my IPhone 13. Case on case off sideways all a no go. Unplugged a no go. Shutting the phone off and back on a no go. I realize now why it was cheaper than brand name competitive products. Just waiting on the second unit my wife uses to stop working. Stinks to throw money away.changed my review to a 5 star.  Supplier reached out to me and replaced the defective charger at no charge.  New charger works great an excellent company to do business with.  Thank you.
5,It works great and I love being able to charge my phone watch and ear buds at the same time.
4,I did not like this product BUT they contacted me offered to send me another one and fix what I did not like. I can get behind a company that stands by there product and works with the customer so they get 4 stars for the company
4,The only thing I don‚Äôt like is you really need to make sure your phone and watch is actually charging or you will get up in the morning with no charge. Both phone and watch need just the right contact with the charger. I have got use to it so not so much an issue anymore.
5,Only think I don‚Äôt like about it is sometimes for my iPhone I have to have it unlocked for it to charge but once your screen locks it still charges the phone. Besides that amazing! It stops charging your phone when it‚Äôs fully charged. Highly recommend! Also doesn‚Äôt make your phone hot as well.
5,Great not to have 3 different cords hanging on my desk... and it's a fast charger
5,Good purchase! Worth the money I paid for the device I hope it lasts long now.
4,Es muy bueno y si funciona pero se calienta demasiado el celular al ponerlo a cargar no se si afecte en algo pero por el momento solo utilizo para los aud√≠fonos y reloj
2,It takes literary HOURS to charge 3 devices at the same time. Only good if you leave it charging overnight I guess. But it's NOT a fast charger! I have 13 pro max AirPods Pro and Apple Watch 7 series. In terms of charging speed it's NOTHING compared to an iPhone original fast charger where your watch takes literary 25 mins to charge to a 100. Very disappointed with the charging capability. The device itself is easy to use and very convenient on my desk which makes me even more disappointed as I like the way it looks and how convenient it is to charge everything at the same time. Only recommend if you don't need a fast charger. I am giving 2 stars maximum.
5,The design is nice. Unfortunately part of the device (watch charger) stopped working after a few weeks.
5,I bought this for $45.86 in April 2021. My previous charging stand wouldn't work well with my new iPhone 12 Pro in an Otter Box Defender case probably because the new phone was a bit more tall than the previous phone and thus not in alignment with the old stand.My previous stand had the ability to charge the watch but it required the Apple Watch to have a flexible band and sit flat. This HATAKIN  stand lets me charge the watch with any band I have including a hard case band I use when working out so it saves me from constantly having to pop the watch out.I've had no problems charging my iPhone 12 Pro and apple watch simultaneously. I like that it is powered by USB connection allowing me to plug it in more places than just near a wall outlet (like my old stand) and it easily comes apart to pack flat for travel use. I don't use wireless ear buds so cannot comment on that charging function however I can place another phone on that spot to charge so that is a useful function if I have a guest.
5,No surprises.
5,Love the convenience of charging phone and watch at same time. Works with iphone and android phone. Haven‚Äôt used it for travel yet but plan to soon.
5,Great product!It is useful for powering everything at the same time! And it doesn‚Äôt take much space!I wouldn‚Äôt use it for traveling! I prefer traveling with smaller chargers.
5,I bought 2 of these one for my wife and one for myself. Both are hardly a few times a week and mine stopped working today about 10 months after I got it. I tried unplugging and changing out charger blocks but o see if that was issue and it‚Äôs not that. My wife‚Äôs is still working but I won‚Äôt buy again
5,Let me start with this I researched these chargers until I was pretty sure they were all the same. I spent the little extra on this because it had the cord and charging block included. I bought this a couple of months ago and just got on here to figure out how to replace it or get a refund because today it was not charging my phone. My smarty pants husband asked me if I had tried turning my phone off and on again. The nerve. So I continue trying to troubleshoot the charger. It would charge his android phone and my Apple Watch as well as my AirPods. But my iPhone 12 Pro did nothing. So just to prove my husband wrong I restarted my phone. And wouldn't you know.... it started charging again just fine. So lesson learned. My husband is still wrong though!
4,Works like a charm for my iPhone and Apple Watch (both latest models). Only wish there was an additional charging indicator light for my Watch.  Like the level of brightness (or lack thereof) of the charging indicator lights. No distraction during sleep time.
2,This item arrived in a shipment with 2 other items. The box is absolutely gross (what is that? Cheeto slime?) and it‚Äôs all banged up. Still I opened it up washed my hands and tried out the charger. My phone seemed to be charging but my apple se watch would not charge at all. Going back. Trying to decide if it‚Äôs worth ordering a replacement or look for something else.
5,Got my hopes up. This thing had lots of good reviews so I thought I‚Äôd try it out. It doesn‚Äôt charge my Apple Watch or my AirPods. Really hope I can return it. The first picture of my Apple Watch is it being on low power mode and not charged even after sitting on the charger all night. I even tried taking the case and bands off but it still doesn‚Äôt work. Very disappointed. (UPDATE: it turns out my Apple Watch was too old of a watch so it didn‚Äôt work. The company was very kind and sent me a replacement and even let me return the replacement when neither worked. Great customer service)
3,Really was upset to see that 1 of 3 of my chargers didn't work! You would expect the company to check each product before shipping! But that's not the case. I'm not a fan of leaving negative reviews but for 50$ I would expect everything to work as it should!
5,Bought one for my desk and liked it so much I bought another for my nightstand. Easy to use - no more wiggling things around trying to make contact - with a small footprint and super fast charging.
5,Exactly as described. This thing charges fast and has great connections with my devices. I love that you can turn you phone to a landscape orientation and it still charges I use that a lot. I don't travel with this the device is sturdy but it comes in two pieces originally and I'm worried that shoving it in a bag with the rest of my stuff. I'm concerned that it would snap in half. Though this device is compact so if that wasn't a concern to you I could see it being used for travel.
4,This is a great design that easily simplified the amount of cables and charges you need. Great for travel because you need less cables and you can detach the stand to fit in your suitcase. I like it so much after trying it that I bought one for my wife as well.Unfortunately the second I received didn‚Äôt really work. It would only charge the IPhone 12 Pro Max for about 10-15 minutes before it would stop charging. So you wind up putting it on the stand before sleeping only to wake up and find that it didn‚Äôt charge throughout the night. The vendor replaced it at no cost and the replacement does much better. Disappointed I had to get a part replaced but excellent customer service and the working ones are awesome.
5,Es muy pr√°ctico y bonito lo recomiendo la 100
5,It's worth the money. Front charger is faster than the one in the back. Apple watch charges nicely. Back is used for a Samsung phone front for iPhone.
5,Seems to have a slow charge. So if you‚Äôre on the go and you need a quick charge this is not your answer. But if you need it for your phone when you‚Äôre going to bed it‚Äôs perfect because in the morning the phones fully charged as well as the watch. It‚Äôs good for traveling you don‚Äôt need to carry five different cords. You bring this in the one charge cord and it charges your watch earbuds and your phone. Would be better if you could fold up a little smaller other than that it‚Äôs perfect
5,The pieces are sensitive. The watch component stopped working and started back on its own. It‚Äôs a nice package but not sure yet on durability.
4,Love that it can charge all my devices but while using it does cause the devices to be some hot so just be careful of this
3,My Beats ear pods or Air pods will not charge. It did charge my old 1st gen. Samsung Galaxy ear buds.So my final word‚Ä¶Phone charging doc charges‚úÖWatch (Apple 6) charges‚úÖNot fast charging but it charges fully overnight.
3,Charger has worked great for the last 6 months now constantly makes the initial charging sound and light up when I place my watch on it. Pretty sure it‚Äôs going to wear out my watch life because it lights up and makes the sound every 20-60 seconds when it‚Äôs in charger. I‚Äôd love to figure out how to get it exchanged.
3,Update:  The seller reached out and replaced the charging station.  Adding 2 stars for customer service.  Will update on product after two months.I loved this product at first but the phone pad stopped working after two months.  I‚Äôm so disappointed. The red lights just flash constantly no matter how many times I restart.
4,es de muy buena calidad y a muy buen precio la unica pega que le pongo es que en la parte del telefono tienes que ponerlo en un angulo exacto para que cargue.
5,This product works awesome ! I love it
4,This works great for overnight. Only a few times did I realize the next day that my phone was lined up enough to charge. The Apple Watch area seems week so not near as efficient as using the Apple charger.  But I like the concept. Update: the phone portion stopped working after 4 months. I noticed a review said to reboot your iPhone and sure enough it worked!
3,I was super excited for this charger but when I have all my devices (watch iPhone and AirPods) charging it will not charge my AirPods. I‚Äôm using the charger it came with but even with that it will stop charging my AirPods right when I put my phone to charge. Kind of disappointed.
5,It doesn‚Äôt charge as fast as it states but it does it‚Äôs job..
2,Stopped charging my watch and not even a year old. It will still charge my phone but very disappointing I have to use a different charger for my watch. Defeats the purpose when I have to have multiple chargers.
5,Nice to have less cords but I do think it charges slower than my Apple charger .
4,The only reason I give 4 stars is because I ordered the charger in white and the plug is black it doesn‚Äôt match with the rest of the piece. Other than that it is a very functional piece very clean (no cables around) and it charges fast.
3,I bought this because they advertised in the product description that it will charge through cases up to 5mm thick it does not. I even measured the case thickness of the case I have before I ordered this to make sure that it was within the 5mm (mine is 3mm thick) so I was pretty disappointed when it wouldn't work as advertised. I verified that the unit itself worked by checking to see if my Apple Watch would charge.As far as the rest of the unit goes; it comes in two pieces a vertical and a horizontal piece that snap together connecting the contacts between the two. It has a 9V USB adapter plug and a short USB-C pug for it (if you need anything longer than a couple of feet you'll need a longer USB-C cable). The body is plastic and hollow except for the electronics inside so it doesn't feel too robust.This charger was more expensive than the others and physically looked different (it didn't have that diamond shaped dot pattern that all the others have) so I took a chance that this wasn't a clone and would live up to their advertising. If you don't have a case then this may work for you but then so would a cheaper unit.
3,I stumbled upon this case after wanting to have less clutter on my nightstand and wanted one that wouldn‚Äôt disturb me with a bright LED light. I found this case and thought that it was perfectly just what I was looking for.The first couple of nights were fine but I was using my phone without a case at that time as I was waiting for my apple leather case for my iPhone 12 Pro. So here comes charging with my new MagSafe apple leather case and it would only charge it up to 60-75% then stop charging and the LED indicator light would turn red then start blinking. This happens every night where I have to remove my leather case. I figured it wasn‚Äôt worth the hassle so I‚Äôm returning this.Also my Apple Watch is warm when waking up in the morning and put it on. I know that‚Äôs not normal since I was using the official watch charger that came in the box. I have a feeling this would degrade the Apple Watch battery over time as heat and batteries are a bad combination.And just like what others said it does take a really long time to charge your stuff even with the supplied cable and outlet.
5,Light at night is not bright charges quickly and easily charges all 3 items at the same time.  Best multi charger I have had.  I have had this for a few months and no complaints
5,The HATALKIN 3 in 1 Wireless Charging Station is much better than the unit its replacing! This unit is more compact the magnet that holds the Apple Watch is stronger and the whole unit is much sturdier. I definitely recommend it.
5,Very great deal
4,It charges my iPhone and headphones but sometimes it disconnects and stops charging lights will blik red when that happens all you have to do is take phone or headphones off the charging station until lights turn off then you can put them back on and will continue charging. It doesn‚Äôt charge as fast as product says but it does the job. One thing I dislike is that lights aren‚Äôt bright enough so it‚Äôs hard to tell when it‚Äôs already charging. I don‚Äôt have an iwatch so I can‚Äôt say anything about it. But most likely same thing will happen to it.
3,Bought it for travel and to have at home near the bed. It works fine from what I can tell but it emits an annoying high pitched buzzing noise whenever it's plugged into power. Between that and the bright lights it's very irritating to have nearby at night. I can tape the lights over but can't do anything about the noise.For travel it's questionable since it does not fold up or come apart.Can't get past the annoying sounds though will have to find something else.
4,I like this charger.  Came in handy for traveling.  Easy to break down to fit in bag.  Charges watch and AirPods great!  Have had trouble with phone charging when in its mag safe case.  First week no problem.  Since then it‚Äôs hit  or miss.  Works fine with case off.  Just a pain to keep checking if charging ok and if not having to take case off.
1,I bought a ‚ÄúMuleug‚Äù a couple months back  (for anyone looking for a quick recommendation and alternative in the same price range.)Sooooo I thought I would be cute and get a matchy matchy charging station that went with the vibe of my desk. Silly me. That cutesy wootsy feeling lasted for less than five minutes.The first thing I noticed was the light for each device confirming it‚Äôs charging is not clear it looks like there‚Äôs just one light underneath three windows.The second thing I noticed was it just wasn‚Äôt charging fast. I used the adapter they sent with it and I even use the outlet prong. Which brings up another grievance the cord is not that long and you will not have much wiggle room or grace getting it to an outlet. It certainly was not as long as my other docking station.And lastly it just stopped working after five minutes. My watch has been docked for 30 minutes it says it‚Äôs charging and it‚Äôs only at 8%. My air pods showed up briefly (I‚Äôm referencing the battery widget you can set on your phone). Now the AirPods have completely disappeared and aren‚Äôt charging. After watching this behavior on the widget I pulled everything off of the docking station to verify it physically and nothing was charging.I‚Äôm not even gonna take a chance and put my only lifeline to the world on it.I‚Äôll be returning this NOW and just getting a plain black one like I did a few months ago. They are the same price so if you‚Äôre looking for recommendations I would definitely go with ‚ÄúMuleug‚Äù they are both about 50 bucks the only difference is one is for show and the other one works
5,When I received the product (3 in 1 charger) my Iphone 13 mini would not charge in the vertical position. Everything else on the charger worked fine. Contacted the company (LeafBoat) and they went out of there way to help me out. Turns out that this 3 in 1 charger is incompatible with my Iphone 13 mini (Too short for the vertical charger). Im glad it did not turn out to be a defective product and as long as the Iphone 13 will charge in the horizontal position I am happy with the product.
3,This charger worked good for about 3-4 weeks. then started squealing and blinking red when my phone was put on it. It will not charge now and my phone was getting really hot. In the process of trying to get my money back.Talked with the company after writing the review they were very helpful and offered a replacement or money back. Asked me if anything they could do better for the product. Good customer service goes a long way!
5,This charger is super practical and it is also cute. I love that I don‚Äôt need to have a lot of cables on my nightstand but only this charger. The best purchase ever!
3,I love the way this stand looks. The matte white is great and while I don‚Äôt love the big ‚ÄúFast Charge‚Äù written across the stand I didn‚Äôt bother me because my phone covers it when it‚Äôs charging. I was mostly looking for a charger that I could drop my Apple Watch on to charge fully quickly before bed and that‚Äôs where this product fell short for me. The charger my watch came with charges my watch twice as much as this stand does. This wouldn‚Äôt be an issue if I left my watch on the stand over night but I like to sleep with my watch on so I need it to be charged quickly. That‚Äôs where this product failed for me.Unfortunately I will be returning this but if time isn‚Äôt important to your charging needs this is definitely worth the money.
4,Now I am down to one cord and a lot more rom on my nightstand. Plus my stuff is all together in the same place easy to find in the morning. LEDs a not even brightness and on one occasion seemed to indicate a problem when there wasn't one (fixed by removing phone and watch and putting them back). And it's white and disappears in my room.
4,Liked it's form factor as made in vertical stand vs. horizontal platform. What I disliked was the charging speed for Apple watch 6 could not be claimed as fast charge when compared to original 5W charge base come with the watch. Roughly it was 2.5 times slower than the OE charger. What I don't understand is that this product is claimed to have 5W for Apple watch and it is same as OE wattage. Unfortunately the result had big difference.  It is important for me to have a fast charger for Apple watch if I'm wearing it at bed time. Both iPhone and airpod are being charger with fairly good speed. Just Apple watch charging was disappointed
5,Works perfectly- plus nice and compact
3,We bought two of these for my wife and I. We like the design the space it takes up and the overall functionality. However the power supply on both of them died within a couple of weeks. I sent an email to the seller and still no response. We have taken traditional Apple cubes to replace them but no response is bad customer service.  I also have the Otterbox Defender case and it does charge through it.
5,This product has a great form factor and is easy to use.  unfortunately It does not charge my apple watch very well.  It will take about 4-6 hours to fully charge if I have the patience to use it.  The connection is not steady and the clock mode does not work wither when on the charger.  The other charging areas work well for both my airpod pros and my iphone.  But if its important to charge an apple watch I'd suggest going to one that requires you to supply your own apple watch charging wire.  That still seems the best option.Update:  7/4/2022.  Based on my earlier review I was sent a new one and this one works great.  I love that I only need one cord and can charge all my devices.  Great product.
2,I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs so ‚Äúlightening fast‚Äù and this charger? I want to return it for a different brand but I think I‚Äôm stuck because I‚Äôm past the return window
5,Easy to use
5,My watch stop ‚úãüèΩ charging in this device on yesterday. I want my money back
5,Wife loves fast charge for her phone watch and buds. Loves the color.
5,This charger is quick as advertised as well as simple to use. I‚Äôve had others that are a challenge to get phone lined up for charging but this is easy. I would suggest this product.
5,I've only had this charging station for about 3 weeks.  So far it's the best charging station I've purchased. It's sturdy and charges my iphone - in it's protective case - and my apple watch 100%.  Since I charge both devises overnight I can't say how quickly they are charged.  I purchased two other less expensive charging stations one for my phone and another for my watch and neither were very efficient.  It pays to send a little more to get a quality product that fulfills your needs.
4,I love almost everything about this charger. It's compact lets me charge my iPhone regardless of landscape/portrait orientation and keeps my AirPods topped off while hiding them from view. However the Apple Watch charging speed is incredibly slow even if no other devices are on the charger.The latest test I performed was to place my Series 6 on the charger alone while it had 50% power. I did this at 11 AM and the watch was only at 78% by 2 PM. I have tried to improve the speed by using a different QC3.0 power adapter a different cable and even a USB-C to USB-C cable plugged into one of Apple's own 20W adapters. Sadly there wasn't any improvement.
5,The only thing I don‚Äôt like is the color. I ordered white and got black. I could have exchanged it but didn‚Äôt want to hassle with it at the time. I kind of wished I did now. The black just really looks dusty all the time.
5,I recently upgrade our phones to an iPhone 11 and an iPhone 12.  This brought us into the world of wireless charging.  I have now purchased 4 different products from $30 to almost $100.  I saw this product as i was looking for another one for my desk at my second office.  I liked the style and the price.  However It is now my favorite charger of the 4 I use around the house and at my two offices.  The upright but slim style is attractive.  The charging is quick and the phone 'connects' to the magnet every time.  The later has been an issue with a couple of the flat wireless charges that I have both common name brands and at least twice a expensive
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                              ¬†No me carga el iPhone solo el Apple WatchActualizaci√≥n 19/6/21El fabricante muy responsablemente me contacto v√≠a email y me devolvi√≥ el dinero invertido. Tambi√©n me ofreci√≥ otro producto el cual le dije que no era necesario ya que yo me encuentro en otro pa√≠s de Am√©rica .Agradezco mucho el servicio al cliente y lamento que el producto no funcione para cargar mi iPhone .Lastima porque ten√≠a mucha ilusi√≥n de utilizarlo .Agradezco al fabricante el reintegro del dinero y su amable atenci√≥n para m√≠ Persona .
5,Works great and it's convenient because you can have all your devices in one place. Grab and go in the morning.
5,*updated- seller contacted me through email even after a year since purchase; offered three options; fast replacement; amazing customer service! Changed 1 star to 5 star*original- I cannot find an easy way to contact the seller to see if they will assist with the product being dead now after only a year if use. I am getting two red lights and it does not charge.
5,Very easy to use this charger
5,Probably the most convenient  little gadget ever. So cute. Perfect angle and i can see it from bed with out a glare. Only down side is that id you have a cover on your air pods you might have to sit there and play with how you set them on there
5,I absolutely love having this charging station. It charges my phone/headphones/watch super fast. It makes it so much easier to travel because you only have to bring one thing with you rather than 3 different charges. The only complaint I have about the whole thing is that you can only charge 2 things at the same time. Other than that I definitely recommend it!
5,Charges your phone or headphones really fast .
5,All good
4,Unreliable with the iPhone 12 Pro.  I am running the latest software update.  When placed on the stand the phone only charges for a few seconds.  The solution is to reboot your phone but having to do that every time you charge is way more hassle than just having a cord.** UPDATE **. I wrote the company about my charging problem and they have been extraordinarily helpful and concerned.  They have sent a replacement charger and offered a refund if I have continued difficulty.  I have changed my rating to four stars.
2,Definitely had power and stability but would not come t thru my commuter case or my MagSafe cases. If they connected they did not hold connection. Out of the case it was super. I‚Äôm sure regular MagSafe case would work fine but not for me. Watch was super do we‚Äôre my ipod pros
5,I‚Äôm THRILLED with this charger. I sent this to my folks home for any easy option for all my apple accessories while traveling. I order another unit (from another company) and it did not work. I was so disappointed and cautious about trying another charging station. The main reason for a dock was for my Apple Watch. I did NOT want to bring my watch charger.As you can see for the picture it works PERFECTLY. I suggest only charging two items at a time for no over heating BUT you can do all. The phone charger is fast and my ear pods charged easily.I‚Äôm so happy with the dock!Thank you. We will use this every trip.Easy to breakdown. Easy to set up.
4,Most of the time the charger works but sometimes after a short while I notice a red flashing indicator light (even happened today).  Would remove everything off the charger to allow to reset.  Sometimes it would start flashing again shortly after putting phone back onto charger.I don't feel this charger really charges fast at all.  I have an iPhone 12 Pro Max and I can have on the charger for 5 hours and still won't get a fully charged phone.It's great for compact when you are needing to save space and charge iPhone Apple Watch and possibly AirPod Pro's.
5,Work great for a couple of weeks and then the charger on my iPhone 13 stopped working to red blinking lights. The charger for my watch works great. Who knows how that long that will last. Would not buy this again don't waste your money
5,ive had it a few weeks and it works great. highly recommend it.
4,I think this is a great design I can charge my phone watch and headphones all at the same time. Though as a travel product I have some issues.I keep this in a semi truck and move around a lot the issues I have are the type-c port can be finicky (depends on the cable) the stand portion is clipped in and comes off very easily (I am worried it will break the clip one time) I may use glue or something else to fix this I also find it could have a heavier base. Though for all my complaints I find it functions perfectly.
1,Do not buy. As you can see in the photo the camera ‚Äòbump‚Äô on the 14 keeps the phone from setting flush against the charger.  The gap between the phone & the base makes it obvious this charger was NOT made to hold the iPhone 14 Pro and it‚Äôs apparent they never even tried it or looked at the iPhone 14 drawings. Makes you wonder what other phones they claim it works with that actually won‚Äôt since the 12 & 13 have similar camera ‚Äòbumps‚Äô. There are so many reviews here that say it doesn‚Äôt reliably charge certain phones and I‚Äôm guessing this (inexcusable) gap are the reason. I‚Äôm very disappointed and I hope Amazon forces them change the false description and makes them stop claiming it‚Äôs for phones that it obviously wasn‚Äôt designed for. Will be returning.
4,This works great is easy to use and takes up little space. I would have given it five (5) stars except the shipping was slow it did not show up when it was suppose to then Amazon sent a notice to be reimbursed before it arrived due to it being lost. Then a few days later it randomly showed up‚Ä¶so just confusing.
4,Overall it‚Äôs a nice unit and comes apart very easily for packing. I like that it included the power adapter. One thing I missed was the Apple Watch compatibility ‚Äî mine is the original which is now referred to as Series 0 and I figured that if it had the latest software I‚Äôd be good. Not so much ‚Äî it won‚Äôt charge my watch because Apple doesn‚Äôt support Series 0 on any software above 4. Oh well.
3,Pretty good charger with one super annoying trait.  When the watch is on the charger it randomly connects and reconnects making the watch chime every time.  Can‚Äôt charge my watch at night because of this.
5,In the past I‚Äôve had issues with cordless chargers not charging my phone. I‚Äôve had no issues with this product. I charge my Apple Watch and my iPhone every night both are always fully charged when I wake up. The only thing I would change would be may be a longer cord. I had to get an extension cord and have the power brought to the nightstand because my electrical outlet was too far away.
5,Love the stand everything works as promoted
5,Works as described... no excess 'heat' issues that I read about in other products...
5,I bought it to charge all my products but I am not a fan of Airpods i have Sony WF-1000xm4 instead. I took the risk as the product didn‚Äôt indicate that it was compatible. However it works perfectly. :)
2,For some reason whenever I charge my iPhone the charger starts making weird high pitched noises. The other reviews touch on this as well. I would prefer a non defective product exchange!
3,Worked well for 8 months. Then it stopped charging my air pods and now it stopped charging my Apple Watch.
4,I have the Apple Watch 6 and it works great for charging it. I also use this to charge my iPhone 11 and it charges it quickly. The size is nice and it doesn‚Äôt take up much room on my night stand.The only con that I have is that it can‚Äôt charge my phone with its case on. I have the smartish cell phone case that can hold credit cards in the back of it. It‚Äôs not overly thick but thick enough that it won‚Äôt fit in the slot. Other than that I love this charger.
5,My teenage daughter absolutely loves this because she can charge her watch her phone and all that other teenage technology stuff they have all at the same time! Definitely worth your money!
5,It‚Äôs so easy to use and it can charge more than one thing so multipurpose is a huge plus. Was having trouble charging my phone the port where I plug it in to charge is not receiving the charge so this was a big help and I couldn‚Äôt be more pleased.
5,This product works great! Super convenient to be able to have my AirPods watch and iPhone charging all at once. Also the best product if you don‚Äôt like having a bunch of chargers and cords in view as there‚Äôs just one keeps it simple. Definitely recommend! It also just looks really cool!
5,Needed to replace a Belkin phone/watch charging dock that had became unreliable. After searching found this 3 in 1 charging station. Seems to be well constructed and as a bonus I can use it to charge my airpod pros as well as my phone and watch...plus it costs much less than the Belkin equivalent. Two thumbs up!
3,I give it 3 stars because it does work.  It just doesn't work as expected.  My airpods and watch charge to 100% but my phone will not.  I purchased a USB-C charging block based on other reviews and it still only charges my phone to 80%.  Very disappointed.
4,came on time and easy setup and use. fast charges phone with no issues yet. Have used it every night X1 month without  any problem.
5,Was purchased as a gift they loved it an works great can charge all 3 at same time
3,Doesn‚Äôt work for my iPhone 12 plus max like it said it does. This was my second order and I was very disappointed‚Ä¶
5,I purchased a charger similar to this one 6 months ago from an on line provider.  It lasted 4 months but now will not charge my cell phone only my watch.  Hopefully this charger will be more reliable and last longer.
2,I really like the product it‚Äôs sleek and really functional but it takes way too long to charge my Apple Watch (Series 7). Returning because I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth it because the watch is the primary reason for purchase.  Too bad ‚òπÔ∏è
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†This is a compact fast charger for my iphone apple watch and ipod pro device all at the same time. I have a limited amount of space on my nightstand so this helped to eliminate extra wires and space for all the separate chargers and chords. Note: You must use the supplied  (AC/9V DC ) converter or a similar 9V converter if you which to charge all 3 devices at the same time. Everything you need is in the box and its simple to use. also i have a protective case on my iphone and it charges without me having to take it off.
5,So much easier than plugging in my phone and fumbling with the watch charger. Having them both in one place couldn‚Äôt be more convenient and they instantly begin charging when effortlessly docked - quickly too.
5,love this charging station.  I order a different one first that didn't work.  I've never had a problem with this one.  I do wish it came in more colors.
1,This was such a waste of money.  Got mine for me and my husband and they BOTH burned out in less than 6 months.  I thought well maybe its me so stupidly purchased another one.  Now same thing.  It has barely been more than 6 months and guess what?  Yep u got it.  Its dead.  It stopped charging my watch and then when it did the back of it was so hot.  Thought it was battery for my apple watch‚Ä¶.nope replaced that twice and same thing.  Then it would charge then shut off then turn back on like I just set it on the charger.  Truly a waste of money.  Save your hard earned money and buy from a different vendor and maker!!!!
4,Yeah it might do the job for other devices... but I need a piece of tech that can handle my devices.  Fossil Explorist and Note 9 at the very least.The charger is nice. The USB-C is also a nice touch. It couldn't charge my watch. I can't have a charge station that only charges my phone that's not really a charge station.4/5 because it's a high quality product that did not fit my needs.
4,Works well but make sure your phone is centered on the charger or you‚Äôll wake up to a dead phone. We hoped to use one for my boyfriend‚Äôs phone and watch too but his Samsung watch is too rounded and won‚Äôt connect with the watch charger. Works well for my Apple Watch 3 and iPhone 12 Pro Max though.
1,When I read the reviews for this charger I was encouraged by the fact that many mentioned the excellent customer service they experienced when they encountered an issue with it. So I felt it was a safe purchase. Plus it had all the features I was looking for including a watch charger that didn‚Äôt require the original charger.It worked well for roughly 2 days. Then when I set my phone (newest iPhone SE with a thin case) on it it would charge for 5 minutes max before the red light on the charger started flashing repeatedly. Sometimes turning the phone on its side would get it to work but that was hit and miss for sure. At the same time the watch charger stopped working completely - even after unplugging it and plugging it back in taking the two pieces apart and putting them back together restarting my phone and my watch... no change.I emailed the seller who responded quickly and sent another one. Yay! It seemed to work very well. For roughly 2 days. Then I noticed my watch wouldn‚Äôt hold a charge for more than a few hours. I checked for an upgrade turned it on and off cleaned it well ran the battery down to nothing then charged it back up... still wouldn‚Äôt hold its charge. Tried for a couple more days. Then I charged it on the original charger and it has held its charge like normal. Sooo...I‚Äôm sure I could email the seller again and they would offer advice or replace it again. But frankly I paid $50 for this and have received two faulty devices. I‚Äôm not really interested in this item anymore. I‚Äôm unfortunately past the return window otherwise I would just return it. My advice is don‚Äôt waste your time and money. It looks nice and is a nice idea and all but it‚Äôs not a reliable device.
3,It charges my AirPod pros for 2 seconds then stops charging but it does my Apple Watch series 7 and iPhone 13. I‚Äôm disappointed that it doesn‚Äôt charge my AirPod pros
2,Worked great at first. However it stopped working in just 6 weeks of using.
4,I had this product for 5 days and it stops working after a while then starts back working again it charge very slowly for my iphone 11  with a apple charger it charges faster for some reason my apple air pods don‚Äôt charge up on the device. But the stand is very helpful to use when we‚Äôre want to watch a movie or tv show with cellphone landscape and vertical with the device charging your phone.
5,Being able to charge on one device.
5,I bought this for charging my 13 pro max AirPods & Apple Watch. It does charge fast. Sometimes I have to remove my case from my phone and EarPods to charge sometimes I don‚Äôt. That‚Äôs the only drawback. But I do appreciate the compact size and the fact that you don‚Äôt need any other cords or have to attach the watch charger. I‚Äôm happy with my purchase.
3,This is a pretty decent wireless charger but it is certainly not a fast charger. With no case on my iPhone 13 the maximum charging speed with no other devices on the charger was 3 watts. With my Apple Watch and AirPod case on the charger the phone charged at a speed of less than 2 watts. It‚Äôs ok for use as a regular trickle charger during the day but it‚Äôs much slower than plugging my phone in.
5,Works well. Everything in one convenient place. All devices charge properly: iWatch 7 series AirPods Pro Max (while still in a leather case pouch) and iPhone 13 Pro Max with Pelican Voyager protective case. Impressed with product and meets my needs.
5,Bought for myself but Hubby liked it so he got it loves it
5,I received as a Christmas gift with the addition of my Apple Watch. I love that I can charge all my devices in 1 spot.  I have traveled with it and will not leave home without it.
5,It is used by my bed it is awesome. I would recommend this product and going to be purchasing 2 more.
3,Works 100% of the time if I use the charger on the base. Works 100% if I am only charging my smart watch. Stops working within 10mins if I try charging more than one thing at a time.
5,I've tried everything in regards to charging my iPhone 12 max. It will charge my watch and airpods perfectly But it will rarely charge my iPhone. I've tried restarting my iPhone and restarting the charger. But nothing helps.EDITED: I have bumped this up to a 5 star product for many reasons. right after my review they reached out to me to solve my problem! They were so nice and so helpful! And! Now that I got a new one the product works perfectly! I have an iPhone 12 max airpod pros and an apple watch. All of them charge perfectly!! I would absolutely buy this again.
4,I like that I can charge all my Apple items at once however my phone won‚Äôt fully charge to a 100%. It‚Äôd be on the charging pad for an hour and it‚Äôll stop at 50% or so.
4,I use it to charge my phone and watch
2,This charger is very beautiful which is why I give it 2 stars but the charge is SO PAINFULLY SLOW. Also make sure you Apple  AirPods are compatible. I assumed they would be but they are not. I think for the price if the charge time was faster I would absolutely keep it and probably buy another one.
4,Charges all my Apple products only one power cord instead of 3.
3,For over night charge will get your phone charged cord on back slips out often.
3,You have to play around with it to take the iPhone are for the green light to come on. Other than that it‚Äôs a great charger.
5,Easy setup. Clean simple design looks good and works as intended. Have Phone Airpods and watch charging at once.
5,I write this after having purchased (and returned) another product that just didn't live up expectations.  This product however works exactly like it's supposed to.  I don't have to guess where to place the phone for it to charge.  The built in watch charger is a nice feature as well as it leaves the Apple charger free to be used elsewhere.  The wireless AirPods charger is great too!Another great feature is its size. It's compact so it doesn't take up a lot of room on the desk/nightstand/wherever you have it.Overall it's a great product and I would highly recommend.
5,I was searching for something to replace all my random chargers for my phone and watch. After doing some research I stumbled upon the HATALKIN 3 in 1 wireless charger. I am so glad I did it is the best thing ever. I love that it's only one charging unit for all my devices. I wish I knew about this sooner it's a game changer. I love that it's one piece and one cord. Charges both my apple watch and iphone X fast. Can't wait to travel again and use it on trips as well. I highly recommend you buy it you will not regret it.
2,This product worked amazing for several weeks.  But now the watch and AirPod chargers don‚Äôt work.  Looks great but very unhappy.
3,this item is perfect for traveling but not good to everyday use it only charged my watch to up 94%no matter how long I leave it on the charger.
5,Very convenient and it def charges both my iPhone and iWatch. You can travel with it just prefer this in my home. It‚Äôs pricey yes but it‚Äôs not junk that‚Äôll give up in a week or two.
3,Dock looks great and has a nice finish. Plug and cord are included and no need to use your existing chargers. Phone charger works fine and it‚Äôs nice to be able to charge horizontally. AirPods Pro charged without a problem. The issues began with the watch charger. The watch charger did not work upon assembly and while troubleshooting with Amazon and processing a replacement I discovered that there was an issue with 2 pins. The first pin does not fully extend and the second pin is noticeable loose and falls over. After carefully adjusting the pins the watch charger began to work. It is noticeable slowly than your actual watch charger.Overall it‚Äôs a decent dock. Better than having to use your existing chargers or having cords everywhere but be careful and inspect your pins. Will return/replace and hope to have better luck next time .
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†I‚Äôve only had this for about a day now but it is so awesome to have my bedside table clear of all the wire mess and just have a nice clean wireless charger for all my Apple devices. I really like the magnetic cling for the AirPods since they are on the back side I was worried it would be harder to line them up but they snap into place and everything seems to charge as fast as possible. Glad that it came with the USB wall plug and I didn‚Äôt have to purchase that separately. Will be purchasing another of these for my wife and sharing with friends!
3,S√∫per bien al principio pod√≠a cargar iPhone Watch y aud√≠fonos.Desde que actualice IOS carga menos del 50% y se prende luz roja.Por que!!??  üò¢.
3,Got this to reduce nightstand clutter and it does that job. iphone 12 pro charges pretty quick it seems with the included adaptor (i leave it on all night so i cant really say) and same for the airpods pro. However my apple watch series 3 charges very slow. I typically take my watch off and charge for say an hour or so before bed then put it back on for sleep tracking. With the apple charger its always back at 100% by then but with this charger its maybe charged 15% or so more from where it started.
2,Bought this in January. It‚Äôs August and the phone charger part just stopped working. Two weeks ago the watch part stopped charging. This was too expensive to break so quickly.
5,I love this product
5,Great charger I am able to charge my iPhone AirpodsPro and watch all together and only need to use one outlet.  It comes with everything you need - cable wall charger and the unit itself.  You have to put it together which took 20 seconds.  There are two lights on the front that go from red to green when things are charging but it's weird there aren't three.  Got this for my wife she uses it daily and I am thinking of getting one for myself as I use hers all the time.
2,Everything works except for the watch chargers I bought 2 of these and Keith will charge either of our watches and yes both are up to date on updates
3,Ordered back in April and the product has been working great. However within the last week or so the phone charging portion has stopped working. It still charges my AirPods and my watch just not the phone
5,Charges fast doesn‚Äôt get hot and doesn‚Äôt have a super bright light on the front that blinds me at night. Love it.
2,Did not charge my apple watch fully.  I thought I may not have placed my watch on the charger correctly so the next night I made sure it was on properly displaying the lightening bolt.  In the morning my watch was not charged and it felt hot.  I would not purchase again.  Was suppose to be convenient to have one charger- instead it was a nuisance because I was concerned thoughout the night whether my watch would charge for the next day.
5,The product is good and easy to use. Charges phone watch and ear buds.
5,Fast charging station and organizer for all my electronics.
4,I love this product for the most part.  The AirPods charging port never worked.  But the watch and phone charger worked great.  Might want to get an iPad block to help with charging speed.
5,Love the way it functions and the color so stylish
5,This works great I use for my phone and watch. I got one for my Husband also and didn‚Äôt realize his phone is to old for it. So that sucks! But I love it!
5,It is perfect for my office. Thank you :)
5,Amazing charger. Extremely happy with it. No issues.
5,After posting my initial review the vendor reached out and responded very professionally and replaced the charger right away.  I appreciate the quick response and the level of professionalism that this vendor portrayed.  And the new charger works great.
5,I had an earlier charging dock which worked well but wen I changed my watch to a 7 series the old dock did not charge the new watch. This dock definitely does and works well
5,It‚Äôs nice to only have one cord and three devices can be charged and it takes up less space
5,The title says it all.  Everything locks in place.  No waking up without a full charge!  Enjoy!
5,Absolutely no complaints.  This charger saves space on my night stand.  It hold the phone securely.  Both my watch and my phone recharge completely over night.  It is much easier to place my phone on the charger.  I had to search for the proper spot on my original wireless charger.
5,Easy to use and quick changing
5,I love this charger. Only 1 cable and I charge my phone air pods and Apple Watch. It is also fast charging.
5,I have been using this charger for over 6 months for my iPhone 12 Pro Apple Watch Series 5 and Air Pods. I have yet to have any issues with the charging capabilities for either three products. The wireless charging feature for the phone (and Air Pods) along with the stand ability holding the phone up is great! One of my favorite things about this product is not needing additional cords to plug into the device in order to charge the Air Pods and the Watch. One simple cord charges all three!
3,Good: Love the all-in-one without having to run a cord to the phone separate from the charging device‚Äôs power cord. Charges my watch and ear buds flawlessly. Great esthetics and small footprint on my night stand.  I really love this charging stand with one exception...Bad:  I have an otter box case on my iPhone 12 Pro and the stand will not charge my phone. This stand requires me to remove the outer rubber jacket before it will start charging.  Not sure I want to get a thinner case just to allow wireless charging.  The cost of this phone isn‚Äôt worth taking a chance on dropping it with a suboptimal case.  This stand would easily get 5 stars if it would charge my phone.
5,LOVE this thing. In fact my wife and I loved it so much we bought 2.  Works great with IPhone XR IPhone 12 and Apple watches. Don't have air buds so can't attest to those.
5,I have purchased many charging stations in the past and this one is hands-down my favorite! It charges quickly it has a nice texture and it‚Äôs a great addition to my home office desk. It isn‚Äôt overly ugly! I‚Äôm thinking about buying several more for the rooms of the house.
3,When it works it works great. However I find that it can be very finicky with the placement of my phone. There have been several times I've thrown my phone on the charger at night and woke up to find it hadn't charged. You have to get the placement of the phone just right which can be frustrating. The watch charger seems to work consistently. The bright green light is obnoxious.
2,Kind of works from time to time.  The phone has to be placed just right for it to charge overnight.  Also the light is rather bright for the bedroom.  It goes out then comes on at random times throughout the night.
5,! Buen producto en general y carga no tan r√°pido como un cable pero si bastante m√°s que una base normal
2,Phone and watch charger work. iPod charger did not.
4,Does not charge my AirPods other then that i like it
2,Does not have good magnetics. My iPhone 13 pro would show it was charging when you play placed it on the stand but there was no magnetic pull to the stand. The manufacturer has responded that the stand has no magnet for the phone.  The watch holder was even worse. Even though the holder was flat it failed to hold my watch in place the magnet was so weak. I couldn't even find the charging spot because the magnet was so weak. I returned the device to Amazon thank you Amazon! The manufacturer responded after the return and offered another device or a gift card. So I upped the rating by 1 star for their kind service.
5,Love this charger! Super handy and is great for night time with no bright lights like the other devices.
2,In the beginning everything was great. Charge was awesome and now after having it for 2 months the charge won‚Äôt charge neither my watch my phone and the AirPods. It‚Äôs really cool stand up charger but it‚Äôs not worth it to pay aa expensive as it is for it to just won‚Äôt charge after 2 months.
5,I absolutely love this product. I first bought my first one back in March and it charge my phone super fast. I love the fact that I didn‚Äôt have three different chargers to charge all my Apple products. With a summer coming upon us I am at the beach on the weekends and bought the same charger to bring down to That house. This item is so compact it fits on a 7 x 7 table. I would highly recommend this
5,It works Great!Very easy to use and cleans up a lot of lose plugs üîå all over ur counter.Definitely recommend it!*If it doesn‚Äôt start charging when you put your phone on it simply turn ur phone completely off and then back on. We did this once and no problems.Enjoy üòä
5,This was best decision I've made by for on chargers all in 1
2,This charger was a Christmas 2021 gift to my kid so excited when he got it so disappointing to us both when it literally didnt make 2.5 months. REVISED....So in March 2022 I posted the above review. Very happy to report that the manufacturer or distributor read the above review and IMMEDIATELY contacted me. I was offered replacement upgrade or compensation options. I chose replacement and Holy moly within the week I had a NEW replacement piece. It's been over a month and working as I hoped. Great product AMAZING customer service!  Thanx!
1,Just received my 3 in 1 charging station a few days ago. I went to charge my phone and Apple Watch the first night and only my phone charged. Tried unplugging everything and plugging back in and it still doesn‚Äôt work. I contacted the seller two days ago and have yet to hear back from them! I am very disappointed‚Ä¶. This is now pointless bc I still need to use my Apple Watch charger along with this 3 in 1 charger!I checked and my watch IS compatible with this charger.I DON‚ÄôT RECOMMEND THIS ITEM!!!!
5,It charges the phone Watch and Airpods at the same time and does is quickly with the fast charger. I love it and definitely recommend it
5,Absolutely the best charging station we have found it‚Äôs perfect. Great anti slip material fast charging and small design. Highly recommend!
4,Pretty good! I like how easy it is to place my phone on it even upside-down in the dark without having to fumble for the connector.Minus 1 star because sometimes it stops charging and shows a red light instead of a green light. Will add that star back if I‚Äôm doing something wrong!
5,This charger is amazing! Worth every penny. I bought it for my mom it‚Äôs so helpful. She can charge her Apple Watch and phone! If she ever gets the ear buds then she can do that to! Amazing item I even use it for my phone lol
2,Charger got hot and despite carefully placing the phone/watch/earpods on the charging spots the watch charger stopped working within 2 months. Disappointing I liked the idea of having everything in one place on my bedside table. Doesn't feel worth having the large charger if I can't use 2/3 of the chargers.
5,Easy to use
5,I like that he no longer has to carry multiple chargers around. I like that it‚Äôs easy to use and it looks pretty on the nightstand. It works great and chargers quickly. He‚Äôs had it for a month now and so far no issues.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†I have always struggled to keep my devices charged with all of the different cables. So when I upgraded from an iPhone 6 to an iPhone 12 the first thing I looked for was an all in one wireless charger. I liked this one because it looked compact and can charge my iPhoneApple Watch and airpods(ones with wireless charging case). The only issue is that sometimes the iPhone 12 will sometimes disconnect on its own. It‚Äôs easily fixed by restarting the phone.
2,I love the color  is very light but it made my watch to hot when charging not safe
5,Liked the convenience of charging 3 devices at one time.  Easy for traveling also.
2,It was a wonderful product purchased it in Nov 2021 and didn‚Äôt use it till Dec 2021 after three and 1/2 month of use iPod charger section is not working don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going to be next the phone section or the watch section for reference I have iPhone 13 max pro Apple Watch 7 and iPod generation 3 released in 2021. I think the manufacturer should send me the replacement product I bought two one for my friend and myself mine is not working partially
5,I highly advise this proxy it Excellent for me since I have all apple products iPhone Apple Watch & apple earbuds
3,Overpriced for how little it works... my phone with thin case will charge for a few minutes then it stops. Then I have to take it off for a minute before putting it back on or it won‚Äôt charge (blinks red). ONLY charges your phone vertically (not horizontally at all).The watch charger you have to put on EXACTLY right or it gets HOT. I mean like really hot. Unless it‚Äôs on JUST so and never gets bumped (hard since it‚Äôs on my standing desk when I raise my desk it move the watch and gets hot).Only pro is its triple charger in one; stands up nice on desk and is minimal. But so much trouble to charge.
5,Product works well. We had a slight hiccup with the first one we ordered but they fixed the issue fast and efficiently! üòä wonderful customer service!
5,No
4,It will not charge an Apple aWatch 1!!Not sure why?
3,Love the concept and look but the connection between the unit and cable is very loose which has resulted in an uncharged watch / phone at times
4,works as described nice to have this take up only a little of my nightstand place with only one cord to account for so that i can charge multiple devices. i wish the light indicator showed when the headphones were charging it does charge them but doenst light up to show that just to show that its on
5,I have had a hard time finding a 3 in one charger that worked especially with my phone in its case (Apple leather case) this charger is great! Clean simple and just works exactly what I wanted. It will change a 12 pro max watch series 6 and AirPods Pro all at the same time with the phones in their cases just to be clear. I‚Äôve got a total of three of them now so that everyone has their own
4,Love the compact size - doesn‚Äôt take up a lot of room on the nightstand. Very nice design look. No complicated set up. Everything charges very well. The *only complaint is that sometimes the iPhone 12pro has to be repositioned to maintain connection/charge due to it being in a slim case. Other than that great product! Would recommend.
3,The product does what it‚Äôs supposed to the one thing I noticed when I have either all my devices charging; ear buds watch iPhone or just one the tend to be warm to the touch I‚Äôm just concerned that it‚Äôs going to deplete the battery‚Äôs longevity. I dunno I‚Äôm not an expert. But the design is nice for a simple clean setup in the bedroom on a nightstand. As for traveling it disassembles however I‚Äôm afraid of putting it somewhere it would get banged around I feel like the craftsmanship is a little cheap and if the clips as you can see in the pictures would happen to break then I‚Äôd be out of a charger. I hope this helps
2,It doesn‚Äôt charge my watch it did when I brought it was the main reason I purchased it
5,Charger was good initially but after a few days would only charge my phone to 90% and then flash red.  I have contacted support to see if they will fix it.  Otherwise I will be returning the product.UpdateI spoke with Customer Service for this product and they were very impressive.  They reached out to me quickly and shipped me a new product! The second product sent to me works well so far and no issues!  I recommend this seller and their product. Impressive customer service!!!
5,there is a spot for all my electronics to get charged and it doesn't take up alot of space on my nightstand.  I have my cell watch and ear buds all charging in one spot and it charges quick
4,Appreciate the streamlined  all-in One charging station design.Only complaint is the watch gets a little hot charging.
5,Great product!  The watch in the flat position is a great approach. Solid device. A/C adapter included.
5,I like that I don‚Äôt have to look for the charger cord to plug in.  I keep it plugged in on my bedside table.
5,I like that it is a one stop plug in for all my products like my phone and apple watch. I love that this is completely wireless in putting my phone on as I can grab and go on a moments notice if I need to take a call in the middle of the night as my job does require this. No fumbling with any wires! The watch is an added feature to sync up with this product.
5,First of all I don‚Äôt even have prime next day shipping and It came the next day but I love it it‚Äôs so cute with the pink color and I hope it doesn‚Äôt break or overheat but the whole thing works. I have a iPhone 12 airpods 2 I believe and Apple Watch 4 or 3 I‚Äôm not sure.
1,Update: They sent me a new one. It worked for 60 days and will no longer charge or light up. Prior to the malfunction I put AirPod Pros on it. It charges the AirpPods slowed the phone charge and now it will not charge my Apple Watch.ZERO STARS and no refunded money.I was ready to pack this up to return it when I gave it one more try (aka-too tired to get iPhone cord out of the drawer). This time I laid my 11 Pro Max horizontally on the base. To my surprise it charged from 5% to 80% in 3 or so hours. Surely not a true fast charge but certainly better than the 1% per 15 minutes I was getting w/my phone in the vertical position.Later I noted that my phone didn‚Äôt lean evenly against the base in the vertical position. I stuck a folded business card between the front lip and my phone so that it would lie flat against the charger. This did improve vertical charging to about 1% per 10 minutes but that just isn‚Äôt acceptable by ANY standard.I placed my phone on the charger while on the phone and while on FaceTime; it immediately disrupted the sound quality of both causing severe static for the opposite party and lesser picture quality on my end.The charger does sufficiently charge my Apple Watch 5.This is a resounding ‚Äúno‚Äù for me. I really wanted it to work as it‚Äôs the only wireless charger with few negative reviews. I cannot recommend this product as it does not work as advertised.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†This charger is really lightweight and compact. I charge my phone with all my Apple gears on my night stand and have not had any issues with charges. This helps eliminate a lot of wires crowded around my night stand. The charging power is also very decent. I did not have to move the phone around to get it to charge properly. I would definitely recommend this purchase!
5,I received the item in good condition but there was a malfunction with one of the connecting springs--one of the springs didn't pop back up so the charger was not working anymore. I contacted the seller since the window to return had expired and received courteous and quick response. I submitted a photo of the problem and a copy of the receipt and they resolved it right away.  I'm very happy with the product and their customer service.
5,I had been looking for something like this for some time that wasn‚Äôt bulky and I‚Äôm so glad I found this! Makes it so easy to dock my phone at the end of the day. The only thing I‚Äôd say that would be annoying is if my phone is dead and I‚Äôd like to play around on my phone you don‚Äôt have a cord to charge it since it has to be docked but it‚Äôs not that big of a deal.
3,This is a ok product it charged my iPhone and apple Watch but it did not charge my ear pods at all.  I noticed that it did heat up just a little when charging my watch and iPhone but nothing happened at all just noticed it.  I had to buy another different stand to charge my iPhone I am just going to buy separate for all my devices instead.  I do not feel that when they are all together with these type of items I seem to find ones that do not work.
5,I had purchased 4 to 5 different chargers prior to this one. Every single one of them did not work sufficiently usually related to the charging of the Apple Watch. This unit is the first unit I have purchased that worked perfectly right out of the box for all three Apple products.  I love it so much that I am mediately purchased a second unit for my suitcase as I travel regularly for work. Highly recommend!!!
5,Easy to connect and super fast charge
5,Was thinking of getting the Mophie brand for $125 then seen this. It‚Äôs 10w and charges every thing perfectly. Would highly recommend!
5,Bought this to replace another bulkier 3-in1 charger that had always been finicky but became totally hit-or-miss (mostly miss) on overnight charging of my iPhone. This design is very well thought out and executed. This 3-in1 is much more compact and can be taken down into 2 pieces easily for travel.It's so easy to charge my Apple Watch AirPods Pro and iPhone on the bedside table at bedtime. Super happy with my purchase!
4,I like the look and the fact that nothing needs to be plugged into this device. I gave ‚Äúease of use‚Äù a lower rating because the phone has to be taken out of the case to charge it otherwise an error light flashes. My phone case is plastic but it has a metal ring on the back.
4,Ordered 2 and one was broken and would not charge the phone. Amazon made it easy. Filled out the forms and a new one sent to me.  The new one works great. I like the design. Charges my Air Pods Pro and my iWatch and the phone at night.
5,The charging station works great.  Nice size small profile for the nightstand.  I have had no problems charging the phone or watch at all.
5,So much easier than using a plug. The plug kept not charging and this works all the time. ‚ù§Ô∏è
5,I love that it charges all three of my devices.
3,I purchased this charger to eliminate all of the wires for charging three devices on the night stand. For that purpose it works well because it has a small footprint. The description says that you can charge the phone either landscape or portrait but it only works portrait. The photo online indicates the two charging locations for the phone but it did not come that way. The watch and pod charger work well and have caused no problems. If you are looking for a small charger that can also be used for travel then this is a good device.
5,No
5,Love this fast charging easy to use definitely deserves a five star rating
5,Really like this 3 n 1 charging.  I use the iphone 11 Pro Max upright but my iphone 12 mini will only work on it's side.  both have clear bumper cases and they still both charge fine.  Had to switch to a higher power wall supply to get moth watch and phone to charge together.  The one that came with it only does one at a time.  Actually we can also charge the Airpod Pro case too 3 devices at the same time.
2,First off the watch and AirPod charging parts seemed to work ok.  However the phone charging section is not dependable.  I would place my phone on the charger and it would appear to charge fine (green light was on).  Then about 5-10 minutes later I would find the lights changed from green to red.  I would remove the phone let the lights go off then place the phone back on the charger.  Everything would appear to be working fine and then sometimes it would charge overnight but most nights I would find the lights had gone back to red and my phone was left uncharged by morning.  I tried power cycling my phone and other little ‚Äútricks‚Äù to no avail.  After a week or so of consistently inconsistent performance I have returned this product.  If I can‚Äôt depend on it charging then what‚Äôs the point?  I gave this 2 stars for the watch and AirPod charging section but ultimately this thing is junk don‚Äôt waste your money.
3,Bought 4 of these units and 3 work 1 does not--" 3 out of 4 ain't bad."üôÉ
5,Sits perfectly on the nightstand for easy access to place for charging or retrieve for using.
4,Bought this when I bought the AirPods Pro and it works great! Nice and compact and helps keep my bedside table clear of extra cables. Only complaint would be how it sometimes stops charging my watch and the starts back up again. Other than that I like it!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†This unit is so compact it saves so much space! The headset tucks in nicely underneath the watch up top and the phone up front.Material has a soft matte feel to the touch and does love to gather my dog's hair but that's all over everything at this point! All three devices charge simultaneously and the unit is more compact than any other units I've used.
5,If you own an iPhone Apple Watch and Airpods then this is a great all in one charging station.  I haven't had any issues with it and everything has been charging perfectly. I really like that you can disassemble it for storage in your suitcase or bag when you are travelling super convenient.  It is very well built and affordable which makes it a great deal!
5,Update  they sent me a new charging station.  Works perfect.  Thank you for the amazing customer service!Frustrating won‚Äôt charge all my devices at one time.
5,I very very rarely write reviews but I felt I needed to for this product.Finally a wireless charger that securely holds and charges my phone that has a case and a pop socket!!Slim sleek design takes up little room on my nightstand. Set up took about 60 seconds. I love that it comes apart which will be useful for travel. 100% worth the money!!
5,First off I'm not sure what the "thickness" rating is all about so I rated in the middle. It's an odd question but the charger is not some things cheap charger if that's what it was getting at. This charging stand is great. Easy setup and looks sleek and stylish perfect addition to my office desk. Im planning on buying a couple more in a week or so for some Christmas gifts because for the price I think they are practically giving these away. Highly recommend.
1,I bought this and after few weeks the Watch  charger stopped working.so I contacted the seller and after a series of sending them photos to prove it would'nt charge they agreed to send me a replacement charger.However the replacement also stopped charging the watch.The Phone Charge and the earbud charge seem to work fine the problem is only with the watch charging.Which sucks
2,After two months of use the watch portion of the charger stopped working!
5,This wireless charging station works great! I charge my watch AirPod and iPhone at the same time with no problem. It is a great product if you want to save your office space and not have bunch of wires hanging around for each device. It makes my desk look very organized. Definitely recommend to everyone! You won‚Äôt regret it!
5,Charges rapidly easy to set up and use!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I am an iphone 12 max pro  airpod pro and apple watch 6 user.I have been uncomfortable because there are many adaptors and lines for charging.This item can remove all massy them on my desk.It is too easy for three of them at the same time for charging and charging speed is satisfiedIt is convenient.
5,My husband can‚Äôt get enough of this product it changes his phone but not mine but it‚Äôs because of my case it charges my AirPods through the rubber case and it attach to my watch easily I really like this .So here is an update the product stop charging my phone after a day the watch and AirPod charger worked fine but the phone side started acting up
4,would have been cool if they wre able to charge the dre beats charger box like the ipod charger box...but still a nice product!
5,Greta deal. Works like it should!
1,This product works well but the adapter came apart while plugged into the wall.  My daughter tried to remove it and received an electric shock - obviously a hazard!  I am now afraid to attempt to remove the piece that is stuck in the outlet and this adapter is necessary to operate the unit to its full capacity.
5,Love the wireless charge feature for 3 items. I can charge everything at the same time and the charge is strong enough to go through my AirPods case. Would buy again but there‚Äôs no need at the moment for another one because the product is durable and still works!
5,We love how well this charger works for charging all of our devices.
3,Super
5,I love this charging station for all of my apple products! It‚Äôs so easy to use! I hated having to disconnect my watch to put in my AirPods or phone. This is soooo much easier!
3,If your phone is not lined up just right the charger won‚Äôt charge. Works well enough just needs a tech upgrade
5,I use this for iPhone 11 Bose QC earbuds and Apple Watch 6. Works great for me and my phone is in an Otterbox case too. No issues after a couple days at least. It‚Äôs nice to finally get rid of the 3 cord mess on my tiny nightstand. No more searching for wires on the floor to find the right one and then fumbling to connect them in the dark.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I've had a number of different charging solutions but this one is easily the best design. Since everything is wireless I can simply place each device in it's designated spot and it'll charge. No need to fuss with fraying cables that drop off the nightstand when you unplug it. It's just easy.
5,I have my I phone 13 my ear buds and my Apple Watch on it right now - all three are charging nicely! I highly reccomend!
3,I would have given this product a 5 star had it not been on how sensitive this product is.  The cell phone and watch need to be exactly in the proper zone or it blinks red.  Other factors such as being too close to other electrical products cause the red light to blink.  There is really no rhyme or reason why certain conditions cause the unit to blink red and not charge.  When working it works fine.
5,S√∫per Esa√∫ to set up and  work really good
4,Bed stand convenient
4,Did exactly as promised works very well
5,This product has been working very well for the past month and change! I‚Äôm so glad there‚Äôs no need to have an additional charger for your Apple Watch! The only tiny thing I noticed is once the watch is finished charging when I wore it right away it was quite warm. I‚Äôm not sure if that may lead to overheating if left on charge for 4+ hours but it‚Äôs worth mentioning. All-in-all this device is perfect for your room/office!
5,I can actually charge two iPhones and my Apple watch at the same time and really fast. This charger is so convenient allowing me to eliminate 3 separate cables and power adapters and using a single setup. Its great for travel as well as it can be broken down to pack easily. I will be buying another one for my bedroom night stand.
2,I don‚Äôt know if I received a defective product however my charger takes a really long time to charge my iPhone and Apple Watch even when I do them one at a time. The charger is really cute and convenient and after reading everyone‚Äôs reviews I feel as if there maybe something wrong with the charger I received.
1,It charges your phone airpods and watch fast and just fine when it‚Äôs new. I bought mine 2 months ago and it already is not charging my phone at all. It will connect to the phone for about 10 seconds and say it‚Äôs charging and then when i check on it later it is no longer charging. This does not happen when i use my other wireless chargers my phone does just fine on those. Very disappointed in the quality since I can no longer get my money back or exchange it.
5,Seems well built and stand does not slide around just wish cord was a little longer
4,I almost returned this because it wouldn‚Äôt change my iPhone 12 Pro Max. Fortunately a fellow reviewer mentioned powering down the iPhone and restarting prior to using this unit. It worked like a charm.
5,No issues at all with my iPhone 13 ProMax and Apple Watch 7 plus it charges them quickly.
5,It's best if stationary not good for travel. Charges great!
4,This a great value for the money! I have seen similar products that require multiple cords which is inconvenient but this a great and easy to use with only 1 cord! The charging device is compacts and a perfect thickness for a desk space.
5,Ordered this as I have been having a hard time finding a charger that will work with my iPhone 12 pro max but I was happy to find out that this charger dose work. I do have an issue sometimes with charging but when I pick up and replace my phone it will start to charge. Overall I am happy with this charger.
5,I ordered this 3 in 1 charger after looking at many options and reading reviews about this and other similar products.  This charger had the features that were important to me: able to charge multiple Apple devices narrow profile fast phone charge without removing case unobtrusive "on" light and easy to take apart for travel.  So far it works well.  I would recommend this product.
5,I charge my phone AirPods Pro in case and Apple Watch every night. It‚Äôs great. Something to be aware about is to make sure the green lights are lit when charging or it‚Äôs not connected properly. I had to unplug and plug it in again about 2 times since I bought it to fix this issue. It‚Äôs worked perfectly for the  past two months.
5,I‚Äôve been looking for a charger god my son and husband that would charge all three Apple devices; iPhone iPods and Apple Watch. I‚Äôve purchased two others only to be disappointed because they didn‚Äôt charge all three devices. I took a chance snd purchased this and if works GREAT! Both my son and husband are very happy with it. Works great charges all three devices quickly!
3,I think this would be a great product but it does NOT work with the iPhone 12 Mini in the vertical position. If you don't care that your iPhone 12 Mini will be horizontal then it's a great device. However because the charger uses two magnets in the vertical position the iPhone 12 Mini's magnet falls between the two charging magnets on the device. I'll be returning it today. When you do a search on Amazon for wireless chargers for iPhone 12 Mini be very careful. Amazon search will bring up lots but NONE for the iPhone 12 MINI.
5,n/a
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†My husband got this for me as a gift and I really enjoy it so far! It looks really nice on my bedside stand and works really well. I have a thick otter box on my iPhone and it charges through that without a problem which really impressed me. Unfortunately I don‚Äôt have AirPods so I can‚Äôt say anything about that part!
5,I just got this so I don‚Äôt know how well it will hold up but I love the design. It‚Äôs compact and the chargers work well. I bought it to replace something similar. The other design I had purchased I could never get the phone aligned correctly to charge. This one works first time every time.
4,I love the size of the all in one charger. Could be great for travel as it easily lays flat and charges my Apple Watch earbuds and iPhone. Works great on the iPhone 12 Pro Max as well!
5,Small and compact. The charge is fast and the price was reasonable. Great buy
3,Doesn't work with a case. You'd need to take it out every time.
5,This works great so far - I‚Äôve had it for almost three weeks. I love how easy it is to charge my Apple products and its compact size. I had to remove my pop socket which sucks but the ease of charging now makes up for that.
5,Just unpack and plug in and you are good to go!
5,Product was easy to set up right out of the box. It works as advertised and charges my multiple devices (I phone watch and ear buds) quickly. I would but it again.
5,Love it! Bought it to replace my other one when the wireless pad gave out quickly and it was too big - this one is small sleek and works well! I only wish they would make them to where you can charge the airpod case without taking the cover off but no biggie!
5,Fast charges all my Apple Accessories
4,I love this charger. I purchased it to replace one that was going out and having the  capability to charge all of my devices with one unit is so much more convenient for me.
5,I do like it
5,I have been using this product for a week. and I am very happy with it.  Compact charging with just one wire! I no longer need my plug socket no more fighting for the apple charges!!! It was exactly what I hoped to get to streamline my charging needs for my Apple products.Absolutely awesome product!
5,I was looking to get a charger which can charge all my devices without too much of wires showing for each of my device. Now i can charge my apple phone watch and airpods all at once with this beautiful wireless charger. The charging speed is great and i am super satisfied.
4,Really wanted to be excited about this but it will not charge air pods. I‚Äôve tried everything. Very disappointed since I got this for the purpose of charging everything at once.
5,The Hatalkin 3 in 1 charger really works. It has been a lifesaver so your not charging separately.
5,Love being able to just lay my phone watch and AirPods on it. No more plugging stuff in or having multiple chargers!
3,I am giving this product  3 stars because it is a great product BUT I‚Äôm not sure if this is how they sent it or if It got damaged during delivery but I am very disappointed on how I received this package.I understand that things happen and boxes can get damaged but this one to me is unacceptable. Luckily the charging station still worked just fine and I am happy with the item. I would still recommend this product I just hope someone else doesn‚Äôt receive it the way I did.
5,Love how fast it charges My IPhone and watch and AirPods
5,This thing works flawlessly with the iPhone 13 pro max and Apple Watch. Well worth the money.  10O% satisfied!
5,Great product!!! Easy to use and charges fast!!!
4,easy to use and quick charging for my needs
5,Good quality.
3,Overheats when watch and iPhone 12 charged together overnight especially when iPhone 12 is has battery less than 50 percent. It stops charging the phone and red light turns on. It started having this issue 1 month after purchase. Not convenient in the morning when you wake up and see that your phone does not have issue.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I have been looking for a product like this to help me charge my Apple Watch IPhone and AirPods all in one instead of plugging each one if a different outlet. I am happy I came across this charging station.  It‚Äôs very convenient and easy to use. I love how quickly it charges my products!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†A well built product nice finishes well thought as it disassembles for traveling  obviously takes less space on a night stand and uses only one power socket. It charges just as fast as the original adapters. Everything good I hope it will last as much I recommend.
5,Omg! This is honestly the best gadget to get if you have all the apple products. It charges them all so quickly and conveniently without having to plug anything in. It‚Äôs also super compact &  easy to take with you while traveling. Don‚Äôt second guess it! Get it
5,Works Great- no bright lights when charging
2,Like the phone charger but it made my watch really hot. I have a new series 7 and the charger that came with it does not do that. I am thinking of sending it back. Scared me a little because it is an expensive watch.
5,Works great hAve has no issues.
5,All devices charging at the same time! PERFECT!!!
5,This unit is my second.  The first of a different brand would not charge my IPhone 12 plus with my otter box hard case not even with a thin silicon cover.  It also required you to assemble your watch charger into it.  I was pretty disappointed.  I looked long and hard to find this unit and it works wonderfully.  Five stars.
5,Everything works pretty smoothly. Once when all my devices (phone watch and AirPods) were being charged at the same time my phone didn't fully charge and there was a red indicator on the charger. Not sure what happened there but that was just once since I bought the product. Overall I highly recommend it
2,Out of three advertised charging ports‚Ä¶only one works. It charges perfectly as long as I lean it upright.
5,Doesn‚Äôt take up much space
5,We have tried other units that didn‚Äôt function as well as this one. Wish we had seen this one first.
5,Love this charger! I love that I don‚Äôt have to have a separate cord for my phone and watch like some of the other chargers. It charges very quickly! I also like that I can just set my phone and watch down and they charge without having to adjust them over and over again to get them sitting just right.
4,This is my second charger similar concept but this one is much better quality takes up less space and isn‚Äôt extremely touchy like the one I had in the past
4,This product works very well. The convenience of being able to place all of my daily electronics on it to charge and pick them up without the hassle of chords is great.
1,Edit - Unfortunately the product quit charging 3 days after it was out of its 30 day warranty.  What started out as a promising product became fodder for my trash can.I use most Apple products from my laptop to my iPhone and needed an all in one charging device just to de clutter my night stand.  I checked a few reviews and decided to give the Hatalkin a try.  This product was everything I needed.  I had purchased the Qi quick charger from Verizon when I purchased my iPhone 12 Pro Max and although I haven‚Äôt preformed any actual tests this device seems to outperform the Verizon brand. Plus I had trouble getting the phone in the right position to charge on the Verizon brand. I have no such problem using the Hatalkin.  Just drop the phone on it and it‚Äôs charging. My Apple Watch and AirPods are the same. Quick and easy with a compact form.  The only 4 star I gave it was the travel category and that‚Äôs because you have to break it down to go in a bag. However that only takes about 10 seconds and you‚Äôre done.  I can‚Äôt rate it‚Äôs longevity yet because I‚Äôve not had it long enough but it definitely is a winner so far.  I definitely recommend it!
5,I really like this. It charges my phone & watch super fast.  Sometimes the back cord that plugs in slips out but not a big deal.
5,This wireless charger is AMAZING and for the price? I bought this for my fianc√© for Christmas and he absolutely loves it. He always forgets his Apple Watch in the morning but with this it makes it so he grabs his phone air pods and his Apple Watch on his way out the door. I‚Äôm buying one for myself as well!
5,Love these chargers.  3 in 1 combo simplifies charging.
5,BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!  I bought this for my fianc√© and he loves it.  I use it as well and it is more than I expected. From someone who is very tech savvy and usually stays with Apple products/chargers he is also extremely impressed. Love this charger!!
5,Great charging power. For me it is not ideal for traveling as it is not foldable. I travel light so it will not be going on the road. It‚Äôs perfect on my nightstand.
5,As expected. Very pleased
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Love the 3 in 1 wireless charging station not only are all my gadgets in one place but they quickly charge and are ready to go at anytime! It‚Äôs super lightweight and looks sleek without the hassle of all the chords. Highly recommend!
5,Very nice charger for charging several devices at once.
3,Its good for charging my watch and earpods but for my iphone it takes forever to charge also i had to remove the case to get it to charge however i liked using it as a stand for my iphone to watch somethingI guess Not the best quality
5,The 3 in 1 wireless charger is easy to assemble and use.  It is compact so great for travel.  The charging power allows for a quick and easy charge. One neat feature is being able to charge your phone vertically or horizontally.  I bought mine and then ordered a second one for my husband; great buy!
5,It‚Äôs great to be able to set my phone and watch on it and not have to mess with plugs!! Charges devices well!
5,Recently got new Apple watch plus iphone and airpods that had before really need something like this so I can have all of them charged over night. It is very nice and convenient on my night stand particularly like the way that the phone can standup so it is easy to check when there is a notification.
4,Good but IT has a low power when tree products are conected. But works
4,Great charger for the price. Once the unit is plugged in everything else charges completely wirelessly. No problem with charging all 3 at one not as quick charging as I would like.
5,I initially thought the station wasn‚Äôt working and requested a refund; then I realized I had the station plugged into a USB port and it really had to be plugged into an outlet.  But so far it‚Äôs very well and I‚Äôve canceled my return.
3,This is a decent charger for the money.  I constantly have to unplug and replug it in to keep it working.  But overall decent.I will eventually get another one for home and just use this one for traveling.
5,This is exactly what was described fast changing very easy to use avoiding all the extra wires
1,This devise worked for one week. I loved it at first. Then it just stopped charging my ear buds. I contacted the seller and explained what was wrong. There was a card in the box that said they would replace or trouble shoot any problem. I explained to them what was wrong and they wanted so much info.  Including a video ????????? I sent them everything except the video..  I told them there is no need for a video... No contact from them after that exchange.I'm sending it back to amazon and ordered a different brand.
5,Wow. Never thought I needed this until now. Makes life so easy that I can come home at the end of every day and throw all my Apple products on one charging dock. I especially like the wireless charger on the back for my AirPods. I‚Äôd always forget to charge those and now I never do. Great buy for a decent price!
1,Do not buy this item. It will charge your watch AirPods and iPhone great for a couple days and then stop working. But if you switch to another outlet it will work again for another couple days and then stop. I did this 3 times and gave up.
1,The charger stopped working 3 days after the return time was up.  The description said there was a year warranty.  Received no help from Amazon.  After much searching I found an email address for the company.  Emailed them for instructions for activating the warranty.  Have not heard anything back.  Apparently the warranty is about as good as the product.  I do not recommend this product.
5,Sometimes does not fully charge the AirPods Pro but the rest of the products work fine
5,This is a great compact wireless charger to daily charge my iPhone Apple Watch and Airpods all together. It looks nice on my black desk but most importantly saves me the trouble on cable management. Am considering buying another one for my office.
5,Very pleased with this charger and it‚Äôs ability. It is built very well.
5,Great purchase! Charges my phone in less time than the power cord the phone comes with. Small and compact so it doesn‚Äôt take up too much space on my bedstand for charging three different devices.
4,Charging speed is okay and perfect for overnight use
2,Ordered 2 one for me and one for the wife. After 10 months her watch charger portion stopped working. We liked the design and the less chargers cluttered on our night stands  but are less than thrilled with it stopping working after 10 months.
5,The charger was simple to set up and use. The charger is a fast charger and worth the buy.
4,Bought two. Mine is working great. Spouses didn‚Äôt work so we had to get a replacement. It‚Äôs really nice on the night stand and removes some clutter!
4,My smart watch is very hot when I take it off the recharger......the iPhone & ear buds are not hot at all........wondering why?
3,Good customer support. They sent me another unit although the watch charger still doesn't work I appreciate their loyalty to customers. Apple watch charger is faulty.
1,The iPhone charger works but the Apple Watch charger doesn‚Äôt work anymore. Bought in December 2021 and wasted $50 for less than a year of working and the return policy is 30 days. Hopefully the seller will replace the charger but I have no way of getting a hold of them.
2,I returned the item. It did not function properly. The LED lights stopped working after 4 hours and it stopped charging my phone after a few hours. The watch portion cycled on and off all night in a cool room.
5,I really like this stand.  It allows me to see the phone while my apple watch is charging.  I don't have airpods but have no doubt theyd charge fine as well.A nice piece to have on my desk and keep things organized.
5,I purchased this charger after having issues with a different wireless charger I had tried. I love how the charging light isn‚Äôt too bright and the raised charging spot for your smartwatch makes it so much easier to ensure your smartwatch is on there and charging properly.
5,I love it it's small neat and organized.
5,There are a lot of these on the market . I liked this because it was compact and didn‚Äôt require the use of the OEM watch charger. I have only had it a few days but so far I‚Äôm happy with it
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I like there product.  It is easy to set up and even easier to use.  The recharging time is relative short.  As advertise this device will charge three items simultaneously.
5,Love this product works great for office and bedroom charging station I would highly recommend this product.
2,This actually works very nicely to wirelessly charge my iPhone 12 Pro Max and Watch 5 series at the same time. But it heats them up so much especially the iPhone that I went back to the Lightning to USB cable. Now it makes for a nice stand that I really get a lot of use out of as it follows me around the house.
5,This product is easy to set up and use. It is quickly recognized by both my iPhone 11 and AirPods pros. While I don‚Äôt have an Apple Watch currently I don‚Äôt anticipate any problems charging that also. It is easy to break down for travel and has a small footprint.
5,No complaints iPhone 12 iWatch and iPods charge flawlessly. I'm sure some people will complain that it doesn't put the watch on their wrists automatically. Or perhaps it doesn't smell nice. Or...you get my point.
3,The charger works great for my watch and my AirPods. However I have put my phone to charge several times and most of the times I wake up the next morning with it not being charged at all.
5,Great product easy to use. After a hard days work it‚Äôs easy to take off your iwatch and dock it on the charger along with your phone‚Ä¶ no more lost wires or fighting over the charger with my son. Highly recommended
5,Great for traveling. Easy to use.
3,Would be 5 starts EXCEPT the holder at the bottom for phone doesn‚Äôt allow phone with case seat in slot due to phone case. It works sometimes but usually does not. The rest of the stand works perfectly. If you don‚Äôt have a phone case then it will be great for you.
1,Horrible  will not charge the phone and when on the charger the phone gets hot. I feel like it will explode.It's really pretty and I really wanted it to work but it does not :(
5,This is exactly what I needed. Great to organize all my apple products.
5,Charges iPhone Apple Watch and AirPods  easily and very neatly on the desk.  Love this.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†So far the product works great. It is the perfect size for my iPhone 12 Pro Max with a case on it that protects the camera. I don‚Äôt have AirPods so I can‚Äôt review the charge on those but my iWatch and iPhone charge great!
5,Only had a day but is working perfectly well. Charging iPhone 12pro Apple Watch 5 and AirPods Pro.Nice and neat takes up very little room. All devices are charging without having to fiddle around to locate the actual charge pad. Have tried a few and this has been the best one.
5,This is the bees knees. Someone bought me a phone stand for Xmas 2019 and I loved it. This is a phone stand and charges everything to boot. I will be ordering one for the office and as Cmas gifts this year.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Works perfectly. I have a wallet case and a silicone case for my airpods pro and they are charging well while still on. I was afraid I was gonna have to take off.
5,We are new to the wireless charging.  Got new phones and got new chargers.  Got two for home and two for travel. Hubby and I have Apple watches and this charger works great.
1,When this first arrived I was initially pleased.  That night I put my airpods pro on the base my iWatch on the arm and sat my iPhone 12 pro on the incline.  The two lights in front turned green and all devices were charging.  At this point I was very pleased and turned in for sleep.  I woke up about 4:00am and the lights in front were red and my phone was almost completely discharged with almost zero charge.  I tried resetting it but the same thing happened.  So I contacted customer support.  No response.  I contacted two more times through the app.  No response.  Very frustrating.  I kept trying for three days and the same thing happened.  It can't be used unless you want to run your phone down to zero charge.  But even more concerning is absolute stonewalling by the seller.  HORRIBLE.  Don't know if it works with other phones but does NOT WORK with iPhone 12 Pro.UPDATE 12/5/20- I AM USING IPHONE 12 PRO running iOS 14.2.1.  I TRIED DOING THE COLD BOOT (RESTARTING) THE PHONE SUGGESTED BY COMPANY AND TRIED AGAIN.  NO LUCK!  STILL DOES NOT WORK.  CHARGES FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES AND THEN DISCHARGES.
5,No more wires everywhere! Plus t has a beautiful design!  Charges all the electronics all at once.  No waist of time! it detects the gadget and it charges.  Easy to use.
5,My husband liked me a lot
5,Bought this item because my previous multiple charging station was so bulky and took up a lot of counter space. I also recently traveled with it and love that I didn't have to pack multiple charging cables for my watch AirPods and iPhone! Best purchase I‚Äôve made!
2,Every since I used it it over heat my phone I return.
3,The product worked almost as described however the LED lights barely illuminate when charging occurs.  Because of this it can make it difficult to see if the items are not just charging but continuing to charge should there be issues with them or the charger.  I also did not appreciate the "rebate" letter that came within the package as I believe it's there to inflate the review score.
5,I really liked how easily everything charges but it is NOT fast charging. When I have my phone plugged in it does a full charge in about 30 mins. I could have the phone on the wireless charging for 6 hours and it only slowly charges.
4,Love this charger but doesn‚Äôt always stay connected with the otter box case on my phone.
5,This came in a small box and was very easy to hook together. It looks nice charges both my watch and phone fast. I like that there is NO bright light when charging so it‚Äôs easy to fall asleep at night since it‚Äôs on my nightstand.
3,Exactly what I was looking foe but my Apple 12 Pro doesn‚Äôt always charge? I have woke up a few times to a near dead battery (review written one month in and this just started occurring).  I will need to watch closely to see if it‚Äôs me even though I check every time I put it on the chather to ensure it is charging...hmm
5,I love that I can touch my phone in the middle of the night and see the time.  No more fumbling to grab it in the dark.
5,You will wonder how you ever lived without this item if you use an iwatch iphone and airpods.  If the vertical part we‚Äôre flexible to flatten for travel it would be perfect.
5,Ised for the iphone
1,It was great until it died right after the return window closed. Just stopped charging all of a sudden.
5,So far so good! Haven‚Äôt had any issues while charging my 12 Pro Max AirPods Pro and Series 6 watch simultaneously. Sometimes they get warm but haven‚Äôt seen any issues with battery life.
5,Feels great in hand. Charge everything great BUT severely overpriced and with my new iPhone 12 Pro Max with the outer box case it would not charge through the case wirelessly so I had to send it back unfortunately. Case fault not charger.
5,This is a great product!!! It does not charge as fast as advertised but it is so easy to use it does it all by itself... I bought mine and 2 more for my dear friends... Early Christmas present... Thank you for selling such a great product!!! - Robert
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†Its great with EarPods pro all the watches and iPhone 10 / 12 max pro.  Easy to set up.  Has small lights on base front to give you the green light ask are charging just fine.  Terrific product
5,Everything about this product is just what I needed. It connects easily and charges 3 Apple products at one time not having to worry about having multiple usb to lightning cables to charge them. I would definitely recommend this product for sure. You won‚Äôt regret it.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I received this product today and I already love it! It is super easy to set up and it has a really nice matt feel to it. Everything works really well and it charges my phone really fast!
3,It does not charge fast enough and it doesn‚Äôt seem to charge my air pods at all
5,Me agrado todo
2,I was looking for a charging station that was big enough to use for my phone but it was too small I couldn‚Äôt use the stand at all for my phone it basically had to naked in order to fit in that space and I don‚Äôt feel comfortable leaving my phone like that for long periods of time
5,LOOKS GREAT AND WORKS GREAT!
5,It‚Äôs great for charging all three things at one time. Plus you can charge your phone and charge it with a plug-in as well. Super fast.
1,This item just doesn‚Äôt work! Not for anything it advertised. The magnets it are strong but that‚Äôs it‚Ä¶. Very disappointed. Don‚Äôt buy!
5,This charger is great! But it‚Äôs even more great for traveling. It‚Äôs one thing. For everything. Lol.I didn‚Äôt appreciate it as much before but not having to stress about packing multiple chargers was awesome.
5,good
2,This charger doesn‚Äôt work work with cases. 3 of our phones wouldn‚Äôt even connect with the charger we had to remove the cases to charge. The watch and air pods worked fine.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†I will recommend this product. It‚Äôs easier to use. I only use it for my phone but I like that I only have to put my phone over the device. I will only suggest to take the case off before charging.
5,recharges my phone watch and headphones simultaneously!
5,I love that I don‚Äôt  need a bunch of cords to charge my things. It charges quick and doesn‚Äôt take up too much room! Definitely worth the price and exactly what i was looking for!!
5,It‚Äùs easy to use and make my table clean. It can be separated into three parts good for traveling. And it can provide power for two iPhones and one iwatch efficiency charging station friendly to a fan of apple
4,Good value for the money.  We've had no issues with it so far.
4,It works great with some cases but doesn‚Äôt work with otterbox cases
3,this unit works good but you must put everything is the perfect spot to charge.This is why I gave 3 stars because if you bump it or don't put your items in the good spot you come back to an uncharged item. Also on a 12 max pro you cannot charge sideways only in the upright position.
3,Doesn‚Äôt always work. I wake up with the red light (not charging) blinking. The device says to restart phone if this happens but it didn‚Äôt solve the problem.
3,The charger works great for my iphone but the watch charger continuously disconnects from my apple watch causing it to beep on and off all night.  I ended up using my original apple watch charger.
2,This is so cute and it worked No annoying lights at night. But it only last 44 days. So annoying so cheap! Don‚Äôt buy
5,This product has fast charging power and is so easy to use. It‚Äôs on my night stand daily and I can‚Äôt wait to use it for traveling as well to keep my apple products all charged in a small space.
1,Purchased two of these and they were great at the beginning but after about two months of usage but units stopped working for charging phones.  The pads for the watch and air pods continue to work.  Tried different power adapters but nothing worked. Sending both units to the trash can. Don‚Äôt waste your money.
5,I was skeptical of this product and would  give a shot and to be my surprise it is well made.It charged my airpod and iphone very well. I dont see any issues and it is charging quite well.thank you
5,If it does not work on your 12 Pro Max hard reboot phone and it will work.  Seems like this is a known issue with the 12Max hopefully it will get fixed with the next update.  After rebooting the phone it charged just fine.
5,It is my first wireless charger so far. I have been charged my iphone11 apple watch 3 and AirPods Pro for one month. Nothing bad! I also recommended to my roommates who are two crazy apple fans. Hope they love this too!
5,Takes little space reliably charges all devices quickly.  I wish I had not wasted money on other chargers before discovering this one
5,My daughter loved it but make sure that your charging case for the earbuds is 2nd generation. My daughter‚Äôs were not so it would not work. We bought a refurbished 2nd generation case and it works perfectly!
5,It does what I expected
3,The charging sensor in the 12 mini sits too low so doesn‚Äôt charge correctly (red light intermittent charging or no charging at all). I made a little lift out of cardboard so the phone sits higher in the cradle. This seems to have fixed the problem. My iPhone 10 charges fine.
2,Watch flashed on every couple of minutes the first night. After six hours of charging iPhone 12 @ 87%. Return
5,Light weight and perfect charging and looks great
5,This 3 in 1 wireless charger is excellent.  I love how all 3 apple devices can charge and the space it takes is much smaller than most other chargers.  Very happy with this product.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†I would like to say that this is a great product. I had had no trouble and it is very easy to use and no need for using multiple cables to charge!!! Recommend it 100%!!!
4,Works good for Apple Watch and iPhone!!!
3,Even though I have a iPhone case from apple that is suppose to support wire less charging it does not working with this charger. Every time I have to charge my phone I have to remove it from its case
3,This charger works very fast when it works. Came with a known issue with iOS. About half the time it won‚Äôt charge. But when it does works very well. Sometimes requires a phone reboot to work sometimes just remove then replace the phone. AirPods and watch work well.
5,Not only is it covenant to charge everything at the same time but small footprint is a big plus.
1,It worked for maybe 24 hours before never charging again. Don‚Äôt waste your $$
5,This item is great for the home.. it is a little bulky for travel.. all things can charge at once without adding 3 charging cables.ü§ó
5,I love that I can charge everything all in the same place so convenient! Does make a slight humming noise that I can only hear at night when everything is quiet but it works great and I enjoy it.
5,A great wireless charging station that works on iPhone 12 Pro Max. A great design and can be dissembled to take on the road. The plug in wall charger comes with it too while some others want extra for that. Cable long enough to reach my nightstand.
4,Worked fine just not with the new iPhone 12max.
5,It is very easy to use it is very convenient does not need too much data cable it is easy to carry out. Also looks really clean with my set up„ÄÇRecommend it to many of my friends.
1,Update 6/2022The seller has reached out to refund me even though it is out of warranty. That type of service is hard to find now a days! I would recommend doing business with a company that takes care of their customers like this!I did love this charger but I believe it is somewhat ineffective after a few months. It charges my phone and ear buds fine but my watch keeps lighting up during the night because it is charging off and on. I would return this if the return window was still open.
5,Bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife who uses it to charge he iPhone Apple Watch and earbuds.  Can charge all three at same time.  Really like the small footprint it takes up on the counter.
2,Unit has a solid build and appropriate weighting. However the product details/Q&A sections seem purposefully vague as to whether MagSafe charging is a feature. Thankfully there is a demonstration video showing an individual tipping the unit side to side while both phone and watch remained attached to the unit throughout. Unfortunately that video is false advertising. There is not magnetic support in the main phone docking charger. Zero. Furthermore I have an extremely thin case measuring 2mm but yet still got inconsistent charging connection when placing my phone vertically on the main charger. There are better products out there. They may not be as aesthetically pleasing but they do what they say they do and do not rely on misleading info to secure a purchase.
5,Works as advertised.
5,Works great
5,Altamente recomendado. Excelente para iPhone 12 Pro Max. Carga perfecto con el case puesto y carga r√°pido los 3 Devices a la ves
5,Just plug and play extremely easy set up and charges fast and well.  Definitely worth the value.  I have it at my desk and place my headphones watch and phone on it fully charged and no worries about charging issues.
2,Isn‚Äôt charging Apple Watch nor AirPods and has had a shortage since I received it
1,This product is junk. Have had for literally one month and now it‚Äôs not working at all. Just showing a red light when plugged in and won‚Äôt charge anything. Conveniently stopped working right after the return window was closed too so a complete waste of money.
4,Works well. Easy to use. Charges all three Apple products efficiently.
3,I love the concept it charges my watch quickly the phone not so much‚Ä¶ For some reason it only charges the phone up to about 60% and then the green light turns red. I have to take it off and replace it to get a full charge. That is annoying!
4,Works great and charges quickly
1,I bought this to charge my iPhone 12 Pro and my Apple Watch and while it is fine charging one or the other it does not charge both at the same time.
3,I like it works great just doesn‚Äôt work if you have a life proof case on so if you plan on using a life proof and don‚Äôt want to always take it off then find something different
5,I had a hard time deciding whether to buy or not. Once it came it was an easy setup and compared to the old wireless chargers this one is by far one of the best ones I have had.
1,The station looks great and ideally would be the perfect compact station if it worked properly. I have had to turn my phone horizontally to get it to charge. Also the station will not charge my iwatch at all instead it has made my watch run hot and drained the charge completely.  I am giving this a 2 star just because it‚Äôs nice to look at and nothing more. I will be returning this product immediately.
5,Great product nice stand and chargers all three devices simultaneously.  Also breaks down for ease of packing when traveling.  Highly recommended if you have multiple wireless charging devices!  So many less wires on my nightstand now
4,Works as it should
5,Perfect size! Charges AirPods watch and phone fast. I use it at my work station.I bought another brand from another retailer online for my nightstand and it was such a rip off.
5,I love this charger. Just the phone needs a little longer to charge although it says ‚Äúfast charger‚Äù.
5,This is so easy to use next to my bed.My previous charger had a plug in piece for the charging area on my IPhone that was difficult to use when it was dark in the room and very frustrating.
2,Beware of this charger.  It is a little finicky when it comes to the phone placement.  While it does work to charge your phone sometimes more often than not it errors on phone and its red indicator light blinks.  I have changed the usb plugged into an outlet plugged into a usb port.  Nothing seems to make a difference.  Clearly the manufacturer knew about the issues as there is a sticker on the unit suggesting the steps I took.  In concept it is great.  Never had a problem with the watch or pod charging docks just the phone which is what you need to make sure works most consistently...
5,I love this product charge really fast and is just 1 cable for all 3 devices
5,I love how compact affordable & convenient this stand is. Its very easy to setup & very well built. The light indicator lights up when the devices start charging which is a plus. Doesn‚Äôt require an apple watch charging cable as its built in. Simply Amazing!
2,Wanted a nice setup to charge my new apple 13 pro max airpods and iwatch.  I am very disappointed that this does not charge my iphone at an acceptable rate.  It takes literally hours just to partially charge my phone.  I can't return it because I threw out the packaging so it now is a glorified iwatch / ipods charger.  Very disappointed.
4,Easy to use with phone watch and airpods
1,When I first got it I loved it for the first few days. The good stuff is what you read in the product bio - as the title suggests in theory it's very convenient and I loved the idea of being able to take one charger for 3 devices on trips etc.The reality is the product is barely useable in my opinion. The charging times are horrendously slow - my phone when charging as the only device hooked up to the dock takes around 4 hours. I tried to get around this by just leaving my phone on it overnight but despite leaving it charging with a green light from the dock I consistently come back to find my phone not fully charged and the red light displayed (which many reviews have mentioned). You can get around this problem if the red light appears instantly but if you leave the phone on the green light and at some point after that the failure happens the phone will not charge.
5,I am able to charge 2 phones and a iWatch at the same time. It charges much faster than the regular pull in charger. I highly recommend this. I‚Äôm gonna buy one as a gift.
5,I really love mine. I never use all 3 at once though. But I use the phone and watch part nightly. I love how the phone lays to display it and it still charges with my pop socket on my phone
1,It is heating up the watch and AirPod. Not change the watch and AirPods faster very slow on those. It is worth only for iphone charging.
1,A piece of junk my watch was on it for several hours it got hot and did not charge. My AirPods were on the same amount of time and did not charge same goes for the phone. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. I am returning it!!!
5,This item was perfect for the night table by the bed.  With the CPap machine and the lamp  this item fit perfect and replaced the alarm clock .. good purchase.. good for friends with phone and watch ..
5,Charges quickly. Works with iphone 12 mini magsafe. Doesn't overheat.Very compact than the other flat 3-in-1. You can disassemble it for easy travel storage.Solid quality build.
5,Works as advertised.  Love it.
1,Overheated. Phone and watch became very hot.  Returned it.
2,I was disappointed that it doesn't charge my ear pods
5,I simply loved it! It works perfectly!
5,Good for charging multiple devices. Good for people who use their phone for an alarm and don‚Äôt like bright lights from digital alarm clocks!
5,charges fast and compact
5,Traveled with it once and didn‚Äôt feel to confident snapping the two pieces on and off. Other than that awesome product to leave at home and easy charge for all apple products
1,No customer service the watch portion worked for about 4 weeks then it died and it is a slow charger. Dont recommend
5,Bought this for my wife and she loves it because of the convience i purchased one before that stoped working after 3 days but this one seems to be pretty good! So far so good
5,Charging station for all your apple products. It charges your iPhone Apple Watch and AirPods simultaneously with fast charge capability. Only one power line to the wall charger no need for other cables. Highly recommend.
1,Does not charge my phone at all. Ok on the watch
2,This takes forever to charge my new IPhone 13 Pro Max and of course its non refundable. Buyer beware I love the way it looks but it's really no good to me if the charge takes too long and that's only with the phone! I can't imagine what will happen when I add a watch and Airpods! I chalked this up as an "L" for me. Not a happy camper at all!
5,Works well with my iPhone 12 Pro Max. I have a case on it so I have to make sure that it‚Äôs centered but as long as it is it does great.
5,Easy to use and fast charger! Only issue is it won‚Äôt charge with my cover on it.
1,My watch got hot when charging on it and the fan got loud right before it quit working. It would convenient if it worked right.
2,The latest compatibility on the instruction manual is up to iPhone 12SE. You can tell that this instruction manual was written by someone who doesn't understand English.  I specifically purchased this for a iPhone 13 Pro Max. Very disappointed in this product.
1,Watch charger stopped working all together after a couple months. Use Apple brand battery case on iPhone XR- neither charge to 100%. This product is unreliable.
5,My son loves it. It charges quickly and removes the need for several cables and outlets to charge his Iphone 12 Max and ipoda pro. Excellent product.
1,I am updating to one star.  Putting an iPhone XSMAX or a 13pro max on this at night while you sleep is like buying a scratch off ticket. Sometimes you get no charge other times a partial charge often it will not even connect. Forget about the watch charger; that takes about a full day to charge a watch. The concept and design are good but the product is worthless because it fails to connect and charge on a consistent and reliable basis
5,I bought one of these for my son and my husband. Very easy to use the charging power is fast!
5,Best 3 in 1 for convenience and organizing daily charging. Back charging area for air pods can also charge another phone. Also charges with thick case where similar brand would not. Love this design!
5,Absolutely love this charger! I did receive a defective one but the seller was super friendly and responsive. If I could give 6 starts for the customer service alone I would!
3,Sometimes I get 100% charge no problems. Other times as soon as I sit my phone (iPhone8) in the cradle a red light flashes and it doesn‚Äôt charge. I still have not determined exactly why it‚Äôs random.
2,I wanted to like this thing but every other morning I wake up to an almost dead phone and red flashing lights on the charger itself. The watch always charges but the phone position does not! Would not recommend if you rely on your phone as an alarm.
5,Excelente tener un cargador para el reloj y para el celular en uno solo
5,This charger is perfect for home and travel. It truly doesn‚Äôt require any more cables or cords and comes with the brick for the wall. Best all in one solution!
5,Super easy and convenient. Have it on my bedside table and it has definitely freed up some space. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd necessarily travel with it but I guess you could.
5,Works for my Iphone 11 pro apple watch and apple buds all three.  Has a warning light to tell you its not charging right.
5,Build and design works great for a stationary charger. I cannot comment on traveling with it. The 3 in 1 charger works great for small spaces in reducing the extra wires needed for multiple devices.
3,Won‚Äôt charge my Apple Watch 6. It will charge it to about 52% then won‚Äôt charge after that. Supper annoyed
2,For phone charging and AirPod Pros it charges okay as you are not concerned with speed as you usually charge these overnight and by morning they‚Äôre full.However for the Apple Watch the charging speed is not adequate. With the Apple included watch charger I usually charge my watch while in the shower and by the time I am ready for bed my watch is done charging. With this charger it is not like that. It charges much slower even when all you are charging is the watch so you have to leave it on longer than with the Apple charger. This makes the charger not worth it for me.
5,I really love that I can charge all of my Apple products in one place. It is easy to use and very convenient.  I highly recommend this product.
2,I purchased this charger because it had really great reviews. Well‚Ä¶ It charges my phone super slow and it doesn‚Äôt charge my AirPods at all. My iwatch was on the same percentage for over 30 minutes so I just took it off before it started to overheat. I made sure that when it was placed on the charger I placed it correctly in the center.I‚Äôm wondering if mine is defective‚Ä¶I‚Äôll give it another try but I think I may have received one that doesn‚Äôt live up to the reviews.
5,This product tidied up my charging area. I have had it for only one week and so far it works great.
1,Unfortunately after 4 months it no longer works.The most disappointing thing was customer service - reached out to kegaftersales@gmail.com - no response.I would not recommend this product.
5,Worth the money I use this product nightly. Only one issue twice I woke up with the phone‚Äù12promax‚Äù not charged. Could be my placement of the phone. But overall great product and would buy again
1,I bought this in August 2021 and it was super convenient when it worked.  Unfortunately it quit working in May 2022.  Just quit charging.  I thought perhaps the cable or the plug ceased working and tried different combinations but it was this unit that quit working.  I swear these manufacturers design these things to fail after 6 months or so.
2,This only works about 1/3 of the time and takes forever to charge the watch
1,I was so excited to get this three in one charger to keep my desk organized but the airpod and apple watch part didn‚Äôt work. Definitely don‚Äôt recommend!
2,I like to sleep with my phone on Airplane Mode. This charger will not charge my iPhone 12 Pro if it is on airplane mode. My other wireless charger did work on airplane mode. I have learned to switch my phone to do not disturb at night and it will still charge. Also sometimes I‚Äôll connect my Apple Watch SE and it says that it is charging but it doesn‚Äôt actually charge. I can make it work because I like the design and shape. It‚Äôs a perfect shape for what I need but just was disappointed with the nuances of charging capabilities.
5,I was tired of all the wires for all my Apple products on my dresser for charging  this works well is clean and keeps everything organized  great price and works well
5,I love this charger. Only negative is that I have a wallet case on my phone that it doesn‚Äôt charge through. So to use it at it best I can‚Äôt at the moment.
1,The watch portion of it stopped working after literally two weeks
1,It just didn‚Äôt work for my iPhone 13Pro maxCharges a few seconds then red light starts blinking and stops charging
5,Had problems with first one customer service slow but very helpful. They ended up replacing the charger. Second one works like a charm.
5,Very easy to use quick to set up and charges almost instantly. It‚Äôs not the fastest charger but I love it
5,Does exactly what I wanted. I really like the fact the the Apple Watch charger is built in whereas other charging stations you have to put in your own cable. Highly recommend.
3,The station looks. Ice and is easy to use. However it takes a long time to recharge either Apple phone or watch on station. Compared to original Apple chargers we‚Äôd estimate 3 to 4 times longer.
5,Very useful. Easy to set up and convenient to carry for travel. I used for my iPhones and my AirPods and it seems all working well.
5,Fast charging and you don‚Äôt have to remove your case(as long as it‚Äôs a flush back case)You‚Äôll be happy.I would like to see it in white for the kitchen!!!
3,Works great except the iPhone 12 mini doesn‚Äôt charge when placed Vertically on the cradle but will horizontally if placed in a specific way
5,So great to have one charger for all three devices with one plug! No more cords getting tangled! Quick easy charge for phone. The stand is great for watching movies too!
5,Great fast charger for my multiple devices.  I bought two for our two offices at home now.  we love them.
5,It looks really nice packaging and the charger as well. It has a velvety touch which also prevents the phone from sliding.
1,Within 1 week all of my devices stopped charging all the way. Not worth the purchase.
5,Been using this for about a week for my iPhone Apple Watch and AirPods and it‚Äôs honestly the most convenient thing I have ever bought. Quick charging and very sturdy well made product!
5,Very good product! Real fast charging. Comes with a plug-in block which apple doesn‚Äôt provide anymore. The phone charger work with silicone case on.
1,Does not charge Watch or Airpods.  It does charge my phone so i will not return.
5,Works great other than if you have a pop socket on your phone it won‚Äôt charge...kind of annoying because of that but the product works and overall I‚Äôm satisfied.
1,Worked good but it stopped charging my iPhone after 6 months. Was very spontaneous. I will try to reach out to the company and see if they will correct the issue and I will be happy to update my review because when the product does work it is nice but nice doesn‚Äôt matter if it doesn‚Äôt last
5,Space saving nice design does its job nicely easy to use will use for travel as well as home use.
5,I love my charger stand .. this was going to be my last wireless charger attempt lolBut I got it right finally .. works great
3,Ahhh got mine and it‚Äôs great! I love it. Only thing is the AirPod section doesn‚Äôt work on mine. It old charges my phone and Apple Watch.
5,I was a little leery since it wasn‚Äôt a brand name and it wasn‚Äôt too expensive‚Äî but this thing is great!  I‚Äôve ordered two more.  Charges my Apple Watch iPhone X and AirPods plus.  No issues fast charging.
5,This product was just as advertised! I keep it next to myBed and it takes up little space! I recommend!
5,Ha!I finally found a good and convenient way to charger with very little space the charging speed is fairly fast very practical and I like it!
5,Product works great and easy to use and helpful to have all in one. I bought as a gift for my Dad and he loves his new charger!!
5,This is perfect for the apple products. That all charge wirelessly simultaneously with no overheating. This created much needed space that was taken up with separate chargers. Great product.
3,Works ok. The watch charger is kind of slow but works and the phone charger works well for over night charging
5,Definitely not for traveling but adore this product for my bed stand. I‚Äôm able to charge all my apple products all at once
5,Works well with Apple devices for watch and phone.Not too good for Samsung.Wish could be more universal atleast for the phone partWorks so far as advertised
1,They don‚Äôt work 90 % the time and is unstable
2,Worked great for about a month. The apple watch charger no longer charges.
5,Perfect charger for all three items. Cleaned up my nightstand and made thing easy for me
1,I was really excited about this item but it isn‚Äôt fast charging. It was easy to set up . It had evehtning I need it for. I gave it about 3 weeks total before returning trying to give it a chance and just seeing the label that saids ‚Äúfast charging‚Äù pisses me off because it isn‚Äôt. And to top it off I have to take my case that isn‚Äôt thick but does have a ring loop attached. Can only charge it with a thin case that tuve he loop on the back. It was super cheap nor super expensive but based on reviews I was hoping I had found ‚Äúthe one‚Äù of fast chargers and I would have to be plugging my phone every night. Case my search continues. DO NOT BUY! Because within the first 20 mins you‚Äôll realize you wasted your money
5,Easy to use.  All in one.  One plug for all 3 devices.  Charges quickly.
5,Red led started flashing after a couple months but got a replacement mailed out to me after just 10 minutes chatting with customer service.
1,WARNING!!!  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!Only had this for 5 months and the iWatch charging part stopped working.  The Earbud and iPhone charge fine but not the iWatch part.  I have another unit that works fine.  I have reached out to Amazon and was re-directed to contact the Manufacture and I have contacted them several times for no response.  It says 1 year warranty and trying to contact the OEM clearly does not work.  I will never purchase a product from this company again as they don't stand behind their product.  You all have been warned.
5,Love that I can have one device for my Apple products. Charges everything great!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Love this three in one charger.  We have purchased this unit more than one time.  Would recommend this product.
5,Works perfect with my iPhone 12 Pro Max. Small and compatible with my AirPods Pro in their case. Overall recommend this as best bang for the 50 bucks.
5,I can charge my watch phone and AirPods at the same time. It is my work charge looking at getting on for at home. Well worth the money.
5,Such an awesome charger!
5,I like this all in one charger. It doesn‚Äôt take up much space and charges my phone and watch pretty quickly!  Super easy to use and is sturdy.
5,Perfect product for traveling or just everyday use! Fast charging and it eliminates having to run the second cord for my iwatch!
3,Great concept and would be perfect to charge my phone AirPods and watch but It takes a long time to charge my Apple Watch 6. The Apple Watch usb charger is 3x faster.
5,I like how easy it is to use. It charges everything I need in a short time frame
5,I loved how fast it actually charges. It surpassed my expectations really.
3,It works most of the time but sometimes my phone won‚Äôt charge and I‚Äôm not sure why. I wish I had spent more money for a better one from the beginning
1,Phone overheats when charging wireless airpod case does not charge at all and watch charger is very slow
5,Love love love this charging station!!! Perfect and sleek all in one design. I‚Äôm so happy I made this purchase.
5,It‚Äôs a cool charger. I love it! I put it on my bedside table. It saves a lot of space„ÄÇmy table now is neat and tidy no more messy charging cables„ÄÇ
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†This is a great product. After buying one I ended up buying them for the whole family. Compact easy to use and efficient
5,I like this charger it works great
3,Works fine with phones without cases or popsockets. I returned mine as I didn't want to take my case off every night.
1,This wireless charging station looks nice and the price was right but that‚Äôs where it ends. It lasted three weeks before it broke. I took my iPhone 12 ProMax off the charger or at least I tried to but the magnetic attraction was extremely strong and the plate pulled off and was attached to my phone. The glued seal wasn‚Äôt strong enough and the device was completely broken. Also I was unable to charge my Apple Watch or AirPods because I have protective cases on then and they couldn‚Äôt connect. I probably should have read the reviews to see if anyone else had that same problem with cases. I was given a refund with no issues but I can‚Äôt recommend this product. Spend a few bucks more and read all the reviews.
5,Amazing 3 in 1 charger! Very convenient to use with only having to have one cord. Very compact and will fold down flat for traveling.
2,My iphone 13pro max runs hot when charging with this device. Didn't risk using it for my Hermes watch.
1,Thought this would be the perfect charging station after looking at about 15 of them.I received it put it together and started charging my phone and watch. The phone charging lights started blinking red about 5 minutes and the watch stopped working too. I rebooted both the phone and the watch and tried again.Still did not work. So I emailed the contact on the insert...because they don't like bad reviews - who does!So it started with an email that needs a photo of the problems. Then comes another email that they want to see what model you have. Then another email wanting more information and when you have totally had it - the email comes to offer a replacement.Don't waste your time or your money. And I don't usually write reviews - but this "terrible" customer service is really really bad.
5,What I like about this product is it fits very conveniently on my nightstand and also it fits my three devices perfectly. I highly recommend this product.
5,I have the AirPods Pro the Apple Watch 6 and the new iPhone and this charger is excellent. Highly recommended
5,I had a problem charging my iphone 12 but customer service replace the item. It works well and it is a sturdy well made product.
5,This product does exactly what it says. My only complaint is that it doesn‚Äôt charge my iPhone with a pop socket on.
1,Stopped workin after 10 months
5,I love the way both my watch and phone charge at the same time. The stand for the phone allows me to see the screen at a glance when needed.
2,Purchased two of these charging stations. Despite that they are not Hatalkin products as promoted (there is absolutely no Hatalkin branding on the box whatsoever and it looks a little different from the Hatalkin pics included in marketing) it worked great with my iPhone air buds and iWatch. Until I bought a new iPhone 12 Max. Just won't charge the phone at all. Even without the other two items charging it won't work. I tried both charging stations and neither will charge my iPhone 12. Not sure why but it's very disappointing.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I like my charger because it holds all my apple products watch AirPods and iPhone XS. Remove AirPods cover to get charge completed.
5,Great quality design and easy to use. Only one plug one cable no more cable mess on the nightstand.
2,It‚Äôs annoying to have to take the case off (super thin case) to charge it every time. But more than that it does not charge a phone or AirPods fast. It‚Äôs actually very slow. The watch does charge at a decent speed.The convenience of the 3 in 1 is good.
5,After a long search i finally found this one. As soon as place my phone on the charger instantly charges. The watch on top fits perfect.
5,Superb charger. Comes apart easily for travel. I charge my phone on the front and my work phone on the AirPod space.  Great functionality
5,I really like this charger! Looks good fits in the small space I needed it to and charges all my devices perfectly!
5,Solid all-in-one charger that's quick to set up and helps with a decluttered lifestyle. Great gift too for your tech-loving friends!
2,Nice all in one charger but my iPhone 13 Pro Max iWatch and Air Pods pro all overheated in 15-20 minutes of being on the charger.  I opted to return the charger.  Will continue to look for something that doesn‚Äôt overheat my devices.
1,I dislike this product. It doesn‚Äôt charge my Apple Watch at all
2,I wanted to like this charger and it worked fine for my iPhone. However it would not turn off charging my Apple Watch even when fully charged. Consequently my watch became very hot unless I monitored it regularly. I contacted the company asking for information about this problem and they stone-walled me. I obviously returned it for credit and will look elsewhere for a suitable charger.
5,Works great other then when using with iPhone 12 mini.  Will carve the mini if laid on it side.Nice looking.
5,Easy to use for my daily work I can charge all 3 items in one location and one cable. I like this product
5,Great product works as describedGreat price too
5,Very good purchase well worth your money. I am about to order another one for my mother.
5,We bring this everywhere with us when we travel. It is so easy to use and charges quickly.
1,It‚Äôs disheartening to write that this charger works pretty much like every other 3 in 1 charger-as in it doesn‚Äôt! I can‚Äôt have all three products (phone watch or EarPods) without the charger flashing a red light saying it can‚Äôt charge. An now it won‚Äôt even charge my phone by itself. I can have it on the charger for 30 minutes and it starts flashing red and quits charging. Really crappy product can‚Äôt even do what‚Äôs advertised.
5,Such a great item . Charges all of my devices at one time . I will recommended this product. It‚Äôs easier to use.
2,I liked the size and design; however the charging base is way to sensitive. I bought two one for my mom and one for me. Both have difficulty charging consistently. You have to move the phone around several times to make sure it‚Äôs just right. We both have the iPhone 12. Could be the 12? The case? Or poor design? But what was meant to be easy for an older person turned out to be too complicated. I‚Äôve purchased others less expensive that work better.
3,This charger isn‚Äôt suitable for traveling however it‚Äôs super easy to use. The phone charger doesn‚Äôt charge as fast as I would like but still very convenient
5,Simplistic design that has good charging power & easy to travel with. Keeps away the clutter from multiple cords.
5,This charger is extremely easy to use feels durable and saves space .  I like that it can charge three things at once.
5,Seems to do what it‚Äôs intended clear up all the clutter from the other charging things! Big space saver and charges everything very well!
2,Had this product for a little over a week. I use it as an overnight charger next to my bed. Out of 9 nights it stopped charging my phone (8 plus) 6 of those nights. It charges the watch (series 3 just fine). The only indication of it is a very small light in the front of the charger that starts blinking red. When I put the phone on the charger it is green and charging not sure when it shuts off but it leaves my phone close to where it started charging.Disappointed...
5,Gray charger for traveling and charging little slow on the watch charger
2,The charging stand emits a constant electrical buzzing noise that is so irritating I can no longer use.It does charge and such though.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†easy to use. Compact and charges everything at once! great to have it all in one place.
5,Love this charger! It charges all my apple tech in one place and takes up so little space! And it‚Äôs so fast! Highly recommend!
5,This charger works really well for charging all three of my devices.  They also charge pretty quickly.
5,Works great love that it charges all three at one time
5,Gets the job done. Fun and lightweight. Sleek look also !
1,Charger worked fine for my Apple Watch would show working for the phone but wouldn‚Äôt charge. Very disappointing.
3,But I like the design
2,The charging power for the phone is inconsistent no matter how often I follow the directions for troubleshooting. It charges the watch and the headphones without any issue but it is a hit or miss on the phone. Many times it will start charging at night but during the night stop charging and I wake up with half of the battery being charged
2,Slow to charge watch. Apple charger charges in 1hr.  This would take double or more. Not sure it works great with AirPods. It works fine if you charge overnight
3,Looks great but my devices get a little to warm for my comfort.
2,It‚Äôs great in theory but seems to be a cheap product. Everything works when it works but sometimes it doesn‚Äôt work which is obviously an issue. Something is off in the wiring of this product I think. One bump and it stops charging. Until I play with the cord and make it reconnect. Not worth the hassle of returning though. I‚Äôd recommend a higher quality charger and NOT this one. It‚Äôs just not dependable.
5,Product works awesome! I have had it for a couple months now and charges my phone watch and AirPods great!
5,Easy to set up and has a strong magnet to charge watch. Watch will not easily fall off and charge is instant.
5,Works as expected can charge my iPhone 12 Apple Watch and AirPod pro at same time. Save cord space!
3,Charges Apple Watch great. iPhone 11promax won‚Äôt charge
5,This product works very well as long as you don‚Äôt have a bulky case. I love it!
5,Great product. Charges phone and watch easily without having to plug it in. Going to get another one for my spouse.
1,This is a product with known issues. Many many people have bought this and complained that it does not charge their phones. Mine does not charge my phone either. And on top of it it constantly flashes red. Go read the rest of the reviews. Everyone is complaining about the same thing. This is junk.
5,Works as described. Charges phone and watch easily every time.I don‚Äôt have AirPods so can‚Äôt comment.I‚Äôd definitely buy again
1,Phone charger is not working after a short time period...
5,I love that I can have one device that charges all of my products. It is durable sturdy and looks great!
5,I love this nothing to plug in and charges very quickly
1,A charger should be 100% reliable and this is not. At first it seemed like the best product ever then we noticed on both units that it failed to charge the phone over night. We had cases on the phone and also removed them same red light flashing issue.  Basically you never know if you‚Äôre going to wake up with a charged phone.  Phone is updated per other reviews same issue. Rather disappointing to wake up and still have a phone that‚Äôs almost dead. Like I said 2 different chargers same issue with 2 different iPhone 12 Pro and pro max. Returning both and will continue to look for something that is more reliable. BTW one was already returned and replaced as it made a high pitched sound and failed to charge.
1,Could not get this to charge my Apple Watch Series 5. The dock came with very poorly written instructions that indicated that might happen. It said something about if the watch doesn‚Äôt charge a software update is needed. My watch auto updates so it clearly had nothing to do with that.
1,Quit working after 9 months
2,Does not charge air pods
5,This is awesome! I‚Äôm very happy to have this multi-charging device so handy on my nightstand.
1,Worked for about a month.
3,It‚Äôs hard to get the phone just right to charge and it‚Äôs underpowered.
5,Love being able to charge all my devices from one gadget
5,Charges watch and phone fast.
2,We went to plug it up and when we put the apple watch on the designated spot we got no charge on it. the watch would just get warm. We also tried another watch same issue. Contact support we just took the discount we didnt want to deal with the hassle with drop offs for a watch charger. Everything else works great
5,Love it easy to travel with and compact!
5,Awesome
5,Gave as a gift to my daughters and they said it works great and takes up a small space.
5,This is awesome space saving and only takes up one outlet plug!
5,Absolutely love my station so convenient
5,Love this charger!!!  I can finally charge all my devices at once!  My iPhone air pods and Apple Watch.
5,Like that it charges fast and easy to ise
5,Very easy to set up and use! Minimizes wires on my night table very nicely.
1,This item had a list of warning on it!  Overheating battery life may be shortened and another warning about Iwatch charging. Sent it right back!  Who wants to worry about all these probable issues. Not worth it!
1,Started out great but it didn‚Äôt last long. The phone part still works but the charger for the Apple watch does not. I used it only a few times and it no longer works. The earbud charger is intermittent. It works for a while and then stops before they are fully charged. If I could give it zero stars I would. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT  It is a waste of money and too late to return.
5,Best multi use charger out there definitely worth the money
5,I bought this for a bedside table and it successfully replaced three different charger cords.  Works as advertised it's sturdy and looks great.
5,It works great and is so compact Love it
5,Compact design everything included easy to use and works great.
5,Very compact and convenient. Charges all devices well. Plan to order another for my home.
5,Only my watch will charge the phone part doesn‚Äôt work
5,I love how fast it charges my phone and it was easy to put together.
5,Great quality.  Everyone fights over it. Need to order a couple more for the house.
5,Make my bed stand so tidy love it üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª
5,Love it!  Compact and charges my apple watch Airpod and apple phone well.
1,We bought this in April and already it doesn‚Äôt charge. Just sits there flashing at us DIDAPPOINTING
5,I like the slim design so it doesn‚Äôt take up space on my bedside table
1,I read the reviews before buying and they all seem good. After getting my station I found that at different unexplained times it would stop charging- the green lights would change to red and all charging stopped. This would happen when I was unaware and my Phone specifically would not be ready when I needed it.  I thought it might be the charger so I returned it and got a new one and right away this was an issue. I can only assume now that the reviews that say this product is wonderful are made by people interested in the $20 gift card you can get if you leave a positive review. I will be retuning this product.
5,I actually purchased this for my son in college and It worked great!
5,Super convenient and easy to assemble. Worth it for the money. Read instructions for proper charging.
5,Love this 3 in 1 charger! Holds all my accessories in place and eliminates having multiple cords.
5,Sleek and functional and it works
1,I thought the 1st time I had to replace the charger because it stopped charging was a fluke. I was wrong. One month later it stopped charging my watch. I have contacted the seller and they haven‚Äôt responded. Don‚Äôt waste your money!!!!
5,Hubby needed a new charging station and this covers all his electronic needs.
1,Doesn‚Äôt work without fidgeting with the cord at the socket point .  It‚Äôs like components in the unit have been loose from the moment I got it.  Decided to give up on it today.
2,I works with iPhone 12 minibut without it's original charger I have to connect to Mac Mini and then it has power to charge an iPhone 12 mini but a iPhone 12 Pro not.I am going to keep it because it has a watch chargerbut it is not I was especting.I don't recomend it.
5,It works perfectly. It charges both my Apple Watch and my I phone perfectly!
5,Works like described. I don‚Äôt have AirPods but the phone and watch charger work great
5,Easy set-up works well ... consolidated charging needs into a compact space
1,Because I loved the compact design of this wireless charging station I bought a second one just to see if the first one was faulty.  Nope - neither of them was able to charge 2nd-generation airpods even with the protective case removed.  It did charge the iPhone and Apple watch perfectly though.  I hope that they will fix this issue soon - it really was a nice compact design for charging 3 Apple products.
5,Easy to use. Doesn‚Äôt take up much space.
5,Great purchase easy to use and very convenient! I would recommend this product.
5,Had issue with original unit and seller remedied issue.  Unit works great!
2,Looks great n should work but looses connection some how while ‚Äúcharging‚Äù cause I have to position it right to get a response only to wake up or come back and it‚Äôs either not charged at 60/70%  or maybe I get lucky and it‚Äôs fully charged.
5,Charging all three of my apple porducts is now simple
5,Works well good design. Overall I like it.
5,Charges with no problems! Love not having all the charging wires everywhere!
5,Facil de usar y carga muy rapido
5,So happy with this. Charges all of my devices at once.
5,This charger works with my apple devices great!
5,This product works with iPhone 12 Pro Max AirPods Pro and Apple Watch 6.
5,Really like the design . Look professional
2,The idea is great but the execution was... The main reason for the purchase was to charge my phone and watch while eliminating clutter on my desk. The wireless charger for the phone will not charge with a case on. Also the watch portion of the charger is always hot even when my watch is fully charged.
5,Muy sencillo de utilizar cumpli√≥ con todas mis expectativas
1,I have an iPhone 12 and and Apple Watch. I was excited to get this item to be able to charge all of my Apple devices and save some space. I have no issues with the watch charger but when I try to charge my phone it starts out fine but after 10 minutes the light turns red and it stops charging. After hearing that it probably is my otter box case I tried my wife‚Äôs iPhone and it did the same thing. I have a Belkin wireless charger and have no issues with charging either phone with or without cases. If this is an individual charger issue then please replace it. If this is a persistent issue with the brand of charger then I highly recommend not getting this device.
5,Loved that it‚Äôs 3in1 and super easy to charge all my devices!
1,The charger is bad really bad make the iPhone I watch get really hot extremely hot. Don‚Äôt buy this !! I wrote to them and never respond to Me. DONT BUY DONT BUY
5,Aesthetically pleasing and easy to set up in 1-3 minutes
5,Love it
1,Charger WAS great at first‚Ä¶ Then it started ‚Ä¶.NOT charging my phone. At first I thought I had not placed my phone on it correctly. NO not user error. It will just quit charging arbitrarily. I charged my watch and phone at night but the phone just stops charging in the middle of the night. (It makes a noise when it stops) Found out it was doing this while staying at  my daughters home on the bedside table. DO NOT BUY! Spend $50 on something else that will last longer than 6 months! I would give this ZERO stars if I could!
5,Love it
1,Charging brick not working
5,Sad it can‚Äôt charge a phone unless the case is off
5,Great for a nightstand. Compact convenient style. Easy to use and quick charging.
1,The section that charges the phone quit working after 3weeks. Then the section used to charge Apple Watch did not shut off properly and caused the internal components of the watch to fail. Cost over $700 to replace watch.
2,Looks great to bad it charges watch at a ridiculously slow rate. I have Apple Watch series 6 and this charge takes over an hour just to charge 30% sometimes slower than that while the original charge can do double that. Also the phone charging part randomly stops working and flashes red leaving you to wake up to a half charged phone. Not worth the hassle
5,Love it works great !
5,I love how it‚Äôs compact. Works great!
5,Love it
5,Like how easy it is to use
5,This is compact and works great to charge all my Apple products!
5,Para viaje
2,It never liked my Series 3. Charging often caused it to overheat and cycle on & off. That caused phone charging interruptions. Loved the configuration. Sad they didn‚Äôt play well together.
5,So easy to use. Love not having the clutter of several cords.
5,We love it. Nice compact unit works great
5,This works without hard resets. Love it!!!
5,Finally a charging device that does it all. So convenient!
5,It works as it was advertised to.
1,Had high hopes for this.  But it broke after 3 months.  Tried to get support but it is the digital version of endless futile questions with trial and error.  Highly recommend not purchasing this.
5,Works well as long as everything is aligned just right.
5,Perfect.  Charges all 3 items fast and neatly.
1,I couldn‚Äôt charge my Apple Watch with this Charger. (I checked The problem isn‚Äôt in my Apple Watch)
1,Less than two months before it ceased to charge. I followed all the manufacture‚Äôs instructions to update etc. but nothing worked. A very promising yet very disappointing product.
5,Will be playing 2 more for family members.
5,It is the perfect compact charging station for everything!
1,The description states 1 year warranty but when you go to the details it states 6 months! Very disappointed because this charger wasn't cheap! Lasted 7 months. Would not buy this brand again or recommend.
5,Fantastic compact and efficient design!
3,It takes a long time to load
5,Works great on iPhone 12 max
5,Nice product.
5,Worked on iPhone 12 Samsung S7 airpods and Apple Watch.
3,found a better deal
5,works like a dream - fast and efficient
1,Nice looking product but didn‚Äôt work for my iPhone 12. There is a warning label on the front of the unit that literally refers to an iPhone 12 bug - explains that you need to reboot for it to work. That didn‚Äôt help me. I place the phone on the charger it turns green and after a while it‚Äôs flashing red. Woke up to a phone that was not charged. I have a thin MagSafe Apple branded silicone case that works with every other Qi charger so I‚Äôve sent this back. I need something I can rely on. Too bad though. I was looking forward to having something that charged all 3 of my devices at a reasonable price.
5,Wonderful product that works for multiple pieces of technology.
5,Works great
5,The bulky ness for traveling
5,Great phone charger
1,I loved this when I 1st got it.  Such a great bedside charger.  Convenient & not terrible looking.  The watch charging section seems to work better than the phone.  Unfortunately sometimes it would work sometimes you have to play around with it.  And now it seems to have stopped working all together.  It has been 2 months.  So I am very disappointed.
5,All in one! Love it.
5,I‚Äôm really like this charger.
5,Great way to charge all my devices
5,Very easy to use. Charging is quick
1,I loved the design but after a few weeks the phone charger stopped working. Then shortly after that the watch charger doesn't work. I am very disappointed. DO NOT BUY..... It was a waste of money!!!
5,I use this for work travel and it functions nicely. Its nice to be able to charge my watch and my phone at the same time with only one outlet at airports and hotels. I recommend it.
5,Very nice and compact. Easy to install.
1,Charging station was good until it just stopped working. Do not waste your money on this garbage.
5,Exactly what I expected
2,Great idea but the watch charging power is abysmal. It would take all evening night and then some to charge a watch to full. The regular Apple charger is probably 4 times faster. Will probably return this because I‚Äôd like to wear my watch more than it‚Äôs on the charger each day.
5,Compact
5,Space saving device. Great for travel.
1,I was so satisfied with this product for the first few weeks I had it. Unfortunately It stopped working since June 2021 I have reached out to Amazon and this company several times and we are in September 2021 and I have not heard back no response even with several attempts to communicate. This item is supposed to have a one year warranty but clearly the customer service is lacking and they do not help their customers with their concerns. DO NOT PURCHASE! It will not last you more than a few weeks before it dies and stops charging
5,All in one charging
5,Wounderful product in office and home use
5,Great product! Works very well! No issues
5,Very sleek and easy to use!
5,Best 3 in 1 charger hands down.
5,Works well with my new IPhone and watch
2,This charger gets low scores for not charging 1/2 the time.Pros:- Design is nice and efficientCons:- 1/2 the time the charge ends up flashing red in the middle of night- You wake up with devices not charged. This can be dangerous if you need device charged
5,Works as well as it says
3,Easy to use
5,Works well and charges fast
5,Small footprint and easy to use.
5,Great space saver
5,Charging my iphone
5,Great charger
1,This was great until it wasn‚Äôt. The watch charger stopped working completely and the cord was cheap- bent and needed to be replaced. Not a good buy
5,easy to use charges fast
5,Great product!!!
1,I was excited at 1st despite the fact that the AirPod charger didn‚Äôt work. It charged my phone & watch fine for a couple weeks. Then the phone charging got spotty & now the whole thing is shot. I reached out to customer service & they responded but nothing was done‚Ä¶very disappointed! I was hoping I maybe just got a bad one but given the fact they haven‚Äôt done anything to fix the problem I‚Äôm guessing the product is just shoddy. Don‚Äôt waste your money
5,Truly fantastic. Easy compact charging.
5,Is very good and confortable all in one!!!
2,Nice sleek design but not very fast in charging.  This is OK with the phone since I can use it while charging.  But it's unacceptable when it takes almost 3 hours to charge my watch during which I can not use it.
5,Excellent product no complaints.
5,Great charger.
5,It‚Äôs a great and easy to use.
5,Charges fast
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Has not fully charged my phone one time.  It seems to work for a while and then starts flashing red.  I contacted the email on the packaging and they asked for a video (which I couldn‚Äôt shoot because I couldn‚Äôt use my phone while it was demonstrating the problem).  After i was able to send the video they now claim that this is not their product.  STAY AWAY!!!!
2,I bought this for my husband to charge his watch and iPhone 12 Pro Max. It does not charge the phone at all except for 30 seconds after unplugging and replugging the charger from a power source. It's now basically an expensive watch charger. Not happy at all.
5,Works well!
2,Does not hold a charge as well.
5,Compact and easy to use.
5,Great product
5,Love this product!
5,It‚Äôs great!
5,It works pretty good
5,Everything or perfect
1,Iphone 11Airpod ProApple watch 41) Charging cable too short2) Cannot handle charging all three items at a time Though I restarted my Iphone twice with cover and without.3) Actually depletes percent of existing charge:  Iphone was at 60% when I put it on the charging stand an hour later it was drained to 30%!  I experienced the same with  my Airpods. *** This is my second charge station that I 've tested. Same issues and I don't recommend this product.
2,I did not find the charger to charge fast at all. Went back to using my original chargers.
1,This charger worked great... for the first few charges of my iPhone 12 ProMax. Then... nothing but red lights flashing meaning it didn‚Äôt recognize the device trying to be charged (same iPhone). The Apple Watch charger continued working. Never tried the AirPod charger because I don‚Äôt have any yet. Regardless... don‚Äôt waste your time and money (in this case the time it took to go to a UPS store to return the item cost me over $200 in potential client appointments... it‚Äôs the principle though... quit making bad products!!!)
2,There is a ticking noise like when I Tesla coil is running but the ticking noise is a low sound. Still annoying when you are trying to sleep so I moved it away from my bed like two feet and that fixed the problem.
1,Stopped working less than 6 months off using it.  Passed the return window.
1,No me agrado para nada no carga.
5,Easy to use
1,I am disappointed with the charging for the Apple watch.  It only is charging for the iPhone.  I am not sure if I should return the product.  Please advise.
1,I bought this for my husband for Christmas. It was plugged into the wall and charging when we woke up to a weird electrical smell. It began to spark then caught on fire. Everything happens fast in the middle of the night.This item is dangerous.Thankfully we woke up.
5,Perfect
5,Works flawlessly.
5,Stylish and works great
1,Watch part works. Phone part doesn‚Äôt. Just a blinking red light. Don‚Äôt buy it.
2,This thing sucks just chooses to charge or not charge at various times. Don‚Äôt waste your money going cheap only costs you more money in the long run.
2,Worked well for like a couple of months. Then it started to turn blinking red every time I put the phone on the charger. A waste of money.
5,Chargers for IPhone 12
1,You have to very specific where you place your phone. If not it will of work. After a small drop the Apple Watch charger stop working.
1,The watch charger stopped charging after a few months.  Very disappointed.
5,Works great
1,I loved the look and idea of this charger.  I've had others that have worked well but the phone charging area stops charging before a full charge is achieved.  The result is waking up to a phone at <50% meaning that I have to find a cord during the day and it's just a pain.  Sorry- but this is going back.
1,This is sleek looking and would be awesome but it does not charge the phone fast at all. I was disappointed.
1,Unit was easy to put together and use.  Immediately found two problems:  First my Apple watch 6 was charging so fast it got VERY hot and had to remove it from charger fearing it would be damaged.  Secondly though description stated "Receiving Distance: less than 4mm" would not charge my iPhone 12 Pro Max in it's case which measures 2.7mm.  When trying to charge iPhone while horizontal the area for the lower coil was too low.  If I slid it up the mount it did engage the upper coil through the case.  Product returned.
5,Works as advertised‚Äîgreat.
5,Great
1,I‚Äôve had this for about 6 months now. Everything was going well and all of a sudden my watch wouldn‚Äôt charge anymore. It still charges the phone perfectly fine but it defeats the purpose of the multi charge .
5,Muy bueno
1,In charge mode it continues to turn my phone screen on and off vs charge it. It also has to be unplugged as if it needs to be reset. I‚Äôve had this for just a few weeks and it already doesn‚Äôt work well and is malfunctioning. Do not buy. Save your money.
1,Product can NOT be used with a case on. Have tried 3 different phones with different cases and the charger started flashing red within 10 minutes on all 3 phones. Switched to a different charger that I had purchased for my son (doesn't do wireless charging for Air Pods) and all the phones charged fine with each of their cases on and quicker. I loved the smaller footprint to charge all 3 devices at once but I guess smaller isn't always better.
5,Loved
1,It doesn't charge well with a phone case
2,You see several similar units like this.This one doesn't charge my iPhone.There is no support.I emailed yet no return.Manual + instructions are poor mispellings choppy foreign language...Do Not buy.
1,This one did not work well with the iPhone 13 mini
1,I bought this so I wouldn‚Äôt have to use three separate charging cords in three different outlets.  It takes forever to charge anything.  What a waste of money.  I‚Äôm still using the charger that came with my Apple Watch. I toggle between my phone and iPods for this product. I‚Äôm not sure if charging one item at a time helps as I usually let it charge overnight.
1,It worked well for one day.  Now it flashes two red lights as soon as it's plugged in and won't charge my iPhone 13 pro max anymore.I can leave it unplugged and it won't work when plugged back in.  It just quit.  I'm going to find another brand I guess.
1,I‚Äôve had this less than a year and it won‚Äôt charge my phone anything but it will charge everything else. Best I can figure out is that taking it apart and putting it back together has ruined the connections. It will sometimes barely charge my phone if I put it on there sideways and not right side up. Explain that.
5,Works well.
2,Works fine for charging iphone 11 pro; however it doesn't work with apple watch series 3.  The intended purpose was the be able to charge both devices together so it's disappointing.
1,This product worked fine for a couple of months (6) then all of a sudden it stopped working to charge my Apple Watch it charges my phone though. Now this device is useless for the original purpose I bought it for
1,Does not work as intended. Over heats watch and phone.  The watch component no longer works and Over heats watch every time and became a slow charge.  Phone is also getting hot.  Not a good use of money.  Don‚Äôt buy.
1,If this charger was $20 I wouldn't have minded but the watch charging is way to slow. Like trickle charge compared to the cable the watch comes with.On a side note 1 LED blinks red when nothing is on it it goes solid green when charging me phone but when I take it off it blinks red it has an error. If this was $20 bucks I wouldn't care but I spent more for this charger and it doesn't feel like I got what I paid for.
2,This is really slow in charging the Apple Watch - the iPhone part seems fine but the watch part is not.
2,Great when worked stoped working after 3 days now every time I put phone one it will start charging then within second will stop charging  and the led lights turned red.
2,Have an Apple 12 pro max. This charger will not charge phone  with case on. So this will never be used.
1,This product was great‚Ä¶for the first 3 weeks. Then I would wake up and it would have stopped charging and I‚Äôd start my day with 5% battery. I‚Äôve tried different outlets tried with and without my phone case and tried different phone orientations and nothing seems to help. It‚Äôs sporadic and unreliable. I wish I never bought this in the first place.
1,We really wanted these to work.  Great design and very compact but neither of the 2 units we bought charged our AirPods at all.  Then one stopped charging my iPhone and only works for my watch.  Not worth keeping if the functionality isn‚Äôt there.  Also no support available or useful help.
1,I used this to recharge my iPhone and my Apple Watch. Less than 9 week later it would no longer charge my watch. Nine weeks and one day later it quit charging my phone. That was a hella bunch of mo ey I just wasted!!!  ü§¨üò°
2,Not a huge fan as it doesn‚Äôt charge the iPhone 12 (some sort of bug) and I have to take my phone out of the case to charge it.
1,The iPod section doesn‚Äôt WORK! It never has I found out too late to send it back for another one. The watch and phone sections work fine. I‚Äôm very disappointed that ALL 3 sections aren‚Äôt working appropriately. Will not recommend due to this issue with the iPod section not working.
1,Received this product today 10/16/21. Tho the watch got really hot it did charge it. Yes It was placed correctly on the charging station. Iphone jus never charged. I worked with it for an hour to try to get it to charge but with no success. Will be returning.
2,It works great for my AirPods and my Apple Watch but it won‚Äôt charge my iPhone 12 Pro Max with my otterbox defender case on it.
1,Purchased this product and it worked fine for a few months then the product stopped charging my phone.I contacted the company and after they asked me to do some brief trouble shooting of the product they sent me a replacement. Unfortunately this charger only lasted a month before it stopped working.
1,I purchased this product as a simple way to charge all 3 of my Apple products at once and have more issues than it‚Äôs worth. I leave my phone charging on it fir 6 hours and barely get to 40%. By far one of the worth chargers I‚Äôve ever purchased. Don‚Äôt waste your money.
2,Great concept... however the watch charger never fully charges the watch and the phone charger part stopped working after a month
1,Purchased this item and it did NOT come with the adaptor even though the description specifically claims that it does. "(QC3.0 Adapter is included)" NO it isn't. I purchased an adaptor for it and now I intermittently get the over-volt over-heat over-charge warning. I no longer have the packaging so I can't even return it. GARBAGE.
1,It‚Äôs not a fast charger. I put my phone on and it charged for about 5 minutes and when I checked the battery percent it was exactly the same as when I put it on the charger.I then plugged my phone in with my charger and in 5 minutes it had gone up 15%
1,This worked great for about six months of regular use and then it just stopped working.  No reason at all but it won‚Äôt charge the phone anymore but it will charge the other devices it can charge. Now I have to buy another charger because this is useless.
1,This will charge the watch and air pods but if the phone is less than 99% charged when it is docked  it will actually drain the battery.
2,Not great for the iPhone 12mini with a thin case. You must rig it so it sits higher on the charger for it to work 100% of the time.
2,Not great. Switched back to my old chargers. Woke up two days in a row to a dead phone.
1,Charging is erratic. Surely not fast
1,I bought this to be able to charge my watch and phone together.  From the start I had trouble getting the phone to charge.  If I messed with it taking it on and off the charger it would usually start.  It gradually got worse and worse stopping charging before the phone was fully charged.  A week ago it quit completely.  It is now worthless and it's too late to return it.
1,Updated review: stopped working completely can't charger my phone or my watch. I tried new cable and new power block but no juice!This thing charges the iPhone 12 Pro Max and the Apple watch very rapidly and it looks good while doing it! I have a very slim case on the phone and it does not impair the charging at all. I couldn't be happier with this product! It looks gorgeous in my office and is super convenient.
1,The description stated it would work for the apple watch 7The box did not say it would work with it did not want to take a chance
1,The wireless charger seems very nice but after IPhone 12 Pro sat on the charger and began charging. The iPhone never fully charged and a red light started blinking. I would have to remove the phone for a few seconds and wait for the red light to turn off to then resume charging. The Apple Watch charged fine
1,At first I really liked it. Easy to use and attractive. However it stopped working after only 2 days. I tried everything and my phone would not charge. My Apple watch would but not my phone. I did all of the things they recommend to fix and nothing worked. I sent it back.
2,Only works sometimes with the iPhone 12Pro. I have to power off my iPhone and then power back on and then it will start charging it.
2,El producto me llego bn pero el cargador no funciono
1,This charger did not work with my iPhone 12 Apple Watch or ear buds. I actually returned it the first time and ordered again after I read you need to turn off and on you me iPhone 12 to get to work but the second one didn‚Äôt charge either! I found another one that I love and charges with my phone case on too!
1,If you look at the bottom  this item seems to have been already used . I called Amazon and they are giving me a refund . Thank you Amazon. Not sure if I should but a new one
2,Worked for about 6 months then it stopped charging the watch.
1,I originally chose this because of the smaller design and it does charge my iPod pros and my Apple Watch. I am very disappointed that it will not charge my iPhone 12. The light does turn green when I first place it on to charge but will then turn red and stop charging.  I have tried turning my phone off and restarting and still will not charge.  I am returning this product.
2,I the size etc was perfect but it does not charge an iPhone 12  Maybe great for others. I don‚Äôt know
1,Was ready to buy another as it charges so many items at once but after one month it stopped working properly. For the past month it after about 20 minutes of charging it will randomly switch off and won‚Äôt charge your phone all night. Very sad to have paid this price for this product and it only worked for 1 month.
1,Does not work at all with iPhone 12.  Watch and AirPods work for only two months then went kaput. Save your money and do not buy this.
1,No matter what I do the product won‚Äôt work. All I get is blinking red lights when I place the phone of the charging station.Plugged the device and plugged it back again. No useRestarted my iPhone. No use.
1,If you have the latest iPhone do not get this as you will have to reset your phone multiple times to get a full charge. Returned product and still waiting on a refund after almost 2 months. Would give 0 stars if it was possible.
1,Broke after three months
1,This charger works if you only want to use the Apple Watch charging feature. It won‚Äôt charge my iPhone 12 Pro Max unless it is at some weird angle. My phone falls off because of the weird angle and won‚Äôt stay on. I bought two of them one for myself and one as gift and I have highly disappointed. I am ashamed that I gave the other one away as a gift. I don‚Äôt recommend.
1,Good design. Charger is included. Unfortunately iPhone 12 Pro Max would not charge completely. It would reach 35% to 75% before the red error lights started to flash shutting down the charger. Returned for refund.
1,The device charged the phone for about 3 minutes and then flashed red lights and shut off. The USB cable did not connect firmly to the device.  I had to modify the base to allow the USB cable to fully seat in the socket and that solved one problem but the device still stopped charging after 3 minutes. Overall a total waste of money.
1,This product worked for me for the first couple weeks I had it. After that it wouldn't  charge my phone or my watch at all. If it graciously allowed me to charge something that day it could only be one item at a time.
1,This is the second one I received and it also quit working after 2 months and now it‚Äôs past it return time
1,1 star across the board. Does NOT charge my AirPod Pros. Does NOT charge my Apple Watch. Does NOT charge my iPhone 12 (even after restarting/updating I can read).  The LEDs on the front don‚Äôt even light up. Biggest waist of time money and effort. DO NOT BUY!
1,the first time I put my apple watch on the charger it would not sit evenly.  I have played with it since the purchase and can not get it in the right position for a solid night of charging.  i even tried strapping it onto the charger and it just does not sit in a good position so that it can charge.  I am returning this charger.
1,Initially I was really happy with it! A month later I‚Äôm not. The watch portion no longer works. I have not had time to reach out to customer support. Hoping they will replace it. I went to work today and my watch died within minutes of getting to work  and I depend on my watch.
1,Since purchase I have noticed a SIGNIFICANT decline in the battery life of my devices. I waited too long to return them otherwise I would have. Now I‚Äôm stuck with 2 $30+ pieces of trash. Complete waste of my hard earned money.
2,If you have a case it doesn‚Äôt charge through it. Otherwise I like it.
1,Doesn‚Äôt work with the Otterbox Defender case. It does charge without the case but it randomly stops. Also product is advertised for ‚Äúfast charging‚Äù after leaving phone all night the charge was still at 80%.
1,I hate to give bad reviews BUT‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. This charger is cheap for a reason. This device does not maintain a. Solid charge . It charges for about 2 minutes then goes into some sort of malfunction leaving items uncharged.Can‚Äôt recommend this !
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Bought 2 of these and returned both because they didn‚Äôt work properly and then after returning was sent a message that they didn‚Äôt receive one of the chargers back and charged my card again for $39.27!!! I‚Äôm extremely upset and then there‚Äôs no way to contact them!
1,Wish I would have never bought this. Works great for watch and AirPods but phone doesn‚Äôt charge half the time. What‚Äôs worse is you put it on there turns green says it‚Äôs charging then 30 min turns red. Now phones not charged!!
1,I hit an IPhone 12 and got this charger.  It NEVER charged my phone without me having to restart the charging process several times.  I do nit recommend that anyone buy this charger.
1,Being using dock with no issue and now it‚Äôs flashing red lights. It‚Äôs been 3 months and Amazon won‚Äôt let me return item.
1,After using the product for a few weeks it stopped charging my phone. I would put it on the charger at night and make sure it was charging. I would wake in the morning and the phone had only been charged about 5% and the red lights were flashing. I've ordered a different solution and will be returning this soon... Return started.
1,I have an IPhone 12 Pro. This device is listed as being able to fast charge the 12 pro. It doesn't. I wanted to make sure so questioned the vendor. They said it would take 3 hrs to charge my device. Heck my 6s plus charged faster than that and it didn't have fast charging. Look I like the device itself. But the advertising is bogus.
1,The watch charger worked one time then stopped! Not worth the money very disappointed!
1,Product was good for the first couple of months. Then it stop charging the phone and AirPods. Woke up to my phone on 5% and my AirPods 10%. Had to go back to my apple chargers.
1,Yay for Amazon. More Chinese junk. Stick with brand names for stuff like this. The watch charger stopped working within 1 week. Phone charger hardly works. Sent the recycler and they don‚Äôt even want the POS.
1,Product quality is poor and it did not charge either my phone or my watch overnight. If the watched charged up then the phone did not. If the phone charged up then the watch part would not.
1,Having issues with charging iPhone 12 Pro. Tried restarting phone as instructed by included sticker but only charges for 30 seconds before stoping. Watch and AirPods have no issues charging. Great looking station and build quality is great and compact but no point of it doesn‚Äôt charge my iPhone 12 as well.
1,Such a disappointment. Worked only for a few weeks before I got the red light. Seller if you read this please get to me with a replacement.
1,This charger drained the battery on my Apple watch and now it won‚Äôt take a charge. It is places properly on the surface and after 5 hours it‚Äôs 0% charged.
2,It will not charge through a phone case
1,Very poor power charge for the phone. The power charge fir the iPhone is reasonable however . If you are looking for multi purpose set to charge both your iPhone and Apple Watch then this product is not meant to be for them !
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†I received it and it only charges a iphone 12 pro max and iphone watch and air pods 2 i ordered it for it to charge my iphone 11 pro and it does not work at all i even tried my iphone 12 pro it does not work for it. This was a waste of my money
1,Literally does not charge my phone at night phone becomes dead from using this. Red lights flash and blink to indicate something isn‚Äôt working but only after hours of it sucking the battery from your phone
1,This worked for one night then the phone charger made a funny humming noise and stopped working. The other parts are still working and I made sure it wasn‚Äôt my case and test without and still nothing. This is going back and on the hunt for another one.
2,Only charges my phone. The apple watch and earpod stations only charge to 30%. Do not buy!!
1,charged my watch and  air pods just fine but will only start to charge my 12 pro if nothing else is on it.  Then it stops after a few seconds.  I will see if it works with my wife's 12 tonight but very disappointed in this.
2,Mobile phone charging station doesn't work anymore after purchasing 2 weeks ago.
1,Bought it because it says it works on your phone with the case. It doesn‚Äôt. They do not take returns.Update. I am able to return it
1,I bought this for my phone watch and headphones‚Ä¶ the watch part is the only part that works and not even all of the time don‚Äôt waste your money
1,i‚Äôve had this product for a couple months and while it was good at first it randomly stopped working
2,Doesn‚Äôt charge well. Inconsistent. Sometimes works sometimes doesn‚Äôt.
1,iPod charger does not work this is the second one I received and did not work!
1,Good concept ‚Ä¶ I just won‚Äôt remove case each night to charge.
2,Product will not charge iPhone12 Mac Pro
1,The charger stopped charging my watch right after my return window closed.  I took it out of town with me and when I set it up it would not charge my watch but would charge my phone.
5,Bueno bonito y barato
1,This one does not work fir my iPhone 12‚Äìgreen light turns orange shortly after you put it on. Wake up to a half charged phone!!! Pay more & get one that works!!!
1,I loved this thing but it broke after 45 days. I did some trouble shooting with the amazon support team but no luck. Now I have to buy something new
1,It takes for every to charge my phone
1,Worked once. Will not charge any of my devices anymore. POS.
1,it get hot very quick and it doesn‚Äôt charge fast as it says on description. My airpro charged the first week then stop charging
1,I bought this gift for my wife for Christmas and she have an iPhone 11 and AirPods Pro and 5 mins after using the stand just completely stopped working. I don‚Äôt even want to leave one star for how pathetic this was
1,After 4 months the charger areas no longer works to charge my watch or the area for AirPods.
1,Just opened the box and found one of the connectors  was in the down position while the others were in the up position. Will not charge. Only red lights.
1,I bought this because I thought it would work.  It is a nice unit but it would begon to charge my phone then fail.  The product itself has a nice felt-type finish. The packaging is cheap.I returned it.
1,Like but broke on week one.  The phone portion of this does not charge.  Only the watch charger works
1,It did not charge the devices the way it said it would. Skip this one!
1,I wish this product would have worked. My Apple Watch and air pod charged right away and worked awesome but my iPhone 12 pro would not charge and the device kept blinking red. Was very disappointed it didn‚Äôt work
1,Purchased this product in January and it no longer charges the AirPods. Of course it‚Äôs past the return period. Do not buy unless you want a throw away.
1,I liked the design and price.  However iPhone 12 Pro Max charging was not reliable.  Better if I turned it sideways but that is cumbersome.  It is probably Apple‚Äôs problem but the evil empire always wins.
1,I bought one for my daughter an stage thing gets very hot and I‚Äôm afraid it is going to catch on fire.
1,Thought this was great when it arrived. Unfortunately the front of the charging station for the phone stoped working and it‚Äôs only been a week. So disappointed.
1,cool looking design but unfortunately the phone charger did not work for me tried with 3 separate iphones (all that are able to charge wirelessly of course)
1,I wake up to the red lights flashing every night.  The most it ever charged is 86%.  Very annoying.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†This product was great until it stopped working after a month and a week. Just flashes red lights now. I would return if I could.
5,Great item!
1,It stopped working and flashes red. It will only charge earbuds. The watch stopped charging this week.
1,Does not charge phone fast at all would not recommend at all very unsatisfied.. most likely returning for the price
1,I get flashing red lights at least 50% of the time.  I would never buy another product from this company again.  Total waste of money.
1,You have to find a sweet spot for your phone to charge.
1,Stopped working after 10 days. Emailed Amazon and they asked me to email the vender. They never emailed back. The Iwatch part is the only part that works currently.
1,Stopped working after a couple of months. Red lights would blink while phone is trying to charge. AVOID!!
1,It stopped working within a few days. Product is faulty. Do not recommend. Customer service does not respond.
1,Thought I really liked this charging station then after one month it just stopped working.  So was just a waste of money.
1,I bought this product at the end of January and it's the middle of April and the charging mechanism for the phone isn't working anymore.
1,This product two days in a row has not charged my iPhone 12 Pro Max or my Series 5 Apple Watch. The product should work out of the box as described and doesn't.
1,Worked for about a week. Then the plug comes undone. Doesn‚Äôt charge my watch fully.
1,I only had product for less than a week and it stopped working.  Would not recommend totally a waste of time.
1,Expensive for a crappy product
1,It was great but after a couple weeks the watch charger stopped working

1,Watch portion of the charger stopped working in 5 weeks.
1,Dock stopped charging and woke up to my products dead. Not worth it.

1,Overall it is a fast charger for the phone.  Unfortunately the Apple Watch Does Not Charge on it!
1,The watch charger  doesn't  work half the time
5,I made the switch from Android to Apple in early April 2022. I instantly became hooked on my iPhone 13 Pro Max and went on to acquire the Apple Watch 7 Series and most recently the Apple Airpods Pro with the updated MagSafe case. When I only had my iPhone I was able to use the 2-in-1 wireless charger I had been using on my Galaxy phone and watch to charge my new iPhone. When I got my Apple Watch it did not work on my old charger the way my Galaxy Watch did. After some in depth browsing I decided that the Hatalkin 3-in-1 was the best buy for my money to wirelessly charge both my iPhone AND my Apple Watch. It even worked to charge my Galaxy Buds that I was still using!Well months have gone by and I'm still loving my Hatalkin charger. It takes up such little space on my bedside table and I can trust it to recharge my iPhone my Apple Watch and my Airpod Pros all at once! My old wireless charger was re-homed to my girlfriend who has been using it for her Galaxy phone and watch but just this morning she ordered an iPhone 13 Pro Max and she too will be ordering this charger to power her new Apple devices! I love mine and I trust that you will love it too!

1,Junk.  Never charges correctly on any of my family‚Äôs three phones.  Will only charge a couple percents then nothing.  Complete waste.  Very unhappy
5,It worked great for the first two months then it stopped working. In the middle of the night it began to blink red and not charge.

1,It would not charge iphone 12
1,AirPod charger does not work.
1,Doesn‚Äôt work. Only charges my watch.
5,I bought this for my husband as he has several things that need to be charged and the table beside his chair was becoming too cluttered. He loves it!!! And I love that there‚Äôs less mess on the table!! Would recommend.
5,Me encanta este producto sirve para tel√©fonos reloj y air pods
3,Great concept and uses less space on my nightstand but the watch charger is VERY SLOW. :(
3,The USB C plug doesnt stay firm in the slot this is why everyone gets the red lights. You must also use the correct charging brick to get full power fir all devices. I haven't figure out yet how to make the plug snug. I've tried crimping it a little etc but it still slides out.
1,Mine has a quit but loud ringing sound and i bae good ears. It‚Äôs so loud to me. Charging is not fast very slow
5,This sits nicely on teh desk and very usefull as i can browse comfartably while its getting charged dont have hurt my  neck to llok at whats up or any messages at mobile while working finds it very usefull and recomend it. it has very good usecases.
1,The watch portion of the charger stopped working on about day 30 right after the return policy expired.  Would not recommend buying.
5,It‚Äôs perfect. I bought it as a gift for my bf & love the fact that everything is getting charged in the same place without wires all over the place
5,These photos are hilarious are they all from hotel rooms
5,All in all this is a convenient way to condense all chargers into one little stand. Seems pretty sturdy and does exactly what I expected it to. It‚Äôs simple to put together and ready to use straight out of the box in just a few minutes. Great job!
5,I purchased this charger stand for my IPhone and Apple Watch. It charges very easy and fast. I like how portable it is. I always take it with me every where I go.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Love how sleek it is how easy it is to set up and use. Takes very little space and charges all 3 of my device without any issue. Great product!
2,Worked only a few days. Phone isn‚Äôt charging anymore nor is it recognizing the AirPods. The watch circle popped out of place. Had to push on it to pop it back and it worked. One of the three charging platforms is working. Disappointing.I do like you can assemble and disassemble for trips. The material was good saves a lot of space for sure
2,Charges my IPhone XS and Watch SE but not my AirPods. Even without the phone and watch on the charger it still won‚Äôt charge the pods.
1,I got this charger in black but I am not able to review the exact one I bought. I wanted to really like this charger but it did not work for my Iphone 12 Pro Max. Upon reading other reviews I noticed that many people with Iphone 12s had the same issue. It would charge really slow about 10% per hour; that is really slow considering that it is a super charger. I ended up returning it because it defeated the purpose.
1,Tried the unit with the supplied power supply to charge a iPhone 12 Apple Watch latest series and AirPods pros. All devices were not fully charged overnite. Used another power supply for a different night of charging same devices the watch and AirPods charged the iPhone charged to 50%. I would not recommend this charging station if you expect to get all devices charged at same time.
1,I was gifted this device & it will only charge my watch & AirPods. I have a 11 pro & it will not charge the phone. I took the case off still no charge. I emailed the contact email that it has on the charging station for any defects. No luck yet.
1,does not charge my iphone 12 mini or my airpods this is not good for traving
5,It works with the iPhone 12 Pro!  I needed this to charge my new iPhone my Apple Watch series 6 and my iPods.  I am pleasantly surprised on how great this charger is.  Light well built and aesthetically pleasing.  This can be folded and will be great for those who travel and don‚Äôt want a lot of chargers and cords.  Even my iPods will charge with the case on which is not the case with most Qi chargers.  Do not hesitate to purchase. Great value for money.  (Note: this puts out 10W.  The charger you purchase with the iPhone 12 12 Pro is much faster at 20W but if you charging overnight it doesn‚Äôt matter. )
5,I was contemplating getting a 3 in 1 charger for a while but most of the chargers are pretty pricy and the ones which are reasonably priced don‚Äôt support fast charging... and then I found this one which supports fast charging and was within my price range... it does it‚Äôs job pretty well charges my watch my iPhone 11 Pro and my AirPods Pro all with great efficiency... love the overcharge protection... overall highly recommend this charger.
5,So slim and sleek-charges amazingI was searching for something that didn‚Äôt take up much room didn‚Äôt have cords hanging off everywhere and had wireless charging capabilities for all of my devices.This is EVERYTHING!!I liked it so much I ordered my husband one.The lights easily indicate if your device is sitting correctly on the charger by turning free on the display. It‚Äôs very small but I haven‚Äôt had any issues with it tipping over.I read the insert when I planned to reorder and noticed they were providing a credit if you posted a review. That‚Äôs a fantastic way to give back to the consumer while sharing honest feedback.I really hope they make one that also includes an iPad option. I would buy several because these things are just so nifty charge quickly and take up zero space!Will update in a few months regarding sustainability.
5,I got this to charge my apple watch and iPhone together I got really annoyed with my old wireless charger where I had a ton of different cables for all my electronics however this really helped simplify everything. It plugs in with USB-c and comes with its own Qualcomm fast-charging brick which usually does not come with stuff like this.  I have not had issues with overheating or anything and it is also basically requires no alignment as the watch charger is magnetic and the wireless charger works with the phone placed vertically and horizontally.
5,You want this unit.  I tried others and some did not charge (it would stop mid charge) and some would not securely hold the watch so it would be uncharged the next day.This is perfect.  It charges without stopping AND there is a magnet so the watch stays on securely!If I had to make a complaint it is that the indicator bulbs are hard to understand.. there should just be 3 of them for each chargig surface.But regardless it is the perfect one to get!
4,Love that this charges all 3 Apple products at once and frees up my dresser from multiple cords. I charge items overnight and all are fully charged come morning.  Love taking this for traveling 1 charger to grab instead if 3.* Item stopped charging after a few months but I contacted the seller and was sent a new one in days that is working great. Thank you for great customer service!!
5,Very happy with my replacement not sure why the first one didn‚Äôt work but the company sent me a new one and it is awesome the company really wants to make sure your happy with their product and that makes me a happy customer!
5,This product has cleared up so much space on my nightstand! With just one USB plug it charges my phone Apple Watch and AirPods. All I have to do is set them on there.It doesn‚Äôt charge as quickly as the apple chargers that came with the products but it does better than other chargers I‚Äôve used. No more fumbling for my cords and trying to find the right one.My phone does have a case on it but I cannot have a pop socket or ring stand on it since it blocks the magnetic charge which is a little irritating but that‚Äôs not just this product and is true for most magnetic chargers and it wasn‚Äôt worth it to have to take the case on and off all the time because of a holder.
5,This charging dock is a great item. It charges my iPhone apple watch and air pods pro at the same time and all products charge up really fast. The charging dock is made really well and is very sturdy. It does not feel cheap and like it will fall apart. I am happy with the purchase and would definitely recommend this charging dock to any one  who is looking for a fast space saving dock for your wireless products.
5,I am really enjoying my wireless charger. I can put my Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max and Apple Watch Series 7 both on at the same time. They are both charged in a short amount of time. I give it a 3 on travel because I have not traveled with charger. But if you had a safe place to sit the charger it fast charging.
5,It's great being able to fast-charge my iPhone while I'm still able to see messages etc. that come in while I'm reading or at work on my iMac.
5,Great design and good use of space.  Room for watch to charge plus two additional touch pads to use for a phone or other devices.  Doesn‚Äôt take up a ton of space either just great
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Such a great item. Charges all of my devices at one time in one convenient spot! This charger removes a lot of clutter off my nightstand and looks nice while doing it. My devices haven‚Äôt over charged or felt warm even after a full night of charger. Definitely recommend this charger for people with multiple apple products that need charging!

5,Save us from all the cables! Lol.I got this for my hubby he loves it!!He has all the apple products you can ever imagine this wireless charge is what he wants and what he needs it!Thank this wireless charger! No more knotted cables! He can final charging everything at once!!!!! And don‚Äôt need fight with me for cables lol!The actual product is good looking Light and smooth hand feel.I think I‚Äôm gonna get one for myself too lol.
5,how practical and easy!The device is easy to instal and it's ready to go immediatly!I absolutely love how it works  and especially that I dont have deal with cords and the plug in routine.I set it by my bed side! Just drop and go and voila! full batery in the morning.
5,Had too many cables on my vanity this reduced the job and easy to use.  Very fast charging.  Have to make sure the watch is centered to avoid heat transfer.  But easy to center.
1,I have an Iphone 12 pro it's running the latest software. I charge my phone without the case and about 50% of the time a few minutes after I sit the phone on the charger it starts flashing red. If the solution is for me to restart my phone every time I use this charger...that is not a satisfactory customer experience for me. since Amazon makes it near impossible for me to figure out how to contact the seller. I will be returning this.
5,very nice fast charge my watch and iphone ipod case at same timeIt is very stylish and built very nicely  I'm so glad i chose this one! It's exactly what I wanted which is good price and better product! Very satisfied!
5,I stumbled upon this after looking for an Apple Watch charger and the was sold at the fact that is only one cable so I did not have to purchase a charger again.It‚Äôs amazing product. Beautiful pastel color. It charges everything at once and only one cable needed. Before this I was literally charging everything all over my room.Shipping was quicker than I expected. There is no assembly of any kind. This is a game changer!
5,I can finally charge everything at once without finding plugging multiple cables! It was very annoying. Plus the charge is fast. The new Apple Watch was fully charged in about 20 mins. I also like that the charger is also a phone stand so I can FaceTime or watch videos if I wanted.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†The only one I found that works with a case. Love it. It works very well. Good quality. Charges fast and charges my Apple Watch also. Really recommend.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Love this charger. Tried other brands prior but none offered the ability to wirelessly charge all three of my devices. The magnets hold the Apple Watch in place phone charges quickly and airpod alignment is easy to use. If something is not aligned the pair of LED lights on the front flash to tell you there is an issue.
2,It charges my iPhone 12 but not my AirPods as advertised. I accidentally discarded the box or I would‚Äôve returned it. I don‚Äôt have an Apple Watch so I can‚Äôt speak on that charging area.
5,I have bought multiple third party wireless charging station and some of them did not work with the new iphone 12! But this unit did not disappoint! I have tested it with iphone 12 12 pro and 12 pro max and they all worked perfectly. The 3 in 1 function makes it even better by charing 3 devices (phone watch airpods) at once. Unlike most other products this one came with the USB wall plug too and this is very important because you need to have enough input/output to charge 3 devices at once. Highly recommend!
5,I liked the way my phone sits in the cradle
1,This is the slowest charger I have ever had I put my phone on overnight and it‚Äôs only 40% charged in the morning
1,Product doesn‚Äôt always charge. Red lights are constantly flashing. Did everything the troubleshooting said to do!Big waste of money. Worst product ever!Just threw both in the trash!!
4,This wireless charging station is perfect for traveling. Cuts down on multiple cords and very easy to use. However took a really long time to charge my phone.
5,It worked great easy to use and charges all my accessories perfect.I can charge my phone and earbuds.Great quality
5,This 3-1 charging station delivers as promised. I have a pet sitting side hustle so I‚Äôm always going from house to house and this little gem goes everywhere with me. Easy to break apart and reattach directions are clear charges my iPhone 12 Apple Watch 6 and AirPod Pro‚Äôs fast. It‚Äôs everything I need in a charger to save space and cord clutter. 10/10 would recommend.
2,I like the design of the device but it will not charge my phone or Apple Watch wirelessly.  I contacted customer support and they could not help.  They have offered to refund my money.It is fine if the device won‚Äôt charge wirelessly but please advertise correctly that it must stay plugged in to work.
3,It is a nice product that allows you to charge iPhone iWatch and AirPods at the same time. It works great on the phone and AirPods but I have issues with the iWatch. It beeps every now and then like it is just connecting.
5,Works perfect good. Bought the Apple watch before but didn't really use it because it needs to charge every day and cannot get used to it. The 3 in 1 charger station helped a lot which make me get used to charging the apple device every day.  It's charging fast and you can even use your phone while charging it. Love it.
5,I already had a wireless charging but still bought this one and I am very satisfied. is a true all in one wireless charger for your Apple devices. For the charger I owned I need to use my own apple watch charger and I have to purchase a separate 20v adapter. But this one integrates everything well. Not to mention the touch is much better (it feels more like Matte). Highly recommended.
5,Okay so I looked an looked at chargers I wanted something small not bulky an that‚Äôs I didn‚Äôt have to plug any of my cords into an this did all of that!!! An it was super easy to put together you pop the two pieces together an plug in the charger cord an your good to go.. I have the Apple Watch 6 an the iPhone XR which has a thick case on it an it chargers wonderfully definitely worth the buy
5,Stylish and just what I wanted and needed. Box came opened not sealed. All parts where there and only one part appeared to be taken out and re-wrapped. All is working but I will be saving the box and wrapping material just in case. Notice on picture that seal appears to be cut but like mentioned all in working order.
5,This is a nice and compact charger for all my Apple devices. Works well. I charge my iPhone 11 Pro AirPods Pro and Apple Watch Series 5. Seems to work fine. Chargers everything quickly and at the same time and looks nice. So much better than all the cords I had before.
5,It has a very simple set up. It is plugged in place so you just plug the charger that came with it into an outlet and place your items on the rack. I have an iPhone 12 as well as an Apple Watch five and AirPod pros and it charges all of them at the same time and works perfectly
5,This one is not fast charge compared to MagSafe charger  but it can charge more than just iPhone 12/13 as long as your phone support wireless charge plus it can charge airpod pro and Apple Watch at same time. And it‚Äôs design looks great and robust too
5,Love it so much!!!!I can charge my phone my watch and my AirPod at the same time it help me save my time and save space too. Look professional at my work table also. Highly recommended!
5,I‚Äôve had this for a year now & I‚Äôve had no problems. Loved it so much I bought a second one to give as a gift. It allows you to charge all three so you clear out those cords. Makes it easier to travel with one charger and it comes comes apart for travel as well.
2,Update: does not work well with iPhone pro max 12.  Charges for a little bit and then stops shortly after and shows 2 blinking red lights.  Cool design but disappointing results.Really love how this device lets you charge your Apple Watch without having to use apples charger.  Don‚Äôt notice the fast charge really working faster then a normal wireless charge but that‚Äôs not what I bought it for.  Overall great product for the price.
5,The order in which I purchase items is generally based on performance parameters and price. I found that the performance of this charger complies with WPC Qi 1.2.4 wireless charging Regulation charging at speeds up to 1.7A it has this kind of performance but the price is not expensive so I bought it among many choices.
5,I like how you can charge all your wireless devices. The only thing I noticed was when charging all 3 devices at once AirPods iPhone and watch the red light flashes. I feel because it‚Äôs a fast charger and it‚Äôs using a lot of power to charge. No big deal I just charge the iPhone last.
5,When I upgraded to the iPhone Pro 12 Max my old charging station didn‚Äôt do the job anymore. This charger however is beyond perfect. It‚Äôs a good size for my new phone it also charges my AirPod Pros through it‚Äôs protective case and my Apple Watch.The lights on the front of the display are very dim. Not too bright so it‚Äôs fine to have on my bedside table.I highly recommend this charger. I cannot stress enough how great of a product this is.
5,I had 3 different chargers on my night stand!  Now I have this 3 in ONE.  I have my nightstand back!  Charges phone fast.  Charger has lip at bottom so phone doesn‚Äôt slip off.
4,Wifey loves it by the bedside and it charges her watch and phone quickly and easily..... I'd say it was a good buy....
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†such a great product! I purchased another charging station and this one puts that one to shame. this station is study charges quickly and does not take up much space. The apple watch connects effortlessly and the fact that it comes apart for easy travel is a bonus!! you will not be disappointed
5,Just got the charger. Charges my iPhone 12 Pro Max Apple Watch 6 and anker liberty air 2 at the same time. If I don‚Äôt revise this review then it‚Äôs still working.
5,3-in-1 Charger.  Charger comes with cable and power adapter using USB C.  Charged my Apple phone.  I got a full charge in about an hour.  Compact size.  Good for travelling.  No need to carry 3 separate charging cables / adapters.
5,Best wireless charger I have bought by far. Fast charging charges with case on watch charges fast and does not fall off the charger like my other chargers.
5,Love it keeps the airpods iphone and apple watch neat and tidy in one place. Just NOT include Apple watch Airpods charge cable!
5,Awesome charger. Previous wireless chargers haven‚Äôt had the charging power that I‚Äôve been looking for. I was able to fid it in this product. I would definitely recommend for the quality and price.
5,I have had no problem with this set. Very nice little room needed and charges everything all at once it separate.
5,Works great with new IPhone 12 pro max
5,Much cleaner desk! (Imagine my phone is there as well). I was planning to build something like this as I‚Äôm a hobby wood worker but I‚Äôll never make it so compact. Love it!
5,Works great and is compact love that your phone can be charged either straight up or on its side. Would definitely recommend and buy again if needed too.
1,It charges my Apple Watch 6 and my AirPods Pro but does not charge my iPhone 12Pro at all.  I will be returning the product.
5,Satisfied with the purchase.
5,Great value for the price! Highly recommended. It‚Äôs nice to have a stand that charges my AirPods iPhone and I watch at the same time efficiently.
5,Finally a Stand that will not allow my phone to slide down at night time charging
5,It‚Äôs so easy!!  I love it!!!  So much better than the chargers that use your own watch charger in them.  Don‚Äôt waste your time in them get this one!!
5,I used the similar one before but that one is hard to use and annoying. But This one is really useful I use this one for my iphone and iwatch and airpod and very easy to use and sturdy
5,Great product and easy to use
4,So it seems the cord fell out of the box when I opened it. I finally found it that eve and it works great! However it doesn‚Äôt charge my Anker wireless earbuds with case. But I am happy with this product!
5,I love this thing. The modern design and multiple magnets for charging. Its epic. The random name of the brand may have you skeptical but it‚Äôs worthy. Remember don‚Äôt knock it until you try it
4,love the design but does not charge my airpod 2
5,I'm super happy with this purchase! after weeks of looking and reading reviews I decided to give this one a shot! Definitely happy with my purchase so far.
5,Great 3 in 1 charger super fast and looks reliable charge 3 apple products at once and it is so convenient would 100% recommend this
5,Fast charging and could combine iwatch and iPhone.  Easy to use.
5,HATALKIN Customer Service Team reached out to me when I had problem with charger.
5,This product is very convenient and easy to use for travel
5,Bought it as a gift my son loves it. Charges great!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†Great compact wireless charger that Charges fast.It‚Äôs very Reliable and I Love  it.
5,Very fast shipping. It is a convenience product easy to pair and use. With it I do not need a phone holder and a power bank at the same time. Love it!
5,Love it
5,Fast charging
5,This item is very handy and exactly as described!  Works great!!
5,It charges the phone super quick even tho my iphone has a super thick cover!!!! That really surprised me. For the watch the charging speed is normal. But definitely worth the purchase and would recommend 100%
5,Convienient to use for all of my daily charging needs. Use for my iPhone and Apple Watch. Easy to set up and charge up.
5,It‚Äôs so convenient! I have an iPhone an Apple Watch and an AirPod so I could charge my all my devices at one time. It takes two hours to get full batteries. Whoever has any devices from Apple I would recommend you to get this 3 in 1 Wireless Charging. It‚Äôs worth it!
5,I searched for a wireless charger that would allow me to charge my iphone Pro Max with the case on. I do not want to have to remove my case to charge my phone. It reliably charges my phone airpods pro and apple watch. I highly recommend this product.
1,This lasted two months. Now the only thing that charges are the airpods. This is junk.
3,The charger for the phone worked well....quick charges the phone really well but it will not charge the phone and an Apple Watch at the same time or the phone and AirPods at the same time & if you try all 3 only the phone charges. Great concept but it falls short on performance.
4,I really like this charger. It compact and I can charge two phones and my iwatch at the same time.
4,does not charge well - all my devices run out of power before the end of the day - the phone watch and ear budsThe customer service was fantastic they sent a new  charger out to us and made sure it was working properlyThank you very much for following up on our concerns
5,Works as intended. I had a different version from another company that did not charge with either my MagSafe cases or any other case for that matter.  This unit however charges with all my cases and even charges my apple AirPod pros with a thick leather case.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Super convenient to charge all of my devices in such a compact space. Even works with my phone case. Very sleek and great price.
5,This charging station charges fast & seemless. No issues with this product.
2,Doesn‚Äôt charge iPhone 11 with ottorbox defender case. Will start to then stop. Can‚Äôt rely on overnight charging. Disappointed for $50
5,I have had several different chargers over time and this one by far is the best
5,Love this charger. Only downside is that it doesn‚Äôt charge the first generation of AirPods but other than that it was a great buy!
4,This charging station charges my electronics much faster and easier than others. I like the way it‚Äôs laid out and it sits nicely by the bed at night to charge my devices while I‚Äôm sleeping
5,Just what I have been looking for everything on one compact charger.Arrived on time and in good condition.So far it has worked flawlessly and I don‚Äôt think I am using it to the fullest extent.Would recommend.
5,Love that it completely decluttered my nightstand. I used to always knock everything over because of all the wires I needed to charge my electronics. With this device only one wire is needed to charge phone AirPods and watch. I thought it was a little pricey but it works really well!
5,This station reduced my cords and clutter. The design is great nice and small makes charging all my devices so much easier. 100% recommend this charging station
1,Bought at the end of April and it stopped working the start of August. Very disappointed and dissatisfied with my purchase. This charger should not only last for 3.5 months.
5,Charging station works great. Love that it can change multiple devices definitely saves the trouble of having multiple charging stations for my phone and Apple Watch.
5,Works great with my iPhone X iwatch and my wife‚Äôs iPhone 12 Pro Max. It has two charging spots for apple devices and charges pretty fast.The quality is great and it has a smooth surface. Fits my desk pretty well.Now I can throw away the annoying charging cable and just put my iPhone on it whenever I want.
2,Device sometimes just start blinking red lights and the only way to stop it is to unplug the power cord and plug it back in. Otherwise it‚Äôs pretty good.
5,Love this charger.  I hated all the cords and with this you only have one and it charges super fast.  Love it.  In fact I plan on getting a couple more.  Thank you
5,üëç
1,Not great keeps stopping charge every 5 minutes
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Hahaha this wireless charger is too convenient I didn't expect it to be so good the appearance quality is so good...
5,I love it! It is very easy to use and to have all my favorite devices charging in my new HATALKIN 3 in 1 Wireless Charging Station Compatible with Apple Products. Give it a try.
5,Easy to use and you can charge your phone in landscape and portrait mode. The Apple Watch charger is a little slow but that doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre using it as a bedside charger.
5,Easy to use and aesthetically pleasing
5,Works great and charges my phone through a thick case
5,I really liked this charging port. It took care of all of my charging needs. Super easy to put together!
2,AirPods charging section does not work and this item does not fast charge anything. It charges at regular speed. Buyers beware.
5,Works great
5,Wirelessly charges all of the devices.  Even a Bluetooth earpiece!
5,Easy to use. I just had to plug it in and charge all my devices. The charging time is really fast also.
5,Product works great! Charges everything very well.
5,Charges my iPhone 12 Pro Max AirPods & Apple Watch series 5 all at the same time. Comes with a power cord & it‚Äôs all you need. So much nicer than having a bunch of charging wires everywhere. The light pink color is cute as well.
5,Really like this charger.  I haven't used the ear phone charger yet because not sure how to.  But the phone and watch charger is fantastic.  Plus it is really reasonably price.  It's much better then the Iphone chargers out there now.
5,Easy to put together and to use.  I love mine and would recommend for every one
5,awesome.
5,These are well built products. Is sturdy and looks nice
5,üëçüèº
5,Great
5,Used it for a while and super easy to use it instead of three or more wires.cant wait to buying another one for my friend for a birthday gift lol .
5,Excellent purchase.
5,Love this product!
5,I like everything about this charger. It is like weight so it will be easy to take in a suitcase. I just keep it plugged in and put on whatever needs charging.
1,Makes a constant clicking sound when there is no phone sitting on it.It's scary to think that this could be electrical discharge in the air when the charger cannot find a device to dump power into. I hope it doesn't burn down my house.
5,This did not work with galaxy watch 4 but seller reached out and offered amazing service. Would purchase from them again!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†This is so convenient and easy to use. It looks nice and takes up little to no space.
5,Love this charger. It looks great and chargers 3 devices at once. The only minus is that the new Apple Series7 charges faster with original fast charger but it is not the end of the world.
5,I bought the 3 in 1 wireless charging station for my Apple tech. This charging station is AMAZING. I liked it so much I told my boss about this stand he bought it and loves it too! Product is so convenient doesn't take up much space and super fast charge. Everything on one stand no cords to have to deal with. Haven't tried charging my airpods yet but works great for my iPhone 13 Pro Max and watch. Not sure how well it charges with a thick phone case but I've had no problem with my clear case.
5,This did not work with galaxy watch 4 but seller reached out and offered amazing service. Would purchase from them again!
5,No more tangled wires! No more broken chargers! This is such a great headache free piece!
2,UPDATE 10/3/21: sadly I had to take 3 stars off my original review because these only worked properly for about 3 months. In some cases less. I purchased 5 of these (4 in the original order 1 replacement) and none of them made it past 3 months. After trying again with one that died after 1 month I gave up. Upsetting because the design is perfect and when they worked they were unbeatable. Hope they continue to improve on them ‚Äî may give them another try if they come out with an updated version.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-ORIGINAL REVIEWWorks perfectly for my iPhone AirPod Pros and Apple Watch. All three charge very fast simultaneously and without having to take the covers off the iPhone or AirPods. Would buy again and highly recommend.
5,I bought this charging set for my iPhone Airpods and Apple watch. All I need is just a single cable to charge all these things. It works very well. I was pleased with how easy it gets them to charge in a simple way. I‚Äôm really happy with this item. Highly recommended.
4,Read the fine and hidden print.  *** You can‚Äôt return this. ****  Ordered wrong item and stuck with it.  This is an expensive item to be stuck with. Watch out for this seller‚Äôs policy.Update.  Months later found a use for this item. Very happy with the design and quality.  Works excellent on my work desk so I can see my phone and work and charge items throughout the business day.
5,Very easy to set up took less than a minute.  Charges fast for wireless charger.  Doesn‚Äôt take much space and perfect for any night stand.  Would buy another.
5,I really like the 3 in 1 feature. Charges well
1,This product started out really great. I love the fact that it‚Äôs easy to put together and it gives you the option to take it apart which is good for traveling purposes. Unfortunately I was traveling and I brought this charger. It stopped working. It did not recognize my phone and my phone went dead. The light started blinking red and then it stayed green but did not charge. I have an Iphone 11pro Max
5,It does what it‚Äôs supposed to: charge my 3 apple devices all at once quickly & affectively. I‚Äôd probably rather travel with a similar device that was flat but that certainly wouldn‚Äôt stop me from doing so if I didn‚Äôt have it. It‚Äôs a great device.
5,Pretty great the design makes it so that it take up less surface area that the other type of chargers out there. Especially on my tiny night stand being small is so important. It charges pretty fast too I almost as fast as my quick charge chargers from apple. If they come out with other colors like blue or white I‚Äôll buy it again.
5,Easy to use and assemble. It came with nice packaging. It doesn‚Äôt take much space in your working table. Fast and convenient to charge iPhone Apple Watch and AirPods at the same time.
5,The wife and I both have iPhones (and 8 plus and a X) Apple Watches and Apple Airpod Pros.  Our charging station looked like a bowl of spaghetti!!  Not anymore.  I purchased one of these to see how we liked it.  It arrived and two days later I purchased another.  They charge our devices quickly and the mess of multiple charging cables is gone.  The wife packed hers on a trip to visit the kids and now they all intend to purchase as well.  So nice to have all devices charging in one convenient location.
5,This is my first charging station ever and my mind is blown. It is compact and convenient. I charge my iPhone 12 pro earpods and Apple smartwatch at the same time. Everything charges fast and always fully charge in the morning. Sometimes I could even charge two phones at once (one at the phone pad and one at the earpods pad). I love how professional the station looks and I used it as a phone stand too! Overall highly recommend this product!
5,So easy! Charging for watch and phone in one!
5,This product is awesome! I love that I can charge my phone and watch at the same time. Plus the pink color is super cute.
5,Product works great no issues. I had a hard time finding a charger that didn‚Äôt have issues charging an iPhone 13 pro max all ones I‚Äôve tried either over heated the charger or Charged very slow. This charger did everything I wanted with no issues!
5,This is an amazing productI‚Äôd like to recommend this product to all who would like to purchase a wireless charger  from Amazon for the apple products
5,So happy that I no longer have to struggle with separate chords for my Apple devices getting tangled or which one goes to which. This charging station should have been introduced to me way sooner!!!!
5,Buy!
5,Excellent product works correctly very happy with purchase
5,This wireless charging station is great and have a very stylish look. The great advantage is that this comes with the apple watch cable attached so you don‚Äôt have to use the original one by circling it inside my previous charging station which can have serious damages.
5,Excellent product. I am using every time I need charger my phone and watch
5,I have a lot of apple products. If I charge then by using cables I‚Äôll have a lot of cables and make my tables a mess. If I charge them one by one then I need to spend a lot of times. The product totally solved the problem. The charging is safe fast and useful.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†This charger is definitely worth it! I‚Äôm able to charge my iPhone 13 Pro Max with the case on and my Apple Watch se at the same. It will charge AirPods also but I had to take them out of their little protective case because it was too thick. Super easy to use you literally just plug in the charger that came with it and it‚Äôs good to go.
5,LOVE the color. First 2 uses my watch would get warm but now it works perfectly without a problem. I leave both on the charger all night (the phone playing music) and no problems always fully charged.
5,Easy to use for Apple Watch and IPhone 12max
5,I‚Äôve been using the charger for a week.  I have an iPhone se Apple Watch and AirPod and it works great! I like it that it can charge my three products at the same time. And it is wireless charging so I no longer need to deal with so many wires. It is very convenient.
5,So convenient! I don‚Äôt even need to take off the case to get phone charged. Definitely recommend it.
5,I was skeptical but this works great for 2 phones and a watch.
5,This 3in1chargerIt is very suitable to be placed in the bathroom or bedroom. The mobile phone watch and earphone are charged at the same time. It is very suitable for Apple fans. I can put it in the bathroom and charge the mobile phone at the same time or charge it quickly. After taking a bath the mobile phone is full
3,The watch charger works great.  The phone takes way too long to charge.  It takes all night and then it‚Äôs not fully charged.
5,It's a very good productÔºÅÔºÅhighly recommendedÔºÅgood looking!easy to use it‚Äôs a all in one charging station don‚Äôt have to bring too much cable when u r traveling ...
5,It charges really fast! Finally can charge my phone and Apple Watch at the same time without plugging in multiple wires. It looks really nice on my desk too.
5,This definitely cuts down on the amount of cords and clutter. At the end of my day I just throw all my stuff on the charge and it charges everything quickly.
5,My girlfriend loves it ! No more clutter !
5,I‚Äôve only had it one week but it works great. It sits right by my bed and I can charge everything right there.  I‚Äôm very happy with it.
5,
5,Recommend this product charges fast works great
5,it charges the phone apple watch and ibuds
5,Does what it says works well wife likes it which is all that matters anyways. She uses it to charge the Ipnone and the airpods without having to plug anything in. Make sure your devices are compatible with this type of wireless charging Took a while to figure all that out.
5,I was reading some reviews and people have problems with charging phone in a case charging is not working after some time. Currently I don't have any issues with the changing station. I use my phone in a leather case and works well. Somehow I don't need to position my phone precisely to start charging which is really convenient. May be it is a new version? If it works the same way at least a new I will be happy.
5,The best charger for everything! I have been struggling to find a stand that can really charge all 3 things at once with out the craziness of 3 cords and this does it. Phone AirPods and watch all 3 charging in one places at the same time! It‚Äôs great. We‚Äôve had it about a month no problems at all
1,It's hit and miss as to whether or not this thing will work.  Half of the time the lights blink red and the thing stops charging my phone.  Then the only way to get it working again is by unplugging it.  Don't waste your time or money on this.
5,it prevented clutters of my chargers.
4,Works as should
5,old wireless charger failed and replaced it with this.  seems to be much more powerful and charges my iphone buds and watch with no issue.  comes with everything you need stand wire and power adapter dont need anything else.
5,All in one - neat and fast
5,Absolutely love this stand. It‚Äôs small and mighty. I have already traveled with it - with ease. It charges very quickly. It even charges through my phone case!
5,Great product
5,This 3-in-1 charger is slim & perfect for your nightstand! It's also compact for traveling as well. I'm very pleased with the quick charging efficiency. If you are looking for a lightweight charger with battery power this is a MUST GET product! I'll be ordering a few for my family and friends.
5,Super easy to use and very practical. I really like how you can charge your iPhone apple watch and air-pods at the same time. The charger is quick and charges your phone at a good pace. Overall a very good product that i would definitely recommend to buy especially if you have multiple devices that need to be charged.
5,It has three charging ports and can charge my iPhone  airpods  Iwatch at the same time and all the three charging ports a wireless and I don‚Äôt have to connect my devices with any cord I can just easily put it on the charging port to have them charged
5,These look so neat and clean go with any Decour and don‚Äôt really stand out. Perfect docking station to charger iPhone and Apple Watch at your desk nightstand or even in your camper when you‚Äôre going on vacation. So nice not having to look for quarts all the time you just put your watch and phone on there and it charges really fast
5,This made my life so much easier before I was waiting for one to charge and then having to use the same cord when one was fully charged for the next device. This is a great slim set up! Perfect on my nightstand when I go to sleep I put them all on and no long have to wake up to make sure they all get charged! Thank you:)
5,My nightstand is less messy. All organized and charges all my stuff at once and real quick! It was great!
4,Great product
5,Using it with iPhone 13 Pro Max Apple Watch 7 and AirPods Pro.  Works flawlessly.  Included wall charger is a plus.
5,my mom had been telling me to buy this for the longest and I finally did it! I am so happy with it. My phone charges through the case like ease and charges my watch like it was nothing. I love it
5,This product actually works extremely well. I love that I can charge my iPhone apple watch and my wireless earbuds all at the same time. It included a compact wall adapter and the USB-C cable needed for use. As a standing phone stand I also don't have to worry about getting the correct phone alignment and have not had a single mis-charge. Very pleased!
5,Love this charger. It was a budget purchase and had limited expectations. Charges great and fast. Does not charge with a pop socket (if you‚Äôre curious).
5,It charges my wife‚Äôs phone.It charges my wife‚Äôs airpods.It charges my wife‚Äôs Apple Watch.It charges my wife‚Äôs‚Ä¶ uhh‚Ä¶ it works great.
5,Convenient
5,Not the fastest wireless charger out there but does the job great when you just go to sleep at night. I love my phone is on the charger so I can see it in the morning to turn off my alarm. Very easy to use and I notice my headphone case and phone does get warm while charging but not enough to really be concerned about.
5,Been using this new charging station for a few days now and so far so good. Love having all of my Apple devices charging at once.
5,I love this charger! I just put my iPhone on it and it can be charged. This is the most convenient charger I had been used.
5,after many purchases and sending back items this is it! I loved it so much I bought two!  We have iPhones Apple Watches and Airpods and this charges all of them flawlessly!  Thank you for having a product available that is dependable quality and affordable!  You won't regret this purchase!
5,UPDATING from 2 stars to 5.  My first charger would not charge airpods.  The company read my review and promptly reached out offering to replace.  Second one works great and very clean looking.Wish I would not have thrown away the box.  I was waiting for my new airpods to be delivered so was only using for my watch and phone.  Once my airpods arrived I am unable to get them to charge.
5,The wireless charging works great and it helps keep my desk organized
5,The product arrive to me the 2nd day which is not expected. We have 3 different version of iphone at my house. It works for all of them! I love the clean and compact design. Also very easy to setup. I am thinking buy one more to accommodate other iphone and apple watch in my home. Definitely recommend it to user who has iphone and apple watch.
5,It took me four chargers to get one that actually charged everything it said it would. I would like it to have bee available in colors at a better price but they cost more and I couldn't go higher. I would have loved the white or blue but oh well it does what it advertised it would do so it is a winner in my book!!  I have no complaints in fact I probably would have to say I like it even better than the others I tried because it is so compact and would be easy to take on a trip. I liked the others but they would not charge my watch so I was forced to try this one and I am glad that I did. Like I said I've decided I did not need one that took up more space after having this one.
5,This charger works very well. I‚Äôve had other chargers that were temperamental and required the phone to be moved around on the device trying to get it to charge. This device charges my EarPods in a case iPhone in its case and my Apple Watch. Small footprint as well. Highly recommend.
5,This is the best wireless charger I've ever used. It can charge my two iPhones quickly at the same time without worrying about frequent failure of the lightning cable any more. It's worth recommending.
5,Awesome product.
5,Product does as it states.  It charges my iPhone 12max AirPods and my watch in one device.  It is inexpensive and lears up a lot of cables around my bedside.The only negatives I have experienced is that the cable is a little short so I replaced it with a 4‚Äô cable and every so often I have to adjust the phone to make sure it is charging.
5,Easy works great looks good.
5,This one is replacing my old reliable but bulky nightstand charger. I love that it is very compact and nicely designed. It saved me a room on the nightstand where I really do not have much room to spare.I like it a lot and love that it can charge my watch at the same time.
5,Nice sleek but most of all reliable!
4,After a couple of months it quit charging the phone.  All it get is a flashing red light. Tried reseating the stand and same result. Was great until now.EDITED:  After I posted my initial review the company reached out to me.  They offered GREAT support and showed a lot of concern about my satisfaction on the product.  Replacement device was sent and it is working rather well.  I'm hesitant to give it a 5 star...but may revisit that in another month to see if the red light issue strikes.  But the customer support def. deserves at least a 4 star.
5,Very easy to use-streamline-takes little space.
5,.Order arrived super fast and was as described. This charges my big ass iPhone Apple Watch and AirPods all at the same time. Doesn't take up much space either. I'm pleased with my purchase.
5,So convenient and beautiful design
5,I can slip this into my suitcase and have a charger for all my stuff
5,It's working good with my iphone. Not compatible with other phones
1,It‚Äôs a little tricky putting phone into position to charge and only lasted 10 months before it stopped charging.
5,This was a Hanukkah gift got my husband and it‚Äôs by far the best thing I‚Äôve gotten him. Takes little space on night stand doesn‚Äôt need multiple wires and charges phone I watch and AirPods all in one small station. The material is very study (rubber) and looks very slick. I‚Äôm buying a second one for myself! I‚Äôve had a few months and works great.  Highly recommended.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†Great product! Fits perfectly on my nightstand. Really love it. Will buy more of them. It charges my phone and watch perfectly.
5,Very fast charging. Good size fits two phone and one pod charging
5,Easy to setup and charges everything I have well and quickly. Would recommend highly.
5,No more multiple wires. Option to fast charge or regular for iPhone. Perfect for Apple Watch.
4,Charges phone and watch super fast easy to make connections.
5,Charger works great even with a case on the phone! Love everything about it and it‚Äôs cute. Only downside for me is the slight humming it makes drives me crazy. Hopefully I‚Äôll get used to it soon
5,We just received our Apple watches.  So exciting.... but we wanted to get a charging unit that would charge the air buds watch and iPhone at the same time AND quickly.  This is a beauty!  Easily hands down the best charger out there.  It is a COMPLETE unit and you don't have to buy any additional accessories.
5,It‚Äôs charges wirelessly every time no need to re-adjust your phone. Iphone 12 pro max for reference had issues with other wireless 3 in 1 chargers with the size and having to constantly adjust and after having this one for almost a month i have had 0 problems with it.
5,The appearance is exquisite the quality is good and the power is strong. It can charge two mobile phones at the same time and the two green indicator lights show separately. include QC3.0 adapter (9V / 2A).
5,Great product
5,I absolutely love that I can charge three apple products at once with only ONE cord. And it's so easy to simply drop my phone into place and hang my watch. Simple. Easy. One cord. Less messy night stand! I like the idea that it changes three things at the same time. It seems very well made . I also like that lights on the bottom show which devices are being changed. This charger takes up very little room on my desk .
5,It works well with my IPhone EarPods and watch!
1,Returned mine product itself has nothing wrong just the price is a little high. I could use $40 buy two at somewhere else for something even nicer
5,This is perfect way better than my other wireless charger. Charges all three of my devices very quickly I love that it's a stand and it's so easy to place the devices and they charge. Love the cute rose gold color definitely worth the money!
5,Space saver I like it
5,I‚Äôm using it on the iPhone 13 with a case and it appears to be charging. Will say as I use it more. But seems to be working.
5,This charge station could change phone watch and AirPods as the same time. It‚Äôs very efficiency and price is pretty good.
5,Very nice. Easy to use n great for traveling.
5,I have an IPhone 13 pro Apple Watch 3 and AirPods Pro. All work great with this.
5,Works really well and charges my devices quickly
5,I like the touch of the Frosted skin. charge slower than plug-in but convenient on the table.
5,This charging station is powerful. It charges fast. I just need to take the case off from my iphone 12. Because there is a metal ring on the back of my phone case.  Easy to use and save space. Very reliable product.
5,It seems like this is really sturdy and well made. It charges all 2 Apple products quickly.
5,Great efficient charging station. Daughter loves to have everything in one place. Fast charging wireless station.
5,It‚Äôs so convenient.. charges all my apple devices
5,I love it.I can use it for my phone my watch and AirPod....I love it so much
5,This wireless charger is Great! I bought it as a gift the recipient was thrilled with performance. Literally took it out of the box plugged it into the wall placed Iphone airpods & apple watch in their protective spots (they loved the fact that the manufacturer Really paid attention to caring for customers equipment while offering a Great RAPID Charge! 100% Recommend. Toss cords! Excellence.
1,I like the overall build but it‚Äôs already blinking & NOT charging with IPhone 12 Pro max. Will return with update.
5,Timely arrival after ordered. Works as advertised!
5,Easy to use.  Light good for traveling also.
5,This product is great! Fast charging too! Definitely recommend
5,Love that I can charge everything with one cord and that everything has a place in one spot.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†Searched high and low for a solidly built charger that could handle two phones and my watch and this is the one. Unlike many others a fast charging block and cable is included and the watch charger is built into the stand you don't have to provide your own and it keeps your watch in place snugly. Nice matte black finish with no big logos or anything. Looks great on a nightstand.
5,First I hate Amazon reviews because so many are lies. That being said‚Ä¶This charging station is amazing. It has a sleek design. Doesn‚Äôt take up much space. Charges everything as described.This is my 3rd charging station and the only one I would recommend.I haven‚Äôt seen any drawbacks with this device in the month that I have been using it.
5,Feels like it‚Äôs good quality and so far everything is working correctly
5,Very good 3 in 1 charger makes my work station look less messy. Easy to set up and very good product!
5,3 in one design really saves me a lot of energy of trying to find chargers everywhere.
5,I was hoping this would replace a clock radio with a charging port that never really worked. It does! in landscape and portrait. I already had a free app called Rect Clock and it can be set to use as a nightstand clock. Others are available.The power block is a little strange. It is USB-C where it goes into the unit but the other end is an odd USB-A. The color inside the block is red which I have never seen before. I assume that this is because it is just power and it delivers more power (changing 3 devices) than a standard USB-C charging system. I would guess you should never use an alternate power block or cable.
4,I love the color and everything seems to work when I placed all 3 gadgets in its charging places. I‚Äôd like to give it a 5 star rating but for now I start with that then I‚Äôll update later.
5,This is the third 3 in1 charging station I've purchased because the first two did not charge my Apple watch. This charger works great! Very easy to use and charges my iPhone Apple watch series 7 andAirPods. Super fast delivery - received in less than 24 hours. Couldn't be happier that I finally found a 3 in 1 that works as advertised. Highly recommend!
5,My wife loves this a birthday present that fits her lifestyle.
5,Meets my needs perfectly!
5,Essay for traveling  easy to use !
5,I love love LOVE this charger!  I purchased one for my office my husband and me. Compact convenient and it works!  Winner!
5,I‚Äôm am very pleased with this purchase! It charges my watch & phone no problem! (I don‚Äôt have EarPods yet but nice to know I have that charging area available) this Even charges my iPhone 13 through my Otterbox commuter case!  I love that it‚Äôs more compact than other ones I was looking at. And the seller even reached out to me to ask how my purchase was & to let them know if there‚Äôs any issues or question. I like that follow up.
5,It is very convenient.  One charger for all my Apple products.  No need to worry about forgetting to bring different cables when traveling.  Nice looking design too.
5,I purchase this charger in July and used it everyday. I loved it for how simple it was and how it could charge all three of my apple products at once. But today it stopped charging my phone. It will still charge my watch and headphones but no longer works for phones. I even tried my husbands phone and turning the device off and back on. No luck! Such a bummer cause I really liked it and it didn‚Äôt even last a full year.
5,great product. no issues
5,Easy to use charging station. Very good quality and size. All in one durable  charger. Love my purchase.
5,it looks like charging fast like it is advertising. Very satisfied and certainly recommend for gift as well.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Good
5,Never have to worry if your Apple Watch is charging as it lays perfectly on the charger!Phone charger fits iPhone 13 pro max no problem!Fast charge!Compact for nightstands I have 2! Husband loves his as well.
5,It charges fast. We sometimes use it as a stand too. There are two chargers that can be used for phones. Has two lights for indicating which slots are charging. There is a slower slot that can be used as a phone charger but is designed for AirPods Pro and cannot be used for the regular AirPods as they don‚Äôt have a wireless charging coil.
5,It's working very well. The texture of the charging station is very good. It's very convenient to charge the iPhone and watch. I like it very much!
5,Nice product  Easy to use & Frees clutter
5,Only needed one plug-instead of 2. Great when outlets are limited.
4,This is great for cord organization. My only wish is the cord was a little longer. But it works great and looks great!
5,Used only since Christmas but charges iPhone 13 iWatch 6 and iPods perfect.  Only issue is that if you have rubber case on iPods you need to remove it to charge.
5,I have been looking for a wireless charger for my Apple products for some time now. Very pleased with the choice I made. I can charge all 3 of my Apple devices all at once with one single wall outlet. It‚Äôs small compact and perfect for business trips. Amazing 3 in 1 charger!
5,Item as expected
5,Charges all my stuff super quick!
5,This charging station is very functional it allows me to charge all my devices at the same time occupying a minimum space. Highly recommended product extremely satisfied.
5,The product is used for charging multiple devices at the same time and works great
5,easy to useÔºåeasy to carryÔºågood
5,I use this on my nightstand and it works great for charging my iPhone and my Apple Watch. Would recommend
5,Works well good value
5,Outstanding charging power in a short time and doesn't make any sound while charging.It is easy to look at and check my cellphone without using both of my hands.The appearance look very well it is one of the decorations on my desk.
5,I'm so impressed with this charging station. I can charge my apple series 3 watch iphone 11 and airpods. You can charge phone vertically or horizontally to prop as you watch movies while charging.
5,Overall I am happy with this product but the charging power and speed for phone is not fast as expected.
5,Seems to be built well. Feels really nice. Worked immediately out of package. Love the feel.
5,The charging port was broken on the phone. This was an awesome solution
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†If you‚Äôre like me and you hate cords all over your nightstand then BUY THIS CHARGER! I originally had cords everywhere on my nightstand to charge my phone and watch which ultimately always lead to tangled cords my alarm clock falling over from the weight of the cords and me fumbling over all that to find my glasses when I work up.....well not anymore. It‚Äôs so small sleek and lightweight. Doesn‚Äôt take up a ton of space on my nightstand either. So do yourself a favor and buy this! I always review every purchase I make on Amazon and this one had great reviews. They even sent a info card for contacting them in the event I have a problem. I‚Äôve had it a little over a week now and I love it. Even told a few friends to get one too!
5,Charges my watch just fine.  Unfortunately it charges my phone for maybe 10 minutes and quits.  I will re adjust it and it again charges for a few minutes and stops.  I love the size and design just wish it would actually charge my phone.  Update they sent a new charger that works well!
5,The product is easy to assemble. It‚Äôs a phone holder and a charger so it‚Äôs really convenient to use! Plus it can charge all my Apple products in the same timeü§© I love it.
4,I love the idea and concept behind this. The design is why I purchased this product over the competitors. The charging port is really slow. It does not fully charge my iPhone. Its honestly faster charging my phone with the cable provided. Kinda disappointed.
5,The wife says "it works fine yep it charges everything fast."
5,Purchase to work with my iPhone and my Apple Watch works awesome
4,I love this thing. I ended up giving this to my husband for Father‚Äôs Day because of the timing of ordering. If it lasts I will be buying another for myself. If you have an Apple Watch you know how poorly thought out the charger is. It is very frustrating and about 25% of the time I wake up and my watch has fallen off the charger or not been connected and doesn‚Äôt charge. This solution is almost perfect. My only complaint is that the cord is a bit short so we cannot place on our bedside tables as the plug is too far away. If the cord was longer it would be perfect and 5 stars. Will update if it stops working but so far after a week we are very happy.
5,The only thing that I don‚Äôt care for is that it doesn‚Äôt charge my watch fully by the end of the day it goes to power saver. Never had that problem be for using this charger.
5,Absolutely love this. Small enough to use anywhere. I no lo longer have to carry separate chargers. It charges my watch AirPods and phone fairly quickly. Got it as a gift and ended up also giving it to my sister as a gift
5,Highly recommend! It has saved so much time for me  and also the speed of charging is so great! It really bring my life easier and more convenience.
5,Sturdy. East to use. Great to use in hotel rooms because u can charge multi devices using only one hotel outlet.
5,This Charging is faster and simpler without so many charging cables this three-in-one is easy to get suitable for iPhone 12. It is recommended to  buy.
5,Can charge multiple different products. I love having it in my living room very convenient size and placement. My phone Apple Watch and even AirPods can be charged with this product as well! Can charge pretty quickly very satisfactory product.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ¬†I absolutely love my charging station.  I can charge my Apple Watch AirPods and iPhone all at the same time and it charges quickly.  Highly recommend it to anyone trying to get rid of all the cords and have a one stop place to charge all of your devices.
5,Excellent product ! Totally worth it  I use it daily and take with me everywhere easy to take it as I tend to travel. One simple item to charge all your devices.
5,Works well for my new IPhone 12 and watch!
5,Love the ear bud charging and the muti device. Also fast charging.
5,I love this 3 in 1 wireless charing station for all my apple products. I have an iPhone 12 pro apple watch series 3 and airpods pro. All 3 of my devices charges on this wireless charging station very fast and easy. It comes disassembled but only take a minute to put it together. It comes with its own charing cable and adapter. The only thing to keep in mind is if you have a pop socket on your phone case like I do it may not charge with the case on. I have a magnetic pop socket on the back of my phone case and doesn't allow wireless charging to connect to my iphone. In order to charge my phone on this station I have to take off my phone case which isn't a big deal because it takes literally 3 seconds to do. Even if I lie my phone horizontal with the pop socket not on the charging staton it still won't charge unless I take the case off. But other than that this works great for all my products and I'm very satisfied with it. I'm hoping this last me a very long time.
5,We ended up ordering 2 of these. They charge all of our accessories at the same time and pretty quickly!!! We absolutely love them!!!!
5,This charger is relatively light and charges quickly. It can charge your phone and watch at the same time and act as a stand for watching movies. It doesn't get hot it feels safer it's a good product I like it.
5,I can charge my phone without removing the phone caseÔºåGood quality and easy to useÔºÅ
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Recommended!! well made and make me desk looks very organized
5,F√°cil de instalar
5,Very friendly to use and convenient. Charges all my Apple products fast.
5,Overall excellent product.  So convenient with three charging areas for phone AirPods and Watch.  Does good job when all three devices are charging at once.  Does real good when charging items individually.  Have not had any issues with overheating during the charging of any/all devices.  I am very very satisfied with this product.
5,My son uses this in his room and travels with it. I never hear him say he needs a new charger. May need one for my middle schooler.
5,I‚Äôve had several charging stations like this in the past but this one is the first to use just a single cable to power the phone watch and iPods. It‚Äôs really convenient. I also like that the watch is laid flat. Other models are on a slope which looks nice especially if you want a bedside clock but I found it would often slide off. Great design!
5,Great experience of this charger! Only little light to show the charger is working. Nice stand angle and chartering speed. Can charger three different equipment is great!
5,First of all I love that you don‚Äôt need additional cords for this one. It‚Äôs one plug and you‚Äôre ready to go! It charges my watch and phone at the same time and just as quickly as if you plugged it in alone.I like how this can save a ton of room on my night stand. I don‚Äôt have cords everywhere or my devices laid out on it. This station does a good job of laying out your devices take up a small part of the space.I have not traveled with it but I would say with only one plug it would be easy to travel with. Personally I‚Äôd rather travel with the cords since it‚Äôd take up less space in my luggage and I don‚Äôt need anything fancy for a short trip.Just a few things to improve upon:Large print that says ‚ÄúFAST CHARGE‚Äù on the front that makes it look cheap/tacky.The phone and watch sometimes takes some adjusting to get it to charge.The light at the bottom is not too bright but it‚Äôs hard to see what your battery life is looking at the charging station
5,This device has three functions in one which I think is amazing. It has a compact design and charges wirelessly and doubles as a phone stand as well. I can use it to charge my iPhone Air Pod and my Apple Watch all at the same time. What I find very convenient is that it saves a lot of time when it comes to charging your iPhone devices. This is one of the most useful products I have ever purchased and I strongly recommend this.
5,Perfect for an overnight charge everything for tomorrow session! During the day I do still use my actual charger for my phone if it dies or gets low but using this before bed so all my gear is good to go for tomorrow is a GODSEND. Goodbye three different chargers!
5,Works amazing. It makes my space a lot more organize. Also reduce all the messy cables and wires.
5,It is very convenient for Apple fan.It can charge phone watch AirPod at the same time.Love it
5,I have gone through several charging bases for multiple devices but this one so far has been the best.  Nice and compact and charges with ease and quickly.  Looks nice as well.  Better than the ones that take up more space.
5,The wireless 3-in-1 charger works just fine for iPhone Apple Watch and AirPods combination. It saved a lot cables and tidy up the space. My wife really like what I got for her. It can charge my iPhone even with case but not sure how thick the limit would be. It also docks and charges Apple Watch just fine. The charging speed is just fine. But I did tweak it a little bit with a iPad adapter make it charge much faster.
4,It‚Äôs hard to make this device to charge all three devices at once.
5,We have a few wireless chargers but we can always use more! I wanted a charger to be able to charge my Samsung Galaxy S21 as well as my Samsung Galaxy Buds - this charger accomplishes that! The pad on the back charges the ear buds while the front charges the phone. We have no need for the watch charging pad but I'm sure it works just fine.What's cool about this charging pad is you don't have to attach the upright - I tested it with just the pad and you can use it that way if you want.At first we thought the charger was defective and nearly returned it. Placing the phone in and 'fitting' it in behind the little 'lip' at the bottom made the phone learn forward ever so slightly and would break the charge point. After realizing that you don't need to 'fit' your phone into that lip at the bottom everything worked great! Just a bit of user error to keep in mind.
5,This device was easy to set up and works flawlessly with my watch iPhone 12 Pro Max and with Air Pods Pro.  Nice and compact and will use for travel since assembly and disassembly is very easy.  Looks great too.
5,it's so convenient. easy charge
5,Purchased 3 of these chargers and they work great. They have all types of chargers for different types of AirPods. Highly recommend this charger for easy charging of all apple products.
5,I bought these as Christmas gifts last Christmas. Everyone loved them. You can charge a watch phone and Airpods at the same time which is awesome. It charges  very fast. Another great feature is that you can watch videos on your phone while charging. The phone charger works even if your phone is horizontal. I would recommend this as a great gift for family friends or yourself.
5,This 3-in-1 charger is truly fantastic! It charges my iPhone airpods the same time and fast. Because the charger can keep multiple devices in the station so my desk now is more organized. I also like the folding feature this is helpful to me when I travel so I don't need to bring a lot of chargers or cords one does all. Overall awesome product and definitely recommendÔºÅ
5,works excellent charge my airpods pro and watch super fast even my cell easy to use bought 2 more for my mom and my sister thank you guys
3,It doesn‚Äôt charge my phone all the time. It will charge for about 10 minutes then stop . It works really good with my Apple Watch and my headphones.
5,I have an iPhone 12 Pro Max.  I have ordered products like this over the years and have had to return every one of them.  I waited a week to make sure it continued to work before writing this review.  It charges my phone my iwatch and my off brand wireless earbuds without a problem.  I purchased the white unit and it looks great.  I didn't need to use any of my existing cables and wires.  You just use the one included with the unit.  You can save money by ordering others but if you need those cables for anything else you need to order more.  With this one everything is included.
5,Doesn't take up a lot of room like other 3-way chargers. Looks great and works great.Charges my Airpods Pro Iphone and iwatch all at the same time.Includes the watch charger which some don't.Nice to only have one cord plugged in (also included).Very good product. Buy it.
5,I had trouble finding a charger for my IPhone 12 and IWatch 7 and this did everything I wanted.  I have an Otterbox Symmetry case and a lot of other chargers (Belkin Logitech et al) would not charge the phone with the case.  This does with no problems.  Also a lot of chargers do not work with the IWatch 7  even though they say they do but this does easily.  No worries about placement or overheating.  Great Charger for an excellent price.
5,Compact
3,really good product to use. you can use iphoneÔºåapple watch and AirPods. Charge very fast and easy. Charging power is strong and fast. Recommend this wireless charger. Can‚Äòt charge iphone after two months.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I have three Apple products and I need to charge them every night. I used to use charging cables to charge my devices however the cables would tangle up and would make it look messy. With this device it is so convenient to charge all my devices at one station. It works as described and charges quite fast. I recommend this product.
5,I have had this item for a couple of weeks and I have not had an issue.I have 11pro Max and Apple Watch
5,Item exactly as described! I bought 2 of these for my kids for Xmas and they both work amazing! Definitely recommend this product
5,great product fast charging..it does make a noise though. very quite noise.
5,This is an amazing product East to take apart fir travels and flies like it‚Äôs make of quality parts. I like that I didn‚Äôt have to use my own puck for my watch. Works flawlessly. Definitely would buy again. I have had others that weren‚Äôt half this good!
5,Works perfect! Love having one place to charge everything with only one cord!
5,A lot of the other chargers I looked at you would have to put your apple watch charger into the holder along with other cords sometimes. This is truly ALL in one. You do not need other cords or cables. You simply plug this one stand in and you can charge your phone airpods and apple watch at the same time. The light on the front is not too bright at night (when I charge my items) and does not keep me awake. It also lets you know you have the item in the right spot by coming on. This has worked great so far and reduced all the annoying cords I had by my bed. It would travel good too as it is pretty compact.
5,I recently got a iPhone and a smartwatch. Both great but the down fall was the charging. I‚Äôd have to unplug one charger to plug in the other. Since you only get 1 wall piece. After 2 days of that I knew I needed something easier. There were a couple on here I liked but they were too big for the spot I needed it for. Found this little one and I was sold. One plug that‚Äôs all it needs. Everything comes with it. Also if I decide to get AirPods there is a spot in the back to charge those too. So happy with this product
5,Product works well.. no complaints!
5,I've seen mixed reviews on how well this item works or doesn't work with iPhone 12.  In my experience it doesn't work at all.  I have tried re-booting the phone unplugging & re-plugging the charger removing my phone case removing the watch & AirPods from the charger & the problem persists.  The green light will come on for about 20-30 seconds and then the red light will flash rapidly.  After removing the case I was able to achieve about 20 minutes of charge but then the red light began to flash again.Great design & concept but unfortunately I will be returning it for refund.*UPDATE*: When I contacted the seller about my issues above they sent me a complete new unit & this one charges my iPhone 12 Pro without any issues.  I would definitely recommend this seller & their charging unit.  Thank you for the awesome customer service!
5,Great product small footprint and being able to charge your Iphone Ipod pro and Iwatch all at once is just amazing especially on a 3'' by 5'' inches stand.Sturdy and well balanced and a proper magnet to prevent your watch from sliding off.Enough room on the bottom part of the stand for your Ipod case to charge properly.Good and fast charging  capacity...don't know why I waited to get this charger and I'm not new to this this is my third one and I believe this is the best one I ever bought!!!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I‚Äôve used it for 5 months already. Highly recommend!! It has made the charging experience much better and it is a great help for me to organize my tiny desk‚Ä¶ It would get warm from charging but not heating up like crazy. I love how it can be used as a phone stand so that i can use my phone for video calling when i need to charge it. And having a convenient spot to charge my Apple Watch really made me wanna use the watch more frequently than before.
5,So far so good.Item charges iphone thru otterbox defender case.Stand grips items with a reassuring magnetic pull.Charges items properly.Seems to be decent quality.Will update if it craps out quickly ‚Ä¶
5,No extra cables required. Works like a charm charging my iPhone 11 max Apple Watch 7 and the latest AirPods Pro. Nice size too. Bought an extra one to give my Grandson as a gift. Love it.
5,Best wireless charger I‚Äôve bought!I purchased many different ones and the all seemed to never charge both devices!This one charges both devices at the same time and I‚Äôve also never had my devices got to touch once taking them off the charger!If your looking for a good wireless charger station then this is the one for you!
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†I was surprised that the connecting cable was also white. I ordered a white charger and was worried that the cable would be black like in the product photo. It is compact and exactly what I‚Äôve been looking for. I am definitely ordering another one for my other desk. This would be a good gift.

This unit makes white noise while charging.Update: Contacted the seller and they sent a new wireless charger which works flawlessly. Considering the friendly customer service and new unit working as expected would highly recommend the product
5,As described
5,Works great and actually charges my apple products really fast! Purchase well worth.
5,Excellent produit
5,I like that it has such a small foot print and it works really well.
5,Un seul chargeur pour tout g√©nial!Il faut Bien placer le iPhone sur le chargeur rapide
5,Very convenient compact
5,Great product easy to use.
5,Works amazing definitely worth it!
5,Buy it!
1,I change my review the first product doesn‚Äôt work and the company replaced me but still the second product doesn‚Äôt work either I sent another email and they even answer don‚Äôt buy it
2,It doesn't work well for iPhone 12 or Apple Watch. The phone charging part is intermittent. There is a bug if you have an iPhone 12 where you have to restart your phone frequently to get the charging part to work.
5,Bought this for my daughter who regularly charges her iPhone AirPods and Apple Watch at the same time. Works exactly as intended and has a small footprint. No issues at all.
5,I have purchased other charges and returned them all..... this was the first one that truly looked nice came fully equipped and worked well!!  I would buy this again!
4,There are only 2 lights to show that the items are charging.. It would have a betterto have one light for each  de ice to be charged. It seems a logical design choice.
3,Le Iphone 12 mini charge uniquement en mode paysage.  En mode portrait la charge fonctionne seulement si le Iphone est sur√©lev√© de la base d‚Äôenviron un pouce.  Je me suis fait rembourser.
1,EDIT: Worked great for less than 5 months and now I get a red blinking light when I plug it in.  Another piece of electronic crap.I had been looking for a charger like this for a while but wanted it for my bedside table so was concerned about the indicator lights being bright.  This charger has very small lights that point upwards so they aren't disruptive at all.  It seems to be doing a great job charging my iPhone 11 and my Apple Watch.
4,This is a very nice charger. The build quality seems to be good as well. It did charge my Iphone 12 Pro but only when it was out of the case. It did charge my Iwatch3 at the same time. I found the charging speed to be fairly slow as well. So if you have a thin case or no case you will likely be happy with this charger. I am using a Gear4 Battersea case.
3,Works great for my apple series 3 watch. Struggles to charge my iPhone 11. Constantly stopping then starting. It looks good works well for me watch a good stand for the phone while I‚Äôm working at the desk but would not buy again
2,Product works half the time i will usually get a flashing red light and my iphone 11 would not charge. It serves as a good phone stand just a shame it doesnt work majority of the time. Even happens with the apple watch too
5,This product works great and has enough power to charge all three (AirPods phone and apple watch) at the same time. Added plus that it comes with its own compatible wall charger (some other products on amazon require you to get your own). Highly recommend!
5,Great product. Love the simple clean design. One cord and charges all 3 devices. Helped clean up the clutter on our night stand. Very happy with this product and would highly recommend. Worth the price.
4,Delivers as mentioned. Practical lights to ensure devices are in place. Charges through my slim case with no issue. Sturdy and ideal sleek design - for those who mind the side-by-side setup.
3,Returned the product aince the charging was very slow on iphone 11 and 12 pro
1,I returned the charger because it failed to charge phone and watch fully. It also kept starting and stopping charge all night long causing both items to ding and light up. I‚Äôm not at all happy with product
1,I'll return the charger because it failed to charge phone and watch fully and now is dead after 3 weeks. It also kept starting and stopping charge all night long causing both items to ding and light up. I‚Äôm not at all happy with product
4,Dommage parce que dans l'ensemble c'est bien comme chargeur.
5,This is the second one I bought as I liked the first one
1,Retuning this product.... I have an iPhone 11 and need to reboot my phone every time I want to use it.. ‚ÄòThere is a sticker right on the product saying  iPhone 12 bug‚Äô... defeats the purpose of having a easy charge.
1,Nice design but doesn‚Äôt charge my iPhone 8.
4,Ce produit prend plus 50% en temps pour recharger une Apple Watch s√©rie 6.
5,Product works great.  Charges our iPhone even while in the case.  iPods and watch also charge  easily and quickly and we love how compact it is
5,Love this works very well!!
5,No wires:) very convienant and easy to use. It has the power to charge all three of my devices at once. i have an iphone 12pro earpods and an iwatch5.love it so far
2,Worked well for my apple watch and Airpods Pro but was did not work well with my iPhone 12 Pro Max. It would charge the phone for a short time and then it would cut out and flash red.
5,great value for money spent
4,Super
4,worked as advertised
5,Love it I bought a second one.  One for the office desk and one for my night stand.
4,The outlet plug rings.  I had to go and purchase another one.
5,Great clean/sleek look. Charges all 3 devices just a quickly. Love it.
4,Le seul √©l√©ment que je n‚Äôavais pas pens√© lors de l‚Äôachat c‚Äôest que le t√©l√©phone ne doit pas avoir de protection
5,Bought for the wife on Christmas and she love it
5,I charged my iPhone AirPod and watch at the same time and they all charged quickly.
1,I do not like it ... it charges watch but not phone
3,No comment
5,Keeps everything neat
5,Fast charger
1,Received a defective unitReturned for creditDon‚Äôt buy it
1,Watch part on top does not work on anything we have tried lots of watches
5,Like that phone and watch can be charged with one cable and charger
5,Great product works really well.
4,Bought it as a present.
1,Stopped working after 1 month of use
5,Personal use
5,Great product!
5,The product worked like it showed which is great
2,Not working with iPhone 12 Max Pro
1,Have a problem for charging
5,Cadeau
2,Product seems well built but it‚Äôs not a fast charger‚Ä¶ my brand new series 7 Apple Watch takes forever to charge whereas when I use my supplied charger I get a full charge in less than an hour from 10%..my phone won‚Äôt charge but holds its battery life at a constant when I‚Äôm using my baby monitor where as when I plug in normally and use the baby monitor on my iPhone it will charge to full my phone also gets hotNot super happy with the purchase
3,Will not charge all 3 items at one time. Can only handle charging 2 at once.
1,I‚Äôm so sad because I loved this thing when I received it - it charged all 3 devices and has a small footprint ‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôve had it now for a couple of weeks and it has started to overheat when charging either my watch or (more annoyingly) my iPhone 12. I use it with the correct adapter provided so I‚Äôm not sure why it‚Äôs doing this now. Too expensive to keep if it‚Äôs not working perfectly so I‚Äôll be returning it.
5,Sellers are amazing they really care about their customers. I had to reach out because my charger wasn't working. They right away offered me a new charger or a refund.
1,They obviously never did user experience tests!  When my iPhone 13 is on the stand the base obstructs the microphones so I cannot talk with the hand free Speaker which is one of the main reasons I bought this Charging Station in the first place. I am sending it back right away for a refund!

Everything works fluidly and it also charges even with my case on! I can type while it‚Äôs charging too which is a bonus. Also looks really clean with my set up.

5,Avec l‚Äôachat de mon nouveau iPhone 12 Pro Max mon ancien chargeur ne fonctionnait plus bien. J‚Äô√©tais oblig√© de charger √† la vertical. Je m‚Äô√©tais assurer dans les commentaires qu‚Äôil allait fonctionner avec le nouveau 12. Effectivement tout fonctionne parfaitement Autant pour le 12 Pro max Apple Watch six et les AirPod du Pro. Je la recommande sans h√©siter
5,Works great!. The rubber-like covering makes the grip to the phone and gadgets very stable. Tried charging iPhone 11Pro apple watch and samsung earbuds at the same time and it is charging very well. Sleek and very well designed
5,This works great and as described. Quickly charges my phone with the case on my watch charges neatly on top. Charging is quick and has saved the spaghetti look of having too many cords on my nightstand. Assembly was also super easy. I am 100% satisfied with this case and would recommend  it to friends and family.
5,I bought this triple charge for my wife and she has been using it for 7 weeks and she loves itNo issues with it so far She usually charges her iPhone and Apple Watch at same time but hasn‚ÄôtFound any charging time drop when charging both
5,Tester avec iphone 12 pro max et iwatch 4  fonctionne bien
5,I did not realize I need this product till I saw it. It eliminates the clutter and charges my Apple products seamlessly.Fast shipping and I am very happy with my product. It also looks sleek.
3,Just bought this wireless charger. It charges my iPhone 12 Pro just fine but my Apple Watch Series 4 is charging way too slow. I used to charge my watch up to 100% at night easily with the Apple Watch charger but not anymore. I get maybe 60% at best for the same charging time. I will do some other tests and return it if it keep doing this.Edit : After some tests it‚Äôs clear that this charger doesn‚Äôt charge the Apple Watch correctly. It can charge up to 100% but the watch lose its charge very fast. This morning when I woke up the charge was at 100% (it was at 73% after having to recharge it at the beginning of the evening; that never happened with the Apple charger) and now after being up for less than an hour the watch charge is at 68%!). Something is defenitely wrong with that part of the charger. I‚Äôll returned it unfortunately.
1,If you use this stand for one product to charge it works great but defeats the purpose.  Never works with 3 and half the time with watch and phone it blinks red and doesn‚Äôt charge.  We really wanted it to charge 3 things at one time so it‚Äôs kind of useless.
1,Does not charge earbuds And no real indicator that is charging except verifying it after a period to see if it‚Äôs taking any charge. Does not work. Couldn‚Äôt test the Apple Watch charger because I don‚Äôt have one. FYI
5,for the price this is a great all in one charger on your night stand with an adapter it is designed in a way to minimize its use of space it does have a nice apple watch placement to charge and at the back you have a spot to charge the your Airpods. The front charging stand is at a good angle to charge and look at your phone at the same time and it does charge on landscape mode which is great if you want to watch movies. I did notice some minimal wear and tear for the phone are but for the price it is something that I accept.

5,Charges both ios and android very fast. Charges both apple watches  pods and phone at the same time and it's super fast. Easy to use. Overall I  recommend this product
5,Charge bien le iphone et la montre mais ne charge pas les IPODS ‚Ä¶je ne comprends pas***Update*** tres bon service a la clientele il m‚Äôont renvoy√© un autre chargeur sans que je leur demande!

Can charge phone vertically or horizontally. I love that it comes with the QC wall adaptor and cord that are needed.Really smart space saving design.
5,Easy to use. It works with IPhone 13 pro and Sumsung S9.
5,good build quality. looks nice. Does its job.
5,I love the ease with which I can put my phone and my watch on this device to charge it. It seems to charge both well however I am not sure that it charges as effectively as the Apple chargers haven't compared them in timing of charge.But the ease of not having to put the plug in the phone or dealing with the wondering Apple Watch little saucer this item has been perfect for me. Been a simplifier and taken away frustration.
2,I purchased this in August of 2021 and it worked really well for sometime. It charged my devices quickly even when I had my iPhone apple watch AND airpods on it. However it stopped charging the airpods and apple watch a few weeks ago and now my phone is no longer charging on the station but will charge elsewhere. Very unfortunate as I spent good money on this product. It could just be my unit but just a buyers beware for any other unit out there.
2,J'avais h√¢te de voir si le chargeur fonctionnerait bien... pour ce qui est du t√©l√©phone c'est super pas de probl√®me. Par contre pour ce qui est de ma montre... ouf c'est pas facile. √áa arr√™te de charger √† chaque fois. Je dois prendre ma montre et la remettre sur son socle pour que le chargement se poursuive. J'ai essay√© plein de chose et toujours la m√™me probl√©matique. Je vais donc retourner mon chargeur et regarder pour un autre mod√®le.
5,charges my phone and watch perfectly.  I do have series 2 ear buds but unfortunately the case is series 1.  Make sure if you want your apple ear buds to charge that you have series 2 or higher case.
5,Five-star performance!  Simply plug and use. Received the product plugged the power and start charging.  Read the enclosed instruction first.  The unit is well made very robust. Looks elegant as well.  I have an iPhone 11 plus Apple Series 6 watch and Apple Air Pro wireless air phone. The three charged ok. Recommended.
5,Had a problem with the initial unit I received.  Apple Watch would only charge to 94% for some reason.  Contacted the seller and they were very apologetic.  They sent me a new replacement right away and it works perfectly.  Very fast charging and great way to organize phone and watch.Very pleased.  Customer service is second to none.
3,The product that arrived is nothing like shown on the site photo. Would have so much  preferred the charger shown on the site photo!!! How hard can it be to update the site photo??? That is why a 3 out of 5. One orders a item based on the photo and surprise it‚Äôs not anything like the depicted photo. Easy to use good price
2,Charger worked well but after one month my AirPods stopped working.
5,This unit does not charge iphone 12 at all with or without any cases. When I place my iphone 12 on it the 2 red LEDs keep flashing and nothing happens.EDIT:I contacted the customer support and they sent me a new one and that one worked flawlessly.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                ¬†Great design works great definitely would buy it again.Update: had a small problem and the seller stood behind their product and was able to assist in a very helpful way.
5,Excellent product. The speed of charge is impressive. I just received it and charged my iPhone and Iwatch without any issues. The place holder for both the phone and watch is well designed.
1,This charger would be great if does what it promises but unfortunately it doesn‚Äôt charge my second generation airpods.  The seller was kind enough to send me a second charger but again it doesn‚Äôt charge my airpods.  I wish they didn‚Äôt advertise that it does so I wouldn‚Äôt waste my money that doesn‚Äôt work.
4,This item works pretty good it charges to devices I put on it had my Apple Watch my iPhone and air buds pro. All works well. There only two indicator lights so at first wasn‚Äôt sure what was charging. Over all I like the product.
2,This charger recently started  dinging all night longAnd doesn‚Äôt properly charge my devicesI wrote this review as I had logged on to process a return but the window has closed
5,Je l‚Äôutilise depuis quelque mois et c‚Äôest parfait !Tr√®s jolie sur la table de nuit  je pose mon t√©l√©phone  ma montre et c‚Äôest fini !
5,Works great.  No issues
5,It‚Äôs likely fast charging and works well
1,Garbage charger it didn‚Äôt work properly when I received it.

5,East to use study as well
5,This product is excellent. I would highly recommend it to anyone with the need!
5,I charge my AIrpods Applewatch and Iphone 13 in a nice compact unit. Love it
5,Compact works great and folds well for travel. Love it
5,I got this as a gift for my boyfriend. He loves it and uses all three charging stations  often
4,I have ordered 2 more for christmas gifts
5,Product is easy to use and very convenient. I would recommend. Bought a second one for the family.
5,Just make sure the phone is on there properly.
3,Neither the watch or AirPod charge works.
5,J'adore ce produit.  Je peux charger mon iPhone 13 Pro Apple Watch et AirPods Pro en m√™me temps G√âNIAL!!!J'en ai m√™me achet√© un √† mon conjoint et mon fils.
5,I can charge my Apple Watch and phone at the same time and it doesn‚Äôt take long to charge at all!
5,Worked awesome with my iPhone 10s  but recently upgraded to 13 and it‚Äôs just not performing as it should.
2,This item worked great for 2 months then just stopped working literally 12 days after the return deadline. So dissapointed considering its not a cheap item.
2,The watch and phone charger works well but the apple Gen 2 headphones will not charge at all.
5,for iphone and apple watch
1,Apr√®s 2 jours  le chargeur ne fonctionne plus
5,The product was as expected.
1,Only had for a few months and it stopped charging
5,Working as supposed to.Item arrived and won't charge the phone I contacted seller and they send me new one. Now it's working perfect
1,Worked well for a few months and suddenly stopped working. Not happy!
3,The charger pad for the phone is not MagSafe - it just rests agains the charger
5,Does what is supposed to do
5,Compact sur la table de nuit. Lumi√®re de chargement discr√®te. Fonctionne aussi bien √† l‚Äôhorizontale  qu‚Äô√† la verticale.
4,This is my second one and it works great nice and tidy looking simple way to just drop your phone on and it starts to charge
4,Les AirPods ne se chargent pas pour les non AirPods Pro seulementBel objet compact
3,It‚Äôs a great idea but periodically it‚Äôll start charging my watch and just stop after a few mins which is annoying
5,Easy to use charges my iPhone Apple Watch and Bose wireless earbuds quick and easy.
2,i purchased in Dec 2020  Less than a year old and will no longer charge phone or watch.  I would like this replaced under warranty
4,Bit early to gauge it‚Äôs sustainable but seems like a great product
2,Was working perfectly then out of no where the airpod and phone chargers stopped working
2,Worked great for the first 6-7 months. Now the charger doesn't work and lights up red.

5,Rapport qualit√© prix!
1,The media could not be loaded.
1,The first 7 days were fabulous. it charged my iPhone 11 as expected and my AirPods. Then today it stopped working altogether. It now produces a clicking/whirling sound the green light starts flashing red then all the LED lights go out and the charging stops. Total junk. Returning- without box without instructions. Just as is. Such a bummer.
1,Slow very slow charging not worth it.Design and idea nice but not for Apple 12 products
1,The device will charge for a few seconds then completely stop. Better to pay a little more and get a brand name items like Belkin. This is garbage save your money. Your time is more valuable and you can not put a price on fustration.
1,I purchased this to charge my AirPods Apple Watch and recently purchased iPhone 12 Pro Max. The description indicates it‚Äôs compatible with this phone and when placed on the charger it does indicate that charging has begun but it was only able to charge about 2% in 30 minutes which is nowhere near the speed I get on any other wireless charger. I imagine it‚Äôs because the charging coil is to low to adequately charge the iPhone 12 Pro Max. Additionally my Apple Watch only charged 12% over the same 30 minutes which is not at all acceptable as I normally charge my watch for 45-60 mins before bed to use for sleep tracking. This would require most of the night to fully charge the device.Incredibly disappointing consider what the description indicated this product could do.
1,Mon Dieu Seigneur  entre l‚Äôachat et le retour et l‚Äôachat d‚Äôun autre modele @perte de tempsCa chauffe tt le tempsNB: c le mm commentaire que je vais ecrire pr l‚Äôautre parce que ca m‚Äôa fait la mm chose !!
5,Produto bonito e realmente consegue carregar 3 eletr√¥nicos ao mesmo tempo. Recomendo.
1,Phone stops charging before completed. Happens often. Cannot go to bed and wake up to fully charged phone
1,This product is not worth the money it worked for a month and then stopped charging my phone.
5,Excelente carregador - simplifica a vida e organiza tudo em um unico espaco! Recomendo!
1,Didn‚Äôt work. Wouldn‚Äôt charge.
5,Perfect item
3,We have 2 of these in our house m and they do their job for the most part. If they are too close to the bed somehow either the phone or watch get knocked off(by our movements at night?)and don‚Äôt charge properly.The other issue is the cord to plug in to wall or extension is not long enough to reach out night stand and we like to have a little room left of cord for better placement. Other than that they work great.
5,Update: the customer service is excellent they sent me a new one and now my watch IPhone and iPods charge perfectly- Doesn‚Äôt work with Apple Watch OS 8.5.1. Watch connects and disconnects all night with chime. Very annoying the charging station is great for the iPhone Apple needs to let 3rd party chargers work.
4,Product remains firmly stableHowever sometimes its power is turned off by itself so we have to plug and unplug the whole again
1,A red light has begun appearing about 1 minute after linking my phone to the charger each evening. I wake up to a phone that is completely out of battery each morning now and cannot seem to get this working again. I am told I am outside of the return window but hoping the company will send me a replacement as I really like the design and the concept would be so great IF it worked
5,Was worried about mixed reviews but so far after two months it still works great! And durable too my husband travels with it so it‚Äôs in and out of suitcase often and no problems with it üëç
5,iPhone
5,Good
1,Would not charge phone through the night. Would see the charge light on when went to sleep would wake up to it flashing and no charge in my phone.
1,Does not work with iphone 12 it start charging for a few seconds and then it stops. It never start charging again
5,The charging time on this is amazing! Very sturdy ans will buy again!
4,Does the job. Occasionally the phone won‚Äôt charge. Displays flashing red light. Just need to reseat them phone.
4,Does what it says
4,Does what it says
5,Le produit est parfait pour les trois appareils apple
5,Good
5,Everything you need is provided and it works really well. Always fully charged over night.
1,Disappointed with the phone charging part of device.  Starts off charging and stops - wake up to an uncharged phone. Watch charger fine.
2,Does not charge a 12pro max
5,Wow
5,So far so good happy with my purchase
5,Great qualitynice design and amazing delivery speed
1,Tried to use as instructed but did not work. Contacted seller who simply wished to have proof of purchase even before offering an apology and possible solutions.  So this is my proof of purchase and plan to dispose of this item responsibly. Will stick with my current wired charging station.

1,I love the look and feel of this product unfortunately it stopped working after about 5 months of occasional usage (it's in my office and only used once in a while).
4,This works as advertised. I can charge all three devices (iPhone AirPods Watch) at the same time in a convenient one device solution.
3,Airpods charger doesn‚Äôt work. I would want to exchange the product instead of having a refund but it seems impossible with amazon...
3,Overall this is a good product and priced very competitively as well.  However I have two complaints one very minor and one not so minor. Let‚Äôs start with the not so minor one: The charging of the watch is very slow.  I just recently got my Apple Watch and have been using the supplied USB-A cable plugged into a standard Apple charging block and it takes my watch from about 35% to full charge in about 40-45 minutes. The watch charger on this HATALKIN took just under 3 hours.  I have done this three days in a row and the results have been consistent. I am using their supplied charging plug which they recommend.  Not sure I‚Äôll be keeping this.Now for the minor issue:  the front of the unit has a label that is printed on (and can‚Äôt be removed) that just says FAST CHARGING in pretty large black letters on my all white unit.  Aesthetically this is just annoying.  That would be like having a laptop with the words LONG LASTING in bold letters on the back of the screen. It serves no purpose other than to mar what would be a pleasing visual form. .
1,Stopped charging after a month of use.
1,Starts charging items then just stops
5,Quelques fois m√™me apr√®s 12 heures de charge ma montre n‚Äôest toujours pas compl√®tement charg√©
4,This worked as advertised for a few months but now it‚Äôs making crazy high pitched noises that drive us nuts.Do not recommendUPDATEThe seller contacted me with a replacement after this review.Very good customer service and we are satisfied with this resolution.
3,love it except for the fact that it said it charges airpod 2s but it doesn‚Äôt charge mine
5,Works perfectly with my XR and SE watch.  Charges fast.  Feels well made too.
5,I really love this product than keeping 3 different chargers for my iphone airpods and iwatch.
5,Charger is great! Handles my iPhone Ô£ø Watch and AirPods Pro all at the same time. Really well made very happy with it.Wish I read the description a little more closely as the power cable is just 1 meter (3.3 feet).
3,love it except for the fact that it said it charges airpod 2s but it doesn‚Äôt charge mine
1,I just got mine and it does not stay on when charging. It goes in and off for some reason
5,No compliant
5,Tried a few of these and this actually works as described
1,This product rarely ever works. Does not charge properly. Don‚Äôt waste your money.
5,I‚Äôm not sure what trouble other reviewers had but mine charges my iPhone XR AirPod Pro‚Äôs and android watch just fine.It‚Äôs not even picky about the exact positioning of the phone.  I used an older system once where the phone had to be within a few mm of an ideal placement.  This isn‚Äôt like that.  Drop it on and forget it.AirPods do need to have the case placed backside down.  Not really a problem.I really like this product.  It‚Äôs 100% as described.  Works great.  Not much else to say‚Ä¶
4,Update: the seller reached out directly and sent me a replacement. I am satisfied with their service and the replacement has worked well so far.I used this successfully for almost two months and  no now when I leave my phone on this charger it drains the battery instead. It shows that it‚Äôs charging but after a few hours the battery level has consistently dropped 15-20%. Overnight it also consistently drops 80-90%. Which is sad because I was very pleased with this charger up until this last week.
5,Tr√®s pratique et facile √† utiliser.
3,The quality was not expected.
5,Been using this charger for a few months and was going to return but missed that deadline..  It charges phone well however my apple watch 6 which will charge does go through a cycle of not charging then charging causing it to lightup and show login code then back into charging mode.** update. after seeing there review of problems above they sent me are replacement unit and it works great both with iphone 12promax and Apple watch 6.  Thank you..  watching reviews and responding like this is a great thing to see!!
1,I bought this stand and it is supposed to work with all of my devices. I go to use it and it doesn‚Äôt even work! I‚Äôve tried multiple outlets and nothing. I took the case off my watch and nothing! Waste of money.
5,Works awesome and even with my otter box on the phone
2,The charge station is very sleek and looks nice. The watch charger works great for a 6 series Apple Watch. . It did not charge an IPhone 12 which is what I bought it for.
5,It works as advertised charging 3 devices at once. In our case this means an iPhone 8 + an Apple Watch 4 and AirPods Pro. The provided adapter is 2A and delivers good charging times but it supports 3A as well which I guess mean faster charging times. Excellent customer service.
1,Um dos aparelhos j√° veio com defeito n√£o carrega o Apple Watch e nem o Airpods somente o celular. O segundo aparelho estava funcionando normalmente mas come√ßou a n√£o carregar o Apple Watch no meio da noite o rel√≥gio ligava e desligava como se estivesse com mal contato na base do carregador e tamb√©m n√£o carrega 100% da bateria em fim produto bem ruim.
5,This does exactly what it says it does it is a wireless 3in1 charger for your apple gear. I don't find it charges very fast but to be fair I had all three on it when I tested it. I love that it clears up space and reduces the amount of wires and outlets needed to charge my tech. would definitely buy again.
5,My first time using a wireless charging station and it will be handy since this station seems quite easy to use.
1,I bought this stand and it is supposed to work with all of my devices. I go to use it and it doesn‚Äôt even work! I‚Äôve tried multiple outlets and nothing. I took the case off my watch and nothing! Waste of money.
2,The device charges my iPhone no problem. But when I charged my Apple Watch it not only drained the battery but it also overheated it to the point it no longer works and now I have to get a new watch.
1,Seemed easy to sue charged everything fine until 3 days ago.  Still charges watch but will not charge phone anymore.  Just another thing to toss in the garbage.
5,Very convenient. Perfect size. Sits on my nightstand and everything is charged up in the morning. No hunting for different cords. Love it
1,This product is made well but the watch charger is significantly slower than the original apple charger. Would opt for a different product
1,This stopped working after 2 months of using and I was outside my window of being able to return. I would not buy again or recommend.
5,I bought this item on April 10th. Today were are April 24th and the unit no longer charges anything (iPhone iPods or Apple Watch). Reached out to vendor who replaced my unit promptly! All is now working and good!
5,Great
1,Looks good and sleek. After 3 use the watch charger stopped working! It‚Äôs disappointing. The phone charger part is really slow. Will not use only for that and wouldnt repurchase.
1,Actually only works for my Apple Watch. J‚Äôen i try to charge my phone it‚Äôs flashes red.
1,I bought this for my husband. The watch portion works but his AirPods wouldn‚Äôt charge and his iPhone 11 Pro Max was not compatible. I was able to charge my iPhone 12.
4,It flashes randomly with nothing on it and won't charge my phone.. wouldn't recommend*EDIT* Company got in contact and sent another unit out. Works just fine! Good customer service.
4,Overall great little charging stand for my iPhone 12 mini and Apple Watch. I did notice the first time using that the phone was flickering charging/not charging but an info packet in the package recommended rebooting for iPhone 12s which solved the issue. I then noticed the phone would only charge up to 80% which seems to have spontaneously resolved. I have found since then that alignment wise it is very picky for the phone standing up but resting sideways there are no issues. This may be because I have a plastic case on the phone however it was not an issue the first day so not quite sure what's going on there.Overall would recommend though compact and a great addition to any work desk and bedside table.
1,bought a month ago and it has already stopped working and trying to get a return with amazon was hell!
3,Not the fastest for charger. Compared With my old Samsung duo wireless 2.0 it said charge in 47 min and with this 1hr 10 min.
5,Works exactly like package says
5,pour recharger tous mes √©quipements
1,Bought this for my daughter for her dorm.  She has used it for just over two weeks and it has stopped working completely.  She is in a different country from me so I cannot even just simple send it back to get replaced.  Very frustrating and a huge waste of money.
1,le chargeur n'a jamais charg√© plus de 15 secondes mon iPhone 12. Il charge ma montre mais je n'ai pas pu tester le chargeur pour Airpod
5,Everything but the phone charger works.... Pretty much useless(Update)They have replaced the charger free of charge and it seems like a newer version and it's absolutely perfect love it and thank you the company for replacing it always appreciate good customer service!!! 5 stars!!!
5,Bought three units each one is working perfect. I would definitely recommend them. no noise fast charging iPhone 12 and 12plus . I can recommend them for sure
2,When it doesn‚Äôt overheat (red light) it‚Äôs great. Takes multiple tries to position correctly for the phone to charge without tripping the error light
1,Ne charge pas toujours. Apr√®s quelques minutes de charger il se met √† clignoter rouge et ne charge plus. Si je ne voit pas que la lumi√®re est rouge parce que je dors mon t√©l√©phone n‚Äôest pas charg√©.Je suis d√©√ßu parce que je le trouvai tr√®s beau et fonctionnel.
2,I purchased this a while back and never had luck charging my iPhone 12 Pro. It would initially start but after a while the charging light would flash red and would no longer charge the phone.Charging the Apple Watch and AirPods have never had any issues.
5,Awesome charges all devices same time light is low glow not broght to shine through the night
1,The charging capability will randomly turn off. I woke up to my phone not charged on multiple occasions until I finally said forget it. The cord that you need to use is also not very long. Doesn‚Äôt give you much wiggle room for placement on a nightstand.
2,I love the design and the iWatch charger worked well but the iPhone charger stopped charging after 30 seconds. Tried with three different iPhones - same result.
5,Good product solid and well made
4,No dislikes so far

1,Worked great for a month now the watch charger no longer works. Would not recommend
4,No dislikes so far
5,Great product sturdy and very easy to use

1,Only 1 out of 3 charger parts is working. Not good!
1,Item was opened on April 24 and stopped working by May 7. Faulty product poorly written instructions and unfortunately since I am passed the 30 day return period it does not seem I will be getting my money back from Amazon. Very disappointing and a total waste. Do not recommend.
1,Does not consistently charge. Will dock and begin charging only to stop charging a few minutes later. We have a few other wireless chargers which work well and wanted this to be able to charge watch and phone but the phone area doesn‚Äôt stay charging.
1,i really loved it at the beginning - i bought this because i needed to charge my iwatch other then downstairs where the charger is plugged into the computer. i figured get this as it charges more then just 1 device. of course it stopped working after the return expirary. couldn‚Äôt find a way to contact seller as i can‚Äôt go to the return as the window is closed. my iphone still charges but not my iwatch. going away on vacation so i guess i‚Äôll have to just get a different charger cord
1,The part to charge the AppleWatch stopped working after less than a month of use

1,My AirPod Pro charges and my watch charges so it‚Äôs not a problem with connecting the top half to the bottom. But my phone doesn‚Äôt charge either vertically or horizontally and I made sure to follow the instruction manual. I removed the case I restarted my phone etc. I emailed customer service and they just reiterated what was in the manual and when I said this they stopped replying. So I‚Äôm returning it. Would‚Äôve been a great product if it worked but it doesn‚Äôt.
1,This is the second unit we‚Äôve purchased. The first one is great. It works fine with the iPhone 12 watch and AirPods. The new unit however does not work with the iPhone 12. I have restarted the phone tried airplane mode turned it. And every time the green light comes on and then some minutes later starts flashing red. I‚Äôll have to return it.UPDATE: The first unit has now died. STAY WAY FROM THIS UNIT.
1,Right from the start my air pods never charged. Watch partially charged. Phone worked at the beginning but doesn‚Äôt work now 3 months later.  Total garbage
1,Doesn't work. Can't return it. I call that theft.
1,My cell phone don‚Äôt charge
5,Works perfect
5,It is super easy to use and it works great!
3,Takes the whole day to charge an iPhone 12 ‚Ä¶Just ridiculous
1,Not very impressed with this item.  Broke after 3 months and won't charge any of my items (iwatch airpods iphone).  worked fine before this although seemed 'touchy' when it comes to the placement of a device for charge.  Anyways not impressed that it only last 3 months contacted the gmail account on the sticker which is one the device for a refund will update my review with their reply.
4,It is impossible to tell if the iPods are being properly charged.
2,The noise that it makes when nothing is connected to it scares me it‚Äôs almost like it will explode. Not sure if they are all that way or just the one I bought.
3,Mobile charger is fast but watch charger is way too slow on it no complain but its good overall
1,Don‚Äôt buy this If you have an iPhone mini doesn‚Äôt charge appropriately as the charger blinks to redI‚Äôve messaged the company regarding the issue but no support was provided. I‚Äôm sure it works fine with other devices
4,Working ok
5,Quick and easy to assemble and works great.
2,While I am charging my iphone 12 pro it will start working but half way through the charge it will blink red and stop charging. Its not fun when going to bed I put my phone on the charger and I wake up and its only half charged. It charges my iwatch and airpods fine.
5,Works extremely well for your iPhone and my Apple Watch
5,My previous charger didn‚Äôt always work unless everything was centred just right but this charger works every time. The magnet on the watch charger slides it into place and all three chargers work at once.
4,Good charger so far. The only disadvantage I've come across is the phone case needs to be removed to charge. Arrived on time.
4,Atende a necessidade
1,Bought this for my partner and after a couple of charges the phone charging area stopped working. Extremely disappointed
1,Does not work for my phone in its case and takes like 4 hours to charge my watch. Will buys something different for sure very disappointing for this unit
1,It seems to charge watch and iPhone but when the charger is plugged in it makes a continuous whirling sound that is very disruptive when charging your devices at night.
5,No dislike love it best at charging my two things
5,Awesome sturdy and works with supplied charger ordering another one for work üá®üá¶üá®üá¶üö®
1,I bought this just over a month ago and coincidentally it has stopped working exactly 12 days after the ability to return it....do not purchase this
3,It was finicky with iphone 12 with a apple mag case on had to return...might be fine for others.  I returned.
3,Bought one of these and it worked very well so I bought a second one for work.  Shortly after I received the second one the first one quit working.  This was at 9 months after purchase.  The watch and ear pod chargers still work but the phone charger just quit.  No warning.
