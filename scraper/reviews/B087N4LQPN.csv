5,Ended up purchasing a second one as I loved the first one. Great for gaming. Extremely powerful and no glare worries.
4,Besides being cracked and broken it very good design and I would recommend it just be careful when buying cause it might come broken the package was good but it didn't say anything on it about being fragile plan on reordering at some point
5,
5,I can’t see the difference but I guess kids can?My son says it’s worth it for his gaming pc.It looks cool but personally can’t tell the difference between it and the screen he had before
4,I like the overall design of it but unfortunately the panel is faulty.  I am also having issues with a different Dell Alienware product I bought recently so I will be going with a different brand all together after this experience.
5,The monitor was delivered very quickly which is nice. The solid packaging prevented any damages to the screen or parts (stand/base). Alienware/Dell make quality products and I hope this AW2521HF lasts for some considerable time (might be cheap for some folk but with international shipping to beautiful Fiji I paid a total of about FJ$1300.00) but to complete my machine (have an R11 - was using an AOC 27" 144Hz GSync also very crisp) price was on balance negligible (we live once...at least with current sci/tech). So far I am pleased to say no dead pixels or backlight bleed issues (not paranoid but I first read negative comments/reviews before buying any tech online for obvious reasons - I live in Fiji - shipping costs even for "free returns/replacements" are not negligible). Played a bit of Deus Ex (alas not the new ones with Jensen the old classic with JC the revision version) and also Doom Eternal and while I honestly cannot tell the difference between 144Hz and 240Hz (doubt i'll appreciate a 360Hz) the gaming experience (maybe a placebo) seemed snappier/fresher and overall smooth. Not that I have any complaints with AOC but Alienware is Alienware. Thank you Amazon for being a facilitator and thank you DHL for the speedy and safe delivery. Also thank you Alienware/Dell for your quality products. Hope this lasts (we're all very climate/environment conscious now) so I'd rather use quality tech like Alienware for some time to come (until the next tech leaps). Vinaka Vakalevu (thank you) from Fiji.
5,No la he usado por que estoy esperando algunos componentes que me faltan para Almaraz mi pc pero de la forma que vino enpacada me dice todo… ademas que tiene nvidia singc
5,I had a 60 hz monitor before this so this was a massive upgrade. It feels like I have motion blur because it’s so smooth and it is the perfect size for me.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 It’s a decent size. Even from downgrading from a 27 inch to 24 I couldn’t be more pleased. It started at 60 hz on one of the games in settings when we made the switch from 60 hz to 240 hz it made a big difference. The graphics are crazy you’re able to see much more precise detailed and adjustable vibrant colors. In home screen the background even appeared more animated than the previously used monitor!! What a difference. Gaming on this monitor not only enhanced the quality but speed. It didn’t disappoint at all. Lived up to every expectation!
5,Really enjoy the product works as it should nothing really surprising. 240hz 1080p just as advertised.
4,Purchased this monitor to replace an older HP monitor that kept losing it's HDMI connection. Not a misprint. The HDMI cable was fine I know this because I tried using a couple of other HDMI cables that I have that are working on different TVs.  It was the monitor that kept intermittently losing its connection.  Granted the HP Monitor was getting close to 5 years old.This monitor has a faster refresh rate and also has a USB hub built-in. I have been using it about 3 months and it works really well I am using the same HDMI cable that I was using previously. I am also taking advantage of the hub as I have a wired keyboard/mouse combo that I prefer using and a webcam connected to it.
5,My last monitor I purchased was in 2007 and when I rebuilt my system I bought all new to include this monitor.At first I bout a 27 inch monitor from a walk in store because it was the only one the store had.  I never thought there would be a shortage of monitors.  Then after I bought it realized it was notGysnc since I have an NVidia card.  The 27 inch was way to big anyway.  Way to big to use for desktop gaming.  It was 4k and actually really nice though.I returned it and spent  a few days scouring reviews what kind what size and it was an endless task.I play pc games and as one site mentioned anything bigger than 25 inches was too much to play desk top gaming.  I don't do xbox.They were right and although this measures actually 24.5 roughly call it a 25 inch monitor.  I am so glad I didn't buy anything bigger.  Your field of view can't cover it all.Color is great solid and no need for me to adjust it.  A very solid base nothing flimsy about and I love that I can turn off the back lights that everything seems to have mice modems keyboards and now monitors.  Enough with all that.  The box and packing was unlike anything I had every seen a quality job and very nicely done.The only thing I jibber about is the cost.  A bit high but if it lasts me as long as my 20x20 square NEC monitor did it is money well spent.  I am not into labels or names but I appreciate that Alienware didn't go all kid like on displaying it.  It's a good display without marketing for young kids but shows it in a classy way.Cables hide well with a built in organizer and the adjustment of raising and lowering is nice too.  I think it is very solid the exact size for desktop gaming and colors have been very nice and clear.  I am glad I bought this.  I am surprised how hard 24-25 monitors are to find.  This came with appropriate cables too unlike some vendors you have to go buy the optional cables.  Packing is some of the best I have ever seen.I wanted to give this 4 stars taking one off for price but considering I really like this cost wasn't so much a factor to take a star off unless someone can tell me there is a generic version of this for much less money.
5,Very happy with purchase
4,If you want the 1ms response time on this monitor you'll experience serious ghosting unless you also enable free sync. Overall the monitor is fine just something you should know before you buy.
4,I may have been a little too hard giving this 3 stars. It's possible I got a less than perfect display as every monitor has a different manufacturing variable so I may have gotten a lemon. Mind you I got this on the cheap--only $315 direct from Amazon. It has some nice features though the stand is just ridiculously wide and doesn't raise up high enough (had to put it on a cardboard box) The reason I didn't buy the Dell 1440p TN version was because of complaints about color banding which I didn't know was fixable to a degree And frankly TN displays are getting replaced in favor of better technology. Both IPS and VG displays are improving rapidly these days.The PPI of this one is only 88 and it shows in the current version of Modern Warfare. My old 144hz ASUS VG248QE has only 91 but it looks much clearer for some reason. It didn't support G-sync/Freesync etc which why I went shopping for something better. The 1440p Dell S2417DG TN is a whopping 123 PPI.  Anyway people were raving about the AW2521HF being IPS and therefore better color etc. Not in my case.BTW I had another Dell 27in S2719DGF that was a 1440p with 109 PPI but I sent it back due to my ignorance regarding G-synch compatibility not being an option for Windows 7. I blamed the Amazon description for not specifying that. Now I know better. Sorry Amazon. MS has FORCED Nvidia to abandon Windows 7 when it comes to Freesync/G-sync compatibility. Nvidia said that because every time MS updates Windows 10 it's actually for all intents and purposes a new operating system which creates a LOT of work for Nvidia and they no longer have the resources to work on features like G-sync compatibility and apparently Freestyle for Windows 7 too.This monitor had a SLIGHTLY milky display which I haven't experienced in a long time.  The lighting just seemed to overtake good colors.  I got fed up and went to the Lagom calibration site and to my dismay as I played with the monitor settings trying to get all of the blocks on all of the bars to show up a couple just wouldn't show up unless I raised a setting TOO high rendering the display unpleasant. The only way to correct this is via the Nvidia control panel color setting or Freestyle filters (which aren't available for Windows 7 anymore despite what the driver pages claim).I ran a bunch of benchmarks with 240 and 144 hz g-sync on/off and my old Asus monitor beat it by a small margin. I guess 240hz is a little tougher on my RTX 2070 Super than 144hz.So the bottom line is the image quality (slightly better pixel density) seems to be better on my OLD Asus 144hz monitor. Maybe I'm full of it but I just don't like the image quality in Warzone nearly as much as how it looked on the Asus. Let the hateful comments begin! :p
5,Great gaming monitor
4,if i didnt put this monitor down to 10% i wouldnt be able to sit in front of it very long. It really is bright.the refresh rate is great. but the resolution is only 1080p that is why it is high refresh. but for the price point it is probably unbeatable for FPS and RTS gamers.
5,Not much to say really. The product speaks for itself. It's a phenomenal monitor. And at the price I paid for it I got 0 regrets. If you find it for 260 like I did I urge you to consider the purchase. It's so worth it.
5,It might not be the cheapest monitor on the market but i love this monitor.
5,Best monitor I've ever owned its a good size great picture and with some settings adjustments can make some scenes in games even more beautiful
5,This monitor compliments my Alienware Aurora 9 PC. A few directed adjustments and I noticed a considerable difference in sharpness definition and detail of everything on the screen. This includes backgrounds vegetation clothing buildings characters etc. Perhaps not the ultimate results but for the money I am blown away with the difference from a previous high-end 4k PC name brand monitor.
5,five star
5,I got this specifically for Competitive Call of Duty and it was definitely worth the purchase.
5,Upgraded from a 144hz monitor and I’ve gotta say this absolutely blows it out of the park. Not only for being a higher refresh rate but the interface is SO much more convenient and easy to use. I even bought this monitor used and I’ve had absolutely no problems whatsoever. Also the RGB on the back is a very nice touch.
5,My son loves this monitor.
4,Purchased over the weekend and it arrived a day earlier than expected which i was stoked. Unfortunately it arrived early with a dead pixel which seems to be a commonly noted issue. I don’t think I’m gonna return it since I needed a monitor and it’s not life altering. But the second monitor will not be from Alienware due to the trend I just went with this monitor because of the price and necessity at the time. Still need to hook up to the computer to ensure nothing else is wrong.
5,The monitor is gucci for 240hz gaming if you're looking for extra features that could extra boost you in gaming then no theres no cutting edge features hereResponse time is amazing tho dont use extreme mode its imagne quality drops significantly not pleasing to my eyesIt's a true 240hz gaming experienceOSD software is amazingRGB so bright that could lit your wall in a dark room very nice to seeColor range is sRGB 100% very good accurate out of the box
5,Good
5,This is the first monitor I have ever played on with a 240hz refresh rate so that being said I do not have any previous experience to compare with. I went from a 32inch 2k 75hz monitor and I was a bit worried leaving behind the higher resolution. Due to the smaller screen size this was not much of an issue. There is a difference but due to the pixel density of my previous monitor it isn’t missed. I was also concerned of the smaller monitor size. This was an issue for about an hour of gaming then just faded away into the glorious response time and refresh rate of this monitor.I mostly play Apex MW Valorant CSGO and a bit of Overwatch. Seriously has been a game changer. I can run all these games at around 200fps and above and I have seen significant increase in my gaming ability due to this monitor. Tracking has never been easier.Colors were fairly accurate under my custom setting and I used a calibration tool to get it right where it needed to be but most might be pretty happy with just a few tweaks if you aren’t doing anything more than gaming and media consumption. Every monitor is different in that sense so your most color accurate setting could be different with your monitor. I have not noticed any ghosting and my monitor came without any dead pixels.I was able to snag it at $315 if you’re able to find it below $400-go for it. Again This is coming from a person who had never played on a 240hz monitor before. I may not be the best person to make a purchase decision from but from the many reviews I had read and watched prior to my purchase most have had similar feelings about this monitor. I am very happy with my purchase so far.
5,This monitor is just stunning. The picture quality is superb the max frame rate makes everything feel snappy and smooth and the build quality is second to none.This may be the best purchase I’ve made for my home office/gaming setup. Switching between devices is even made very easy so you don’t need to buy anything extra for this monitor.Absolutely worth $300 if you game and doubly worthwhile if you’ll be working on it as well.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 First off this monitor is a beast in competitive gaming the 240Hz is so smooth it makes the gaming experience so much better. The 1080p is honestly amazing in my opinion picture quality is really clean. This monitor is really great for both movies and gaming. My only issue is it doesn’t come with built in speakers. but Overall this monitor is perfect and I’m happy with it.
5,I bought this monitor to use alongside my Xbox Series X. Now now I don't want to hear anything about "console gaming on a monitor" blah blah blah. My Xbox is a Call of Duty machine and I play most my game on my PS5 on a 4K tv anyway... NOW! With that said this monitor supports FreeSync 1080/120 (higher refresh rate than that but all I care about is the 120hz) and it is perfect for me to get competitive in a good COD or BF match. It has tons of settings and the image is crisp and clear. My only issue is I sit near a big sliding glass door in my master bedroom and the glare during the day is awful. Messing with brightness/contrast settings doesn't help. I won't knock it to the monitor. Just don't get it if you'll have light glaring right onto it is all. Oh! It also has the cool Alien FX lighting witch has a ton of LED color options for the back which light up pretty well against the wall at night in the dark. Overall this is a very good cheap monitor to do some gaming on. Included is HDMI Display Port and USB cables and it has good I/O support.
5,I use this as an external monitor with my 2018 Razer Blade 15 advance (gtx 1060 max q) laptop. Had it for over a month used it everyday and so far no issues. Picture quality is really good and it also gets really bright. 240hz seems a bit high for the games I play which I get around 80-100 fps (cod warzone civilization VI Deus Ex and Titanfall 2). But on older games where I can easily hit 300 fps it is so buttery smooth. Refresh rate can be adjusted you have 60 120 144 and 240hz. The connection I used is via Display Port with a mini DP adapter for my laptop and it's just plug and play. HDMI also works with no issues. Monitor controls were easy to use once you get used to them. I bought this monitor on sale on Amazon for super cheap. And also I plan on building a PC so this monitor is just future-proofing. So far I am enjoying this monitor. My dislikes are that the stand takes up space so make sure you have a long desk depth-wise and the overall product (stand and monitor) being very heavy so be extra careful when you're assembling this monitor for the first time.Overall I am satisfied. Highly recommend.
4,its normal but just putting this for anyone a bit confused and had purchased his product assuming all of the ports work in 240hz
4,My first time buying a monitor and I’m happy with it. Unfortunately I didn’t know that there wasn’t speakers when I bought it; which is ultimately my fault. I’m trying to find some that are compatible… no big deal. Still like it!
5,Great monitor image quality for 1080p is really good. I picked this up for $269 when it went on sale and felt it is worth it at that price point especially if u are like me and play eSports games because you like to improve for yourself. The only thing that can be better this is if you can afford to go 240hz +Dayc which is $500 or 360hz which is $700. 5-star recommendation!Suggestion: Recommend getting a Monitor Mount because of the long base. My current mouse pad is 480x400mm on a desk 27.5 inches deep. I have longer arms being 5'11 so cannot put the mouse pad directly underneath the monitor without the legs of the stand being on top of it. I would have to put it right at the edge of the desk which is uncomfortable for me. So I recommend getting the mount for a smaller base or if u like the bigger base with the RGB in the back either get or make sure you have a bigger desk.
5,This monitor is basically always on sale at around 300 dollars which is a total steal for such a premium monitor.Pros:-There are no dead pixels.-No ghosting at all.-RGB on monitor stand.-no backlight bleeding-The IPS display makes the monitor feel extremely premium.-Stand offers tilt both left to right and up and down.-Minimal bezels.-Easy assembly-The menu on the monitor is easy to access and change with the use of a joystick on the back of the monitor.-Though obvious this monitor does come with all the necessary cables.Cons:-The stand is very big so though it has RGB it would actually be better to get this monitor mounted as it takes up a lot of desk space._______________________________________________________________________________________________If your budget is around this price point this monitor is a total steal. Most monitors at this price point are all 144 hertz and I would really recommend getting this monitor as it both future proofs your set up while giving you the best experience for your budget.
5,After owning a Gigabyte Aorus 24.5" 240hz 1080p monitor that costs 100 dollars more I would pick the Alienware every time. Brightness is excellent gray to gray response time is fantastic. Ghosting even on Extreme Overdrive (1ms gtg) is very minimal and has been shown in various tests to be in the top of its class within the range of other 240hz 1080p displays. The panel quality is definitely there and while I cant speak to its accuracy in color I know it is there from the naked eye as well as seeing others test it. I received mine with virtually zero backlight bleed and from what I can tell your semi-serious sweaty FPS gamer this display has been proving itself to be a top contender out of the many 1080p 240hz monitors.You likely wont be disappointed if you pull the trigger!
5,I researched G Sync compatible 240Hz monitors for quite some time before settling on the Alienware 25. It's really everything they advertise amazing color as smooth as a babies bottom and mine had no bad pixels or washout on the corners. Really why I bought it through Amazon for their return process.  Other than a few tweaks was ready to go right out of the box. I play mostly Battlefield games its running BF5 at around 160/170 in game with a RTX 2070 Super and 10700K. It takes a little getting used to coming from an old 75Hz acer but after a few sessions I cannot imagine playing on anything else. Its big I have just enough room on my desk which I was concerned about but it works. It does put off a bit of heat but I suspect that is because of the unique cooling and vents everywhere. Oh...Dell's 3 year premium monitor  replacement warranty was the icing on the cake even for just one bad pixel - just have to transfer ownership to yourself when buying through amazon - google it pretty straight forward.
5,I had this in my cart and came back to find the price had dropped $70 so I pulled the trigger since the Dell site still had the old price. I had recently upgraded to an AMD based gaming system and needed a monitor to match. Going from my old 17" 60/75hz monitor was like discovering a new world! I'm a casual FPS gamer and this made a huge difference in games like Fortnite and Warzone. The stock settings seemed a little blue to me but a moment of tweaking dealt with that. The software seems to want to turn the RGB FX lighting on when monitor gets turned back on although I turned it off but that is minor. I did a lot of research before buying this and feel like I made the right choice.
5,I must say I was overly surprised on the quality of the monitor. Good weight on the base LEDs look great and its not cheap plastic. Screen looks great true 240Hz as well. For the price I expected so much less. Strongly suggest putting this into your consideration for a new monitor. Have yet to find something I do not like about it. Great product.
5,Huge difference with using this 240hz monitor & using your gaming laptop screen. This monitor is too good!
5,Clear display no complaints!
5,This is my first time to jump right into 240hz. Once I started using this I could feel the smoothness in the screen. The brightness is good and can be tune up to 100%. At stock form it comes at 75% brightness. The screen is an IPS panel which brings best colors for photo and video editing. This monitor is perfect to competitive gaming or use general gaming.
4,A well balanced monitor for the price I got which was $315 on sale. It was out of stock at the time so I had to wait almost a month til it finally arrived.Pros:-Nice OS and controls to tweak settings and create profiles-Good pixel density so the screen is a good size-The color as an ips is excellent-The response time is great when set to fast and super fast but when set to extreme its not worth the ghosting artifacts-Great colors makes it easy to see and has nice settings to tweak the darkness to see easierCons:-Extreme has alot of ghosting-No speakers ig but not really an issue for gamers-Mine came with one pixel dead off the bat which is stupid on alienwares part so its green when on-The lighting is good mostly for the power led and back led strip but there is no white setting-The stand is wellmade and sturdy but heavy and protrudes a little too far to the userOverall the monitor if you can find it for $350 or less then its a steal maybe even under $399 if you really want a good low response time ips for the color monitor is so then definitely pick it up.
1,I would like to preface by saying I really wanted this machine to work and I’m honestly bewildered at what a catastrophic failure it was to me. I looked dozens of places online before I bought this and everywhere I went this machine gets rave reviews. Often in my experience that is the sign of a good/solid product because surely 1000s of people can’t all be wrong but in this case I don’t get the hype for this machine. Never in 100 years did I think I would return an Alienware let alone 2 of them just a few days after I bought them but here we are. Now to cut to the chase-The good- this machine is an absolute beauty and its design is both sturdy and aesthetically pleasing…and that is all the good I have to say about it.The actual monitor quality is where this machine absolutely tanked for me. I work a job where I have to stare at a computer for 10+ hours a day so I need a screen that gives a good quality image. Bluntly the image quality of this monitor is one of the worst I’ve ever encountered. The colors are dim and lifeless and the image is just not even remotely sharp. That’s not to say I didn’t give this machine a chance. I must have spent around 6 hours tweaking the Nvidia controller and the monitor settings to try to get a good image but regardless of what I did my laptop screen looked better. It also bothers me greatly that this monitor cannot produce true “black”. Everything is grey once you brighten the dim screen. Again though I tried once more to forgive this monitor- so YouTube looks a little bad with poor/nondetailed coloration and games aren’t close to HD but hey it's fast and responsive. The straw that broke the camel’s back though for me was the reality that the sharpness is so incredibly poor that I couldn’t even search google without my eyes hurting after a few minutes. Words seem to have a blurry pixel fog around them that is incredibly distracting and hard on the eyes and that was even after I used the settings to specifically help calibrate text.Bottom line in 2021 I don’t think this machine is worth it for the money it will cost you if you care about anything other than the hz. Also check your current specs before you think about buying this. In my case I realized my 15” Lenovo laptop is QHD and has a higher resolution than this monitor which made the FHD 1080 unbearable. I ended returning both of these decided to ditch a multiple monitor setup for now and I now use a single LG UltraGear 32" Class QHD 166hz from Costco and thus far I’m incredible pleased as I got both a bigger screen and much better image quality for roughly the same price as one of these. If you want competitive speed for gaming where image quality doesn’t matter I guess this is the monitor for you but if you want literally anything else (movies work high-res gaming) get a different machine.
5,I’ve had the monitor for a few months now and everything is still looking crisp. The design is sweet and the picture quality matches. Elden Ring looks so good on it!
5,I purchase it on sale for $199. It’s a backup monitor for when I’m working from home at my mom’s place. It’s mainly used in a day to day by my brother with his Xbox one. Even on a last gen console it looks great! He no longer uses the family tv as it looks nowhere near as good.Yet to try it with my own pc.
5,I bounced around several monitors till I finally tried this one. Yes the price point is high but you get what you pay for and with Amazon you can try it out and if it doesn’t work for you just return it to you local kohl’s. This is by far the best monitor I’ve ever tried.
5,Nunca me avía sentido tan satisfecho con una compra. Mi gente este monitor es otro nivel el free sync premiun integrado es asombroso. Toda la tecnología que trae para mejorar los juegos es una pasada... recomendado mi gente
4,The alienware monitor is on the right side in the pictures)pros:-Phenomenal gaming monitor. I get reliably high frames-screen doesn’t tear or have blur. It does what it it’s supposed to do. Having 240fps is next level.-The monitor is nvidia g-sync compatible (big plus)-I mounted it with the vesa mount works and fits with the mount.-Good HD picture qualitycons:-the stand is protruding and too big in my opinion. I have mine mounted so it’s no issue but if you are planning on just using the stand it is a bit big.-Monitor’s picture is not as bright as I’d like it to be I had to tinker with the color/brightness for a while get it where I liked it. I ended up getting a configuration I liked using the nvidia control panel through my pc to adjust this monitors brightness/picture.
3,terrible monitor ghosting. If you know what that is dont buy it (unless you dont game seriously but you are looking for a 240hz monitor so..
5,This monitor is perfect has all the settings for fps gaming trust me.
5,Glad im not blind because i am now. so many htz
4,I really love the smooth 240hz gaming monitor it feels so good to play with in game but I had a slight issue when I was unscrewing one of the screws on the back panel to mount it to my triple monitor stand one of the screws somehow fell into my monitor there’s like a whole I believe for airflow in the monitor on the back and it fell through that and I couldn’t get it out all I could hear was a rattling noise when moving the monitor around so I took the back panel of the monitor disassembled it and I still couldn’t find it so I’m assuming the screw got stuck in the more motherboard part of the monitor even deeper down which really sucks cuz now I’m missing a screw and it’s stuck somewhere in my monitor overall it’s a really good monitor though besides what has happened
5,This is very durable it’s base is made out of strong Steel and the monitor is self is made out of strong plastic I’ve had no problems with it for the last 2-3 months of owning it the Colors on it are very pleasing to look at (when colors and brightness is tuned up to max and with other adjusted settings)13/10 monitor for look as well as performance Amazing starter if you wanna spend a little extra money In my opinion and also experience with this monitor it’s definitely worth it.P.S it’s got some clean RGB for those who are wondering <3
5,Best monitor I’ve ever used..
5,I love this product so much I bought two more of them very great quality and worth it if you are a gamer
5,No issues whatsoever out of the box! Assembly was easy and the monitor works perfectly. The panel is a must have IPS is definitely the way to go. This monitor suits anyone into gaming at any level. This would be my go to option any day of the week!
5,Está bueno la neta algo caro pero vale la pena
5,This is a great monitor with excellent colors and very fast response times. In fact as of writing this review I believe it is one of the only panels which support IPS at 240 HZ refresh rate. To be truthful the first one I received developed a dead pixel and I returned it immediately but the replacement has been excellent thus far. This is why I buy from Amazon I know I will be covered and at worst I will have to wait a few days for a refund I'm glad in this case all I needed to do is just swap it for new one.
5,Great design easy assembly no dead pixel smooth 240hz. Response time: 3.6 MPRT with my rig.If you can find this under 250 USD it will be the best bang for bux. Other competitiors lack one thing or other compared to this well arounded beast.
5,Amazing quality for the price right now! Got it at $290  if it weren’t on sale I probably would’ve still bought it. The $400’s is worth what you’re getting. Amazing response time the monitor is mostly the screen and it has an amazing mount which unfortunately isn’t in use atm but when it is it lights up(Bulky piece i might add). This monitor is lighter than my last despite having better specs. 10/10 from me  it’s a steal right now! Mainly used for Fortnite right now and it’s boosted my frames and gameplay with the nvidia gsync. I would recommend buying this monitor.
5,Bought this for my son for gaming and school work. He uses his older monitor and this new one simultaneously. He is delighted and that makes it worth it.  We priced it around town and came back to Amazon to buy because it was the best deal and Amazon handles returns well if something was wrong.Delivered for free right to the door!
5,I got this monitor to go with my new iBUYPOWER desktop. And when I received this monitor I was impressed! The packaging is amazing! Everything is nicely packed and secured. Not only that the quality of the monitor is outstanding too! It’s nicely built and very easy to put together. I really liked the color too it’s a matte space gray which is fingerprint proof. The display also has a matte finish which will get rid of glare and reduce fingerprints. Also since it’s an IPS panel the viewing angles aren’t affected like the TN Panel everything is still nice and bright. The 240 hz and 1 ms response time feels and looks the best. I highly recommend this monitor in every applicable way. Best monitor out there and it’s at an amazing price too!(Alienware.... please sponsor me) 😁😅
5,For gaming this is in my experience the best screen that you can get without breaking your bank. Please do your research before buying one because the refresh rate matters more then the resolution some of the new 4k and 8k screens cost like an arm and a leg bit this one gives you same or even better quality of game play. The only one I believe that will be better then this is when Dell releases their series 7 Inspiron later in the year but i recommend this for everyday and multi purpose use.
5,its a 240hz monitor it came with no dead pixels even though i checked by zooming in my phone to see each pixel great monitor overall and comes with great pacakging it just depends on the manufacturer if u cant buy it just know the price dropped as low as 253 dollars so you can wait it out if you want
5,For gaming its perfect with extreme response time it does look a bit weird but to get rid of it just turn on gsync or freesync
5,This Alien ware monitor was an amazing purchase that I have made and was worth its money. However this monitor tends to fluctuate in price and changes quite often and if you want to get it for cheaper you can potentially wait for cyber Monday or Christmas or just simply install Honey and Honey will let you know when this product goes down in price.
3,Purchase this monitor on sale on Amazon Prime day ($253). I wish I could like this monitor but sadly it wasn’t for me I couldn’t seem to adjust to the 25” monitor after playing months on a Asus 1080p 27” TN Panel. Colors were amazing and Media consumption on this panel is very pleasant but nobody purchases a 240hz monitor for watching videos on YouTube or streams on Twitch and my Alienware AW2521HF did had a terrible overshoot/ghosting on every overdrive setting except the default one. I couldn’t stand gaming on this monitor for more than a hour before I ended up with a horrible migraine my panel also had terrible brightness and contrast and certain maps on COD Modern Warfare where horrible to play with since I couldn’t see anything even if I tweak with the settings. Sadly I ended up returning it since I couldn’t get used to gaming on it.
4,Very easy to mount if you don’t want to use the huge feet and buy a mount for it instead. The quality looks perfectly fine since it’s 1080p.
5,
5,Excellent gaming monitor. Has a plethora of USB ports 2 hdmi ports and a display port. The USB upstream is super handy to save port space on your PC. Up to 1ms response time is super nice. Really easy to configure and setup to your liking. The stand feels very sturdy like top quality and has a good weight to it. The base is slightly larger so if you have a small desk you may want to go with a monitor arm which would be a drag since the base is really nice.. Great for the price and I would recommend.
5,I gave this monitor to my boyfriend as a xmas gift and it is the best thing I ever did. Great quality for the price.
5,All good with the monitor.
5,I've had this monitor for a month now and it has been incredible for gaming. The color for this monitor being 240Hz looks amazing on all games. no dead pixels and no issues with this monitor at all. I highly recommend for gaming. it also came with a display port cable and HDMI Cable.I do use this monitor for work as well and have had 0 issues in that department.Side note: this monitor doesn't have speakers built in. so I have to hook up my own speaker if I want sound.
5,This is a beautiful monitor! Stock picture looks washed out but with some digging on the internet I found the perfect picture settings for this monitor! Totally worth it.
5,At first I was a bit underwhelmed with the picture quality but after messing around with the settings I’m pretty impressed. I have a 1440p monitor as well so I did notice the drop in resolution but the responsiveness and smoothness of the display is more than making up for it.Tip- keep the dark stabilizer at 0 and crank up the sharpness to around 80. This drastically improved my image quality
5,The monitor arrived perfectly packaged to avoid any damage.  It was simple to connect and got it set up right away.  The screen is clear and visible from any angle.  With a 240 refresh rate it works perfectly with my gaming.  I basically play Fortnite some Minecraft and a little bit of some other games and I am completely satisfied with this purchase.  No more stalls as the images run smoothly during these games.  The value for the price is worth it.
5,Great monitor for the price! I had to adjust settings on nvidia and windows because at first it looked like crap bit figured it out and now everything looks amazing
5,I switched from a 32 inch 165hz monitor to this 25 inch 240hz monitor and I have been so happy I have switched. For FPS don't go bigger in monitor screen size. This is the size the pros use and I see why. Pixels look great I even had to move apartments since I have gotten it and I packed it all back up in it's OG box and it still works perfect on my new setup. Will be getting a second one of these!
5,It’s a good monitor for playing games
5,I used it gaming
5,I use this mainly for CSGO and its great with 240 hz refresh rate. Nothing that I dislike so far.
4,What I really dislike was not getting any of the cables including the power cable with the computer. The iO shroud was completely gone the thumb screw for the stand was missing all the wrapping paper was shoved into where the cables would be at but the computer arrived in one piece and it seems to be working just fine it’s just that I had to buy and source my own materials because I bought “used like new” with “Promotional information missing” thinking that the product would still be all together.
4,The picture only looks good on standard mode once switch to FPS it gives me a lot of headache. I use nvdia to make it looks better but still feeling dizz with this monitor. Unfortunately I can’t return it because amazon won’t let me. I regret that I returned aw2721d even it have more ips glow on the left side. Compare with xn253 pg259 as 1080p the aw2521 have reallly bad pic quality.
5,Got this for a birthday gift for my son. He is enjoying it. Looks nice and doing the job. No complaints
3,Stellar product haven’t seen any issues clear as day I just love it glad I picked it up on sale when I was putting together everything for the pc build I upgraded to from a laptop so I’m definitely satisfied with everything.Seemed like not three days after this review a pixel went wild and now streaks whenever there is a bright shade where it’s displaying and is so annoying for a product from a “high end” producer.I got mine on sale so it could definitely be worse but if you’re not picking this thing up at 270 and below don’t bother. Too many obvious issues with pixels based of reviews. If this worsens I’m definitely returning.
5,Este monitor es impresionante en todo sentido su estructura es muy rigida y se siente de excelente calidad ademas de tener una presentación de colores increible más aparte los 240hz y el rgb que lo acompaña es el mejor monitor que eh probado
5,The monitor is overall amazing not regrets buying it and using it for gaming.
5,Quick review of the Alienware 25 AW2521HF 24.5 inch Gaming Monitor. Great monitor and didnt have a dead pixel at all. The picture looks brighter and more vivid due to my phone going into  HDR. The green isnt as bright in person more natural looking in person. In games works as advertised and general work on this monitor is great. Showed a side picture with a VESA mount to give you all an idea of how it looks and the size/depth of the monitor should you mount it.
5,
4,great 240hz monitor that does its job. Needed to play around to find the best brightness
5,This is an amazing gaming monitor. There are 3 speeds that come with it the fastest being 1ms and the other two very little behind. The 1ms does make the game look a little grainy but if you are a competitive gamer you should not find it annoying. The 240hz feels as smooth as butter and the 1ms response time make this well worth the money!
5,This monitor really covers for how much it costs.  Gaming in 240hz is life-changing.  RGBs are built into the back and are completely customizable.  Has great settings that work with NVIDIA and AMD.  I don't really know how different this would be for console users but maybe next gen consoles might see a difference.  Picture quality is great no dead pixels so far.  Took me 2 minutes to setup.  Worth the money guys
5,This is an awesome monitor for competitive gaming. Great frame rates and ultra smooth feel.One short fall is it’s not the best for watching movies or videos but honestly it’s the best gaming monitor I’ve ever played on.If you game on valorant fortnite or COD this is the monitor to take your gaming to the next level!Very happy customer
4,The stand is too big and points out towards the user blocking mouse space for gaming
5,This is the first gaming monitor and I'm very happy with how it works. And also it looks cool
4,
5,What's not to like about this monitor.  Quality build great picture and stylish looking. My kids love it.
5,
4,The monitor is perfect I just have one “problem” with it it has a dead pixel if you see the monitor for first time you won’t notice but now that I know where it is is very annoying
5,I purchsed this monitor in july and I have to say it is by far exceeded my expectations
5,I got this monitor near last Christmas. Ended up getting the 27 inch. Best monitor I’ve ever used. Perfect for the price. Color is a little washed out but nothing to get even a little disappointed or upset about. Also it’s very sharp looking. Nothing was missing or scratched up or out of place. Perfection. Highly highly recommended.
5,I use this monitor for everything not just gaming.  Console gamaing PC gaming and using editing software.
5,If you pc can push over 150 FPS in some games you want to make the jump to 240hz monitor. This was one of the best bang for your buck options I could find on Amazon. So far it’s perfect. Do wish it had a speaker. FYI playing COD GTA5 and Sea of Thieves mostly.
5,Bought the AW2521HF as I wanted a speedy IPS panel. I'm currently on a Xbox One X but am getting a PC shortly. Super easy to assemble with no tools required. Getting 1080p @120hz and games run incredibly smooth and look fantastic. I mainly play shooters and cannot wait to get my PC to try the 240hz. Packaged incredibly well by Alienware also. Really screams quality and performance
5,Its a great gaming monitor. it was very easy too setup ive had zero issues with it so far. It was big upgrade from my old monitor from 2013. so Amazing product especially at the price you cant beat it
4,the picture is complete trash out of the box with some adjusting it looks mint
4,There was no shipping weight given on the Amazon page it only says 7lbs that's the weight of the screen but the stand is a whopping 21lbs so be mindful when shipping. The monitor itself is really good but the colour calibration is severely lacking. If you play fps games stick to the FAST preset less visual drag is seen (ghosting)
4,Overall great monitor if you’re looking for an IPS display 240 hz and 1080p. Unfortunately had to return this because the base sticks way too far out my desk..
5,I loved this monitor best experience. I went from a 144(165) monitor to this 240hz  and the differences amazed me. I could see people faster than they see me on games like Call of Duty and Fortnite and many other pc games. This monitor feels like cheating in a sort.
5,I bought this when it said “Temporarily Unavailable”. It arrived three days later!! Great 240hz monitor! I have it hooked up to my Alienware Area 51m Laptop connected through the DP (Mini-DP to DP cord bought separately). Operates as intended! Came in a very secure box that also made it a breeze to setup. I love the cable management built into the stand along with the RGB lighting on the stand that I have matched to my laptop. Looks great!
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I wouldn’t say this is a bad review. It’s a great monitor for gaming and there was no scratches etc. But during my process of recording it begin to show multiple lines and now the screen is fading. The product was under very good condition. I hope that you guys test these items for at least two weeks or to a month. Especially for consumer who is spending 200+ it’s important and dreams matter lol
5,Received the package on time but noticed a 2" scratch that I couldn't even feel with my finger so I requested a replacement. It took me 4-5 days before I could get to Kohl's to return the monitor but by the time I got back from the drop-off the new monitor had already arrived and it looks great. The Kohl's drop-off process was super smooth as well.
5,The detail on this monitor is awesome! I have Alienware laptop that I though was great (and it is) but this monitors detail was even better! Highly recommend. I play apex on it and love it
3,The background color is more grayish. Not dark enough.
3,This monitor is the perfect hardware for gaming at 240ms! It has a very cool design and the stand is extremely well quality! However after just a few weeks I've noticed that a few dead pixels have popped up... I'm not entirely sure whether they were there when I got it or if it is a recent development but either way that is not a good quality for a gaming rig.
5,Great for ps5
4,very good for online gaming.
5,Don’t get it twisted the bad reviews are rare  mine came perfect and the 240 hz shines perfectly  worth the price
5,amazing for fps
5,You need to have this monitor!
5,For entry level gamers this screen is the best in its price range.
5,I got a warehouse deal with damaged box and couldn't be happier. The monitor itself came in a pristine condition. The picture quality is great. If you're an average user and not a graphic designer or someone who works with high-end monitors on daily basis you're gonna love it.
5,Perfect for pc gaming! no hdr but 240hz at under $300 makes it well worth it (p.s best looking gaming monitor )
5,This is an amazing gaming monitor!! The value you get for the price is incredible!! Looks great image quality and colors are amazing and most importantly you get 240 hz so you can play fps like Call of Duty and be able to quickly react. AMAZING JOB Alienware!! Totally recommended!
5,Super bright and the 240hz adds so much to the overall immersion of gaming. After playing on a monitor like this not even your TV can make your games look this good. 👽
5,Great quality. Perfect size for gaming.
5,Excelente producto
5,Love it. Been using it for 3 months. Have already recommended to my friends and would 100% buy it again. I use it as my main gaming monitor now and my 144hz is my second one
5,The screen is perfectly sized for competitive gaming and the picture quality is amazing for 1080p. Satisfied with my purchase only complaint is the monitor sticks out a little bit so if you have a smaller desk you may not like this monitor because it's not adjustable horizontally.
5,best monitor ive owned yet
3,... In a monitor but a crosshair. It needs to be less money and it's kinda dark image wise. Unless you watch the back of the monitor often it doesn't matter to me to have the alien on the back. It is also heavier than others it's size. If you play ps5 240hz is pointless because the console caps at 60hz to level the playing field. So it's monitors at less cost to play on 60hz. So it's not worth buying unless your a PC Gamer
5,The reaction time is super good it feels amazing while playing
5,High refresh rate.  Low response time.  Crystal clear smooth effortless gaming.  Very color accurate.  This is a GREAT monitor!!!  Perfect for a PC gamer.  My son loves this for his new gaming computer and raves about how much better it is than his older monitor.
5,This item was all  it said it would be.
5,Es un excelente monitor para gaming y multimedia la calidad de imagen es increíble y la fluidez de la pantalla 🤩
5,this monitor has improved my gaming  experience and made me so much better at my games
5,Love this monitor gaming at 240hz is awesome! Great price!
2,This monitor is everything it is advertised and I mean that with a grain of salt. This monitor was non stop issues for me. If we're talking picture quality its bright but not as bright as my ASUS monitors. The colors are dull. Not a fan of this monitor. Keep in mind I had a triple monitor set up and it just stood out like a sore thumb to me.If we're talking gaming this thing constantly shut off with black screens that lasted about 1-3 seconds. Everything I researched said it was an issue with the g sync. I had a 165 hz g sync monitor before that never turned off. This is the last time I buy a freesync monitor that is "g sync compatible". Non stop issues. I even edited the resolution with a custom resolution utility and it didn't fix it. Numerous DP cables 1.2 and 1.4. Nothing worked. Had enough returned it.
5,Buy it for the great specs love it for that and the aesthetic. With 240hz my gardens in stardew valley will flourish and maybe I'll get better at counter strike..
5,This was very good and it is great for new players who are trying to get into 240hz gaming I honestly recommend it and it’s also a great price for a high quality 240hz monitor
5,Such a major difference from 60hz I can’t go back anymore
2,I've only had the monitor for 4 months before this incident. Monitor settings were well below max brightness response time on normal etc. Nothing notable to decrease life expectancy so drastically.I went outside with my huskies after watching some videos and spent maybe 25 minutes trying to get them inside. By the time I'm in I come to my pc and am greeted with an entire burnout.Originally I thought it was a great deal and maybe it is and I got the bad end of the stick- but I may as well post this on the off chance that I'm not alone and others are experiencing the screen burns as well.Mid-Review Edit: The pixels have settled? The screen burn that was present went away over time and I'm at a loss for words. Maybe the temperature of the environment had impacted the monitor in some way? I'm adjusting my rating but keeping a close eye on this thing.
5,Me parece un excelente monitor el panel IPS hace que se vea todo casi perfecto no le veo ningun defecto luego de 2 meses de uso y no lo venderia por nada ! A parte de ser lo mas hermoso que vi en la vida.
5,You have to change the settings to find which you like best (colorsatbrightness)... thats the only con I can think of.. Love this monitor!!
4,It is a very great gaming monitor. The only downfall I have found is that it has no sound unless you have your own speakers.
5,This Monitor is very good. I love it! I use it for gaming and it blows the TN panels out of the water I used to use. IPS low input lag is the way to go 100%.
5,Amazing and beautiful display!!! Glad I picked this up. I’ve had it for a few weeks now and have not had any issues. 👍👍👍
5,
5,Next day!!! Lol unreal how fast this was!! It is perfect. My 14 year old was thrilled for his bday!! Thank you guys and girls!!
5,Perfect monitor for gaming at high FPS
5,If it had speakers it would be the perfect monitor
5,Wonderful piece of technology. coming from a 60hz 1080p tn budget panel from my old setup major upgrade. performs well and do not have any cons.
5,I love this monitor a little on the pricey Side but worth every penny.
5,My son was very happy with this monitor.  Works perfectly for gaming!
5,I love this product!
5,Best monitor for gaming
5,Timely manner and works great.
5,This is perfect for my stream set up
5,Perfect monitor size for gamers i love the design  the built in usb ports i can charge my phone  accent lights in the back of the monitor makes it look moresick in the dark .
5,Buy it. Its my first and last gaming monitor. Dont think il ever be looking for anything else. Its perfect
4,The monitor is awesome but unfortunately my model came with a dead pixel. I returned it and hopefully my next one is okay. Other than that this monitor is fantastic.
5,5/5 Excelente
5,Overall it is a good gaming monitor but it has some blinking problems when you changing the respond time to faster one.
3,Used for one month and a DEAD pixel decided to show up right after the return deadline hit.. very upset.
4,Nice monitor
5,Good for gaming picture quality greatBrightness setting very easy!
5,Such a great monitor. It’s so crisp and clean especially playing games on high settings.
5,By far the best monitor I have ever owned you won’t be disappointed in this purchase
5,Perfect for FPS games.
5,It looks nice
1,Ok so I realize that this probably isn’t the manufacturers fault but I’m still pretty mad. So I got this monitor when it was on sale and it was BEAUITFUL when I got it out of the box but then I realized something. THERE WAS A CRACK STRAIGHT THROUGH THE SCREEN! And when I say a crack I mean a Grand Canyon sized crack. So anyways that sucked but what sucked even more is that when I returned it I did so before the sale ran out just so I could get a new one. But they wouldn’t refund me until the sale ran out! Not even joking I got the money just as the sale got done and didn’t have enough to buy it full price. So f u Alienware!Also if u wanna monitor I suggest an acer one they have one with the same specs for cheaper I think and it’s a curved 27inch.
5,Simplemente hermoso monitor.
5,fast color accurate just make sure you have the hardware to handle it.
3,Picture quality is great and doesnt cause too much eyestrain. (Doesnt feel like PWM)The monitor stand works well but wish it was smaller. It has a large footprint.It makes a buzzing noise when on... sometimes it gets loud.
5,Amazing quality. Great picture.
4,Great accessories and screen options but noticed a dead pixel within 2 weeks so had to return it.
3,I plugged my hdmi to my PlayStation but the monitor isn’t making any output noise from my PlayStation
5,Very snappy True 1ms
5,Best monitor
5,My friends actually wanna play video games with me now cuz I don’t suck
5,You can’t go wrong with this monitor if you’re getting into 240hz packaging was secure no dead pixels bought when it was at $315 and would still buy for $399
5,This monitor is fantastic for gaming beautiful colors and resolution. AWCC compatible.
5,very useful and nice monitor
5,New the name before I found this gift for my nephew. He enjoys it very much in fact he replaced his 60” flatscreen for it! Thank you!
5,Great monitor
5,Great for gaming and awesome picture quality! Would definitely recommend if you are looking for a great monitor for gaming!
3,I thought it was a pretty good monitor for 399$ i liked everything except the fact my web browser burnt onto my Background.. after checking reviews I’ve seen a few other people with the exact same issue.... I’d probably stay away from this one guys..There’s a reason it’s one of the cheapest 1ms 240hz 25 inch’s online.
5,Best gaming monitor that money can buy
5,The graphics are outstanding
5,My son loves it. No glare and picture brightness is great
5,Best 240hz monitor for the money.
5,Very surprised how good the colors look and the monitor is very responsive even when plugged into a laptop through HDMI.
2,Purchased this for my sons birthday. As well as the warranty. The screen being cracked with one month does not have coverage. I was transferred various times. I was told to plug it up for a diagnostic. I was told to send a picture. I did and they never respond to my email. I called again myself since I had no response to my email. I was informed the case was closed sorry they never called and emailed back. $400 down the drain and a broken monitor.
5,Me agrado todo incluso el alíen en la parte de atrás me gusta
5,Excelente calidad de imagen recomendado 👌
5,Had to make an adjustment  but works perfectly now.
5,Best 1080p gaming monitor you will EVER own
3,Great monitor unfortunately I was inpatient and bought it for 415$ and now it’s 300$
5,Perfect
5,Been an amazing monitor!!!
5,Surprised this does not have ulmb almost returned it... But with Gsync and 237fps capped this works better than ULMB!Highly recommend!
5,Perfecto
5,Worth the price for a new one but you might be able to find one for around 300-400 used.
5,Very nice Monitor!!! Love it!
5,Love it!!
5,Amazing the picture is marvelous and I would never switch
5,Great picture. Can’t go wrong with Alienware.
5,Beauty monitor
5,Worth every penny!!!!
5,Perfect
5,No input delay
5,:)
5,very good
2,I was a fan of the 240HZ however I couldn't get over the fact that the screen had such a yellow/orange tint. tried setting in the Nvidia control panel and still nothing. I ended up sending it back.
5,Great quality for the price point
5,great stuff
5,My son loves it
5,Amazing moniter
1,Monitor was really nice until I noticed a dead or stuck pixel in the bottom right quarter of the screen within 60 days of purchase. I've had Dell/Alienware monitors for years so maybe this was a fluke. Sad thing is I could not get a full refund from Amazon since it was past the 30 day return window. Needless to say I will be buying my bigger more expensive electronics from one of the warehouse clubs in the future. Can't beat a 90 day return window specifically for something like this.
1,The monitor was already damaged before it was shipped. When we opened the box all the parts were not secured. After installation the screen was very damaged and pixelated. Disappointed because this was a good monitor.
1,I was sold a defective monitor.  Wish they would tell you this monitor is known to be garbage when selling it to their customers.  Absolutely will not buy from this seller again.  Screen doesn't work fresh out of the box.  Doesnt recognize humidity cable or dp cable.  I have the matching alienware dark side of the moon computer.  Absolute trash!
1,It happens but annoying anyways. Don't see any reason for it
1,As mentioned in other reviews my monitor came with dead pixels. I immediately ordered a replacement and will be updating this review once I have received and tested out the replacement. If the next monitor also comes with dead pixels I will be looking elsewhere for a new monitor.Update 1/24/2021: The second monitor also came with dead pixels. Unfortunately I have to return this one as well. I would advise to look elsewhere for an IPS 240hz panel.
1,Waited all week for this monitor to get here. It finally does and it comes with dead pixels. Never ordering alienware again
1,Gave to son for Christmas.  Monitor worked for two days.  Waited on phone for an hour to talk to Dell support just for someone to tell me no one was available for help.  Dell customer service has always been terrible and unfortunately that has not changed.
1,Just got my monitor shipped to me and can’t get a display great! Tried with multiple hdmi cables different power cords and nothing tested them all with a different monitor and they worked so thrilled to get my 240hrtz monitor that doesn’t turn on!
5,It’s is a great monitor don’t get me wrong especially with ips paneling. Although there is currently an Alienware that’s 360hz and ips on sale for 380 instead of 660 so I would honestly go for that instead but this is still a great iption
2,The monitor is great but there is legitimate false advertising on the title. There is no g sync compatibility. And I was really excited to use g-sync
1,I bought this expecting a top tier product. It came with dead pixels. I replaced it with the same product. The replacement also came with dead pixels and a mark on the screen. Dell’s LCD manufacturer is low grade and many of their products have defects. Never going with Dell again.
1,I'll be returning the monitors I bought because they both have stuck pixels. The colors are also weird; everything but standard is blurry. Standard is too harsh but if you turn down the brightness or contrast then it looks really washed out.
1,Pin in back of monitor and mount was busted for led on mount. Didn’t realize until after open and he had started using so pretty much voided sending it back. Use caution when opening and assembling.
1,I had this monitor the same time I had my gaming PC and dead pixles are starting to come up less then a year. I’m just disappointed on how this monitor is becoming.
5,First off this does not come in a box it comes in a suitcase lol. It is an armored like suitcase at that. So don't worry that it got broken in shipping. Second this this is heavy much more than my last monitor. Set up is easy and the picture quality is excellent. I bought this at a Best Buy I like to see things in person ( and my old monitor quit so I needed something quick). I was looking at this and I think a Samsung. I am glad I bought this one works great don't think you will be disappointed. I do a lot of gaming so that is the main reason I bought this one rather that something else. My only complaint is I have a desktop and it sits to the side of my desk which is large. The power cord HDMI cables are not very long. I had to buy a longer HDMI cable so I could run it out the back. Had for about 45 days and no problems.
2,Not worth it
1,Monitor never powered on. Returning and going with a different brand.
1,There is a scratch on the monitor display.
1,After less than 5 month of use I'm getting random glitches and 'marks of death'. It's flickering randomly in game.
1,The monitor was damaged!
1,I think I must have been sold a used/returned monitor. Unbelievable.
5,Ordered this monitor during Prime Day and I was a little wary of the steep discount.The monitor was packaged extremely well. Received with zero stuck or dead pixels. IPS glow is acceptable.My panel has a slight amount of backlight bleed on the left side; only visible on deep black images/scenes and disappears with any shade of gray. From what I can tell this is a minor panel imperfection as a portion between the spot has no bleed. The panel appears to have slightly more pressure applied In that one area which eliminates the bleed there and exaggerates it above and below. Obviously for warranty purposes I can't disassemble it to get to the root issue but considering how minor it is I'm going to accept it.Overall the panel lottery was pretty good to me the rest of the panel is flawless.I have owned high refresh TN panels in the past and am coming from a VA panel most recently.Initial picture quality impressions were not good. The standard preset the monitor ships with is pretty washed out and not very bright. Switching to one of the game presets and increasing Brightness and Contrast to 75 each really made a difference. The contrast is obviously lower than a VA panel but not enough for me to care. I personally compensate for this by increasing color saturation.I'm running the panel with Gsync Compatible on and Very Fast overdrive. I see no ghosting and response times are great. I believe when Freesync/Gsync is working the response time is mostly ignored and a curve is applied to overdrive. This is good overall and it matches what I saw in reviews online. The best part about this is that you don't need to change any settings whether you are gaming at 60hz 240hz or anywhere in between in the VRR range. Set it and forget it! I tested in a game with a solid 240fps and on a demanding game getting 60-90 fps the monitor performed great in both scenarios without any changes. Many monitors in this price range require optimal overdrive settings for certain refresh rates; I'm glad Dell/Alienware took the time to tune the overdrive and eliminate overshoot across the VRR range.I have no intention of running this monitor without adaptive sync but you should know that if you disable it the best overdrive setting is Fast across refresh ranges. If you run Very Fast or Extreme with Freesync/Gsync off you will get significant overshoot (bright white/purple trails behind moving objects). This issue occurs on most monitors and is not exclusive to this one most manufacturers include these "unusable" modes to back up 1ms marketing specifications. 1ms is not even consistent on all pixel transitions on TN panels so it's a really unrealistic claim.If you are coming from a  ~144hz TN panel if you are still happy with the color and contrast of your current monitor you won't get much more benefit from this monitor. If you are coming from a high refresh VA panel you will lose contrast but get significantly less motion blur. This will make you better at games mainly due to picture clarity during fast motion (turns).If you have a 60hz monitor this one will blow you away. The transition from 144hz to 240hz however is nowhere near as earth shattering. While I'm not disappointment I expected more from a near doubling of refresh rate.Overall I'm happy with this monitor and I fully intend to keep it. I have read reports online of image retention especially with static blue scenes but was unable to reproduce them on mine. I sat a "known" site with a color scheme that causes it and checked; nothing. Image retention is not burn in and is temporary (albeit annoying if it occurs). I do intend to try to reproduce the problem during my return window but so far my monitor appears to have been spared.If you get this monitor and the panel lottery rolls similarly in your favor this monitor will not disappoint you.

5,I 100% recommend this monitor for competitive scenes it is literally the best to date at an excellent price.
4,This is a beautiful quick panel and Dell's quality control really served me on this one. I bought directly from Dell at around $384 but with a double 10% discount from my credit card and Dell themselves plus an extra $30 credit it ended up being around $320. I did a decent amount of research on 240hz panels and it seems that while this panel uses the same 2nd generation AU Optronics panel as the top rated MSI Optix panel as well as the overclocked 280hz Asus one they didn't include backlight strobing on this one. Oh well I don't care as I'm the rare idiot that wanted this monitor despite doing pretty much no competitive gaming (it's just pretty and smooth okay?)I love it. G-Sync works perfectly on my GTX 1080 and things are nice and buttery smooth when I'm playing Warzone and Battlefield around 90-110 FPS and even butterier when I'm playing CS:GO at 240fps. Though it's an IPS so no deep blacks here I love the color and brightness. I came from an LG office panel which was the cheapest IPS panel I could find 4 years ago so this display blew my socks off. I'd previously purchased an Acer Nitro XZ2-series 144hz curved display but I couldn't stand the VA black smearing and other artifacting since it was a cheaper panel so I decided that I wanted an IPS display and for some reason chose 240hz. Ah well.It's a little on the expensive side but it gets the job done. I wanted a no-compromises display that was pretty fast and accurate and I seem to have found one in this Alienware panel. My only complaint is that the stand will take up half your damn desk so maybe think about a VESA mount... although I'm sure some of you want the pretty lights. As others have said you could think about stepping up to a 1440p panel but I'm perfectly happy languishing in 1080p especially since high refresh rates are somewhat easier to drive at this resolution.Edit as of September 2021: I have some more thoughts. For one the monitor sometimes shows little lines on certain images that go away later. It's some kind of visual artifact that's relatively well documented and vaguely annoying but it only happens to me like twice a month and only on specific images so I don't really care that much. I do kind of wish I'd bought a 144hz 1440p panel instead but I have also compared 144hz to 240hz and 240hz really is that much better. It's like eye-bleed smooth when you've got something running at the native refresh rate and I tried going back to 60fps once after having used this for a year and it looked like a slideshow. I genuinely can't believe I used to play games like that -- I couldn't hit a single thing in CS:GO when playing at 60fps.
4,Monitor itself is great. No real complaints in the picture quality or OSD controls. Bezels are thin and the power button is pretty bright. The real complaint is the STAND. Idk who on earth though this gigantic crab leg of a stand was a good idea but they pushed with it anyway. I personally have my mouse and keyboard pretty far up my desk (about halfway) and the stand is right up to where my mouse and kb is. Really annoying and it's super wide as well which makes me feel off centered. If you buy this have a pretty long desk (depth wise) or buy a new monitor clamp/stand.
5,In my opinion 25 inch or more accurately 24.5 inch is the max you should go for 1080p and this monitor has all the check marks for that. At a distance of around three to four feet pixels disappear and you view a very bright crisp clean picture. Using a usb-c to display port cable you are able to use G-Sync and get the full 240hz refresh rate of the monitor. The stand feels like it weighs a ton but that results in no shake of the monitor while typing or during game play. And a multitude of adjustments can be made with the stand that is included. But the stand does have long feet that takes up quite a bit of desk space so the deeper your desk is the better. Type is clear and easy to read and the monitor is almost a dock in its self as there are four USB ports due to the USB upstreaming that it provides. It has standard VESA mount so you can mount to a desk mount stand if you prefer. The big thing now is 27 inch 1440p in gaming but if you're limited on space and plan to do a lot of gaming you can't go wrong with the Alienware 25 AW2521HF. Also Dell includes their panel replacement during the warranty even if there is one bright pixel found. Very pleased with my purchase. Cheers.
1,The monitor has a problem i already connected both hdmi plugs and is not getting signal.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 It is broke i want yo meke a return
4,So there should be no surprise that the big selling point of this monitor is the 240hz refresh rate.  You are making a few compromises going with this monitor one being the smaller size 24.5" and the 1080P resolution.  If you are okay with a smaller low resolution monitor and don't need your monitor for productivity or even content creation since the RGB color space might not be wide enough.  The monitor has a great stand albeit it is somewhat bulky.  The RGB is subtle but very customizable.  The monitor is pretty versatile since it support G-SYNC and  FreeSync Premium which is awesome since you will not be locked into just one graphics card.  Where this model improves over the last gen is the viewing angles.  The last version was a TN panel and while it was just as good performance wise the viewing angles were God awful.  Now with the panel being IPS the color preproduction has improved but also the viewing angles.  Now you don't have to sit right in front of the monitor straight on.  If you are okay with the size and resolution my only other problem with them monitor is for the price there is no HDR.  Now this might not matter since most people using the monitor will probably be using it with e-sport titles were HDR is not supported or doesn't matter.
4,Dislike ...image retentionThis is a IPS monitor if u pause anything it will burn a image onto the screen if u have use this for your main monitor and have no screen saver it will burn your desktop image with all icons on to it ... If you do use a screen saver make sure its moving not static like a photo for a minute then another photo it might burn in ... you can  google search this i found a video of it on youtube"" ips image retention " There is a built in program that u can run its called LCD Conditioning.. it flashes different colors for as long u want to run  to get rid of image  i also read u can just turn it off for 24 hours and see what happens ??? Other then this one issue  its a great monitor i use mine on comfort view to cut down on blue light .. If u have a Gsync  pc  then u need to go into the menu of this monitor and turn off  freesync ... The controls are on the right hand bottom side with a joystick to move around the menu .. the power button is on the right side bottom .... It might be a bad thing to do but i do turn off the monitor if i am not using it and turn it back on due to the fear of burning a image on to it ... Now i have game on this monitor for 8 hrs  with no image retention i have watch movies on this with no issue..Dont pause the game or movie longer then 5 mints ..i do recommend this monitor to anyone looking to buy it but just be careful
5,Es cierto la base es bastante grande tanto que me hizo pensar en poner el monitor en un soporte VESA pero ¿Como quitarle parte de su genialidad a esta belleza?...Tanto el monitor como su soporte son maravillosos estéticamente robustos y finos cuál acero quirúrgico.Funcionalmente lo he probado muy poco pero hasta el momento su calidad de imagen es buena tiempo de respuesta casi inexistente viniendo de alguien con un monitor de 5ms y que decir de la taza de refresco una locura! Todo es increíblemente fluido y gracias a su compatibilidad con NVIDIA G sync y AMD freesync no hay inconvenientes de Tearing.10 de 10 felicidades a la gente de DELL excelente trabajo.
1,Too bright. Can’t adjust settings easily.
5,I would like to tell you guys that the website dell.com sells Alienware Monitor for the same price $286 so if you don’t want to buy it from a third party website like amazon you can go buy it from the original website dell and the computer will be perfectly fine I don’t know if the prices are still the same however you can buy it from the website or app that feels the most comfortable for you so yea. By the way the monitor is good recommend Enjoy!
5,I finally got to replace my 16 year HP Pavilion monitor I got from my dad. Now that I work from home 50% of the time I wanted a really nice monitor. I have two laptops (a Dell Inspiron I use for work and a Galaxy Book S)  I LOVE that this has 2 HDMI inputs so I can attach both instead of taking on and off. This also has 4 USB 3.0 inputs (yay for the #) but I am surprised they didn't include a USB-C port (boo)  Setup was not difficult at all and it really looks super cool with the lighting and the looks. My son will probably want to snatch this from me! I'm surprised this doesn't have speakers but maybe those are just the old school monitors that has speakers. Thankfully I have one of those bluetooth speakers I could use for now. It was pretty easy to use the controls at the back and it's nice that I have a way of keeping the wires neat through the stand. My old monitor had those humongous black bezels on left and right and this Alienware does not. You get to see more of the screen. And the picture is really a beaut! Did I saw that already?! Lol! So far I've just been surfing the web watching YouTube and Netflix (and my son has played his Roblox and Bonetales LOL) oh and work :(  <ahem> but yes I totally love this monitor. Oooh and when i was reading some tips and tricks I thought it was pretty cool that you can change the way (screen colors not sure if that's the proper term but you know what i mean) for each app that you do. I still have to read on some more on this monitor but so far as a regular working Mom (with some visual leisure time and son who uses the computer but hopefully doesn't get this monitor away from me!) we are both pretty happy with it. It is pretty expensive so unless you have the extra $$ or it goes on sale - which it looks prices have come down - I would definitely recommend.
4,This is perched next to an Alienware 35" ultrawide monitor and it looks great because it matches the style even though it has a smaller height. The screen is crisp colorful and 240 Hz is super fast. I've played games including shooters like Doom Eternal and with my system everything on the screen is flawless assuming you can reach peak frames per second so you'll need a beefy system if you want to actually see 240 FPS.Even though my main monitor is on an adjustable arm I chose to set this monitor to the side in case I needed to turn it diagonally which the included monitor mount supports. The mount is also heavy and there's no way it's going anywhere once it's on your desk. This is probably the best designed monitor mount I've ever seen.As a second monitor this is terrific although the price is the one thing that is concerning. For hardcore gamers who want the fastest refresh rate available this is close although 360 Hz seems to be the next big thing but they will find this to be an extremely competent screen. If you aren't looking for the fastest frame rate a larger monitor can be obtained for the same price.Overall this is a good monitor and if you're on the bleeding edge of gaming it may take your Overwatch game to the next level or at least act as a solid placeebo.
5,So I ordered this gaming monitor as an upgrade for one of my displays. The good news is that it's certainly an upgrade! The bad news is that the stand is larger than I previously had so now my desk feels completely different ha!This Alienware monitor arrived in it's actual retail box which I'm not a huge fan of for higher priced items but so be it. It worked this time.While unboxing it nothing was unexpected everything went very well and everything was there. Setup went well everything connected perfectly and it powered right up without issue.Once it was powered up that's where the fun began! The RGB light on the back is a nice touch but also pretty common in gaming electronics. Still nice though plus it can be customized!While many displays are working into 1440p this one is still very nice with it's 1080p and if this is an upgrade for you you'll be happy no matter what!The display itself is awesome and provides an excellent gaming experience. Response time is super fast and the display flows so much better! The picture as expected provides a bright and clean experience - if it didn't I'd be rating it 1 star. :)So far I haven't had any issues - no flickering burn-in etc. If I ever do I'll definitely update this review ASAP!Overall I'd definitely recommend this monitor. If you're looking for an upgrade on the lower end of many gaming monitors - this is it! The monitor itself looks amazing and won't disappoint you!
5,This monitor is GORGEOUS. I thought my tv was good until I got this. It so crisp and clean. Everything is fast and smooth on screen
5,I was excited to try this and add it to my setup. The assembly was easy connected with no issues and worked perfectly with Nividia G-SYNC. The colors were so bright and crisp and it really does an exceptional job providing a rich black color which is where other monitors often fail.PROS: - Easy to assemble quality product packaged very well - Minimal bezel looks great manages cords - Works amazing using G-SYNC with 1ms response time - 1080p with 240Hz refresh rate provides a quality gaming experience - Fun customizable lighting on the back - Height and tilt are adjustable to find just the right viewing experienceCONS: - The power light doesn't turn off when the monitor goes to sleep or you turn the computer off. It's surprisingly bright so you just need to actually turn the monitor off when you're done. - It's not 4k which is much more expensive but it still does an exceptional jobI had no issues with dead pixels and it's worked flawlessly for the last month. I really didn't think I would notice the difference of 240Hz refresh rate but you can tell it's a much smoother experience. This is a really great monitor and I highly recommend it the visual quality is outstanding.
5,Great monitor. Upfront for my honest opinion I was able to get this for a reduced amount. It was in great shape upon opening and it tilts and adjusts smoothly. I love the graphics and resolution of it while playing COD on PS4 Pro- and it definitely has a fast response time. This seems to provide better support for my graphics card in comparison to using my LG IPS Gaming monitor (model 27GL63T) that I purchased on my own earlier this year (not as a review item). I do like the LG one a lot so I'm using both monitors still but overall I feel like this one offers a little more support. I haven't come across any issues or anything that I don't like about it but if any come up I'll make sure to update on here. I like it and feel like it exceeds expectations when considering the selling price. I also feel confident enough to say if I had purchased this on my own I'd still be really happy with it.
4,This came in a big box. Assembly was pretty easy and quick. I found it easier to connect all my cables ahead of time before connecting the stand to the monitor. There were enough ports and slots for my needs. The monitor turned on with no issues and I found the picture quality to be bright and sharp. I also found this monitor to be highly adjustable which made it more comfortable to use. Unfortunately the stand was bulky and took up a lot of space on my desk. I wish it was more compact.
5,My 22nd year old son lives at home while he finishes college. He has a large desk set up with a couple of monitors in the basement. His major is computers specifically IT. He's also an avid gamer. While he didn't *need* a new monitor he is very happy to have this one. His monitors were pretty basic. This one has an amazing visual output. The refresh rate is excellent. He didn't think he really needed a gaming specific monitor but now that he's gotten a taste of it he's considering replacing his other one as well. This is a little smaller than what he was using but the quality of the image and the refreshing more than make up for that. Plus he is a fan of the glowing feature!
5,This is my first 240hz monitor and its super smooth. I was previously using a 144hz 1440p monitor and while I do miss the extra resolution this monitor is just buttery smooth.  Out of the box the colors are decent but I did use a calibration device to fully adjust it.  Alienware  did a great job boxing this unit lots of padding and protection. I had zero damage even though it was shipped directly in the product packaging.  I also did not have any dead pixels and have been using the monitor for gaming over a couple weeks now.  The adjustable RGB light on the back of the stand adds a nice glow and the monitor feels very sturdy.Be aware the base/stand for this monitor is massive if you have a small desk.I would recommend this monitor to anyone looking for a great gaming experience. If you are doing creative work / development I would look for a higher resolution monitor (1440p or 4k).
5,First off I know that this monitor isn't huge but it's a really nice monitor. I have this monitor hooked up to my old Xbox360 and the games look amazing on this monitor. It's actually the perfect size for the purpose that I am using it for. I love how the games look on this monitor. It has many features and modes that I really haven't had the chance to play around with yet because I've been enjoying playing my games on the default settings. Although I did turn the brightness up a bit.I really like the LED back lighting on the back of the monitor stand. One thing to note is that the monitor stand is very large and takes up quite a bit of room on your desk.Overall though this is a really amazing monitor and it looks great for games. I would highly recommend this monitor.
5,I’m using this monitor for console gaming so I can’t comment on the 240hz but from a design standpoint this monitor is truly amazing. The RGB light in the back look pretty amazing although they could be brighter for me taste. The table mount works really well and can go really high up tilt or rotate 180° easily and smoothly. It’s also pretty thin but the stock monitor base is pretty big and heavy which I happen to like but just a warning for the possible minimalists. I mean the price is steep but I think it’s worth it if you have the means for a premium special monitor that stands out.
5,This review is for Alienware 25 AW2521HF 24.5 inch Gaming Monitor (Dark) 1ms GtG RT FHD IPS LED Backlit FHD at 240 Hz Refresh Rate AMD FreeSync Premium + Nvidia G-SYNC Compatible Adaptive Sync 99% sRGB DP/HDMI USBIt looks very cool I like the light on the stand. The stand is adjustable and it is very smooth. You can set it horizontal or vertical or any angle you wish. The legs are a little too long which takes a lot of space on your desk. The stand has a nice built-in cable management system.Picture quality is very good images are accurate without angle and the non-reflective coat is excellent it eliminates the annoying reflections on the screen. No more ghosting effect it is super fast.
5,Excellent monitor for gaming and movie watching which is what I mostly use it for. I had no issues setting it up and install was quick. Beautiful crisp and vivid. I highly recommended this monitor. I’ve been using it for about 6 months now with zero issues.
5,I work from home and this was an upgrade to my current Dell external monitor. The refresh rate is amazing and I find it easier to look at because a large part of my job is watching videos for hours.While a bit heavier than the external monitor I had been using I found it easy to set up. A nice thing about this monitor is that there were included cables in the box so I was able to hook it up easily to my All-in-One PC without digging for more cables especially the one that gives power to the USB ports on the monitor.
5,looks great sharp image 240hz is amazing as expected. The stand was a little too big even though the lighting on the back is pretty cool so i have it mounted on a vesa swing arm. Fantastic viewing angles too but the color isnt quite as good as i would expect. The brights are fantastic but black isnt always a pure black and i dont really know why. I dont do any photography or video stuff just games so thats really not an issue  for me. Overall a competent 240hz ips monitor and absolutely worth it if you get it for $350 like i did
5,This is an excellent monitor. Image quality is exceptional and the backlight is a nice touch. The only problem I have is that it looks so good that it makes my primary monitor look bad in comparison. Not Alienware's fault just be aware if you have something made by someone else you might be unhappy with how your old monitor looks if using a multi screen setup.
5,The picture on this is crystal clear. I use it for design work for our business.  The clarity this offers takes the guessing out of a lot of the design work I do.The hardware is built well and is what you would expect from an Alienware product.
5,The best monitor ever
5,Had this monitor for about 3 months came from a BenQ 4K 1MS monitor. My only concern was the fact it isnt 4k but i will say the colors and picture are AMAZING on this monitor. Havent had any issues with color bleed or dead pixels and i will have to say in three months i have used the monitor for a total of 1500 hours. Overall the avid gamer i am and the crazy amount of monitors i have owned this one is by far the #1 monitor ive owned. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
5,Love COD MWF at 240hz with my RX 5700 XT and Ryzen 9 3900x at 240fps
5,This monitor is great for gaming I have always wanted and Alienware monitor but they were too expensive then this came out I just had to cop this is an absolute steal and if you don’t take advantage of this deal your bonkers
1,Alienware isn't the brand it used to be. I have owned two of their monitors for about a year now. The first two monitors arrived new in the box. One of the two monitors had a dead pixel. Not a big deal but since it is a new monitor I asked them to repair it. No problem and a new monitor was sent. The replacement monitor worked fine for a little over a year then started to get vertical banding and image retention. It's to the point where the monitor isn't useable anymore. For $250.00 you think they would have a slightly better useable lifetime. I have monitors that are 10 years old that still work with no issues. So now I have an out of warranty band monitor that is slightly over a year old. Save your money find a better company to buy your monitors from.
5,It's a really good monitor
1,I am so regretful when buying this monitor. I thought Alienware  should have good quality about their product but this monitor like trash. I see not see clearly anything in this screen. I open Youtube and find a lot of HD (1080p)  videos to watch but the quality of the monitor cannot help me to watch HD videos. BAD QUALITY. DON'T recommend.
5,Amazing monitor. It felt a little too smooth at first and going back to 60hz is honestly disgusting and I can't do it honestly.Setting it up was easy (somewhat)Very complicated due to the little amount of instruction. It uses pictures instead of words mixed with images. Another thing is that I spent like 30 minutes finding the power button because the pictures were too confusing.Besides this the stand works amazing the integrated buttons perfect the lighting (RGB and screen) so i could match it with my red/black/white color scheme!
4,It is a great gaming monitor with 240hz refreshing. It will make your successful in any kind of FPS game such as Csgo and Rainbow Six. However the image quality is terrible for watching movies or photoshopping.
5,Detail color spectrum right sized variety of options and back-light. All at 240 mhz! Perfect!
5,Bought this for the PS5 until a 4k 120hz model comes out. Works like a charm for the PS5.
5,Works as advertised.
5,Monitor works great no issues.
5,I think this screen it too big my fat laptop dwarfs in comparison to this 27in monster.
5,This monitor is the best monitor I have ever had … it has no issues at all … it was bought used -like new & it was literally brand new … I plan on buying the 1440 p version of this monitor ..
5,Heavy and sturdy. Good quality but pricey. Bought on sale
1,Upgrading from a Samsung. Although this monitor is newer the picture quality isn't as sharp. And the whole screen has a slight yellow/faded tan hue to everything. Maybe I got a lemon that would explain the yellow color. Tried 'chat' with Dell but they had issues. Tried g sync but still get tearing issues. Says it is compatible but has bad issues. This is either a bad monitor or I just got a bad one.
5,Bought this monitor as a gift for PS5 gaming and laptop use in a college dorm.User seems pleased with its performance. Pricing varied from sellers and matched ratings.FY I - lower price equals lower ratings.
4,I love the fact that they are Alienware. I don’t like my games having to adjust sometimes. I get a message frequently about the resolution even though I have it set to 1920 x 1080. It would close out my games or not load up sometimes.
5,Good product and price
5,good
5,Changed my gaming experience
5,Great 240 Hz monitor. 240 Hz looks soooo smooth. Plus it is IPS so no washed out colors. Good recommendation for the competitive gamer.
5,Por calidad y precio
5,Thanks
5,Amazing default color and overall great gaming monitor I would recommend to people.
5,
5,Great monitor.
5,Its good but i just wished that it would change to 240hz default because i cant change my hz until i get my pc
4,Looks great addition to my 17.3" Alienware laptop with incredible display this is not as good but great.
5,Has adjustable RGB lighting to fit with my blue pc fans. Also has plenty of ports and horizontal mode that i use for reading.
5,good
5,Bought to pair with Alienware Dark Side of Moon laptop...getting close to 200 FPS on Apex Legends...I'm a happy guy!  Monitor appears really well built as well and very well packaged.
5,I got a steal on this off of FB marketplace brand new. Although I only paid $220 for it I’d certainly be willing to pay the $350 listing here.Coming from an older model 144hz Philips monitor I actually didn’t think I needed an upgrade. I simply wanted an upgrade when I saw the deal I got. As it turns out the jump from 144 to 240 is very noticeable. My old monitor seemed to have tearing issues I thought it was more PC-related but after using this monitor my setup feels authentic.
5,Thuu it s monitor is amazing I’ve used it for about 3 months now and this is by far the best monitor I’ve ever used. The back buttons bring up options you can change too. I highly recommend buying this monitor.
5,1080 p is good and that’s what this is but 1440 is better and they need to make a dark side of the moon monitor  in 1440
5,My son loves it works perfect.  Fast response time.
5,bought two they live up to their refreshrate which I've definitely put to the test and set to different rates each time they roll with it beautifully. To be fair I have a great GPU/CPU behind them but they process just as fast as they're given input definitely worth it.
5,loved this monitor!
5,Insanely good quality and if you can get it on sale its suuuuper great if you want a high quality gaming experience
5,my son loves it
5,The screen quality is perfect and the monitor was easy to setup when I initially bought it. Good job Alienware!
5,What is not to like.
4,So far so good haven’t had any problems with it but will update
5,good build quality and solid monitor overall. especially love the rgb light at the back
