3,Not been setup a month and having issues on the log in screen. Password section disappears so have to reboot to try and log in. Not sure if a windows issue
2,Unfortunately the free ram memory slot is not usable and the advanced BIOS settings are locked by factory. If you put a DDR4 memory stick in slot 2 then the computer will not boot.
