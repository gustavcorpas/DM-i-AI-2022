5,I have worked with wiring for a long time and can't believe I didn't know about this tape. Just purchased a used trailer and repaired the wiring to the tow vehicle. Don't get me wrong about this being a breeze because it's still tedious but this tape is so much easier and superior to regular electrical tape that I will never go back. Time will tell how well it stands up to the rigors and weather but it has to be better than what I removed!
5,I work a ton on automotive. These are incredibly worth the price. What a great price too works well. I can apply lots of wrapping tension and it works great. Not sticky garbage like typical electrical tape.Can’t recommend more!
5,Used this to wrap my harness and protect all the plastic liner around the harness. Seems very tuff. Need scissors to cut and sticks very well. Time will tell how long it will last.
5,easy to use easy to cut looks good  two thumbs up
5,Couldn't be more pleased with quality and the look after I was done. I expect it will outlast the truck.
5,Love them
5,Much better than the plastic tape and it looks factree!!
5,The only thing I can say bad about this tape is that you better be sure you're ready to wrap before applying because it's a booger to get loose.  I used it on wire for a manual switch for my radiator fan and it worked great.  I've yet to see how it holds up to the heat.
5,Great price! Great product!
5,Works good for me
5,It does the job as described. Would buy again
5,This is a great tape for re-looming car wire harness. The tape is abrasion resistant and makes the harness smaller as it’s a tight wrap
5,Does what it’s supposed to do and the description is correct. Which is saying something when buying from Amazon these days.
5,Very strong
5,Best tape I’ve bought from Amazon
5,Beats electrical tape by a mileDoesn’t get all nasty with heat and ageRemovableTakes the environment under hood
4,Easy to use good value
5,As advertised!
5,Bought this tape to rewrap 4 wire harness' in heavy equipment / construction atmosphere.This stuff worked GREAT !The adhesion is very good - the pliability is GREAT - the look is amazing (looks like factory work)Seems to be holding up to the elements as well as the dirty / greasy lifestyle of a piece of heavy equipmentQuit wasting your time reading reviews on this product - - Just click buy nowYou will not be disappointed
5,The tape is wonderful I used enough to ensure that no water penetrate to any wires and still have 3 rolls left
5,Looks just like factory stuff
5,It’s a great product to use when making a quick wiring harness doing wiring repairs and when doing a proper wiring harness when using cloth sheathing. If you are doing wiring please don’t use that sloppy and tacky looking convoluted tubing also known as “spaghetti”.
5,This is great tape for  wrapping Car wiring in the Engine Compartment
5,If you've been looking for that fabric-like tape that the manufacturers use this is it!
5,Very useful product! Great value for the money and a great alternative to the original tape that was on my vehicle. Very strong and secure hold.
5,I used this to wrap several extra SAE power dongles I installed on a 2013 BMW R1200GS Adventure before routing them from their mounting location along the motorcycle's frame to the battery. It appears to be pretty tough stuff like electrical tape with a fibrous anti-abrasion top layer. This appears to be similar to what the factory used to wrap the motorcycle's wiring harness. If you're reading this review wondering whether or not this will do the trick I say pull trigger. It worked well for my purposes.
5,I completely rewired my 77 CJ5 and used 9 rolls for about half of the new harness build. It’s great tape. I’d definitely buy again.
5,Sticks good and very strong
5,Im a do it yourself person rewired my own 64 fairlane and found this item here tried it and loved it  #1 it resembles a almost factory appearance to original harness #2 it stick well helps assemble harness wires and give it a more pro look #3 has a almosy 1960's cloth texture enough to say to me  It looks good !  again  a great item  3 rolls per
5,Use this product to retake some wires that I had to fix. It was only a few weeks ago. Will update if it does not hold up. Right out of the package seems to be a good product and worked well.
5,fast shipping and its better than the plastic electrical tape
5,Ideal for use on wiring harness
5,Great
4,This tape works well so far. It's a little hard to find the end to start the roll but it's strong so you can stretch it tight as you go. Coverage is good and so far I'm happy with the results.
5,I like this tape better than using electrical tape. It's easier to use and not as costly.  And it looks better when your done.
4,Good stuff for the price.
5,Works great!
4,Nice product with good adhesive.
5,good stuff i  make a lot of harnesses and harness modifications on LS and Coyote car and truck...
5,with the 5 pack you can loom all the wiring of your vehicle
5,Great product
5,This is not electrical tape. This is for forming wire looms/harness and was just what I was looking for. I found that the fabric is tough and takes a lot of abuse as I was wrapping the wire bundles. Even applying and reapplying the tape several times to get the right form did not lessen its grip and finished look. I will recommend this and will definitely recommend this product.
5,Easy to work with.
4,Durable product great for its intended purposes....wires harnesses are all secure.
5,I use it on the tips of my tools. I do paintless dent.  It's easy to use. And don't need scissors to cut it.
5,It easy to work with and it look like a pro did it.
5,Tape up all my wires.
5,Nice cloth tape. Looks OEM quality. Still holding up strong under vehicle where I installed a trailer hitch.
5,Fiber tape is so much better than plastic loom. Stuff is tough and need seam ripper to slice open harnesses. OEMs now use this in commercial vehicles.
5,Works really well and gets the job done and looks good as well.
5,Had to make some electrical repairs recently and ordered to wrap and cover repairs. Gives the factory look and worked great.
3,
5,Works as expected can hardly tell the difference between OEM harness tape and this. Only issue I had was for speed wrapping in tight spaces the roll is on a pretty large center. To accommodate tighter spaces I unrolled a bit onto a 15mm socket and wrapped from that.
5,This was easy to use for wrapping wires together after fixing squirrel damage to my RV.
5,Not sure about the temp resistance yet but really easy to install and sticky enough to do the job. Perfect so far !
5,Works great as described to wrap wires to protect them.
5,Good quality
5,Repairing a wire harness
5,Where has this tape been all my life? It is easy to use when you remove it it does not leave any bad residue like regular electrical tape will and it looks and feels very much like the factory loom that is used on most cars.
5,Very nice material to work with. In time I’ll see if it takes the heat of the engine
5,Ordered more
5,I really like the factory look after using this tape for a radio install wiring on my truck. The only bad thing is if you need to take it off it is very difficult to get off so if you use it make sure its for the final step.
5,Better than most that I've used at a fraction of the cost.
5,I like how easy it is to wrap wires with. Stays tight and strong.
5,It works
5,I used this tape to protect my engine wires from heat. Since I've installed it it has been over 5K miles and the tape has not unraveled or shrunk. It's a cloth like tape and you can't rip it off the roll you have to cut it. So far so good.
5,It's just a good product!
5,This stuff is great.  Looks factory.  Mine has very good adhesive.
5,Very close to OEM used in newer vehicles on harnesses
5,I found this on Amazon. I never used this type of Electrical Tape before. I like it better then regular black electrical tape so far. It seems to stay together better but I haven't used it long enough to compare them long term. Time will tell.
5,worked perfectly ...great replacement for tesa tape
5,Perfect width ample amount good quality
4,If you do any auto wiring this is what you need. Works great in Engine compartment and under the dash where space and organization is key.
5,Great for making my classic car the of care and attention.
3,i got the tesa tape to try it and after using tesa tape i knew i should have gotten it for my harness restoration. its more money but worth it
5,This is really good tape and will make your harness jobs come out nice.
5,This stuff really measures up.  I was very satisfied with everything.
5,Tape did what it was meant to do.
1,I bought this tape because it had overall high reviews.  I used it to wrap my electric connections for my car speakers and amplifier.  I was sorely disappointed to find all of my neatly wrapped wires had turned into a sticky goo mess.  The adhesive from the tape soaked directly through the cloth tape to the external side.  One cable did see some direct sunlight but the others did not.  I wouldn’t recommend using this in a car or anywhere that might get remotely warm.  Now I’m going to have to clean off and re-wrap all of my exposed cables again with something better.
5,Works great and looks much better on my harness than normal electrical tape
5,If used on vehicle’s harnesses this product makes them look like new OEM harnesses very high quality at a very fair price.
5,Smaller rolls that depicted product is a good and works as expected.
5,Doesn’t seem to be very sticky but is holding on so far.
5,Great price and works awesome! Is some of the best self adhesive wire harness tape I’ve used!
5,Works great for under the hood wiring a nice clean look will buy more!!!!!
5,Got it fast and at a bargain price
5,Love it looks great
5,This is a very high quality great to use tape for many different projects.  Sturdy very adhesive and easy to use.
3,Adhesive breeds though when used  in heated areas and doesn't Adhesive well at the tear off end
5,Looks better than factory of course I used a lot more care than they did. Very strong highly recommend.
5,Quality tape that far outlasts regular electrical tape! Great use for attaching accessories to the Jeep!
4,Me agrado este producto sería mejor si fuera más gruesa la cinta
4,good stuff!!
5,Great price for five rolls . Will buy again.
5,Works as described. Had to rewire a wiring harness on my 2001 Yamaha Warrior and used this harness tape to clean it up and make it look a little better.
3,Wish the adhesive was a bit more sticky.heat shrinked the ends of the looms so they won't unravel.
3,Works. But is not the fabric type of tape I was looking for.
5,I am just going to say this I’m  not going to buy any other electric tape again ...like a champ
5,I like this product have used it on several projects and so far it has held up very well. The delivery was quick.
5,Great for wrapping the wires under the hood of my  older classic car .😃
5,The tape works great and looks good to has that factory harness look after applied.
5,Great product really easy to use. Protects the harness well and keeps it flexible.
1,Used this to wrap the ends of my wiring harness and convoluted tubing to give a factory look. Not very sticky but when it gets hot it DOES turn into a sticky goo much like vinyl electrical tape.  And by hot I mean around 120 degrees so in an engine compartment it's a poor choice.
5,Very smooth application
5,Good quality
5,100% better than vinyl electric tape fir wrapping wires
5,Great quality
5,The harness tape worked perfectly for me .
2,Not at all what I was wanting and I’m kinda bummed that I paid $7 for a roll of tape that is so thin and not very adhesive at all. I have an entire engine full of bare wires and I wanted actual harness tape. The tape that has fibers in it the tape tht is used for binding harnesses. I work in automotive electrical so I use harness tape every day... this is not the tape used in manufacturing
5,Love it.
5,Great value
5,Like this product
3,too early to make judgement call
5,Good product
2,Gave it 2 starts because I ordered the 3 pack 90 ft and got a 3 pack 50ft but other then that it was ok
1,The sticky stuff turns to goo and oozes out of the tape after a while. It’s not pleasant.
1,Ordered 5 pack and received a 3 pack mislabeled as a 5 pack.
1,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 This tape has just about 1% adhesive properties to it. Bought it to do a wiring harness and the stuff barely sticks to itself and does not at all stick to what you are wrapping. I took the first roll and threw it right into the garbage can and opened a 2nd roll and it was just the same.
1,Product is very thin could never prevent a abrasion and definitely will not be pleasing to the eye. Will probably give to my new helper to tape up his cuts as he learns the mechanic trade
1,After using this the adhesive started to melt from the heat. Makes a mess everywhere very messy doesn’t do well in the heat.
1,this garbage is not as soft as you think.  it's just a sticky stiff tape. Definitely not a gusset tape.
1,It was dried up and would not stick to anything. Not worth the my money at all
1,Does not stick comes off quick. Only leave the wire sticky.
5,Does what the description says it does sticks well on my boat wiring harness. GREAT CLOTH TAPE.
1,The tape that was sent to me was old not sticky and separating within the roll. RETURNED
1,Tried to use the tape for under the engine but the tape barely sticks to itself.
5,wanted something that was not vinyl seems to be strong
5,Started the process of relooming my engine harness. Love this tape! Not that plastic crap that will harden with time and become brittle. I assume this will break down with time but nothing more annoying than flaky plastic electrical tape
5,Like
5,first time using the product made my cabling look factory on my wifes truck stereo install
5,Came quick price was good and quality is good.  Worked great for my lanyards and wrapping some handles of my tools and I even wrapped my vape for some added grip. Sticks well.  This tape is great stuff and very useful for many applications.
4,A little to much on price for the amount you get
1,Cheap China tape !I was expecting something close to what i have on my car. Is farrrrrr away from that quality. I ended up using landscape fabric on my wires for noise reduction.
5,Para reconstruir un sistema electrico
5,Good price  fast shipping
5,La usé para un auto q estaba arrumbado y lo he ido reparando de a poco.....y me ha ayudado a aislar cables de manera efectiva....
5,Buen producto era lo que necesitaba. Buena calidad
1,I have only 1 good roll the other 4 are all bad. The adhesive detach and stick on the top of the tape that make it both sides sticky.
4,Es ligero al momento.ento de enrollar no hace tanto bulto como otras cintas de tela
3,It's good tape but I wish is was slightly thicker.
4,la cinta se ve pratica para lo que se requiere se ve de buen material
