5,GOOD LITTLE GADGET!!  DOES THE JOB!For the sake of this review please keep in mind that I am not a connoisseur of audio or video signals!  Personally I can’t tell the difference between HD hi-def ect.  I can tell basic differences in picture quality and sound if those differences are pretty big but that’s about the extent of my ‘expertise’.  With that said let’s get to the actual review!Over the years I have tried several different products and have had very little success and much frustration.  To name a couple I have tried ‘Dazzle’ as well as two different ‘Roxio’ pieces of hardware.  Both gave me the same frustrations… they worked for a minute or two but then I started getting a lot of picture static as well as frames freezing and skipping!  Also after the ‘recording’ was finished it would then lock up my computer for quite some time while is ‘saved’ the transfer conversion.  Sometimes it would even freeze my computer and I would have to reboot it.  At that point I would lose the 1.5 hr film I just tried to convert and save.  Lastly both of those programs would not allow me to save it directly as an mp4.  I would have to save it as their file type then convert it later.  (or at least I didn’t know how to save it directly as an mp4 file type from those other products.My current project is converting about 30 old Hi-8 tapes of family birthdays/Christmas’s to digital for safe keeping and watching later.  So far I have completed about 15 of these so far without any problems since getting this converter.  It has not disappointed and has worked as expected.  There were a few glitches as well as some pros and cons but all in all well worth the money.  I will explain a little more  further.1)  make sure you have the needed wires to connect your video source to this converter.  It does come with RCA jack cables but in my case I'm using my old camcorder as the source to play the hi-8 tapes.  My camcorder only has 2 output types… one is a 3.5mm a/v port and the other is an ‘s-video slot’.  Just an fyi for those who might not know the s-video cable will only transmit video it does not transmit sound.  (I did not know this until I read it in someone else’s review  )2)  it seemed like a got a little bit better of a picture using an sd card to record on rather than on a usb drive.  However I then transferred it to a usb drive to save for later.  I would recommend to get 2 sd cards.. that way while you are recording on 1 card you can put the other card in your computer to work with the file.3)  the unit itself is nice and compact.  It is about the size of a ‘larger’ cell phone.  It seems to be sturdy too.4)  with this device it does not tie up your computer.  As you are recording directly on the unit itself5)  it does save the recording in ‘real time’ as an MP4 file.  Therefore no need for the conversion or the save to take another 1.5 hours after you just got done playing the full tape into the unit.  After you push ‘stop’ your file is ready! **important note.. i read reviews where people were having ‘corrupt file’ error messages after trying to record/convert.  After doing multiple experiments I discovered that if you press ‘stop’ on your source device while you are still trying to record on this device you will get a corrupt file every time.  It’s as if the loss of signal causes the file to error out.6)  this is very easy to use right out of the box.  Which is good because the directions seem to be lacking.7)  Other reviewers were complaining that the ‘auto-stop’ function causes ‘dead space’ which then corrupts the file.  On my version of the unit I was able to turn off this ‘auto-stop’ function therefore I have not had this issue.8)  Other reviewers stated they were having problems with the media card not ‘clicking’ into place therefore not able to record on.  I will say this was an issue at first until I looked a little closer.  Normally when you try to insert an sd card you push it till the pad of your finger touches the computer ect.  At that point the sd card typically clicks into place.  However with this unit the card actually ends up being ‘inside’ the unit after it clicks into place.  Therefore I have to use my fingernail to push it into and out of place.  This is a bit annoying but once I figured it out no problems.  I'm assuming this is for the safety of the card?9)  other reviewers stated they were getting ‘corrupt file’ error messages after converting.  As I mentioned above it is IMPORTANT that you stop recording BEFORE you press stop on your source device.  The converter itself senses an input video signal and will not allow you to record until it does.  Therefore I'm assuming that  when it stops sensing this signal it stops recording but doesn’t finish the file out correctly.10)  this is the same for when you start recording… the unit will not allow you to start recording until it senses the input video signal from your camcorder ect.  This wasn’t too big of an issue but I did occasionally miss a second or two of my original tape due to this lag in recording.11)  as far as the ‘quality’ of the recording.. I wasn’t really able to notice a difference.  Again I do not have a trained eye either… I will say this though.. Remember you are recording from an old TAPE of some sort (aka non digital)… it is not of extremely high quality to begin with.12)  some reviews said to make sure you update the firmware  once you get it.  I was not able to figure out how to do this.  However it doesn’t seem to actually need an update.  I don’t remember where I saw it but I saw somewhere that stated if you ordered your unit after a certain date then the unit is already updated.I know this was a pretty lengthy review but I hope it helps yins make a good informed decision.Happy converting 
4,I'll try and keep this short and to the point -I received this product in the mail a couple of weeks ago and just made my first digital conversion today. It is SUPER east to use. Literally plug in your yellow and white RCA cables to the back of a VCR (if you have one I had to order one from Amazon lol). Plug the RCA cables to the top of the device and presto you will have sound and picture in a matter of seconds once you push play on the VCR and make sure you're on the correct mode setting on the device. I read the directions when I first got it but they're really short so once you know what you're doing I think you're going to play through the VCR hit record on the device and just walk away while it does its thing.I just finished recording a copy of the 1989 NBA all star game I had and the picture is amazing. I've got over 100 tapes to convert and my theory is that the picture once digitized is only going to be as good as the original tape (I remember back in the day that programs taped at 6 hour speed would not be as clear as those taped at 2 hour speed - just a thought).Now because it's been 32 years since I've played that tape I thought there would be issues but there weren't. I'm guessing family videos and such (things I really bought the converter for) will be a bit more grainy because they were recorded on a shoulder-carrying camcorder from 1988. Again I think the digitized copy will only be as good as the original recording OR as good as the quality of the VHS tape is NOW.Reading through A LOT of other reviews before I bought this device I saw that people commented about not being able to pause the recording because after hitting "pause" the device will actually stop. For my sake that doesn't bother me because what I know I do want to transfer over will most likely be the entire tape so I'm not bothered by not being able to pause because I probably wouldn't have done a lot of that anyway.I am now recording the final game between the BULLS and LAKERS in the 1991 Finals and the picture showing through the device seems as clear as the tape itself when I first recorded it. So far I'm VERY happy with it and would recommend it!Only reason I rated it 4 STARS is because of the sound that is produced out of the device while the transfer happens. It's very soft and you basically have to be holding the device or sitting very close to it to hear it. Imagine leaning in close to someone to whisper to them and that's what it's like. I would prefer just a little bigger device for a better speaker if that's what it takes.Screen dimensions: W 2 3/4 inches by H nearly 2 inches.
5,I am looking to finally get rid of all my old tapes but needed a way to get them to dvd the easiest way possible. This little gadget has been working wonders. Super easy to use. Very solid device and user friendly. For now I'm just running each tape to my SD card I put in this unit then when it's complete I move the data to my computer hard drive for further work I want to do on it. I format the SD and do the next tape. Super slick. So far I've used it with a borrowed Hi8 camcorder and now I'm working on the mini DV tapes. After that I'll do the VCR tapes. I love that if you want to sit and watch the full tape as it is running/copying and a part comes that you don't need to copy you can press the OK button to pause the recording and then press OK again to start it going again. You can fast forward if you want to (from your camcorder or whatever) and that's what you'll get copied (fast speed). But this is a great option if you know it's something you can just splice out on the PC later.  I recommend this item.
5,I used this to transfer some important home videos to digital. It worked well. You have to watch the videos at normal speed as it records but it works fine. The controls are simple enough and as long as you have the required hardware it should be ok. I transferred 3 home videos and a regular VHS movie with no issue. You can view the footage on the device after you record it and playback on a computer is simple as well. It’d be nice if there was a way to transfer the media faster but I can understand the reasons for the not being possible. Overall very happy with the price and quality and it gives the extra piece of mind that you won’t lose your media by sending it in the mail.
5,I have been using this for about 3 days and I love it!  I am digitizing home movies. I've made so much progress in such a small time and I couldn't be happier!  This project that seemed like an insurmountable task now seems very doable.  The product is nicely packaged. The instruction booklet is concise and clearly written.  The user interface is simple and well designed.  There is even a video to show you how to use it -- that is simple and clear.  It is very easy to use.  I love not tying up my computer with this process.  I also like that the file format is .mp4.  I wish ALL products could be like this.  I've tried other products and this is by far the best one.  Thank you so much!
5,I have many dozens of old VHS and miniDV video tapes with countless hours of cherished family memories recorded on them.  I know tape is good but it will not last forever.  There is always the chance of it breaking or getting jammed and you can no longer buy new equipment to play them.  You have to get used and hope for the best.  I bought this device to preserve those memories for future generations.I just got it recently and have only used it to transfer one tape so far but it worked perfectly.  To me that one recording is worth the money I spent on it.  You do have to buy a storage medium of some type.  I ordered a 128 GB flash drive along with mine.  From there I can transfer it to hard drive memory card the cloud or all three if I want to make certain those memories are preserved for decades to come.I will try to remember to update this when I have transferred a few more tapes but right now I am completely thrilled with the purchase.  Update - I have now transferred over 20 tapes and still working perfectly.  Video and sound are never out of sync which is a problem I had when trying to transfer directly to my computer with another device.  Love the pause feature.  If I got carried away and recorded an hour of my son running up and down the basketball court I can hit pause after 10 minutes and continue recording the same file when the scene changes to something else.  I am using an S video cable and the picture quality is excellent. I highly recommend this product.
5,What an awesome little gadget! I have been wanting to convert my old camcorder tapes to digital for some time now. I have about 25 years of memories on these tapes so I was hesitant to send them away and the cost was daunting! Luckily I happened upon an add for ClearClick and decided to give it a try. To be honest I really didn't get my hopes up as so often technology doesn't go as planned but I have been so impressed with how easy it has been. My original Sony camcorder was still in working order so it was very easy to pop in a tape connect it to the ClearClick via my 3.5mm to Av cable (not the cable included - this was my original camcorder cable) start up the tape and press the "Record" button on the ClearClick. I recorded to a ScanDisk Ultra USB 3.0 64GB memory stick. I was quite pleased with how easy it was to set up and the quality of the recording both audio and video is pretty darn good! I was really pleased to have an easy and cost effective way to convert my catalog of home movie camcorder tapes to digital that I can fast forward through or edit. Highly recommend for someone with a lot of old camcorder footage!
5,Over the years I have bought 5 other converters. 5!All the others were OK at best = losing signal conversion quality lacking etc...This converter has not failed me even once after having converted more than 8 hours ofDVDs into a digital format on my Mac computer.I cannot over state how great a feeling it is to have a converter that actually works as advertised and expected.I will buy again if needed and would recommend to anyone needing to convert VHS or DVDs to digital.
5,I shouldn't really complain about this little machine.  No it not prefet but it works surprisingly well.  It's really easy to use and a good video quality on recordings.  If your the type of person that needs 4k for Everything than this Not for you....  For the people who live in the real world it's just fine....This model ONLY uses RCA INPUTS!  The HDMI is an out put ONLY.So need to use an older DVD play with RCA outputs or a line converter.  (See 2nd photo)Yes you can watch the DVD or show on your TV as you record...Also. It only supports storage up to 32Gwhich ok I guess. I have even recorded 50 + DVDs and put on Micro SD Card played on my phone...  Works well.I hate always having to stream things and dislike the cloud even....  So this is prefet for me...
5,When I first viewed the mp4 videos transferred using this device the videos were "jerky" about 1 hour into the video. I sent an email to tech support on a Sunday afternoon and within a couple hours received a reply from a real human (Tyler). We worked back and forth on a solution and he ended up sending a replacement device. When the videos did the same thing with the new device I did more troubleshooting and determined that the issue was my Windows Media Player. They play back perfectly with Microsoft Movies & TV app. I can't say enough positive things about their tech support (and enough negative things about Windows Media Player!).
5,Easy to setup and use.  The converter works great for VHS and 8mm film.  The quality of the conversion is dependent on the quality of the film source.  I used it to convert old VHS tapes and 8mm cassette tapes to digital and save to a flash drive or computer.
5,I used this to take the analog signal from my Infrared camera and record it due to the Camera's "computer" (really a windows based palm pilot).  The camera outputs 720 DPI but the old "computer" that was used to capture images was only recording in 320 DPI so that is a big upgrade.  The second feature is that I can now record the entire Infrared scan as a video.  The original "computer" that came with the camera could not do that.  As a bonus I can take still images (720 DPI screen captures) while it is recording and I don't have to stop the recording of the video. This is a huge improvement!!!  It has a color screen!!!!  My old one was in black and white.  Now I can see in real time the color spectrum produced by the camera instead of looking at it later or just using a grey scale spectrum for my work.To make this unit portable to work with my camera out in the field I also purchased a 12v to 5v 3A converter and wired it up to a Female USB pigtail (both sold on amazon for less than $20 for both).  This unit appears to only need 1A (per the included power supply) but having 3A capacity means that the converter is not being maxed out.  Since my IR camera is powered by a larger 12 volt battery (similar to a motor cycle battery) it has more than enough amperage to run both of these devices. My total battery life with both devises running run time for both the camera and the ClearClick is about 6 hours.The bottom line is that although this unit is not sold for the use that I am using it for it turns out that it is absolutely perfect for my application.  I have improved the DPI on the captured photos by 2X. I now can capture videoOverall Quality of the unit I got was fine.  It lacks a premium feel like a modern high end cell phone has but this is 1/10th the cost of a modern cell phone.  The unit is lightweight for its size but this is to be expected from modern electronics in plastic cases.  The buttons have a nice feel to them.  The screen is very bright.  Overall I am very pleased with this product.  I think it is a decent value for the money.FOR MY APPLICATION there are two things I would like different.1.  Make the case our of metal.  Brushed aluminum would be perfect.  This would add a much more premium feel to this product.2.  Rotate the screen and the buttons 90 degrees putting the screen over the buttons.  THIS WOULD ONLY BENIFIT MY SPECIFIC USE CASE.  It would not improve the units functionality for its intended use by the designer/seller.  This change would probably make it not as good for its intended use.  The layout of the unit for its intended use looks to have been very well thought out.  With the unit sitting flat on a table the various plug location make sense as does the screen and button locations.Overall I am very pleased with my purchase.  I may purchase a 2nd one to keep as a backup as I am sure these will eventually stop being made as the need to convert analog video to digital media decreases.Very pleased with this and how it worked with my existing equipment.  Glad I found this product
5,This device was so easy to use and transfer irreplaceable memories into digital format. Love that you don't need software or anything on your computer in order to use it
5,If I could give it more stars I would. It is so simple to use and does exactly what it stated. Very intuitive to use and gives great results. Highly recommend this device.
5,Converting dozens of old VHS to MP4 for archival purposes.This is the best video capture device I've ever seen for that purpose.I highly recommend this.
5,Very easy to use and well worth the money. I converted several family VHS tapes to MP4 files to share with family and keep forever. I watched the youtube video that came with the instructions and had no issues whatsoever. Quality of the video you get depends on the quality of the VCR and VHS tapes so just be aware.
4,I was able to use this device to make copies of old VHS tapes so that I can watch them without the ancient VHS player.  Also used it to digitize old Hi-8 videos which could only be replayed by the camcorder that made them.  They turned out really well but there are two things to watch for:1.  The aspect ratio of the resulting video is wrong with the default settings.  That is old standard television video when encoded using the default aspect ratio isn't right.  So people in the videos look fatter than they are etc.  I was using an external tool to correct this - but then read the manual more thoroughly.  It turns out that the aspect ratio can be set in the menu so if you are restoring old television video don't forget to change this setting or you'll end up with fat videos.2.  There have been reports of the ClearClick stopping a recording at random but I haven't seen this except in the case of a wonky thumb drive.  What I have seen is that it limits the size of videos to 4 GB but this is likely due to the format of the media.  Thumb drives for instance come pre-formatted usually in FAT32 which is a very standard file format that can be read by just about anything.  The problem is that FAT32 limits file sizes to 4 GB.  It won't stop recording when it reaches 4 GB but it will stop recording to the original file and continue recording on a second file.  4 GB is a bit over 2 hours of video.  This can be gotten around by reformatting your thumb drive to another file system like NTFS (I've found that exFAT doesn't work though) which allows nearly unlimited file size.  On windows this can be done by right-clicking the thumb drive and selecting "format..." and changing the "File System" to "NTFS".  Note that this will erase the entire thumb drive when you do this so make sure everything is off of it first.Otherwise the ClearClick is pretty easy to use and gives you a pretty much "what you see is what you get" simplicity.  I've used it on several old videos with no problems but those listed above.
5,I just used this converter to copy 32 8mm tapes and 24 VHS tapes and I'm thrilled with the final product.I had previously bought a software program that would supposedly convert my tapes.  The old program was difficult to use it loaded a bunch of things on my computer and produced a "jumpy" output.  I was contemplating using a mail-in service that would cost hundreds and hundreds of dollars but decided to try this first.  I'm so glad I did!  I had it up and running in minutes!I didn't even need my computer during the process.  I used a thumb drive to copy the tapes.  Once the tapes were copied I put them on to a hard drive just a drag-and-drop operation.  You may want to store the files on thumb drives or SD cards it's your choice.  I hope you are as happy with your result as I am with mine.
5,My family and I were wanting to digitalize our home videos for the longest time. Besides my uncle who works in IT I'm the only accessible tech-saavy person in my family that they can come to for help on certain things. We still had our VCR tape machine that was still workable. I debated purchasing between the ClearClick Video digital converter and the elgato USB converter. I decided to go with the ClearClick digital converter after watching a youtube video where a youtuber who works with videos/cameras/etc. used this exact device and gave his review and thoughts on it. I decided to take a risk and go with ClearClick instead of elgato where elgato has about over 7k positive reviews.Shipping was extremely quick  — I ordered clearclick on a Wednesday Night around 9PM and it arrived the next morning at 6:40AM using prime delivery. I was able to plug the device in the VCR and record the tapes onto an SD card. I had a bit of a hard time getting the SD card to format for the device but after going on Clearclick's website to troubleshoot how to format specifically for the device it worked great!The picture and sound quality is amazing considering all the home tapes were from the 90s to early 2000s. My aunt passed away in the mid-2000s due to cancer and my grandfather recently passed December 2021 due to health issues — so I'm very excited to have the digital format of my home videos where I can hear and see my aunt's and grandfather's voices again and being able to see their smiles and cherish all of the memories that were created. This little device is completely worth the money! And honestly for the picture and sound quality that I got out of the device spending a little bit of extra money vs a cheap digital converter was completely worth it. I've learned if you go cheap you get what you pay for. So having a higher end digital converter will last you a long while and produce great .mp4 files! Extremely happy with my purchase and I can't wait to digitalize more videos in the near future!
5,I have some quibbles. And I thought it was kind of expensive. But I'm giving it five stars because it has been 100% satisfactory for me and has done exactly what I expected. Good gadget works fine.But one thing I've learned over the years is that with offline converters--digital audio CD recorder audio cassette to digital converter now this--WORK. With an offline converter I can get the job DONE. Anything involving a computer as part of the process is tempting--but false economy. I started with a $30 video-input-to-USB gadget and sure enough the software provided with it broke with an OS change and no updates are available from the manufacturer.I was not picky about image quality. The results look fine to me and I think fully capture the quality of the (usually analog) source. The (analog) transfers from digitally recorded "Digital 8" are better than the ones from analog sources which convinces me that the device is capturing what's there. I couldn't see any difference in quality between composite and S-Video.I have a concern about the audio quality. It seems fine in anything with a normal level but I think it's possible that there's some audible distortion in quiet passages.The unit was mostly easy to use there are some quirks to get used to you need to spend a few minutes and look at the instruction book.The instruction book is much better written than usual but could be more detailed.I wish there was a wider range of "auto stop" times--they give you 60 90 120 and 150 minutes. In theory at least a VHS tape can play for 240 or 360 minutes. And there are times when I was quite sure that a tape only had ten or fifteen minutes recorded and would have liked a 30 minute setting. However compression works and long periods of empty blue screen add surprisingly little to the file size.I bought a SanDisk USB 3.0 flash drive as recommended in the instructions and it worked fine but I also tried random old thumb drives from my collection _including USB 2.0_ drives and they all worked fine too.
5,Easy and great quality . Fun to easily save all the vhs recordings
5,Amazing.So easy to use! No drivers. No OS restrictions. You don't even need a computer! Just plug in a thumb drive plug in Y/R/W and you're set (it even comes with the cable!!). An all-in-one GODSEND of a device!!! Great quality great compression (I think I could have stored 32 hours of footage on a 64GB drive) and great controls.
5,It was easy to transfer to digital media.  Much simpler than I thought it would be.  The instructions were good and they have a intro video to go over how it works.  It would be nice to have a better speaker but I would still rate it a 5 in spite of that.  It saved me time and money to have someone else do it!!!
5,Would highly recommend this product to everyone! It was so simple to set up and record old vhs tapes! My family and I were able to watch home videos we haven’t seen in 20+ years and I am so grateful to this product for bringing back such beautiful memories! The picture and sound came out perfect!
5,This product is user friendly! Watch the video on how to work it ! Glad I got this product ! Great product to preserve memories.
4,Works great. Very easy to connect to VCR player for source then insert an flash drive for destination. Only complaint if you try to switch to and from displaying on units tiny screen of display on your TV. Display goes out. I am using 64 GB flash drive and it still has some room after all the recordings that I have done so far.
5,Good small gadgets
5,I work in TV editing and have spent years burning old VHS tapes to DVDs and then laboriously capturing them to mp4 ending up with something that looks almost unusable.  This device gives you a one step process no noticeable loss from the conversion and is perfectly simple to operate.  Very much recommended and a good price.  My only criticism is it would be nicer to have a longer power cord but otherwise no complaints!
5,This product is absolutely amazing. It's super easy to use and the video and audio quality is great. I had the instructions handy but never even used them.  Being able to record these videos and upload them to the cloud to access anytime is priceless. The hardest part about converting these memories to digital files is finding a working vcr.
4,Straight to the point - the unit is easy to set up and easy to use.  I would highly recommend this as an easy quick low cost solution to share videos that might otherwise never be shared with family and friends.I purchased this unit in Feb. 2022 to digitize 20 year old 8mm and Hi8 video tapes and have so far digitized over 30 one hour tapes using this unit with many more to go.Observations:- I would recommend using a S-Video cable for video instead of the video line in for better image quality.- Overall it appears contrast and color are slightly reduced  but they look fine considering they are originally 480 scan line images not 1080 or higher.  I've experimented with lightening up a few using a simple video editing program like Windows Video Editor but the effect was not that perceptible to other people that I've asked review both and the WVE doubles the file size if you convert it to 1080.  Obviously the original image quality doesn't improve using WVE; it just lightens the video.Static shots like groups of people architecture landscapes etc. look much better than action shots that have a lot of movement and camera motion but the 8mm and Hi8 cameras I used 20 years ago were not really designed for fast action so that's a function of the original recording device not this unit.
4,Easy  to set up worked as expected.
5,Like many others I was having an issue with the jittery picture. Tech support responded within *minutes* and was incredibly helpful. Turns out that the jittering only appeared if I viewed the converted movies with my particular version of Windows Media Player. Any other software played the movie perfectly as did a standard DVD/BluRay player. I did not have any issue with synchronization or darkening of the picture or with improper cutoff when scenes in the VHS source tape transitioned. I did use an S-video adapter in conjunction with the RCA cables which essentially sends the video through the S-video channel and the audio through the RCA channel but that too was seamless. (Set the unit to S-video as your source if you do that though it will pick up the RCA audio automatically.)Very happy with this unit!
5,I needed to replace an older DVR and wanted to save some of the things I'd recorded to its hard drive over the years.  Because of its age this DVR had built-in RCA outputs the three separate round plugs marked in yellow (for video) and red & white (for the two audio channels in stereo--left & right).  As long as your video source has those outputs then this device will work for you.  Almost all older video devices like VHS players and camcorders will have these outputs; if yours doesn't you can buy an adapter (such as HDMI to RCA) and still be able to use this device.  What this device does is convert whatever video signal you feed into it to an MP4 digital file.  The file you create must be saved either on a flash drive or SD card that you plug into this device.  I used and recommend the SD card option as some flash drives might not be able to keep up with the conversion rate which will create video/audio sync problems.  As another reviewer said the key to using an SD card is to push it all the way inside the converter so that the card's edge is flush with the unit's edge; if the card is partly sticking out it's not inserted correctly.  The included instructions don't make this very clear.  Then all you do is start the video source playing and hit the device's "record" button.  You have to let the video play in real time so if the video is 30 minutes of playing time that's how long it's going to take to create the digital version.  Once you're done you stop the recording and remove the SD card.  If you want to do any editing or uploading of the digital file you'll then need a way to transfer the MP4 from the SD card to a computer (my PC has a built-in SD slot so this was simple for me--if you don't have this you will also need an SD card reader that plugs into your computer's USB).  Overall I was very happy with both the quality of the conversion and the simplicity of doing it.  I'm so happy I could save those things from my dying DVR!
5,I was on the fence about spending the money on this device but after converting over 30 videos from my old Sony Handycam Vision Hi-8 ccamcorder and a few from old VHS tapes via VCR I am so pleasently suprised and pleased at just how easy and straight forward this thing works. It's amazing. I'll quickly just give you a very simple idea of how easy using this device is. I start off by plugging it in with my phones micro usb connection to power it up. I then plug in a little USB device that my movies will be copied to. Next I plug an S-video cable into the device and connect the other end to my handycam (I used the provided red/yellow/white cables when using the VCR) -that's the video connection. I then used a cable that plugs into the audio out connection on my handycam and has the red and white male connections on the other end that connect to the converter -now I have audio connected. From here you just press play on the handycam or VCR and when you see the video on the devices screen press the record button. When I saw that the screen was fading out (something I always used when I was playing camerman..) I would get ready to either hit the middle button (to pause the recording) or I'd hit the record button to end that particular video. If that event was not over with I'd hit the pause button again to resume recording. But if that event was done and another was beginning I'd hit the record button to end that video. Since the next segment had started to play I'd rewind it a bit back to the beginning and then hit record to start another recording. It's just that easy. You can also easily see your videos on the USB by pressing the mode button.Everything is well thought-out and simple to grasp. This device has given me so much piece of mind just knowing if anything were to happen to my 'master' recordings I now have them backed up on my hard drive and in the cloud to share with all my friends and family. I converted a video for my mom from the 50's that she hasn't seen in decades and she was in tears. Worth every penny.
5,I have a pile of VHS to digitize and have been looking for a solution. I ended up buying the ClearClick 2.0 Digital Converter to get the job done. The unit came with clear instructions on how to get started and within only a couple of minutes I was converting the files. I am happy with the quality of the digitized videos given some of the originals weren't the best quality to begin with. I did have a question about file names that I emailed to their tech support. They replied to my email within about 30 minutes. For those wondering the file is created on the USB drive when you press stop on the record button. It is given a unique date/timestamp name that you can rename the file by plugging the USB into your computer. I recommend this product.
5,Worked better than I expected. I was looking for something to convert my old dvds so I could watch them on my iPad. I’m glad I found this. Thankfully I have a portable DVD player that still works. I hook this device up to it and can record movies to a flash drive. Keep in mind movies take up a lot of space so a 128gb flash drive is recommended
5,Very minor issues with reading the mp4 file but the tech support was exceptional.  Responded immediately and told me what I was doing wrong.This product converts your video as is.  That is exactly what I wanted.Can't recommend strongly enough.  I am now transferring over 50 videos with the only cost being that of the clearclick product.
5,Very easy to use no degradation of video quality from what is on the vhs tape. Very pleased with its performance.
5,This is exactly the product I was looking for to get all my kids home videos in a digital format. Easy pleasy... With my old VCR a few 8 GB SD Cards and my Chromebook. I easily uploaded 30 VCR tapes full of footage to Google Drive. Converter worked perfectly and quality was as good as original. Highly recommend this product for DIY home videos to digital.
4,ClearClick Video to Digital Converter 2.0 (Second Generation) - Record Video from VCR's VHS Tapes AV RCA Hi8 Camcorder DVD Gaming Systems$ 119 95  + taxFree Shipping for Prime Members & FREE ReturnsFull 1-Year Warranty & USA-Based Tech Support from ClearClickI was hoping that this item would solve my project needs;  I have A number of vhs tapes of movies & documentaries as well as home movies that I wanted to convert to digital format.ClearClick Video to Digital Converter 2.0 (2nd Generation) is supposed to enable you to record video from VCR's VHS Tapes AV RCA Hi8 Camcorder DVD Gaming Systems - any device which uses analog connectors (3 RCA - red white yellow). You should also be able to record to SD card or usb flash drive.I checked customers reviews before purchasing this converter to make sure it was what I wanted. I also took note of all the hints for best results as well as numerous  troubleshooting solutions.Unfortunately I have not been successful in my many attempts to use this device. All connections on my devices function properly. I use quality cables that are shielded to cut down on interefence.  I should be able to accomplish my goal if the ClearClick converter works.I believe I received a faulty device for the following reasons:  1) It will not accept any of the SD cards I've tried to use. All were new of good quality & had been tested.  When you try to insert a card into the slot it will not "click" or seat into place; instead it pops back out.  2) I've tried various high quality new flash drives ranging in size - 16GB. 32GB 64GB & 128GB.  None of them worked with this device.  3) I went through the helpful hints & troubleshooting suggestions made by others in their reviews to no avail.  4) I used a different & far less expensive device to accomplish the same thing & was successful thus eliminating any question as to whether my set-up cables or any devices were malfunctioning.Spending approximately $130 with tax for a product that does not work is unacceptable. At this point  I would simply like to return this device & everything that was included in its original box for a refund.Please Note: I acknowledge the fact that defective products can inadvertently slip through manufacturing and quality control processes of any company. I'm sure properly functioning products work; however I do not want a replacement as I resolved my issue using a different method.I used a converter to HDMI & your HD Capture Box.Would I recommend this company's products?  YES.
4,I purchased this to convert 40+ VHS tapes some of which are coming up on 38 years old. I also have 60+ HD miniDV tapes to convert.I tried the converter with both an SD card and a thumb drive and both worked well. The instruction manual recommends using the fastest SD card you can get and I agree. I found that using a thumb drive was easier when it came to transfer the captured mp4 files to a computer but the higher capacity of my SD card meant I could capture more video before having to move files to the computer.  Each hour of video required about 2GB of space on the chosen media. My biggest complaint about using an SD card is the physical slot for the card does not have any kind of depression in the case making it difficult to fully seat and release the card.While watching the video on the built-in LCD screen I noticed a "stutter" in the image as though the converter was dropping frames. This occurred with both the thumb drive and the SD card. The instruction manual states that these "skips" will not be recorded but that isn't true. I find that I am having to edit around the problem as I assemble a finished video from the captured video. I noticed that this occurred with my older VHS tapes and as I transferred the newer miniDV tapes the problem seemed to disappear. I believe the converter works better when fed a cleaner stronger video from a better source.The biggest benefit of using the converter is freeing up my computer from the real-time task of recording video. I can continue to work on other tasks without the processing load of recording video.As an FYI - if you are new to editing video and want to try your hand without investing in an expensive software package (like Adobe) try either Shotcut (https://shotcut.org/) or Hitfilm Express (https://fxhome.com/hitfilm-express). Both are free and have ample tutorials online (Youtube) to get you running. Both are available for multiple platforms. Of the two I have settled on Hitfilm which is more polished and has additional tools for purchase.
5,It works fantastic! It is so portable and simple to use. No messing around with trying to involve your regular computer with extra software/hardware to complete the conversions. You hook your analog video playback device (I'm just using my original VHS VHS-C and miniDV cameras) to the small Video2Digital device and insert either an SD card or USB stick for the resulting mp4 files to be stored (I'm using USB sticks) and that is pretty much it! I waited until I had converted a sizable number of tapes to write this review since some reviewers said it worked ok for a few and then stopped working. In my case I have converted a little over 30 tapes so far and the resulting digital conversions look great! I still have another 50 or so to go but have seen nothing so far to make me think I'll run into any problems.As far as their service goes I can't say enough good things. I was having an issue with my first conversions. When I reported it online to ClearClick software support they responded immediately with suggested things to try. We traded numerous emails and when nothing seemed to be fixing it they actually sent me 2 new USB sticks to try that are models they test with; thinking the issue might be my flash drive write speeds. Long story short those didn't work either ... but I eventually figured out that it was actually Windows Media Player on my playback computer that was causing the problems and had nothing to do with the Video2Digital converter or the resulting mp4 files. I downloaded 2 different free video players and all of the mp4s play back perfectly with each. And even though the problem turned out to all be on my end and having basically wasted a bunch of their time (not to mention them packaging up and shipping me USB sticks) they were just happy it all worked out. I offered to return the USB sticks and they told me to keep them with their compliments. You don't find support like that very often especially online so these guys would get 6 or 7 stars in that category if I could!In summary great product and great service ... I highly recommend.Joe C.
5,I'm a do-it-yourself type person and didn't want to spend the money to have a professional convert my videos.  How hard could it be?  Well I found out and would like to share.This is a nifty little device for copying your old analog tapes to digital.  It's easy to setup just like the manufacturer claims.  However I found that although my old VHS and 8mm tapes play well on the camcorder display and tv they did not display well when captured on THIS device or OTHER digital devices.  The captured video is extremely jittery/choppy and very difficult to watch.  The video quality is actually worse than on the original tape.The manufacturer's website wants you to check the condition of your tapes & the functionality of your VCR/camcorder before purchasing our product because it relies on these to make quality recordings.  Their website also claims "Improved Audio/Video Sync Protection".  I agree that Quality in = Quality out and the audio/video does remain synced (mouths didn't look like a dubbed Godzilla movie) however  there are very important factors to consider with "video jitter".Analog video signals are very inconsistent compared to digital.  The old analog tv's and some vcr's compensated for this problem.  The average digital video capture devices cannot.  To make quality captured recordings you need to use Time Base Correction (TBC).  This product DOES NOT have TBC built in.  In fact most devices do not have it.  The manufacture should note this in their description.A TBC is another electronic device that plugs in between your video player and the ClearClick Video capture device.  It essentially counteracts errors by processing the video signal as it comes off the videotape at an unsteady rate and releases it at a steady rate for digital.Do your research on YouTube about Time Base Correction (TBC) before purchasing.  TBC can be expensive but well worth the investment and is the only way that I found to capture stable video on the ClearClick.
3,Just a little back-round... I am a retired Broadcast Engineer so I may be a little picky.The clearclick is Video to USB or Video to SD only .  Record in MP4 which is nice. Transferring to USB means you now have a digital copy and that's the goal that most of us are after.  So Clearclick has just what we need. How about quality? Clearclick has no quality settings. . It does not tell you how much time is left on your recording target.The Clearclick has a built in speaker.  Although the speaker on the Clearclick is quite low at least it has one.  I don't know why it doesn't have a headphone jack.  In fact if it did you could use it as portable media player. More technical stuff;The Clearclick will continue recording even when sync is lost or for you non-techies when there is an interruption in the video signal.  VHS tapes are notorious for losing sync in bad spots and this has always been a problem with traditional DVD recorders they stop at that point. That is one of the reasons we use Time Base Correctors in the studio. This was an important test as many people have reported in earlier reviews that the Clearclick would stop recording when there was a break in the video. It seems they have addressed that issue. In fact in my tests it seems they have a built in TBC of some sort pretty impressive actually. One thing I would characterize as false advertising though is the Clearclick's ability to pause a recording and then resume. It does not. The pause button stops the recording and resume starts another recording. So "pause" really means 'stop". I myself was duped by this misleading advertising because  I have never seen the ability to pause an MP4 recording in progress and I thought this would be absolutely great. But it doesn't it is simply a lie on Clearclick's part.It records audio very very low.  Why?  I don't know. If you have a way to boost the input it sure helps. I have a little 2 channel audio mixer that does the job and it has a headphone jack! I'm not advocating anything here but just some more technical information; the Clearclick does not seem to honor the broadcast record flag. What that means is it records Cable.  The FCC mandated long ago that the airwaves are free and free to record so I am not talking about OTA TV this is Cable where pretty much everything has a broadcast record flag. DVD recorders won't record Cable but it could be that there isn't much concern anymore over low resolution baseband video so in the case of Clearclick they just let it go .  We're talking analog Video here not HDMI.The Clearclick is not perfect but for the $139 I paid and not having to use a computer and software and patch bays and stuff I think I'm going to keep it for what it's worth.
5,easy set up in a few minutes you're ready to go! BE SURE TO HAVE A DEDICATED USB FLASH DRIVE OR SD CHIP AS IT WILL BE FORMATTED TO USE WITH THIS DEVICE.
4,Overall the product works as attended. Any AV and S-Video plugin will work on it.Only issue I've encounter is video recording auto stop will corrupt file. I have to keep an eye on the recorder and manually stop it.Recording on MicroSD is not so great even when its a Pro class 10 card. It loses frames when open up in Premier. Best to use a good highspeed USB flash drive.
4,Only doing 4 stars because sometimes it's a little tricky with my USB but gets the job done!
5,I was hesitant when I ordered this wondering if this unit would transfer video from old VHS tapes with the quality I wanted along with the ease of use I was looking for. After digitizing bits and pieces off of numerous VHS tapes from the 1980s and 1990s I can say without hesitation that it checked all the boxes for me. Quality was excellent although keep in mind much of that depends on the quality of the original recording and the quality of the unit it's being played on. Ease of use was great: no computer needed no software to install etc. Just plug it into the output jacks of a VCR play a tape then hit the record button for anything you want to save. While going through all my VHS tapes and digitizing them will take some time (no fault of this product whatsoever) I'm well on my way to tossing out all my VHS tapes as well as my VCR and moving on to the next century.Recommended!
3,I purchased the ClearClick recorder as my first attempt to preserve in digital form 20+ 8mm/Hi8 family video tapes and another 50+ Digital8 family video tapes. After putting this off for several years I was excited to finally have time to do this and wanted to finish it before either of our 20+ year-old camcorders stopped working.The ClearClick recorder was easy to set up connect to my old camcorder (using the RCA connector) and record video in mp4 format saving it to a MicroSD card. A couple of quick 5 minute test runs looked good. After converting three full tapes I stopped to watch the conversions in full. To my disappointment the ClearClick recordings were noticeably darker in so many places. The original tapes looked natural and bright on the old camcorder view screen but a lot darker in the mp4 versions. After converting a few more tapes and getting the same too dark result I decided to look for another way to do it.FINAL VERDICT: I would rate the ClearClick recorder a 3/5 overall. It is a 5/5 for ease of use but only 1/5 for not accurately reproducing the color and brightness of the original material. If you want an easy way to convert video from an RCA device and darker video is okay this device might work for your situation. I just wanted (expected) a more accurate reproduction of the original video sources.EPILOGUE: There is a happy ending to this story as I DID find a way to do to this that turned out great using a computer free software and two interface devices I purchased here on Amazon for a total of $70. The critical devices are an RCA to HDMI converter ($10-$25) and an HDMI to USB video capture device ($10-$50). There are many options but the two I purchased = B087JDJ37Z and B0894DDD7H. The software is the free OBS-Open Broadcaster Software. It is used for streaming but also has great screen capture features. You connect your camcorder to the RCA device (using an analog red white and yellow cable). The HDMI to USB video capture device is connected to your PC via a USB port. An HDMI cable connects the two devices to complete flow from your old camcorder to the computer. Remember if there is an HDMI port on your computer itself it is almost always output only (not input) so that is why to need the HDMI to USB device for an HDMI input port.In my situation after making the above connections and installing the OBS software I merely needed to push play on the camcorder and click record in the software to convert my family videos. By default the recordings are saved in mkv format which plays on most devices. The mkv file are pretty big but the quality is outstanding. I am so happy to have preserved these family memories in a format that is accessible in the future and remain so when the old camcorders ultimate stops working.
5,I don’t even know where to start here. My son who has cancer told me he didn’t want another tshirt or anything for Christmas except to see his videos when he was a kid. I have vhs and 8mm tapes. A lot of them. I didn’t know where to begin and he told me 2 weeks before Christmas. So I started by playing them on the tv and using my phone making a video from the tv. It was hard tiring and the quality was terrible. My other son sent me a copy of software I could buy. I don’t have time to learn how to use software. I don’t have time to take them to a professional- cost was no option and I didn’t care but no time. Plus I don’t even know what was on these tapes and videos.  So while I was scanning at the software and freaking out I saw this. The reviews were pretty good and it looked easy. I got the item and I hoped it would work right and actually I had no idea what I was doing. After some practice I have to say this item was awesome. I sat on the couch watching the videos pushing the copy button which transferred to my SD Card. I emptied off the SD Card after about 30 minutes of video onto my laptop at a time.  Worked on my camcorder- then a small portable vhs. I pulled all that I wanted - took every second of time I had free. But it was so easy!!!!! I added a channel to my youtube account and uploaded all the videos. I then added content to them all. The whole family has been watching. He was so happy!!! This item is Worth every single penny!!!! A great investment. I have shared this items information with so many people. We didn’t know this existed. Oh and I didn’t need to edit a thing! If I didn’t pull the copy right I just rewound and did it again. So easy! Thank you so much for this product. If you -The Seller - could only see the smiles and tears this project gave to us. Happy New Year!
5,I love the screen size and giant buttons; very easy to navigate and setup. The frame rate capture is buttery smooth at nearly 60fps (59.94). SD card feature is great I don’t plan on using USB but nice that it’s there too. S-video capture looks great. The screen is an OK monitor but the actual recorded result has a nice quality. Too bad this isn’t battery powered but I found that it be powered with an iPad using an adapter so I can convert and edit tape video on the go which I bought for this intention. A+ for that. The plastic build does feel cheap though and it is a pricey device but still definitely indispensable for me. In the future it would be great see this device updated with a battery and USB-C for power and data transfer.
5,I love this thing. Well designed and easy to use--it does exactly what it's supposed to do. Also the Clearclick people were incredibly helpful to talk to. They helped make sure I got the right device for what I needed. Great experience all around.
5,I looked around at various options on Amazon for capturing VHS videos to digital. While many were cheaper than this ClearClick Video2Digital solution they involved connecting a VCR or camcorder to a PC directly via a composite/s-video to USB connector and then installing drivers and software.In looking at reviews of these cheaper products many complained about capture anomalies and compatibility issues with the drivers and/or software. I decided this solution was worth the price as it avoids any such hassles. You connect your player directly to this device and it records/encodes the videos as MP4s directly to an SD card or flash drive.That isn’t to say I didn’t have issues. I initially purchased the following flash drive as it came up on Amazon as commonly purchased with the Video2Digital converter:PNY 128GB Turbo Attaché 3 USB 3.0... https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FE2N1WS?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_shareAfter capturing several videos I noticed that the audio was running faster than the video. While synced at the start of the video after about 30 minutes the audio was more than 5 seconds ahead of the video. This made many of the MP4s unwatchable as you would hear someone talking several seconds before their lips would move.I contacted ClearClick support and they immediately responded that they would look into it after asking about the equipment I was using. The support specialist indicated that the flash drive I bought had per many Amazon reviews slow and inconsistent write times and that slow media devices accounted for most audio/video sync issues.I was a bit skeptical but I decided to purchase the following USB drive due to its good reviews and faster write times:ARCANITE 128GB USB 3.1 Flash... https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RWPF43G?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_shareAnd that did the trick. Everything is now recording accurately and I’m making good progress on capturing a large home movie collection. The support at ClearClick is very responsive and helpful and I would recommend this device as a great solution for converting analog to digital.
5,Years and years of home video on VHS 8mm tape and digital tape… the passing of parents and receiving their home videos… it would have literally cost a fortune to pay one of those services to digitize all of these! The hardest part of the process using this converter was finding working cameras or VCRs to connect it to. Image quality is pretty good and the process was simple. Now that I’ve finished transferring what I had I’ll be passing this around to family members so they can transfer theirs too. I’m happy I bought this converter and highly recommend it.
5,This is simple to use.  I didn't rate the tech support because none was needed.  Connect to your VHS player with the cord that is included. As long as you understand that converting to digital doesn't improve the quality of the video you will be happy.  It doesn't lose any clarity but it only copies what is playing.  Also know that it records in real time.  So a 30 minute home video takes 30 minutes to record.  The screen is big enough to make it easy to watch while you record if you want to.
5,I have lots of old VHS tapes digital videos and "party" DVDs that really needed to be digitized if only to clear out some space in my garage. This gadget is just what I was looking for. It small well designed and does a great job. My ancient and dying VHS player digital video camera and DVD player have RCA standard red white and yellow (audio and video) outputs so they are easy to plug into this converter. It is powered by USB and comes with a transformer and cable. It only lacks an SD card but being an amateur photographer I have lots of SD cards available.I can just say a short prayer plug in my old gadget pop in a tape or disk refresh my failing memory and hit play. The playback shows up on the sharp 3.5" screen. All I have to do is hit record. There is an automatic timer but it is limited to 30 60 90 and 120 minutes. That means I have to keep an eye on the process to stop it at the end of the tape or disk. Despite this minor flaw transferring from physical media to an MP4 file on an SD card is pretty straightforward.I have been able to use SD cards (or micro-SD cards with an adapter) right out of the bullet proof plastic wrapper. Most of the popular brands like Sandisk come formatted in the appropriate FAT or EX-FAT manner. To get the video files onto my Mac I just use an SD card reader that plugs into my computer. Macs seem to be able to read the files just fine so I can copy them with the Finder. I would be very surprised if this didn't work on Windows. (I go on about this because the documentation and some comments note possible format problems but odds are most people will never see them.)All told a great little gadget.
4,I bought this because the adapters that connect directly to the computer sometimes do not work when Windows updates interfere with the feed. After familiarizing myself the unit is easy to use and produces reasonably good video files. I found the results were often a bit superior to video transfer devices and occasionally slightly inferior.Pluses:1. Easy to set up and use. The buttons are actually quite responsive so don't make my initial mistake of holding it down for a few seconds.2. Good results.3. Easy to transfer to a PC and use the video files.4. The unit can be set to record for specific time periods.5. It is supposed to sense when the video signal stops (Signal Loss detection) and shut off the recording.Minuses:1. Sometimes the audio is out of synch with the video and I have to re-record it. If you use this for live video feeds that cannot be re-recorded you may want to consider something else.2. The unit can be set to record for specific time periods. This works fine but I wish there was more flexibility either with several more selections or the ability to enter a custom time. If I have a source that's 61 minutes long I have  to record 90 minutes. The longest setting is 150 minutes so longer sources may just keep recording blank/unwanted video until you shut it off.3. The unit is supposed to sense when the video signal stops but it doesn't seem to work that well.4. It is supposed to sense when the video signal stops (Signal Loss detection) and shut off the recording. This sometimes works. Fortunately it creates a series of video files that splice together just fine so you just delete the empty ones.5. When the power is unplugged the unit reverts to 1/1/2019. Not that important (to me) just an annoyance.
5,I've avoided purchasing this for quite a while. I was sure I could get my computer to record the video but after adding a firewire card adjusting drivers installing software it never really worked. In the end my tapes were beginning to degrade and I didn't want to take the chance they would stop working. So I bit the bullet and purchased this. It works just as it says. It is simple and straight forward. The video quality is a little worse than I expected but that's just because the camera is old and it's just recording from RCA and S-Video inputs instead of the firewire/dv but much better than nothing. While it is worse than expected it is by no means "bad" it's just fine for archiving these old tapes. If you've had issues getting your old tapes converted to digital I highly recommend this device.
5,Simple plug and play. I love it
5,This is a remarkable piece of equipment. It has helped me realize a dream I've had for years.Like many I created and kept many VHS videos from long ago. Some of these were of business meetings. Some were from friends and relatives (many no longer with us) and other memories. I wanted to have a way to view these old VHS tapes through today's MP4 files.Well this device allows me to create the MP4 videos that are a lot easier to view will last much longer than the eroding VHS tapes (yes they go bad after a while) and I can easily share these (no copyright involved so it is legal) with other family and friends if I want.Word of caution. I've read some of the negative views and the problems with syncing video and audio. I had some problems with video that wouldn't record at all. I was very concerned that I had been "taken" on a promise too good.Well the problem was not in this device but in me using some very old USB drives that were way too slow for video recording. The (easy) solution was to order some more updated USB drives that were faster and have plenty of room. Once I used the more updated USB drives all the videos I've transferred thus far have come out great. Even better than I thought they would.If you've got a bunch of those old VHS tapes hanging around in boxes in the attic this could be the ticket for you. I am re-discovering principles and ideas I had years ago. This is more than just watching memories. Yes that is nice and it is good to do it. This is giving me insight into ideas that I needed to hear again but had forgotten. It also has given me insight into ideas that I thought were great years ago but now I see they aren't. I can revisit the "younger me" of years ago and learn for today and into the future.Thank you to the people who put this device together. You have helped get my dreams back.
5,This product was a game changer. I have several old camcorder videos and this device was able to easily transfer them over to a thumb drive. Now they are backed up and easily playable on my HDTV since this device can use an HDMI and/or composite cable. If you and/or your parents etc have old camcorder videos you need this device asap to preserve them and make them easily sharable.
5,This is so much easier than using a USB device and capturing via a computer. The auto stop settings are a huge help with allowing to "set and forget" a conversion. Use a high quality fast write speed SD and you won't have any issues. Video/Audio quality are as good as a VHS copy could be
5,Years ago we had Super 8 film of family recorded onto VHS. I uncovered these VHS tapes recently and wanted to preserve the recordings digitally.After an unsuccessful purchase of a different dongle I settled on this one. I can't believe how well it works. As mentioned in the description you only need an SD card / thumb drive and a VCR. A computer isn't even necessary (except to transfer the recordings onto)!This device displays the video (and audio) being captured in real-time. I recorded in 15-20 minute chunks; pressing the record button off and back on automatically saves the subsequent recording as a new file. So I did not experience the corrupted files that some reviewers were mentioning as I didn't use the auto-off feature.I did find that - when I toggled record on and off when the VCR was running but nothing was showing on the tape - it would cause the unit to freeze and restart. The power cycling only took 20-30 seconds and it was back to being ready to record but it is worth mentioning.Preserving recordings of long-passed family members and sharing them digitally has been awesome and this product made it very easy!
5,I had tried a similar device which had audio sync issues so got this since it specifically stated it had a mechanism in place to combat that... and of course the .mp4 output was extremely convenient.  At first I had some issues similar to what I'd seen mentioned before: obligatory video slicing happening when "the end" of the video had been reached... but it went beyond that and seemed to happen arbitrarily and then later... the resulting file would sometimes vanish when I was trying to move it.  I asked technical support about a firmware upgrade which they were more than happy to help with... but had me look for the start of what mine mentioned for version and said if it said THAT I already had the latest.  When I asked what the trouble could be they were quick to blame the media I was using but it seemed unlikely to me that every USB key I'd bought in the last several years had some fatal flaw.  The thing is: if you know anything about disc formatting then for a project like this you automatically format as NTFS since FAT32 has a 3GB max file size limit... and these videos could easily be larger than that.  But with these recurring issues I "tried it their way" by letting the device format the disc instead.  I'm forced to assume they've chosen some nonstandard allocation size for their FAT32 format as virtually every file it has made has been well over the 3GB limit and had ZERO issue but I would not ask your computer or anything other than this device format the media since I do not know what settings they are picking just that I can't seem to duplicate it.  Whatever they're using my PC reads it fine after that's all that matters.  I've digitized at least a hundred VHS with this thing and it does terrifically.
5,I like the ease of use and tech support is great.  I have a win10 laptop and my flash drive worked right out of package.  Highly recommend that you use the Sandisk 3.0 flash drive  for best performance.  I loved my Sony but it was a lot of extra work because it went to a DVD disk this is super easy and I have more editing flexibility with the mp4 file .  The video quality is good in spite of my old VHS tapes.  Thanks ClearClick!
3,I got this to capture some old Digital8 Tapes from a working Sony-TRV720.  The first one I received I tested capture via RCA cables and also via S-Video. Theoretically S-video should be the best quality there.  Tested with several different high end SD cards. I'm a photographer I don't buy crap cards.  That said it IS finicky on what brand of cards it will work with. I got it to work on SanDisk and PNY.First unit was giving digital artifacts via S-video but not present with RCA. No difference in resolution noted even when viewing on a 4K monitor. Resolution-wise it was actually pretty decent given that it's Digital8 720 footage.I was excited for a solution at first and noted the monitor on this device was noticeably darker than the one on the camera. Not a big deal what matters is what is captured. And thus the disappointing part. The footage actually was dark by nearly 50% the original.I had noted some other comments in questions and reviews and it states in the description this is fixed in this newer version so I called tech support.  Their solution was to send me some free crappy editing software to "lighten up" the footage.  Well no thanks. I have Davinci Resolve Studio I can professionally manipulate footage any way I want and trying to "lighten up" old low resolution footage like this only introduces other artifacts and is not satisfactory.  I saw some other comments about needing to update the firmware. They didn't ask so I offered that up. They said I had the latest and could return it for a replacement so I did.So I just got the replacement and in testing getting the exact same results. Footage is too dark by nearly 50%.  Artifacts again via S-video but fine via RCA.  I was inclined to return it but decided in a worst case scenario it's an easy to use device to crap some footage that might otherwise be completely lost. So I guess I will keep it. Just knows the limitations with this device. Given those I feel like it should be selling for half what it does.Given this camera I have has firewire I was able to find a highly rated firewire card that supposedly works with Windows 10 so going to try that route.
5,I had VCR tapes that I wanted to digitalize but wasn't sure what was on them. I was really glad that I ordered this. If I had sent my tapes to be done I would have been highly disappointed since what I had was mostly stuff I had no reason to keep.  But the things I did find were treasures and I was able to digitalize them.  Good points about this item is that it works! Bad points form me is that it was small and hard to see but the recordings I saved and uploaded to my computer looked good.  Sound and video was really good for old tapes.  Also I couldn't hear from the device very well. I wish it had an ear jack. But those are my picky points.  I really liked using this and bypassing trying to figure out software or sending tapes to be converted to CD or digital.  Once I'm done the device won't be needed anymore but it was much cheaper than paying someone to digitalize things that I would have not wanted.  I will most likely try to sell it once I am finished with it.  But overall I am happy with my purchase.
5,So a few years ago I spent a couple weeks pulling a bunch of old VHS to .mp4 files- I assumed they were all ehh quality because they were 30-ish year old tapes recorded off TV- was very mad when I realized the cheap  ($50) converter I was using was actually converting the picture poorly.Screen grab taken from 29 year old low quality (SLP- 6 hour) VHS paused on my computerWriting this because I have a collection of old VHS that got me though some interesting times as a kid and finally being able to capture these in such unexpected quality was so exciting.
5,This was easy to set uo and came with the necessary cables. The USB cable needed for power was a bit short for my setup but I was able to to place it easily enough.We found a vcr at goodwill to play the big tapes and the little ones can be played with the old video camera we had.
5,I have used the ClearClick Video2Digital Converter Ver 2.0 to convert my 8 Hi8 and Digital8 video tapes to MP4 computer files.  All tapes were played back to ClearClick with my Sony DRC-TRV350 Digital Handycam video camera; about 35 tapes already converted and another 20 or more to go.  ClearClick works as advertised with resolution to my eye about the same as the video camera playback.  The MP4 file output and the ClearClick display are a little darker than the Sony Display output.  In some cases that makes a better clearer video file than the original tape playback and in other cases it is a little too dark.  I am expecting to be able to fix this while editing the MP4 files since I will now be able to conveniently edit  playback and store my video files unlike my tapes.I recommend a few practice files before getting into mass conversion as some of the function buttons and display icons take a little familiarity before complete understanding.  The manual does cover everything but there are some subtle differences between the descriptions of the buttons and functions that is helpful to understand and resolve in your mind with practice beforehand.  For example some function buttons have dual functions depending upon the length of time you depress the button be sure you have a feel for this.I used an SD card in ClearClick so did not test the USB flash drive option I was very happy with the SD card use but I expect the flash drive is also convenient.  I also used the S-video input with the RCA audio input for all my conversions because I could and because some think S-video is better than Composite video I couldn't tell the difference myself in the quality of the output of s-video compared to RCA Composite video.
5,It is very simple to use and I wish I could say it works perfectly but it doesn't quite. Even though I don't have it set to automatically cut off it will clip some video that was there. Don't know if its an old bad tape the vcr heads or what but I can't seem to get a clean video all the time. I have concluded there is no great solution to transfer your VHS videos to mp4. Don't get me wrong this is not a bad solution but I would do one tape at a time transfer it to a computer edit it in a good editor save it back to mp4 renamed to whatever naming convention you have decided on into to a folder with all the others then move all of them to wherever you want them archived.
5,I've got the older version it was great but I like newer version better.
4,The product was fine but I didn’t really need it. Disappointed in the return. Instead of refunding my credit card they added it to a gift card I didn’t know I had
5,As a video producer I put this little unit through its paces. Remember mixed cassette tapes? After hooking this unit up directly off a Blu Ray DVD player with RCA outputs I enjoyed getting single selections off of several DVD concerts and making a mixed music flash drive. Although the picture and sound quality are a bit degraded from the origional  they are great to watch off your TV smartphone or tablet. VHS tapes home videos and even lap top instructional videos are easy to make on this unit. Most folks don't want DVD's anymore so going directly to MP4 is a real time saver with transferring home videos. Also I use this unit off of CCD video camers that record video through telescopes at the Crewe Observatory. Kim Kenny  - CAC
5,I love it. It’s very easy to use!
5,I hooked this up to my old Sony Hi8 camcorder to transfer some old videos of my kids into a streaming format.  Worked the first time with no issues.  Great for people who don't want to figure out how to do video grabbing directly on a Mac or a PC.
5,Glad this product was made I was able to able to transfer all of grandpas scat films onto dvd and onto his phone.
4,This product works as advertised. The video instructions were especially helpful.
5,This was the best investment ever! My grandmother who passed away in February 2020 left behind many VHS cassettes of family memories from as early as 1995 or so. In a time where most people don't own a VCR anymore I wanted to digitize these videos so that my aunt's uncle's siblings and cousins as well as their children could enjoy watching and reminiscing over the good ol' days. I purchased this adapter and it was perfect! All you need is a VCR and the adapter because you can see the video playing on the adapter screen. Oh yeah you do need a USB drive of some sort to store the videos. I really like the auto signal loss detection feature which allows the recording to stop once the the tape is playing but no longer has a video signal. This was perfect because all I needed to do was press play and record and I could go about my business doing something else without having to monitor the recording to manually stop it. I really like this product and it saved me a whole lot of money versus using a professional service. I converted approximately 30 VHS videos to digital form and then also uploaded them to YouTube unlisted and was able to share the link with my family member so that they could see the videos. I still plan on copying the files over to some type of hard disk such as a DVD or large storage disc just as another backup.
5,This product was amazingly easy to use.  I was so happy to be able to transfer my old VHS & 8MM to a flash drive.  I just wish it also transferred SD cards to flash drives also.
2,In the last 15 years I've been trying to convert all of our old home movies. I have a Panasonic VHS to DVD tape deck. It takes VHS's and records them directly to a DVD. Being that it's a 15+-year-old deck I figured the conversion wouldn't be as good as what some newer stuff can do. I also liked the idea of this being able to record a straight digital file because with the VHS to DVD deck 2-hour VHS tapes are really like 2 hours and 4 minutes long and the DVD will cut off at 2 hours. So I'm missing a few minutes.But after doing a side-by-side comparison of the file that the ClearClick Video and a DVD rip of my 15-year-old deck it's clear that converting to DVD and then ripping that file is still the best option. See the side-by-side photo attached. The ClearClick file just looks washed out. Details in highlights and darks are not captured as well as the tape deck. And there are just some artifacts around edges that show that over-sharpening has been applied.I reached out the ClearClick to check to see if there was a firmware update and brought up my issue. They were responsive and asked for a sample video to check. They confirmed that I'm using all the proper settings and suggested that I use the Yellow Video input instead of the S-Video. Which doesn't give any better of a resolution.I hate to say it but I had to return the device because the video quality wasn't any better than what I already had. As an Art Director I'm pretty particular with how things look. And if I'm archiving old home movies I want to make sure I'm working with the best possible file. Also note I did take the file into Premiere and did some color correcting to match the DVD rip. While much better there was still a loss of detail in the darks and lights and still the artifacting.I'm also unsure why so many people are taking photos of the device or computer screen showing their videos? This isn't showing any useful info other than the device working. It creates a digital file. Load that file into your computer and take a screenshot of it within the OS and post that. This screenshot will help people so much more than just taking a photo of your screen.
5,This worked fine for what I needed it to (Converting my old Sony Hi-8 recordings of wedding and other life events over to digital. I tried other means of converting my Hi-8 tapes to digital before such as the computer-based ones that required software. Those sucked and I sent them back to Amazon. This was very easy especially compared with the sucky computer/software-based ones that I returned. One Con was it is NOT rechargeable and must be plugged in to use it. Also it did not magically convert my old Hi-8-quality recordings into better recordings than the original (Okay on that last con I am just engaging in smart-assery. :-) Because hey garbage/average Hi-8 quality in garbage/average quality digital video out. No surprises there.).
5,I had considered using one of the services available to transfer our old VHS tapes to digital. This seemed a very reasonable alternative if it worked. The biggest problem was finding a workable VCR player. Having secured one I read the instructions for this product and watched a YouTube video. In about 10 minutes I was in business.This is very easy to use. I have transferred a bunch of tapes to digital. The copies are not the best in quality but that’s due to the limitations of the VHS technology.The screen though small is very clear. The only real negative is that the volume at its highest setting is not very loud.All in all this is a very good value.
4,The ClearClick easily enables you to digitize your old VHS tapes.  Instructions are clear and intuitive picture quality reproduction is excellent.  All that is needed is a working VCR and connecting cables; there is no computer hook-up.  Importantly a 32GB or larger San Disk flash drive or disc must be used for the ClearClick to reliably transfer data.  Customer service was exceptionally responsive and helpful.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 The converter works great!Don’t expect 4K quality from a video CamCorder from late 80s early 90s. I’ve been wanting to bring all of our home videos into a digital format and this does the trick!What ever the quality of the video camera that’s what your MP4 will be.I first used a 1 TB external drive and I think it was to much to power but 128 gig flash drive captured everything with seamless effort. I then connected to my computer and external hard drive to name and copy the MP4. I start the copy process and walk away- the ClearClick device stops when no video signal is present so no sitting to wait for a 2 hour video to finish. It copies in real time. The display is great for monitoring the video and a small speaker let’s you hear what playing!I  very happy with the product!I had to buy a VCR I chose a Sony 4 head Hi-Fi stereo. If you are converting memories don’t scrimp or you may be very disappointed. I paid $125 for the VCR- some were as high as $800 which is ridiculous! Read the rating of the VCR seller!The price and product of the ClearClick is worth it!
4,This product is well worth the money.  I purchased this product because I have several  mini 8mm tapes I need to convert to digital format.  Previously I sent several 8mm videos to an online business because I the 8mm video player was inoperable; they did a good job but it cost a little more then I wanted to pay and they took a while to get everything back. For this project I do have a mini 8mm video tapes and the video camera still works so I opted to purchase the ClearClick Video to Digital Converter 2.0 (Second Generation) to convert mini 8mm to digital format vs sending the videos tapes in to get them digitized. I've already converted several mini 8mm videos and I just received it two days ago this product works as advertised.  Didn't give it 5 starts because the SD card does not have an indent to grab the SD card and it does not eject when press upon thus it does not come out easily; if it ejected when press on - 5 Stars *****On a Sunday I sent an email to Customer Support for the firmware update they answered within an hour (Wow).  Provide them the information about the device and they provided a .zip to me within the next hour.  Put the files on the root of the USB I was using followed the instructions and it self installed without any issues.Very happy with ClearClick Video to Digital Converter 2.0 (Second Generation) so far...
4,I was impressed at how simple it was to set up this device since it attempts to cross technologies that seem to come and go rather quickly. It integrated easily with the VCR and VHS tapes but I'm still working with the mp4 file created to get it to play reproducibly i.e. first time second time etc. I'll let you know how I make out.
5,Love the design. Very easy to use.A few issues with conversion after I had used it a while.  Manual says to try s-video if pictures are glitchy. First few tapes I converted had no problems. Some glitchy-ness with later tapes.Problem resolved thanks to excellent customer service!!ClearClick sent s-video converter when I commented that neither my camcorder nor VCR had s-video ports. Works great.
4,I am writing this since I have time now and do not know if/when tech support will get back to me.  And what time/energy I will have then. I did make one transfer from a VHS to flash drive to computer successfully.  I have now spent hours trying to make a second recording. The basic problem is that when I hit the Stop/record button to stop recording nothing happens other than occasionally I get a screenshot. The record icon continues to display.  if I ht the power button the video disappears but the sound continues. The Mode button seems inconsistent in what it displays.So I give this one star HOPING that either tech support can easily point out the problem  or a replacement will work properly.  I would live to give this 5 stars.Update 12/12/20Well with the great help of Tech Support I am using this device successfully.  My problem was that I was mistaking the appearance of the camera icon for actual recording. The camera icon just means "in recording mode"; unless the counter immediately to the right of the icon is counting I wasn't recording.  So I've upgrated my rating to 4 stars.  I need to use the converter a bit more before I give 5 stars.
5,I read all of the negative reviews and had some concerns. There are many other less expensive devices available but their negative reviews were even more concerning so I decided to take the plunge with this one. My project included converting about 2 dozen Hi 8 tapes from when my kids were growing up. I priced out a local service that does this kind of work but it would have cost me way more to have it done that way so I figured I’d invest in this device.This unit was truly plug & play. Connect power; connect Red/White/Yellow cables to the camera and this device; plug in a memory stick; use the menu to select the date/time and format for saving the media; hit Play on the camera and hit Record on the device. Easy Peasy. The only thing I did have a brief issue with was that when I went to transfer a MP4 file to my computer it said that the file was corrupted. I realized that I never hit “Stop” on the device when I was done recording which I’m guessing meant that the MP4 file never had an End Of File marker. Hitting “Stop” when I was done with each tape resolved that issue and it never happened again.I didn’t get into any of the other features so I can’t speak to those.I’m happy with the results I got from this device. The sole purpose was to digitize all these old tapes so that everyone can watch these memories by simply plugging a memory stick directly into a smart TV. Mission Accomplished.
5,Very easy to use.  I would add a line level booster for audio control since the audio is a bit on the low side.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08L4WYSZ4/ref=cfb_at_prodpg is a good inexpensive choice and has been working well for me.
4,This converter does what is says and is very simple to use. My only complaint is that it does not support external hard drives so you must use a usb flash drive or SD card and then transfer the files to an external HD (if that’s your backup method of choice).  It’s only one extra step but when you’re doing multiple files it becomes an inconvenience.Also be warned the instructions do state that an external drive is not supported so heed this warning! I made the mistake of plugging mine in before reading all the instructions and it prompted me to format the drive. Mine was exFAT. I chose NOT to format it when prompted and disconnected it but it somehow still changed something where I could no longer access it on a PC without having to reformat it and thus lose all the data on it. Luckily I had a duplicate backup so it wasn’t a big issue for me but this could potentially have been disastrous.
5,I needed to transfer a Hi8 tape to digital; my niece's first filmed Christmas in 2004.  My sister never saw it because she didn't have a camera.  I first tried Dazzle...I've used them for years.  Didn't have a driver (new computer) so I bought a new one.  I was so disappointed with it.  Skipped frames pixelated; what a let down.  I thought there would be some issue since the tape was 18 yrs old.  I was very hesitant to buy the clear click.  It was pricey and if it didn't work I was out another few days trying to find something else (this is for her graduation in June).  This is no lie...the hardest thing about this product was opening the package!  I really didn't need to read the instructions.  I just plugged it in plugged in my external hard drive's USB (works with an SD card too) plugged in the connecting wires from my Hi8 camera hit the play button on my camera and the record button on the device.  When it was over I hit the stop record button.  That was it.  Just reviewed the video on my laptop.  The quality of video was awesome!  No pixelation no dropped frames.  It was like it was taped yesterday.  I'm so relieved that something with this project actually worked! Not a single glitch😁
4,I purchased the 2.0 version do not need the product long term since I have a limited number of vhs and Hi8 videos to digitize. Works excellent! No problems so far converted 5 videos so far. Good product!
5,I am very pleased with this product.  It's super-easy to use and works as advertised.You just plug it in turn it on pop in a Flashdrive to the USB port on the converter device and get ready to record.To record you simply plug in the audio/video cords (they come with the device) from the device to your VCR hit PLAY on the VCR and RECORD on the device and it starts recording. When it finishes the recording will have saved on the Flashdrive as an MP4 file and you are all done.There are extra features on the menu option of the device if you wish to use them.By default the converter device will record at an aspect ratio of 3:2.  This is fine with video in the last 5=10 years or so with the now wider televisions etc...  But if you recorded the original video sometime before that there is an option on the Menu selection to change the ratio to 4:3 which may have been the original size your video was recorded in if it was before the time that wider TVs became the norm. Otherwise the video may have a slightly stretched look.  It's a simple selection on the menu to correct it.So in conclusion great product!I've been putting off converting old VHS home movies into digital files for safekeeping because I thought it would be a hassle but this product has made it very easy to do the job. I'm pleased.
5,This product was so easy to use and works great to convert our old home videos! We tried a few cheaper versions first that didn’t do the sound or picture quality well. This was totally worth the extra money!
5,The VHS to digital conversion process is a daunting and headache filled process. Previously I attempted to convert with one of those PC dongles with all the cables hanging off. That never worked right the software was bad and support was non-existent. Fast forward to this device being available and the whole process has changed for the better. Everything you need (almost) comes in the box and you can get up and running in a few minutes. I cannot believe how easy this device makes the process.I did have an issue where the video was occasionally jittery both on the device display and in the final digitized video. This judder effect was not present if I connected the VCR directly to the TV so something was off. I emailed ClearClick support and they quickly (I mean QUICK and on the weekend too) had a composite to S-Video adapter in the mail and once it arrived the problem was solved. I am extremely happy with the level of support received and that they didn't give me a hard time about the issue.If you're looking for a simple no fuss solution to digitize your tape library this is your device hands down. My only recommendations are to ensure that you are using a high quality SD card and video cables. This thing is the real deal!
4,I'll try to keep this short which is hard because I usually leave super lengthy reviews...I bought this because I have many family vhs recordings many of which are already starting to fade and fall apart (some literally). I wanted a way to make a digital backup before it's too late.I've backed up about 6 tapes now all different lengths in video. The video that transfers is just about the same quality as what I'm seeing on the vhs and so goes the same for sound. I would leave 5 stars but I can't.The reason it's not 5 stars is because any family videos that were shaky in the vhs (filmed with a shaky hand) comes out WAY too shaky on the transfer. I'm talking EXPONENTIALLY more shaky (it almost looks like it's skipping frames). It makes it almost dizzy to watch sometimes. I think this is more an artifact of the device's transfer process than anything else. The vhs isn't as bad. It leaves me needing to find alternative ways of transferring shakier videos (ex: filmed while boating or walking)
5,I've been in the Video business over 40 years doing everything from Broadcast to Industrial. First impression:  Great Video and Audio Quality and very quick and easy to use.  There is a little barely noticeable picture degradation but very acceptable for non-Broadcast use and hard to beat for the price.  If you want the better quality... it will cost you at least $1.5K more.  Audio level was great and I did not have low audio or other issues others reported.  I can confirm this does appear to have a TBC to fix the signal.  Check out the VHS photos... B&W is the crappy Original Color is the image from the ClearClick.Great unit... Makes transferring Consumer videos a breeze and I just hand the client the USB Thumb drive.
5,Was able to transfer old analog Sony tapes to digital.  Also digitized a VHS tape.  Really easy to use and did an excellent job.  Would highly recommend
5,a few days ago i pulled out my old laserdisc player from the garage to see if it still worked. i've got lots of obscure cartoon collections and i wanted to show them to my kids. after watching several cartoons i thought "wouldn't it be cool to be able to digitize these?' a little searching on amazon led me to this fantastic and easy to use little device...most of my LD's are titles i'm not interested in or i've bought again on bluray. but a few of them are cartoons they haven't (or won't) release on dvd or bluray... so i can now easily make digital copies and i'm very happythe one minor complaint i have and won't affect most people interested in this thing: it automatically makes 60 frame per second files. these cartoons are 24 fps. it would be great to be able to set the frame rate for the material being recorded. it would REALLY be cool if you could tell the device to split up files at chapter stops for sets like this where you would want each cartoon as a separate file... again this is a minor quibble that only affects the animators of the world (like me)very cool device nonethelessedited to add the following: after copying ten sides of a collection i must say the final quality isn't stellar. the thing seems to have trouble with 'fade in's'. as a shot fades from black to full exposure it makes these transitions kind of 'blocky'. nevertheless i'm happy to have a way to digitize these discs....
5,Worked very well no issues takes a bit to get used to it the end results are nice!
5,I thought I would have to write a negative review but now I have to write a glowing review. When I first received the product everything seemed to work but the voice quickly got out of sync just like with other devices and I was using a brand new USB3 drive with it. I got quite angry thinking that "once again" I had been taken in buying a product that could not do what it promised.  Long story short I did email customer service and they quickly diagnosed that even though I had a new "thumb drive" that had a high read speed it had horrible write speeds (So the device could not keep up). I swapped that for an SD card I had on hand that had decent write speed and problem solved. They also helped with other questions. So now I must say that they seem to be an exceptionally good and honest company. They are candid in the product description of what this device will and will not do. Just read the description. Also so many people seem to ask questions like where does the tape go - it doesn't! No tape film nothing goes inside (except SD card) It simply CAPTURES the video and audio signal either composite or S video and audio (red/white RCA connection) Follow the rather simple instructions and you will have good Mpeg4 files saved to the SD card or USB that you can play on most modern devices. Once again two thumbs up for customer service and product that does what it says it will.
5,I have to say that I was skeptical something so small could transfer my movies. When I looked up to see how expensive it was to send my movies out and have it professionally done I knew that was not an option. I had about 40 movies to convert. So the price of this unit if it worked would be a good deal. I am blown away at how easy it was. I have not seen these movies in 20 years and it brought tears to my eyes. We now have movie night with popcorn as we watch the movies on my large screen television. A little word of warning though as I found out the hard way… I uploaded all of my movies to YouTube (either unlisted or private). There were Christmas movies and birthday movies and beach movies and most of them with background music of some kind. Most music was considered Infringement of copyright even though most of the songs were pretty old including the traditional Christmas songs. And most of The music was so faint because of all of the action being recorded in front of it. Some songs I could not even pick out but somehow YouTube did. They deleted some of my movies because of maybe one song that you could hardly even hear and others they gave me a warning and I had to either cut that part of the movie out or delete all sound from that segment of the movie. And they only give you a week to fix it. So just want to give you a heads up that because your movies are now digital There may be copyright Infringements when You upload them.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 You really do get what you pay for.  I bought a subpar 30 dollar gizmo and had horrible results.  This device not only gives you a preview of the tape you're converting or you can passive display it on a TV with an HDMI cable!  The transfer is simple intuitive and so flawless.  I'm super impressed with this device.Let's face it there's only a certain level of quality you can get from a Hi-8 or VCR tape and this device pulls every bit of video data available.  One thing to consider is to make sure you have rca cables inputted for both left and right audio -- I had to buy a Y splitter because of my funky cable for the HI-8 camcorder so I can split the mono audio into separate channels.I haven't used the USB option but my high-speed SD card I use for my digital camera works flawlessly.  No skips or degrade in image at all.  Can't say enough good things about this device -- something I've been looking to obtain for years.The video clip I posted is 20 years old from a HI-8 vacation tape -- it was very windy and before I used the Y splitter so I only have audio in one channel.
5,This device works like magic! Easy to use. Easy to hook up. It even pauses recording when it detects stacic or no picture.Got so mom could convert her old home movies from vhs to digital. It is the perfect solution! You can use its built in screen or a tv screen.
5,What a great video transferring tool. I literally had it up and running in less than 5 minutes from the package to the recorder.
4,This little gadget works.  Is relatively easy to operate.I have quite a few video tapes.  Since new machines can’t be had rebuilds are very expensive and only last so long this is a less expensive alternative to buying often exorbitantly expensive DVDs.The thumbnail picture is of slightly less quality than the video.Am satisfied with this purchase.
5,Ever since the pandemic started I made a goal to get all of my family's old home videos on VHS-C and 8mm tapes converted to digital. I went through two cheaper $30 converters from other companies before this one. This is one of the instances where what you pay is what you get for. Compared to the other 2 cheaper options I tried this ClearClick converter worked like a charm and was so much simpler too! A computer isn't required and all the cables you need are included. The only thing you need is a thumb drive USB and a WORKING camcorder to play your tapes. I bought the thumb drive they recommended and had no issues. I've spent at least 50 hours converting tapes and trust me it won't get any simpler than this. You just put a tape in turn on the camcorder and ClearClick converter make sure everything's plugged in correctly and hit the record button! Once you've finished recording plug the USB thumbdrive into your computer and your new digital video is ready! And the quality is great too! Not only is the product itself great but when I needed to talk to customer service they responded very fast and were very helpful. They are super knowledgeable about the products they are selling. My experience with their customer service was one of the BEST customer service interactions I've had. Save yourself time and stress and buy this converter. It's worth it!
5,After reading mostly positive reviews on the ClearClick Video2Digital Converter 2/0 I decided to purchase one. I have lots of VHS tapes from years ago and was concerned about them deteriorating over time and thought it would be a good idea to convert them to digital. I also purchased a 64GB SanDisk Extreme Pro SD card. I had read up on the trouble some folks were having and it seemed that some of it was caused by slow or inferior SD cards. I got mine on Amazon for $19 bucks. After reading the directions formatting my SD card on my Mac hooking everything up and remembering how to operate my VCR I was off and running.  This thing is simple to use and the quality of the machine seems to be very good. The screen is clear and the controls are simple. In a little over four hours I had converted three tapes to digital. I then inserted the SD card into my Mac laptop and WOW!! The videos were converted flawlessly. I now plan to download them to YouTube after editing them. If you buy the ClearClick 2.0 take your time and read the directions. Also check out the question and answer section for this product on Amazon as it may answer all the questions you may have. Overall this thing is GREAT and saved me a lot of money over paying someone to convert all my tapes to digital.
5,Had a ton of 8mm tapes I made from my 2001 Sony Camcorder that I wanted to convert to digital format. I was lucky. I had the camcorder and the necessary cable that came with the camcorder. Easy hookup just followed instructions and the digital quality was excellent no complaints whatsoever. Worth the money I spent and now I have all tapes converted.Note: consider breaking down the longer segments in your tape into shorter “episodes” if possible like I did at most 7-8 minute runtimes or else the converted digital segment will be quite large. Do not recommend converted a 2 hour tape into one digital file! Nopity nope…
4,I tried using the cheaper way of plugging in a device to my computer and using crappy software to transfer my old vhs tapes. I had way too many problems doing it that way. Like they say you get what you pay for. This device has been great for the most part. It has a built in screen so you can see what you're transferring and it includes audio. I use an SD card to transfer the videos to my computer. The only real hiccup I've had is some videos the audio is not synced with the video. I don't think it's necessarily the device as it only happens on some videos. There are ways to correct it such as using VLC and manually syncing it. The only problem with that is it won't let you save the synced video. It's worth it though because you have family videos that are now digital instead of rotting away on tape. I recommend this device it's simple to use and works well!
5,Straight out the box plugged it in connected it up and press record. Easy as one two three. The best device I have bought this year. I had several Hi8 PAL and NTSC tapes VHS and VHS-C. I also had some good cameras to play the tapes back. Nevertheless this little device captured them all and the quality is pretty darn good too after 27 years (see baby photo)!  Saved file is MP4 so good for cloud storage as well as playback on a mobile device. If you have old tapes and want to digitise them. This is all you need (plus a playback camera of course).
5,Everyone has seen or heard ads about having your old VHS tapes converted to digital by a professional company.  I had many of my tapes converted that way before I found this product.  I had several more to convert and some I had already converted done again due to problems with the converted files.  This product is simple to use and delivers in my opinion a digital copy equal in quality to the to the ones I had converted digitally.  If you have more than 5 or 6 VHS tapes to convert this product is right for you.  The only downside I have found is the conversion is done in real time.  If you have 50 hours of video to convert it will take 50 hours of your time.  But once you start the conversion process it runs itself so you can go about doing other things.  Just come back after the tape ends to stop the converter.  Then a file is automatically created on the flash drive you connected to the box.  It is that easy.
5,This device is all it says it is. I was amazed at the picture quality. Look no further this device works very well.I am very pleased with the results. Of course poor quality video going in will get you poor quality coming out. But it will give you a digital video with as good if not better quality. If it gives you poor quality its not the gadget's fault.
5,This was the best purchase I have made in a long time!  It was incredibly easy to use (as long as you have a working vcr) and easily converted my old vhs family videos to digital.Once they were converted I was able to share them with others so easily.I am so thankful as these family video treasures were 25 to 40 years old and the vhs tapes would have deteriorated in the coming years.Note that when you are transferring them the video quality may look shaky but after they are converted the picture quality on the digital video file was fine.
5,easy directions and setup right out of the box . plug into old camcorder video and auto to clearclick and go .
5,Very pleased! Easy to use and works like a charm!
5,Connects easily and is basically one touch operation. Couldn’t work better. Wish there were a way to box the videos so it didn’t make them wider for widescreen but I might be missing something in one of the menus. Other than that - no complaints
5,I had old tapes and dvds that I needed to get to flash drive since most computers no longer have disc drives. And TVS have USB ports for flash drives!It’s great to be able to view the material and not need a tv hook up or computer.Simple to use.  Great results!I would recommend this
5,I practice using it for at least 2 months. At this moment I have uploaded 12 digitized videos.
5,Since this video capture device did not need to be connected to my newer Mac computer it was the only one that worked!! When you use it you save the videos to either a USB drive or an SD Card.  It was GREAT!
5,I have used many analog-to-digital converters over the years and now they are getting hard to find and limited in support. The ones still on the market/still functioning create out-of-sync audio (that varies in delay) dropped frames choppy video or a myriad of other issues.Not this unit. This thing works PERFECTLY. Audio sync is perfect. Video quality is perfect (well it looks as good as the source footage allows). The UI is easy to use. Because it records to an SD card I can stick the footage into my PC and edit it just like any other footage with a separate editing program. No weird file formats no proprietary software lacking support no audio/video issues. If you have old 8mm VHS or VHS-C footage that you want to preserve this is the thing to buy.
5,I was reluctant to purchase this product as even some of the positive reviews mentioned some issues. I can't understand how anyone could write a poor review of this product. I followed the simple directions (which are basically plug in the device insert USB or memory card connect to VHS player insert tape hit play and press record on the device) and the end result is better than I expected. The quality of the digitized video is exactly whatever the quality of the original recording. Obviously if the original recording wasn't that great or the VHS tape quality is poor then you cannot expect an improvement. However my tapes were of excellent quality once transferred to my 1TB USB device. I stopped the tape when it was over took out the USB device and inserted it in my computer and there were my family memories preserved digitally. I have about 50 more tapes to go and I will provide an update if I run into any issues or if I think of tips or suggestions. Please do not pay thousands of dollars to ship your videos to a company. If you have time do it yourself.
5,Muy bueno
5,This product worked great. Very simple to use however was a bit frustrating trying to get the proper cord to work. It may seem obvious but be sure when you get a cord that plugs to the converter it is a male end. The majority AV cords I noticed on Amazon are female end and I mistakenly ordered a female cord first. Other than that this device worked great and I would highly recommend this product!
5,Quickest and easiest analog to digital convertor I've ever seen/used.  Was a bit temperamental getting going and would freeze when plugging in a USB until changing the output from SD to USB...but nothing I couldn't figure out.
5,Great product! My old BETA and VHS tapes from over 20 to 30 years ago are being digitized easily and simply. Only 1 wish...if you included a headphone jack for hard of hearing people. Very small sound but adequate and the video's sound is perfect.
5,I absolutely LOVE this product... I have my kids videos on Cassette and have now been able to get them into digital format easily with this terrific product! Easy to use. Does a great job even though I should have done this 10 yrs earlier because the videos have lost some of the sharpness and are a bit old... this product is super great! Can't say enough thank you's to the company. You have saved my babies' pictures ... love it !
5,After struggling for a month to use a different product purchased for <$15 and my 2013 Macbook Pro running Mojave I decided to spend the money for this product.  It's very simple to setup.  I used a new 132G SanDisk thumb drive and the same VCR I had tried earlier.  I checked the firmware was up to date and it was.  I enabled "Signal Loss Detection" and pressed PLAY on the VCR and Record on the ClearClick and let it run.  I was able insert the thumb drive into my Mac and doubleclick the *.mp4 file to launch QuickTime to play the movie.  Video and audio remained in sync.  Using the low-cost solution I would have had to spend many hours to  import/edit QT clips in iMovie to detatch audio and/or speed up video just so audio and video where in sync.  On a Mac I couldn't use VirtualDub to adjust framerate or loss detection.  The ClearClick plug-n-play solution will make conversion of many old VHS tapes as well as old Sony 8mm camcorder tapes a simple task.  Once video is captured to mp4 you can then use any video editing software on either Windows/Mac to add titles voiceover convert to another format etc.
5,This thing seems to do what it claims to do.  I opened the box  took it out hooked it up  stuck an old 4gb class 4 micro sd card into an adapter shoved it in(it is very very tight) checked that the date stamp was off  set it for 120 minute record time  pushed play on a Toy Story 2 tape that has probably been watched 60 times(maybe more since my 2yo just pushes the tape in even when the tv isn't on) pushed record and went to bed.Other than a little place about 20 seconds in and the previews having a little weirdness at the bottom the picture quality is just fine.  I played it on a 60" TV and it was good enough for a digitized copy of a well worn VHS and definitely good enough for a toddler.  Our VCR is hooked up to a very old flat screen so I've only seen the tape in low resolution.  I doubt one would notice the difference between the tape and the copy.120 minutes took up 3.3gb at 720 x 480.
5,I have converted dozens of hours (on my way to "hundreds") of old personal video to MP4 files on hard drives (primary and backup drives)  The video consistently comes out better on the new files than it shows on TVs from the old tapes.  You can spend hundreds or thousands with the commercial conversion companies or do this yourself very easily.
5,We used this to convert 21 hours of video from our old Sony Digital 8 Handycam cassettes. Super easy to use - just followed the directions that came with the converter. We transferred the videos to thumb drives and have been able to easily access whatever we want. Highly recommend!
1,Seems easy enough to use and it is- few things that make it a total waste of time-1) you MUST start with a BRAND NEW SanDisk- it can not have any other media on it if you put in an SD card with media on it- you will LOSE it.  The card becomes unreadable.2) There is no functional auto start/stop function- meaning you essentially have to be right there watching it to start and stop the recording (start is a piece of cake- but the only "auto-stop function" is 30 60 minutes etc- not timed by the actual video recording).3) once you remove the SD card from the viewer/recorder and put it in a computer you can NEVER add more videos.  So if you didn't use up all the memory (and NO way to tell if there is room left on the card) if you remove it from the viewer/recorder you can not add anything further.4) Once you put it in a computer- if you put it back into the clear click reader/recorder- you can not record anymore (even if space is available) and your computer will subsequently NO LONGER read the videos you recorded previously- this pushed me over the edge- IT STINKS- I spent several hours recording onto an SD card- needed to check where I was at- went to put the card back into the reader and it gives me a message it wanted to format- I told it no (as I knew this would likely ruin what was on there) and then the SD Card because useless- $18 brand new SD card and 5-6 hours of me sitting by the device while it transferred and I have to START ALL OVER AGAIN.  What a pain in the butt and waste of time.  With all the amazing technology we have today I am astounded this is the best option I could find- it's like going back to the stone age.
5,Works Exactly as expected.  Allows you to pause recording to avoid recording unnecessary scenes in the old video.It is important to clean the heads on the old tape equipment before you rip it to digital.  This unit records exactly what it sees and hears...  So dirty heads sound like dirty heads - purchase a new head cleaning tape for your tape machine with this unit.  Save lots of time.
5,Using a USB 3.1 64GB flash drive works great.  The instruction say to use a drive smaller than 128GB with fast read/write speed.  I have a couple of older USB flash drives that didn't seem to work but the 3.1 drive has a 30 MB/s write speed and works great.  I have a monitor on my Hi8 video camera in addition to the one on the ClearClick so that I can watch both monitors at once side by side.  "Glitches" in the video appear on both indicating that they are coming from my camera playback so it's important to fix that (using a head cleaner) prior to recording... but once that's done the quality is just as good as on the camera.  I can set a tape playing and walk away and I get a full digitized recording of the 2 hour tape.  After that some video editing software is helpful to get the most out of the long videos (break them up into smaller more viewable chunks).
2,I bought Clearclick Video2Digital but I found it was “unstable”. For example after 2 hours of decode it just turned out to a unreadable mp4 file and made me very disappointed.The power supply plug was loose then every time I reconnected it all my previous setting turned back to factory default 2021/1/1 I need to manually set the date & time by pressing the button on the machine. The machine has no memory to save. “I feel in order to lower the manufacturing cost the final outcome of the product was very 80’s”. Moreover I could not pre-set the name of the recorded file and I need to change it immediately after each record. Also the preset auto stop had no 180 min. “VHS Long Play lol “In summary the recording quality is good the screen can preview was very good. However the product has lots of room for improvement
5,So I bought this product to copy my old home movies to digital format myself. I bought it back in December of 2020 but waited till now to do the review so I wouldn't jinx it because of what others have experienced with it. Since December I've copied 11 home VHS tapes and 16 home DVDs. Each one was about 1-2 hours long and I had no issues with the recordings or the device while recording. I haven't tried copying anything to an SD card but using a flashdrive or an external hard drive worked perfectly fine with no issues.The picture and sound is great too when going back to watch them on my computer! I couldn't tell much of a difference between the digital version and the original one. I definitely like how there is a small screen to watch the video as it records or you can hook up an HDMI cable to watch it on the TV as it records.It's fairly easy to use and it's a great product to get if you're looking to digitize all your home movies! Definitely recommend.
5,I had approximately 40 Hi-8 video cassettes that I needed to convert over 21 year time span. It seems once you record you never look at them again. I thought about sending off and having someone else do it. I did send two off a few years ago to a company and the quality wasn't that great. Actually now that I remembered that I may try them with this little gem and see if the quality is better. It took some time because the recorder had to run as they converted onto a USB; I then put them on a external hard drive. I couldn't get them to convert right on the hard drive...it may be possible but I didn't put much into it but trying one. I did contact customer service over a plug issue but they handled it great and just sent me a new one. The quality is great and it has been so much fun watching the videos and bringing back those memories! I highly recommend this; especially the price versus sending them off; of course this is my opinion. :)  Thank you ClearClick!
5,This little gizmo converted all of our VHS tapes which now that they are on flash drives are going to be given as Christmas Gifts.  Remember -  you must have a source (camera or player) to play YOUR VHS or DVD for conversion.  The local video guy wanted $14.00 hour plus additional fees to convert AND we had to give him our precious memories.  Once we got the hang of it we were able to go about our business around the house and check in on it to see when it was finished in order to start the next one.  HIGHLY recommend.  We did not need Tech support so did not rate.
5,If you are like me and you're looking to take your old home videos and convert them to avoid bit rot this is the product for you. I took my old tapes from the 90s and converted them to digital files without losing any quality. I've been stressing out about tape degradation and getting this footage digitized and replicated has eased my concerns.I tried to do something similar many years ago using a dazzle capture device and there were tons of dropped frames and everything was just generally not of a good quality. This thing was quick to setup and it didn't require me to install any software. You plug in a USB stick plug in the AUX input or s-video and you start recording. In my experience its about 1GB per hour of footage that you are recording. The video retains its 60FPS which is the most important feature in my opinion .Yay!
4,Liked its ease of use but when there was a snag I was basically on my own. The small booklet did not explain my concerns. When I looked on the booklet to refer to explanations of the symbols on the visual screen it was not available. Some of the questions were answered online by individuals. When I tried to execute them it worked and then did not. It may be my mistake but I followed the same rules without success. All I probably would need was complete info on what each display on this unit referred to. Otherwise everything would have been easier. One last thing it does not match the exact clarity of the original signal which I could live with because it digitalized all my years of happiness.
4,i like is really small u can take it anywhere.its relativly easy to use .i didnt like cause is very sensible and if u have a lot of clips on a videotape if the gap is more than 30 secods between the clips the recordings stops and not only this but it dealeats whatever u taped to that moment and u have to start allover .u probably could get away with that but u have to know how to do it and i wasnt able to figer it out.also for sa future devices it would be nice if u could tape from a memory stick to another memory stuck.i guess it can be done on a laptop but for someone like me which is not so digitaly expert would be a good feture .overall it was a good machine that did the job for me i did do all my videotapes from 30 yr till now in a digitaly format and it was a job that would cost me around 2000 it id do it in a professional studio so i saved a few bucks witrh it
5,Hooked it up with a brand new flash drive inserted. Pressed play on my VCR and the record button on the device.  Pressed the record button again when my video finished. Screen is a great size.  Sound is loud enough.  Settings were easy as pie to understand.I was very happy to have this device finally. My DVD player/recorder/burner failed and there is no such thing anymore.  Besides DVDs are obsolete. I have no desire to set up my 8 year old laptop with cables to my VCR and wrangle with a bunch of software to transfer and record.Some of my VCR tapes with precious family memories are going on 35 years old and since the life span on those is supposed to be only 20 years I'm running out of time. I can do it fast get a single file for each tape back it up for safety then split and edit on the computer at my leisure.If the unit fails I'll check back in.  But I doubt that will happen based on the great reviews I have seen here.
5,I have family movies on vhs tapes on Sony handicam 8mm cassettes and Sony handicam mini dvds so far they all work well I have to use different connections for all of them lots of wires but it’s worth it to get all my movies on a sd memory card which I then hook up my connector to my iPad and download them to files app. I will be storing them on an external hard drive. It’s really very easy as long as you have the proper connectors for your camera. It does take time to transfer from camera to so card because you can not speed up the camera but I just set it and walk away you can set this device to stop copying at different time intervals 60 min being the shortest. Great device really for the price. And the videos don’t seem to lose any clarity in the transfer. I’m not disappointed at all with this it’s nice to have years of videos in one central location and easy to bring up at any time.
5,3.84gb per 2 hour file basically easy as rca input or s-video (with rca l-r input or mono spliot to l-r no problem). the files can be read easily in windows 10 with vlc or mpchc and it's not too bad on the stepping of the interlace to interpolated frames. it is what it is in 2021. get your stuff into mp4 before it decays so bad you can't capture it. this is basically a security dvr if you think about it and I used a simple usb3 32gb unit from microcenter. it never loses a recording after 110 tapes so far not once. making it know you want to record when there's a blue screen / lossy signal is tricky but that's the signal's issue. don't expect too much from vhs it's...well... vhs. hi-8 comes in great with this 640x480 without an issue.
5,After reading the nightmare reviews for cheaper products which required installing software I decided it was worth it to spend a little more to ensure I would have a fairly easy time converting all the old cassettes of the kids when they were little a project I had been dreading and putting off for some time. I was a bit concerned about the automatic stop feature that had been a show stopper for some buyers but it sounded to me by reading the more recent reviewers that this problem had been fixed. The product worked great for me. Very simple to understand and use. I converted all of the tapes to digital in no time. I used the free editor on my computer to edit them and then uploaded all the videos to my google drive for backup and so I can watch them on my phone or at a relative's house. I am now going to convert all my mother-in-law's old cassettes next because it really is so easy.
5,Very simple to hook up to the VCR outputs.  And provided pretty much identical quality as the original VHS tape.  Used to transfer VHS-C tapes from an older camcorder to digital format.  Pleased with everything and experienced no problems in making the conversion from analog to digital file.
4,This is an easy to use and effective solution for converting VHS tapes to digital format (MP4). It is a stand-alone device obviating the need for using a computer or service to convert tapes. I highly recommend this product. However be aware that if electing to write to a USB drive not all USB drives are compatible.Users must have a USB drive with a minimum transfer rate of 200 MB/s. Many "good" USBs do not reach this performance level and results in cutting off the transfer. I deducted a star for ClearClick Video not making this thoroughly clear to buyers - so be forewarned! It took an email to tech support (which is good) to find out that critical bit of information. Once I had the right USB the device worked well.
5,I am a software engineer who specializes in video apps and have extensive experience with video and an eye for defects. I have now tried a cheap usb capture card the elgato video capture and this and this is by far the best.This is perfectly built for digitizing video and you don't need to leave your computer tethered to the camera. It has a built in timer so you can auto-stop if you're digitizing vhs/hi8 and don't need to keep checking to see when it's done.But most of all the video quality is great. 60fps 4mbps mp4. Compared to other capture methods this perfectly reflects what I see on the camcorder screen.For reference other methods I've tried:USB capture card using Quicktime on a top of the line Mac results in dropped frames. I even wrote my own recorder and have identified the problem is that the hardware can't capture frames fast enough.Elgato only works with its software and has an extremely low bitrate that can't be changed.
5,This unit was very easy to use after being in production 35 years this product works exceptionally well good quality compatible with all formats as long it has a video out you are good to go
5,i am not a clearclick rep. im a pissed off consumer who simply wanted to convert my home movies. i bought the roxio easy pkg and the vidbox pkg after that. those are ok  if you are computer savy or/and have a complete computer system. for the rest of us you will be dissappointed with computer hook up. please read the reviews before you try other products. i lost 2 weeks of time with playback videos coming out as a black box driver errors "CODEC"errors? both tech supports are a labor in process. then i tried this clearclick 2.0. i lost the pro touch but this serves my needs. copy video to sansdisk card(64gb)stick it in my laptop transfer copy to file--easy. but to my surprise when you playback video there will be a "PEN" symbol to edit which means there is a white dot on either side hold right/ left click on the dot to move it to cut out part of video you dont want click save top right will save what is between dots no expensive edit apps. im sharing this because im excited finally being able to give family members pieces of memories that i know will bring emotions of joy all thanx to a product for the less computer savy crowd. try this product first you won't be sorry. hope this helps somebody
5,Had a little trouble at first but if  you will go by the instructions included and have a working VCR you should be fine.  So far very pleased.  saving my first born's birth on a flash drive as we speak....
5,I was looking for an easy to use yet high quality way to transfer all of my old family VHS tapes to digital. After checking it out on various youtube videos I decided this was the one.  I have not been disappointed!  Not only is it easy to use but having the screen on the unit makes it a snap to see the video without having it hooked up to the tv.  I just pop in a video watch it start & then push the record button.  I walk away as it does not need any attention until it's done. I'm using a duel VHS/DVD player & thought to try the DVD side as well as I have some old family dvd's I wanted to be digital. It worked great! It does record at real time but no matter as it doesn't hog the tv or your precious time!  You won't regret purchasing this little jewel.
3,First off let me say that tech support by email through AMAZON was good. A second unit was sent after discussing the issues. But now to the issues. I have been using a ROXIO converter but the picture quality to MP2 is less than I wanted and this unit advertised reproduction to MP4 so I felt I would give it a try. If you look very very hard at the comparison of the two you can see a very slight improvement but not what I expected MP4 to be. Second as you can see the exposure setting is way to dark. Picture detail is lost. Even when I used my movie maker to increase the light level it destroyed picture quality. And then the advertisement stated that picture jumping on the monitor would not appear in the reproduction. But it does. Then finally Ratio aspect. The images came out wider than the original making everyone look fat. In discussing these issues with tech support they assured me that there was a new release that corrected these issues and sent me a new unit. The new unit did correct the ratio aspect question but as you can see in the photo it did nothing for the other problems. It has been returned to AMAZON. I am very excited about this product and how easy it is to use and if and when it can produce a conversion equal to or even close to the original I would purchase it again.
3,I used this product to convert my vhs tapes to digital.  I had many problems at the start.  I should have read the user's manual more carefully and it would have saved me hours.  If the customer support people had a clue they could also have saved me some time.  My files kept coming up as corrupt and unreadable.  I got some tapes done and messages still kept coming up sporadically.  I asked the support crew for help and they were no help at all.  The problem turned out to be that I was using a USB with too much memory which was causing all the problems.  With the explanation I gave to the support crew they should have been able to tell me that.  I think that this should be put in bold face in your manual to prevent anyone else using too big of drives.  Also put in boldface that it will not accept over 2 hours of recording without problems and that if you start and stop that a new files is created.  Once I found out the problem the transferring of data from VHS to digital was a breeze.  I have not done 33 tapes and have about 10 more tapes to do. I do like the product and I now have many great memories a click away on my big screen TV or my computer.  I have also given copies of 25 year old memories to friends on a USB.  If the manual would have been clear and the customer support crew helpful at all I would have given this product 5 stars for sure.
5,Ran a dozen VHS tapes through this and onto a USB thumb drive.  Worked great
4,I have a ton of old VHS and Beta video tapes to transfer to digital. Most other transfer systems require a computer and are awkward to use and many do not copy directly to MP4. This little device is an awesome solution to the transfer problem and it's really easy to use. The flexibility of being able to record in MP4 directly to USB or SD card is great as is the HDMI output for monitoring on a larger screen. I have noticed that the transfer process does appear to somewhat increase the chroma (color intensity) of the original video but that is usually not an issue. I've also noticed that the resulting MP4 file size is very large but there is free software available that can reduce the file size without affecting quality (Handbrake.fr). It can even be used as a portable video player! Recommended.
5,Works well
4,Nice to get old videos into new format. Not a lot of instructions. Never could get files transferred to memory disk (despite formatting attempts) but was able to use USB transfer.
4,This is serving the purpose of digitizing my old home videos. It's super easy to use any complexity is usually on the source tape side not on this recorder's side. It auto pauses when it stops receiving signal which means I can set it and forget it.Picture quality is generally more than acceptable considering the quality of the source. My one problem is where there is a lot of camera movement either by someone panning unsteadily or walking while shooting the digitized image chops and stutters badly. This is NOT present on the image I'm seeing play back on the camcorder screen.I'd say 80% of the videos aren't subject to this problem but it's a real shame on occasions like a hike or something where the resulting picture is aggressively distorted.
5,easy to use and set up
5,This is a really nice device I have done 90 VHS tapes already and the quality is great.  Very easy to use and gets the job done If you have tapes you want to digitize this is the device to get.
5,This is a simple yet affordable solution to dubbing old video cassettes.  It is simple to use and does a good enough job.  It is standard def (they may make a HD version but if your dubbing video tape VHS 8MM DVcam that kind of stuff it is low res anyway).  Just plug the video out of your camera to the video in of the device and push play and record.  It is a one to one dubbing meaning a 60 min tape will take 60 min to dub but you can leave the device and it will auto stop when the tape stops.  Files are saved as AVI/Mpeg/maybe a few other formats but I only used the default and it work fine.  Everything is stored on a basic SD card (they are cheap on Amazon) and readily available.If you have a lot of tapes and want to transfer them to digital this is a really good product to do it with.
5,While I sense that the instructions could be a bit better the unit works to convert VHS to mp4 files.  It did take me a couple of try's to get it to work largely because the instructions were not perfectly clear concerning how to actually start the conversion (e.g. need 2 presses of the record button not just one).  Also I noted that the instructions claim that one can NOT use a USB hard disk as a designation for the converted mp4 files but instead must use a USB stick.  This is obviously not true as I've been able to use a 2TB USB hard drive many many times for the converted mp4 files during the conversion process.  To be fair the actual video quality of the converted files is somewhat suboptimal (at least compared to HD files) but at the same time the original VHS format was not exactly HD quality to begin with.  I'm pretty happy with the purchase.
5,Easy to setup and use. Picture as good as original tape. We used it to save movies purchased on VHS and we are very pleased.
1,This is the version 2 unit and out of the box it is simple to setup.  I purchased the ScanDisk 128G Class 10 SD card.  The issue is that Auto Stop cannot be disabled.  This is the feature that when the unit detects there is no longer video then it will automatically stop recording.  The issue is that it is not accurate and will stop recording but will not close the MP4 file correctly and it will be corrupt and unusable.  For example it you have a VHS tape that you transfered or recorded multiple segments i.e. birthday party play outdoor scene etc. on the same tape.  That brief space between those recordings can be interpreted by the unit as a "stop" but since it is not long enough the unit does not close the file correctly it's like a bump in the road.  The result is you transfer a one hour video to digital and then take your SD card and load onto your laptop and the file is unreadable.  Tech support knows about the issue and states a fix will not be available until spring so you should sit in front of the video and watch it every second when you see these pauses hit stop record which obviously is not really an option.  I even had tapes with no other recordings on it and when it reached the end of the tape it still would have about 15-20 minutes left with nothing recorded.  The Clear unit would then automatically stop recording but again would not close the MP4 file correctly and thus it would be unreadable when I tried to view it on the unit or on my laptop.  I would not suggest that anyone purchase this unit until such time as this company can disable the automatic stop.  By the way this is not the stop where you set the timer to stop after a number of minutes this is the automatic stop when the unit determines there is nothing left to record.
5,This thing is the cat’s pajamas. Like many people I had a box of 8mm videotape of family history. To use it you need to look a lot at the content and that alone is enlightening. Once the tapes are digitized they can be quickly scrolled through unlike a tape and organized in some fashion. All of this video can be put on a tiny SD card And given out to the kids.Next stop video editing software.
5,I converted probably twenty videos to digital with ease! Make sure you order the flash drive they recommend. This is such a gift!
1,I purchased the ClearClick Video2Digital 2.0 converter today and immediately hooked it up to begin archiving home movies from my childhood. Setup was as simple as you could hope for and I began to record within 5 minutes of opening the box. After recording I played the file back on my computer to check how well it did. Unfortunately there is a 'juttering' affect throughout the video that it not on the tape (I played the tape back on our TV using the RCA cables to make sure). I took the file into a more advanced video editor and played it back frame by frame where the juttering issue occurred. What appears to be happening is that video frames are randomly inserted out of order in the video. The video will play smooth and then a frame from a few milliseconds in the past will randomly appear giving the effect of a jarring shifting video. This is most certainly an issue with the encoding hardware/software being used on the device itself. I plan to archive hundreds of hours of home movies that are priceless to us and this issue makes the video unacceptable. It's quite disappointing since everything else appears to work brilliantly with this device. It's hard to find 'real' reviews on Amazon these days; hopefully this prevents someone from making a costly purchase mistake when seeking to create a digital archive of their movie content.
5,I've been wanting to get my family videos onto my Mac for years.....Too many wires and codecs and whacky software  choices etc.  I read all the reviews and shopped this carefully.  Perhaps some didn't care for it but my experience is 100% POSITIVE !!!!!!!  This little gizmo does EXACTLY what the manufacturer says it does.  It works perfectly and I'm completely happy with it.....As I type this it's recording an old Hi8 tape onto an SD card.  It's the third tape I've done today.  One hour translates to about 2 GB.  You really don't even need a huge SD to copy to.  I transferred from SD to my MAC with no problems.  If you do use a MAC just format your SD in the computer using Disk Utility.  Format to MS-DOS fat32. Easy as pie.....  I give this product a huge thumbs up!!!!!!!!!
5,Performs above expectations
3,I read up on this product and decided to give it a try. Out of the box it's pretty straight forward instructions are easy to understand I had it hooked up in minutes. I started the VHS Tape and noticed alot of "jumpy" interference and "blue" screens. OK re-checked connections re-wind - same problems. I e-mailed tech support. They got back to me quickly and through a series of e-mailed Q & A it was determined that it was the VHS tape that was actually a "dupe" store bought tapes worked fine. I did copy one complete movie to a memory stick but then the recorder stopped recognizing the VCR.Again a series of Q & A e-mails with the helpful guys @ tech support but the problem persisted. I changed "RCA" cables VCR's and cleaned the ports on the VCR with denatured alcohol to remove any gunk that may have accumulated on them I even bought a new "RCA" cable BUT still the same problem. Tech support sent me a new unit without me asking unfortunately the problem could not be resolved. In the end I figure the problem is more then likely with my VCR's.I returned both units 1 to Tech support and 1 to Amazon for a refund until I decide what I'm going to do.I can say this - I LIKE THE PRODUCT EASIEST TRANSFER PROGRAM I EVER WORKED WITH AND TECH SUPPORT BENT OVER BACKWARDS TO HELP. When (if) I get a newer VCR I'll revisit this product.
5,Simply said it made life easy. It’s simple to hook up and it converts the input to DVD quality for further processing if desired.If you’re looking to walk away and let it process everything it can do so.  Except for cassettes with no blurring or quality issues...Warning:  It doesn’t stop recording when cassette blurriness begins or cuts off a bit.  You’ll have to do that during processing. Or you can pause recording during occurrence and continue recording after it ends.  You will have to know in advance where this occurs of course and wait for it.For what the product is it’s good.  In today’s modern world with so many free video editors.  Proper use should be to record your video then edit your video further for enhanced quality.  This does not apply to everyone of course.  Therefore for the simple folks likes out there set it and forget it.That being said it’s well worth it don’t put a price on your life’s memories.
5,I used the 'ClearClick Video to Digital Converter 2.0' to copy my photos and video from VCD/DVD files into thumb drive.This is a very good product as you can record certain parts or portion that was required. No need to record everything if they are not required.
5,This product works as described I transferred some old Betamax tapes to MP4 files and uploaded them to my GoPro account to share with the family the quality was excellent.
5,I used this to transfer all of my VHS to digital. It works really well you just need a VHS player you can burn it to USB. I was able to hook up my Hi 8 VHS using the video ports (Red White Yellow) cable connectors from the VHS. I was able to complete all of my tapes within a few hours. There is no dubbing on this so if the tape is 1.5 hours that is how long it will take you to transfer. Still well worth it in my opinion. My only complaint is that you can't rip it to MP4 directly. I just rip mine in AVI and then transcode it to MP4.
4,I bought this to transfer dvd and 8mm camcorder footage. In order to do that I had to buy an HDMI cable as well as an adapter for the camcorder audio connection. Luckily both were easy to find. There were a couple issues with the device: record/pause button not responsive so I powered it down and restarted it and in one section of video the screen had a small curved black edge but it may have been caused by the 8mm film(?). All in all I am happy with it.
5,Product works as described. NOTE... This device requires a NEW HIGH SPEED SD card to work properly. I had a ton of HD cards laying around and all were not sufficient. The manual says what type to get. After buying a new card...perfect video transfer.
5,I have been using it to upload home movies from my VCR and from my camcorder. It’s been so easy and painless! What a great purchase! I also can watch the screen and don’t need a tv involved.
5,Absolutely love this product! I have been nervous for a while about attempting to transfer old home videos over to digital. I didn't like the idea of taking them to a shop and doing it myself seemed daunting. I finally took the leap and ordered this. I was somewhat skeptical after reading some of the reviews but I am so glad I ordered. This device made it super-simple with excellent results. With basically no more effort than plugging in the AV cords pressing a couple of buttons and walking away I've sucessfully transferred several videos and I'm pleased with the audio and video quality of the transferred files. For the record my original videos contain multiple events with short "dead time" in between and it has had no trouble recognizing that and continuing to record as well as stopping recording at the end of the videos (maybe after 10-15 minutes of dead time?). I honestly couldn't be happier!
5,The reviews I read really worried me and I wondered how many problems I would have or if the device would work at all. All that worry was for nothing. It worked exactly as I hoped. In fact it was easier than even my best-case scenarios. I used a new SD card plugged it in connected it put the tape in hit record and done! I split the files up by hitting the record/stop button in between scenes. The only quality issues was because one tape showed its age. The rest of the tapes were in pristine shape and the device recorded them just as they were. I don't think I've ever written a review for a device before but I just can't be more grateful for the team that designed this. If you have a decent VCR and tapes I think you'll be fine.
5,Worked Perfect.  It was a bit costly but with the amount of family videos I had it averaged about $3 per video for me to transfer all my family video treasures over to digital.  You can plug a flash drive right to the unit and plug into the furnished cables to a VCR and watch the screen and go.  Easy as Pie!  You can play back Flash Drives or transfer SD or Flash Drives to another Computer Storage.  You can also use the unit to play back flash drives to a tv.  It took me a few days to do all the videos I have. But now I have them all converted and they won't degrade any more as do VHS Tapes.  So glad I found this device.  Makes it Sooooo Easy.  Satisfied.
5,I am still having a problem formatting USB and Cards.  I spent $$$ getting InfinitiKloud SD and compatible with PC/MAC/ANDROID devices.  And they should work with the converter.  And yes I bought ScanDisc and yes it works however I did not want to spend the money on them.And as for the card.  It is so tight going into the slot you aren't sure if it went to far or not far enough.  It did not lock nor did it spring out.  I had to use my mini pliers to get it out and yes it is a Scan Disc.  I have written via email and customer service for both items and yet not heard anything.** Ok I got it working with the USB and it looks good.  But the disc won't work.
5,I’m using this device mainly for VHS tapes and the quality is good compared to original. I’m happy to recover my VHS Video library because of this device.
5,I'm working on digitizing video from VHS tapes using a VCR. This works exactly as stated. Plug in a thumb drive to the unit use the AV wires (Red/White/Yellow) from the VCR to the unit hit play on the VCR hit record on the unit hit record again to stop all done. Video is saved on the thumb drive as a .MP4 file type. Note that there is not a thumb drive in the package - you need to buy one if you don't have one. Or an SD card. The file sizes are coming out very large for me (400+MB) which I'm not sure if that's normal but it did make me go ahead and get an external hard drive to store the videos on rather than a bunch of thumb drives or DVDs. But once your video is on the thumb/SD drive from the unit you can do as you please.Works great. Worth the money.
5,I had lots of old vhs-c tapes that I wanted to convert to digital. Bought a used vcr and Clear Click. I hooked Clear Click up to the VCR inserted a flash drive into clear click hit play on the VCR and record on clear click. If you prefer there is a slot for an SD card. When the tape was done I inserted the flash drive into my computer and uploaded the videos. I created a YouTube channel for family and now they can watch from wherever they are whenever they want. It’s that easy.  I would highly recommend the Clear Click converter. I researched several ways to convert to digital and decided on this. It was so easy to use. If you have old tapes you want to save and convert to digital this is the way to go.
2,I like many fumbled around with trying to convert old VHS tapes to digital format with other devices and didn't have satisfactory results.So when I came across this device that got my curiosity.  A portable device no PC required records to SD card or USB flashdrive has built-in LCD and sound.  Too good to be true?  The only way to find out for sure as to buy one and test out.Overall how to use is pretty easy.  I did have an S-video cable and used that for the video to supposedly get a better quality video.  When using the picture on the LCD display is sharp and clear.Unfortunately the resulting MP4 video ends up darker and color not an accurately matched to the original tape.  I even trying to fix the darkness and off color with video editing software.  This made some improvement but not enough to make the video close to the original.  The audio was synced to the video but the video was just off.It's a shame that the resulting video is too dark and not like to original colors.  If ClearClick is able to come up with a fix with some kind of firmware update or newer version then this is a winning product.  But until then I cannot recommend.  There are better options out there for a better resulting video.I give the ClearClick Video to Digital Converter 2.0  two stars.
5,I have copied a few VHS tapes with this gadget and am storing them for safe keeping on a jump drive. It's the perfect gadget with which to save those old tapes.  Also it can be uploaded to the laptop of coure or emailed via Google Drive or Drop Box.  It's a great way to share these old vidoes with friends and family.
5,Worked beautifully. I converted a LOT of videotapes!
5,I had this for several weeks dreading setting up and trouble shooting. Not So! Plugged everything up simple directions and good to go! I have had a few that didn’t transfer for some reason and just redid without a problem. I am not tech savvy or computer savvy so this is a great buy!
5,I sent 16 Video8 and Hi8 camcorder tapes the oldest of which was 32 years old to Kodak Digitizing for conversion to digital. I was so unhappy with the quality which showed the interlaced video horizontal lines that I decided to do it myself. I purchased the ClearClick Video to Digital Converter 2.0 and am amazed at the quality being so much better than Kodak Digitizing. This converter it well worth the money. Just remember if you do it yourself you need a working camcorder or other player to use as input into the converter.
3,milky picture lacks contrast
4,I like how easy and simple it was to use the only thing I dont like is that it is 720p or 480p I dont know if it's the vhs camcorder that has low quality or the converter deteriorates the quality lower.
5,It was pretty easy to use but it took me a bit to get used to coordinating the VCR tape two when it started transferring to a flash drive. The sound well I was monitoring was too low for me but when I looked  at what had been converted it is excellent.
5,This works great. It was exactly what i was looking for👍🏻. Just make sure you use good quality wires.
5,I have tried several video converters with a screen to I interface to my PC but all had reliability problems with Windows 10. This worked with no download of additional drivers.  Be surer to get a USB 3.0 memory stick for storage.
5,I purchased this unit because I have over 60 videotapes from when my kids were little and need to convert them to MP4 for upload to Google.  I can say the conversion process from 8mm and 8mm digital tapes to MP4 is super easy.  I don't know how it could be any easier.  The ability to setup the timer to stop recording at 60min 12min etc... is an awesome feature and seems to work perfectly.  At this point I've been unable to upload any of these files to Google Photos however and i've yet to determine why this is.  This would be my only reservation at this time.  i have a concern there may be a file compatibility issue with Google and the resultant files this unit creates.  This is yet to be determined and i'll update this review once I know what is found to be the problem.  Overall - I couldn't be more pleased with this unit and view it as an excellent purchase.
5,We were very happy with how easy it was to save our VHS tapes to a flash drive using the ClearClick video to digital converter. We did use an old VCR and played the tape while recording to a flash drive. We arranged all videos by date so that we can easily know which file to play. We put the flash drive into a Smart tv and could easily select what we wanted to watch. We did try to play from a laptop to a non-Smart tv using a cable but weren’t able to get that to work. The clarity depends on what speed we originally taped on so some of our videos are really clear and others are a little grainy. We’re very happy overall with the ClearClick device.
5,Was looking to digitize old camcorder tapes in part due to passing of my uncle from COVID. I had a question and reached out to customer service on 12/31 at about 1 pm PST...on New Year's Eve I received a helpful response within a few hours! The hardware was easy and intuitive to use. The only tricky part was formatting the SanDisc drive I separately purchased to work with my M1 Mac mini. In the end I mis-read the directions...once I correct my disc formatting mistake it was a piece of cake. It has been a lot of fun watching old home videos with my now grown kids and the coverage of my uncle and a cousin who passed over a decade ago are priceless. Thank you to ClearClick for making this product!!!
5,I'm relieved to say that I have had a great experience with this item.  I read all the reviews and was apprehensive at first. It got a lot of positives but the negatives gave me pause.  But I went for it anyway.This is an upgrade from an Omni that I've been using. That still works but it has its limitations.  The appeal of this ClearClick was the video screen.  It also can take SD cards and USB drives of larger capacity than the Omni. That one rejected anything higher than 8gb.  So far The ClearClick took a 64gb card.I had a mild panic when I first turned it on as there was no sound. But I shut if off and turned it on again and the sound came in perfectly.  The recordings are not high quality but they're pretty good for my purposes. Don't expect HD or 4k from this. But if you want to have an archive of videos this is a good device.
5,It's not a PERFECT transfer "which for me would be if the video came out somehow sharper than the original" but the transfers are much clearer than anything else I've used. As you can see the first video snip is of my daughter when she was 13 practicing basketball.  The second snip is through Clear Click. The whole video is very nice. My daughter is 27 now so this is an important piece of past documentation.  It's very easy to use not much at all to understand. I will say the DARKS pickup could be better. In several scenes I can't see people through Clear Click transfer although I can easily see them on the original video. So that's the only issue. Otherwise a good buy.  This is only my 2nd day using it and several people have said the machine 'STOPPED WORKING'.  So far it's working well for me.  I will give an update if it breaks suddenly.I haven't had to use TECH SUPPORT so I didn't give a rating.
3,After reading reviews I decided to try this item to start converting a box of MiniDV master tapes. The set-up took a few to properly configure but it was easy-peasy once done. We're talking button-click easy. The memory card function could not be simpler. As soon as a recording was finished I'd pop the SD card out and into my laptop to transfer it there. A nice little tool easy to use and simple. So far so good until we get to quality of transfer. I've been researching several other methods for digitizing old MiniDVs to Digital; I've even tried a few of them with very effective results - its just the processing time which is a complete PITA to do so. That said I was disappointed with the transfer output. The product works but as others have echoed it has a saturated color effect on the output not too mention that the image clarity / sharpness is nowhere near the master. For that alone I have to knock it down a few ratings. If you're seeing quick/easy and don't care about quality then this is a great little cost effective solution. If you're seeking a quality conversion method for preserving/archiving/uploading this is not it.
5,I'm not one to leave reviews but couldn't let this go without sharing what great Customer Service this company has.  My converter power supply stopped working couple months after started using...the return window was also closed but when I emailed company they immediately made it right! No questions asked no red tape they just apologized for my problems with converter and sent me a replacement! Also sent me a return label to send defective one back.  This converter is incredibly use and hook up simple!  I would have spent hundreds to have all my old tapes converted.  It is time consuming doing it on my own but enjoyed watching all those memories as I was converting.
4,The fact that you can capture video content WITHOUT installing software and current drivers on your computer makes this device great.  However it would be a really great device if instead of or in addition to wall mounting capabilities the device was designed as a wedge you'd be able to VIEW content more easily.  Other thing that would aid in making this device great would be the ability to insert your capture media the right way round instead of backward.  This allows you to monitor your media as content is being captured.
5,I have tried a number of ways to convert my old VHS family videos to a digital format and this is the best one I have found. As long as you have a video player just plug this in and press play.The process could not be simpler and the video quality is better than I got back from the big name commercial processor I sent some tapes to.If you have old tapes with family memories you want to preserve so yourself a favor and get started with this now!The tapes are degrading and it is almost impossible to find a working VCR anymore.
4,The format for the converted videos is mp4 only but these can be converted easily to the avi that I want using a program on my laptop.  One reviewer said it was possible to set it to convert to avi but there seems to be no way to do that.  Previously the DVD burner I was using to convert old VHS tapes created video files that were corrupted as often as not so I'm satisfied.  The higher price for this unit seems to arise from the display and speakers which the converters selling for $100 less do not have.  Overall I'm glad I purchased it.
5,This product is exceptional for anyone who wants to convert VHS tapes using a VCR to digital and also directly from a High 8 camcorder (Hi8) tapes. Simple set up no software to mess with. Excellent product!
1,Received it yesterday and put it to work immediately.  Worked well enough last night.  Tried recording some stuff today and it has been acting up.  Sometimes mid recording the audio turns static and muffled.  I thought the tapes were damaged but once I stopped recording the sound problems immediately stopped.  I'd rewind the tapes to the points they were sounding weird and they would be fine but the second I pushed record it would get funky again.  Not really sure what's going on.Pretty sad about the situation.  Trying to do a purge of my family's home and we have so many VHS tapes that have a lot of memories attached to them.Going to buy another one and return the one I have... hopefully it's just this one that's glitchy.Update:  received a replacement.  that one didn't work much better.  same thing... approx 20-40 mins through a recording the audio would be garbled but if I stopped the digital recorder the sound would be fine.I reached out to customer / tech support to try and trouble shoot - 3 wks later still no response.Super fun.  Going to try another option.
5,I have tried many different methods for converting my old VHS tapes to digital and this is by far the easiest method that I have found.  Definitely recommended!!!
5,I read some of the negative reviews but this product worked flawlessly. After my father passed away I felt a need to ensure all of our old home movies were preserved. I looked into legacy box and other services which would do this for me and was staring down a price tag in excess of $600.00 for the amount of media I was looking to convert to digital. I decided to take a chance on this and was pleasantly surprised. I have hard digital copies of all of the home movies as well as cloud based storage for the rest of the extended family to enjoy at their leisure. You need a vcr or some other means to play the original media but that is fairly obvious.
3,I was really looking forward to this product as I thought it would be an easy and very convienient way to convert camcorder recorded VHS tapes (from the 80's and 90's) into the digital format.  I tried various tapes and various VCR's and the results were always the same... whenever there was a shot where the camera operator was moving it seems to produce a jump like effect like frame skipping.  And i was using high quality VHS tapes that had been well taken care of over the years.  I've transferred the same types of material on other VHS to digital converters in the past and never had this issue.  I did contact tech support and they kept saying that it was most likely from the signal on the VHS tape...but again I tried numerous tapes all in good condition and this effect remained constant. I have only tried using this device with VHS tapes so I can't speak to how well it works with 8mm tapes hi-8 digital 8 or other formats.  If ClearClick can figure out this buggy issue with properly decoding signals that shouldn't create a problem then the device would be ideal for converting VHS to digital.maybe version 3.0 will fix this?
5,I'm using this to transfer old home video tapes from VHS to digital. The product works well and is easy enough to use. My only problem was that the original VCR I planned to use didn't have to output plug needed. Must have yellow and white!
5,The product accomplishes an important goal that has mostly been overlooked by similar products: digitizing analog video in modern format without a PC.  Its ability to produce good quality MP4 video files at full 720x480 resolution in a way that allows minimal user interaction is quite helpful.  Most solutions to this digitizing problem require a computer to perform the file saving and thus inherently rely on the complexities of software UI to get the job done; this solution is much simpler.One thing to be aware of:  if you set a time limit on conversion such as guessing that your videotape source requires 1 hour of playback the product may stop converting before that time limit is up if it detects “an end of content”.  That detection includes blanks spaces on your tape between recordings.  Better results were achieved by simply starting converting without the time limit setting and monitoring yourself.  When doing this the conversion would pause but not stop during blank portions.
5,It’s a plug in and “go” device. I’ve seen earlier devices from other companies. I sort of held my breath in buying this fearing that the quality of the conversion wouldn’t be great. I was totally wrong. This is a gem of a product. Worth every penny!
5,Product is perfect for taking old video to digital
5,The image quality on this is the best based on the different converters I tested the only drawback I would say is if your end goal is to have them on your computer it is a two step process. You hook up a back up drive or SD card and make the initial transfer and then hook up that back up drive or SD card to your computer and transfer. From my test images though it's worth this slight inconvenience. Another small inconvenience is the date and time don't keep time if you unplug or shut off the unit. It's simple to set just something I thought I should mention.
4,Easy and convenient to use. Works fine. Expect sounds and picture quality to be no better than the original. Relatively expensive as compare to competition. For this price it should include an S video cable.
4,I bought this because of good reviews but the first use was terrible.  I contacted tech help.  They replied in a few hours and sent me a file of firmware to update the device.  The update was easy and fixed the problem.  It does convert VHS to digital file for the whole tape and continues even if it hits space between recording on the tape that is fuzzy.  This was the problem the firmware fixed.  So if you buy it get on line and get the firmware up to date.I also like that it will show on TV while converting.  This lets you view the tape with friends while conversion is happening.
5,No software to install!  No taking over your TV/monitor!  Built in features let you go about your day!  Seriously so awesome that you can just plug this into a VCR Camcorder or other machine and get right to transferring to a USB or SD card.  You can see the video as it's converting and switch to view mode to ensuring it worked.  AND there's a "Detect Signal Loss" option that works amazingly well.  The moment it sense snow it goes blue and pauses not stops recording until it senses a signal again.  You can also set timers - 60 90 120 150 mins - although that does seem to override the signal loss option and record the blue screen.  Overall dope device!
5,Directions for set up were clear and easy.  Easy to use.  Only problem was my own trying to figure out how to play the videos with Windows 10.  They loaded with windows media player but played with the movies and TV app.
5,Product works as advertised and does exactly what I hoped it would do.The only anomoly that I found is that at times the HDMI output to a TV would carry the audio stream that I was recording other times it would not.The very responsive support person (who even answered my email on the weekend!) stated that it was not designed ot do that but was not sure if something changed in a recent patch of the software running the recorder.  I left it at five stars since what he lacked in knowledge of the current product capbilities he made up in responsiveness and customer service.
2,I received a box that had been opened and all of the cables had been removed from their packaging and the tape removed from the ports on the product and stuck to the instructions.  The product had been used and I checked to see if the product was functional and it was.  I would have given it 5 stars except it had been opened and used.  I have 30+ years in IT hardware and software so since the product was working I started moving my VCR tapes to digital and it accomplished the task without any issues. Time permitting I would have sent it back for a new one.
5,If you understand you are going from VHS to digital and NOT from high def video this is a great device. It is very easy to use and does a great job of putting old videos onto an SD memory card. Once on the SD card you can view your videos from there or transfer it to a computer to do with as you choose. I like that it has an HDMI out port to watch you transfer on a flat screen while processing. Pay attention to the instructions and format your memory card on a computer and NOT the device!
4,The directions aren't super helpful on how to operate it. I eventually figured it out but only after "recording" for 2 hours just to find out that it wasn't actually recording. It did not save on to the external hard drive I used first but on my second attempt with an SD card it did save. The video quality is decent. I did not have a problem with the sound matching up with words on the recordings like other reviews mentioned however when I plugged the HDMI cable into my tv to watch on the screen while I was recording the sound did not match up with what was being shown on the screen. Not a big deal because the sound and picture on the saved files was synced up.
5,I have a 20 year old Canon ES60 camcorder & several video cassettes. With the ClearClick I was able to easily gather snippets from the video cassettes to create a beautiful video presentation for a memorial service. I am so glad I purchased this device and I highly recommend it.
3,It was pretty straight forward if you are somewhat techy.  I transferred several old 8mm videos to an sd card.  Quality was good as can be expected.  The card slot is frustrating.  The card frequently got stuck even with trying a different brand.  My biggest frustration is the video was jumpy.  I reached out to manufacturer and after a day or so they replied and gave me a link to purchase a cable off amazon and said that should take care of the problem.  Well it did but I got delayed on my project almost a week.  Also I didn't plan on needing to purchase another cable to get it working.  Maybe that should be included or at least an option??  My other gripe with the build is the S-Video cable barley locks in.  I finally had to rig it with some wire and tape so it wouldn't come out in the middle of a 2 hour recording...frustrating.  It worked but seems overpriced with all the hassles.
5,Amazingly simple device for video conversation.If it broke tomorrow I’d have gotten my money’s worth. If you have a desire to save all of your old tapes to digital this is the device to do it!
5,TIRED OF TRYING TO CONVERT ANALOG TO DIGITAL VIDEO TAPES.  WELL THIS PRODUCT WORKS OUT OF THE BOX WITHOUT HUNTING FOR DRIVERS OR SOFTWRE FROM THE INTERNET.  IT PERFORMED PERFECTLY ON MY FIRST TRY.  I HAVE A TROVE OF HI8 VIDEO TAPES AND NOW I HAVE DOWNLOADED MY FIRST VIDEO TO A THUMB DRIVE AND COPPIED TO MY COMPUTER.  NOW EDITING WITH PREMIER PRO AND HAVING MUCH FUN INSTEAD OF FRUSTRATION.STAY AWAY FROM THE $11 DOLLAR CHEEPIES AS THEY ONLY ADD TO YOUR FRUSTRATION.  THIS THING MAY COST MORE BUT WORTH THE MONEY.  YOU CAN LITERALLY CONVERT ANY ANALOG TO DIGITAL TAPES YOU HAVE.  ENJOY THE FUN WITH THIS PRODUCT!!!!!
5,This is a remarkable device.  VERY simple to use. Red Yellow White RCA connections to your source device. Plug in a formatted thumb drive or SD card.  Start playing your tape and press the record button. You can immediately remove the thumb drive and plug it in to your computer and play it.  I found it helpful to rename my files right away because out of the device the assigned "names" all look the same.
4,It does a fine job of transferring VHS tapes to digital and the quality is good. BUT... it will drop out of record and create a corrupt file (that is useless)if there is a gap in the recording where it goes to snow. I find the best way to use it is to either monitor it the entire time or check on it at 15 minute intervals. That way if it stops you only lose 15 minutes of your video and you can go back and redo that segment while watching it. If  the picture goes to snow pause the recording and resume when the picture stabilizes. Shouldn't have to do this but it seems to be the best solution available. I used a Sandisk  USB drive with it per manufacturer's recommendations.
4,Unfortunately after purchasing a separate 3.5mm to RCA male adapter to transfer my tape I found that it only worked for sound on your device. It showed and sounded perfectly fine on my camcorder and TV but all I kept getting on your device was "no signal found". Fortunately I also had an "S" cable that I tried. That worked fine but no sound on your device. I plugged them both in to obtain both picture and sound on your device and it's currently recording. I'll see if it actually transferred to the flash drive when it's finished.
5,With the several negative reviews I had my doubts of this product. Since receiving it I have successfully converted hours of my analog hi-8 video tapes into mp4 videos with a press of a button. The device is very easy to use and the quality is outstanding. Not to mention the mp4 videos take very little space on the flash drive I use. I bought 128G flash drive and still have plenty of room. A flash drive is easier to use than the SD card unless you have a card reader. I 100% recommend this product if you want to view and have your old analog camcorder tapes / VHS tapes digitally.
5,Easy to use very easy.  I'm converting tapes from the 80's so the quality is only as good as the camera back then and the age of the VHS tapes- and so far the quality is very good.
5,I thought this was too good to be true because I've not been able to transfer my old camcorder videos. Nothing was compatible with the other - it was either my computer operating system my computer itself or the old program that came with the camcorder was no longer in use or I didn't have the right connections but long story short NOTHING WAS WORKING!! I literally spent about 15 years trying to get these transferred. When I got this unit I thought it was too good to be true. I thought there must be a catch. But there wasn't. This is everything I ever wanted and I'm so glad I purchased through this seller!!! Thank you!!!
5,So easy to use and transferring home videos from the '80's into digital files is terrific!  Fun to look through the past 40 years of our lives.  Should have done this years ago.  Very happy with this purchase and you can't put a price on memories!
3,Couldn’t get it to work.
5,I used this to digitize over 20 Hi8 Tapes (2 hours each) and 12  mini Digital Video Tapes (1 hr each). Overall I was very pleased with the results. I had attempted to digitize some of the tapes before using a PC and a fire-wire connected camcorder with a builtin conversion function but it was a complicated operation and in the end the results weren't any better than I got using the ClearClick Video to Digital Converter 2.0.Using the ClearClick Video to Digital Converter 2.0 is very simple and I tested recording to a micro microSD and to a  USB thumb drive and both worked fine. I tried to limit the captures to about 30 minutes (1GB)  to make them more manageable when I finally get around to doing some editing.Typical Capture ResultsVideo Length 00:32:53  Frame width 720 Frame height 480  size 998MB
5,Once I got one of these my brother just had to get one too. He's thanked me several times now for showing him this unit. Works well to preserve the old home movies.
5,Wish there was a Monday thru Friday recording selection otherwise a worthy purchase.
5,Ok I absolutely love this thing  I have a older professional  camcorder that uses old school mini dv tapes  the camera works beautifully but the storage medium is dated. This converter plugs right into the rca jacks or the s video plug on the back of the camera  I can digitally record what the camera is viewing that's a plus because it uses less camera battery power  or off the dv tapes in vcr  mode no probem. The controls are self explanatory and easy to use it fits in well for what I do and is small and light weight. Only complaint is that maybe I should have went with a model that has an internal battery  though this is not to much of a complaint because I just use the external cell phone battery  back up kind of  packs to power it.
5,I have tried a handful of other products that connect via usb to a computer but found this to be both the simplest and most consistent device of all I've tried. With the USB ones I had a tough time with 3 different VCR's to start recording at the right time due to signal drop until video plays. This device handles starting before the tape begins well and handles drops in between recording segments as well. No feature (that I'm aware of) for automatically stopping the recording when playback stops but I'm happy to not have that with how consistent it records overall.
3,I'm digitizing a dozen 25 year-old Hi8 tapes. Initially I had trouble getting more than twenty minutes transfered at a time.  I discovered that this has to do with the noisy intervals that were sometimes inserted between shots.  Typically this happened back when my small children wanted to see themselves immediately on the camera monitor and the next shot was consequently not precisely queued back to the end on the last shot upon this playback.  Beware! These noisy intervals totally crash the unit -- recording stops files are erased.  This would have made the ClearClick useless for me.  Fortunately there is a workaround.  I fast-played through each tape stopping at these noisy bits.  Once I recorded over the noise all the way to the end of the tape everything else has been a breeze.  I was able to set the record timer on the ClearClick for two hours and capture each 120 minute tape without issue.  Although I expected a higher quality transfer than what I get for the price I like the concept and it couldn't be simpler to use.  Both SD cards and flash drives work just fine with less than 2 gigabytes of storage required per hour of tape.
1,VERY disappointed in this product. I had finally decided the expense was worth it since I really needed to get  25 year old family Hi8 tapes transferred to digital. Not surprisingly they are of great sentimental value.  The ads make it sound simple just plug and play - ITS NOT.1. I hooked it up and first read the little manual cover to cover - I always do this I'm detail oriented and I didn't want to risk messing up with my old tapes.  It was not helpful.1.  NO WHERE IN THE MANUAL does it explain what each MODE icon means - you're left just to guess.  I tried to set it to record and hit the REC/STOP button - no visual feedback given that its actually recording. It wasn't. Two hours later my USB stick was blank and frustrated I asked other users and got feedback from the manufacturer saying that the startup DEFAULT is in "record" mode.  I tried again. It wasn't - it seems the default in mine is screenshot pictures.  After I went through every mode and menu item I discover the default is NOT USB recording its SD (NOT MENTIONED IN MANUAL) so it didn't even recognize my USB stick.  I had to use each function BLIND in trial and error mode.  Again nothing in the manual.2. Another problem.  After setting up my NEW Scandisk USB and configuring it online it had to be reformatted on this machine which removed the encryping software.  Again nothing in the manual it just says you should use a new Scandisk.Having to start and stop and rewind old tapes every time something goes wrong will ruin them.  I'm NOT happy with this piece of junk and will be sending it back.  Seeing the answer to my question I was not the only person with a poor experience. This product is not ready for market is very poorly designed and is HIGHLY overpriced.
3,Device appears to turn off during recordings and turns to a black screen during random errors during recording initiation.  Audio and video lose synchronization during playback.  It's a nightmare trying to figure out the synchronization during post processing with third party video editing software. Captured video is darker than original video footage.Issues is clearly not "fixed".The developer needs to release a firmware upgrade.
5,I am thrilled with this product. After a dear friend passed away in the mid 90's I inherited about 30 Video8 tapes that I wanted to digitize. I've been holding on to them for years and when I came upon this gadget I figured I'd give it a try. It was so easy... I received it August 27th and have been letting it run in the background. In one week's time I got them all digitized and they are on my drive. Super easy and there's no need to bring them in through another video program. They are transferred as mp4 files. I also have some Beta and VHS to transfer and this will work for them as well.HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!
5,This product did exactly what I wanted it to do and importantly never broke down even after many many hours of use. It was also very easy to use. A good purchase.
5,I hitched this up to my old vcr stuck in a tape pushed play pushed record and in a few minutes converted an old home video over to digital
5,This is very easy to use plug it into your camcorder and play and record.  I had a lot of tapes that did not record properly but I think that was user error.  When I go back I will alternate between two flash drives to make sure each cassette properly scans.  As it was after the first test I just put one in after another without checking that I had properly hit record etc.  It was so easy I did not check to make sure each properly scanned.  My bad!  Compared to the cost of sending them out to be professionally scanned this was an ideal purchase.
5,I’m a technical person but I could see a novice finding this very easy to set up and operate. Easy to digitize videos from tapes and dvds.
5,This has been an amazing purchase. After my father passed away I found all of the old VHS tapes he had taken with his camcorder in the late 80s. This device connected easily to my VHS a player from the early 2000s and was simple to use. Considering both the videotapes and the machine I was using I was completely pleased with the conversion video quality and the file size was decent. I recomendable this device if you have simple conversion needs.
5,Work great. Convert VHS tapes to a digital format
4,Pretty good but don't leave it running for long periods of time because if the file becomes corrupted then all the time spent recording is wasted and you have to redo it. That kept happening to me so I decided to record in 10-20 minute intervals. That way if a file becomes corrupted I'll only have to redo a small section. I noticed none of the short files became corrupted only the longer ones did. Don't leave it unattended for longer than half an hour. Also use a small flash drive rather than a large hard drive with this device.
5,Very easy to operate but you'll want to explore all the menu options before operating.  There aren't many menu options but they are important.
5,Over the years I have been the family photographer and videographer and acquired a large box of old VHS and 8MM tapes. I struggled to find a product that actually work without cheap buggy software. Well this product takes the cake. I does not get any easier than this and it works perfectly right out of the box. Thank you for providing a product anyone can use and works as advertised. I have only had it two days and already archived hours of footage that  was worried would one day be lost forever. So far no complaints
4,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             for the price it's more than I was expecting.  However it works great.  Easy to use and simple to figure out.I plugged in and hit record and wow.  It's so awesome to see my old video.  Over the years I've puchased many other cheaper Software required devices and they all sucked.  This product is easy.  Simple and records at 720 p/60 fps.That's all I needed.  Plug in the Extreme Pro card hit record.  Thanks guys for a great product.  I love it.
5,The Digital Converter 2.0 came with a video that showed how to use it.  I just hooked up the VCR to the Digital Converter 2.0 as explained in the video and was able to both preview VCR tapes and/or record to a thumb drive.  Very simple to use.
5,Highly recommend if you have any old VHS movies you need to digitize. Very easy
5,This thing works great. It captures video seamlessly and saves them as .mp4 files to SD card or USB -- my experience is with SD card only. Works as advertised and is very easy to use. I utilized a brand-new high-speed SD card which is recommended. You can see and hear the video as the recording progresses. You have the option of adding a date/time stamp to the video if you want to on mine this option was off by default. Good picture quality -- exactly what you see from the copied source. It's nice to finally have those old home movies captured digitally after all these years.
5,As long as you have the cable for your vcr camera it works will and transfers from SD card to PC no problem. It has display so don't have to use display in vcr camera. Although price is not cheap this is a stand alone and don't need PC to hook up.
5,Tried computer capture software and could never get audio and video to sync properly on the pc.. This was the answer! If you have old tapes you want in digital format buy this handy converter. Works EASY and FLAWLESSLY. Well worth spending the money on Takes every bit of frustration out of converting. I used a 32gb ultra SD card to hold my files and then transferred to pc off the card. Very fun enjoying the  trips down memory lane. My wife is using windows to edit them. Highly recommend this little wonder!
5,I LOVE THIS GADGET!My family has dozens of VHS-C tapes at home that I've been meaning to digitize and this little wonder has done the trick in a very easy way. The quality of the digital version created is what you would expect out of 30 year old tapes (looks like the VHS tapes do on my television). It is also very easy to use.I would say the catch is that I already had all the other tools needed to make this work. I had the VHS adaptor for the VHS-C tapes and I had a VCR To play them on. I just hooked up the gadget to my VCR and voila!I'm very happy with my purchase.
5,I couldn't believe it a product designed to actually work! It's so simple and straightforward. There was no loss in picture quality at all. Connect and transfer it was that easy!
5,With lots of old videos (VHS) and dvd's it was time to convert them to digital formats so that I could share with family (grandkids especially like seeing their parents as children). After looking at a number of companies that would convert for me decided the cost was too high - this converter was about the cost of 1 VHS tape converted - it's worked very well for both VHS and DVD's - saves into mp4 format and I can share via YouTube to family. Easy to set up directions are easy to follow and works as it should. Very pleased with the purchase.
5,Make sure you have all the necessary cables and if you haven't used your VCR in a while test it to make sureit's not going to eat your tapes. The product Clear Click has a bit of a learning curve. Watch you tube tutorials.  Have fun! and get a designated area in your house to complete your project so you don't have to continuously clean up after yourself.
3,I wanted to use this with the s-video cable to capture the video output to get slightly better picture quality. However it does not work. The manual doesn’t even mention s-video besides showing that it does have an “optional” port (albeit useless.)I had the audio cables plugged into their respective ports and had the s-video cable connected properly. I went to the menu options changed the video sourcefr AV to s-video and nothing. Plain ol’ fail. Doesn’t work. Tried all combinations nada.Although I am disappointed about not being able to record the way I was intending to (and the way it was advertised) I guess I’ll have to make due with the standard AV cables and record this way. Bummer.
5,This item could not be easier to set up and use.  The cables are color-coded to match the VCR output and the controls are easy to read even for my old eyes.  The on-screen display allows you to begin recording exactly where you want and there is a volume control that enables you to watch the video or reduce the sound while it records.  The app records a photo of the recording so that you don’t have to search manually through your list.  I am very pleased with this product; I have been looking for something like this for a long time.
5,The picture quality is the same on the VHS tape and I’m super happy with my purchase! Great audio just one thing when I would get other devices close to the converter it would do some type of interference with the audio but I kept my phone and other devices away and it would play perfect audio no static noises. It worked great for me and now I can share my home videos with my family and keep sharing memories of loved ones that passed!!! Would highly recommend to restore your family and friends home videos!
5,Easy to use. Video Tutorial and User's Manual & Quick Start Guide provide very adequate detailsfor product set up and operation. Transferred 30 year old VHS to recommended SanDiskUltra 32 GB / USB 3.0 Flash Drive. Easy download of video from flash drive to video fileon desk top computer.  Additional copies were effortlessly made by sending the computer video file to otherSanDisk Ultra 32 GB / USB 3.0 Flash Drive units that were inserted into the USBport on the front of the computer.
5,I am technically challenged and I could make it work!
5,works perfect
5,I tried 3 of the cheaper converters and none of them worked just like what many of the reviewers warned about.  I set this one up with the same equipment and it worked perfectly.  I converted VHS tapes and homemade DVDs.  Any chapter structure in the DVDs was ignored and the entire video was captured in one piece which was fine with me.  All conversions were captured to Mp4 files ready for editing.  This nifty little device is all I needed to watch and hear the video as it was being captured to my USB flash drive.  Huge relief and fun to use.  Now I need to find a beta tape player.
1,I spent around 2 months with four VCR players three different USB devices and a lot of patience before ultimately giving up on it and using a product I bought from Best Buy.  Trying to get my device to work was not easy. I purchased for Christmas and there are far too many details that you have to meet in order for it to work properly. Tech support was friendly and on top of it but inefficient as they communicate through email and it felt like they always had a different reason as to why it was your fault that their product wasn’t working.I had problems with the video jerking when it was getting recorded and when it was transferred the jerking was also transferred. The different device did not have this. I had thought that it was the VCR or my old tapes at first. I had problems with the audio syncing up - I tried different vcrs and then support told me that it was probably the usb so I used the one the suggested. And yeah audio was still poor and not syncing. The longer the video the worse it got. The system would consistently crash.I requested a replacement and I guess the warranty allowed for that. So I got it replaced! Did not try to use the one that they sent because I honestly think that they still have some kinks to work out.Definitely was happier using the other device that I got from Best Buy and was able to finish the project in a week versus the 2 months of work I put in to Clear Click.
5,Worked exactly as advertised. I used the YouTube tutorial to set up.  A 10 year old could operate this.  The digital tape to thumb drive is excellent quality.  VHS-C to thumb drive quality is very good but it will vary depending on the quality of the tape you are converting.
5,This is a very good product for its purpose.  I highly recommend it.
5,I looked into using Legacy box to covert our videos but like many of us we have a BUNCH of tapes so it would have cost a small fortune that way.  Then I saw this converter and bought it and boy am I glad I did.  It'll take a while to get them all done but it works super easy and with good quality. And the best thing is I don't have to worry about some company losing our tapes!  This system is super easy to use and I recommend it whole heartedly!
5,I read a lot of the reviews. Some that said they had a problem with syncing video and audio.  As with most things I assumed it was probably the user not the product.  I was right!! Read the instructions fully and follow them.  ScanDisk brand lowest possible Gig (storage capacity) for transferring.  Uses about 2 Gig per hour of video.  I had no problem at all after following instructions.  I transferred to a ScanDisk 16 Gig flash drive. Formatted it with the ClearClick unit before using.  I downloaded to my hard drive after each 8mm tape I was working with erased the flash drive after downloading to hard drive and re-formatted flash after 3 or 4 tapes.  Might have been overkill but it preforms fantastically!!!!  Love this converter!!!!!
5,A great product excellent picture quality it depends on your tapes whether or not your tapes are clean or they’re very old and not looking good. It was very easy to set up however you need to make sure that you format your card to the right format for Macintosh computer but everything else works perfectly no issues like the kind described in other commentsI enjoyed this product very much as a addition make sure you format the Ed card MSDOS FAT on your Mac computer otherwise  it won’t read it
5,The ease of converting not being dependent on a pc and superb quality but most important to get in mp4 format allowed me to share play my old videos even from google cloud and stream it back to smartphone but also play it from my mediaplayer on my oled tv .  I disliked that date and time had to set manual and when set as watermark it added it to my recording which i did not intended.
5,I have a ton of older VHS tapes that I really wanted to transfer to digital format.  I tried a couple of the cheaper units but they simply didn't measure up!  This one does!!  Easy to us captures directly to a flash drive and your done!  I've transferred about 20% of what I plan on transferring and each task was completed with a hitch!  Well worth the little extra cost to have a unit that works properly!!
5,Lo compré con escéptico pero después de probarlo funcionó perfecto!!Muy simple de usar.He podido traspasar 10 hi8 cassettes antiguos sin problemas.Extrañamente solo he podido conectar un canal de sonido porque cuando enchufo ambos (blanco y rojo) suena como con estática.Finalmente usé el Svideo combinado con uno de los RCAPero el video perfecto!!Ah el  manual muy completo
4,The ClearClick product works! Seeing the video to be digitized only happens sometimes but so long as the video can be transmitted to the ClearClick product a mp4 formatted file will be produced with sound.
5,This device was so simple to set up.  Quality is EXCELLENT!  Definitely worth the price!
4,I've converted hundreds of VHS &  8 mm tapes with no problems thus far. Great little converter.
5,I had tapes in multiple  formats that could only be played through the cameras they were sot on. One was an OLD JVC (hi8 I think it was) and a newer but still ancient Sony HandiCam (mini Digital8 I believe). I was able to easily get them all digitaized with this. I DID have to try a number of different cables that weren't included before I got the on JVC to connect properly but once I did it was a piece of cake.
4,Nice devise. Pretty self explanatory. You can set timer for recording. You can create a recording length to align with tape lengths. pressing the releasing the power will turn off the screen. Pressing and holding the power will prompt to turn off the device. Volume I’ll the way down mutes the device. Only one issue I can find is if you unplug from power you loose the current date and time.
4,Great product. has worked well with my Panasonic VHS-C to digitize my old home videos. i havent had the auto stop issue others have mentioned. maybe they resolved in a firmware update. one issue i've had is that the produced videos are not recognized by iMovie. i will have to run the .mp4's thru a converter so they can be edited.
5,When I first opened the package I was concerned- one of the RCA jacks was sticking out at an odd angle from the case. But the packaging was not damaged in anyway. I fired it up and all signals were fine. With that I decided to remove the temporary screen protector but boy was that hard to remove- the screen protector was tucked under the frame so I had to use a few plastic tools and a pair of tweezers to gain purchase of the protector in order to pull it off of the screen. Those minor "fit and finish" quality control gripes aside the device works flawlessly. I am glad I spent the money to remove the computer from the video conversion equation and am also glad to see some of this old footage again!
2,The ClearClick Video2Digital Converter 2.0 does not work correctly with VHS-Tapes wich are in the NTSC-Format (mostly spread in North America) because the output format is not in colour like the film on the Cassette but in black and white. There is no problem with VHS-Tapes in PAL-Format (mostly spread in Europe). But when I buy a video grabber from Amazon-USA I would have liked that it work correctly with VHS-Tapes in NTSC. Above all for this high price. The other grabber wich I ordered from Amazon-Europe looks exactly like the one mentioned above with another name. That grabber also have problems with the NTSC-Format. And that one is made in China (says all). So my hope to buy a better one was not fulfilled.
5,I love this simple VHS-C to Digital Converter. When the video starts I wait for a good scene and then take a snapshot rewind the video and then begin recording.  It's so easy it's so simple. I have completed 7 VHS-C to digital movies so far 10 left to convert. My 90-minute video's are running about 3Gb in size. Recorded at 640x480 but the digitized size of 720 seems perfect nothing seems out of scale.  Strongly recommend this product don't send your VHS-C to someone to convert and costing $2000-$3000.
4,Thanks PotatoJet(YouTube) for the recommendation. So far so good. It does what it is supposed to do. I found some old HI8 videotape along with my old Sony Handicam circa 2002. Although the resolution is low 460 a lot of the video looks great. I found video of my daughter playing soccer when she was five now she is all grown up and going to collage.
5,This product and vendor are absolutely fantastic.I had tried another product with dismal results.Thought I would try ClearClick and am so glad I did.  Contacted support about an issue and they were immediate to respond and spent the time to make sure I was satisfied.  Don’t waste your time or money on the others.I have copied over 150 family videos on several different platforms.  This product copied them all flawlessly and was easy to use.Great product and people!!!
5,This product is just what I was looking for in order to transfer my 23 year old minidv's from my camcorder. I tried other methods unsuccessfully and decided to give this product a try. It is so easy to use and I'm happy with the quality of the digital transferto my external hard drive. I had no problems with this product and I highly recommend it!
5,I cant say enough about how easy this is to use. I was able to transfer all my old tapes to digital effortlessly. I had feared these memories were lost or that Id have to pay well over $1000 to have someone transfer them for me. Plus I didn't want to trust someone with my private moments. If you have VHS or VHS-c tapes and want them saved (and shared with family) this is the way.
5,I am not that good with technology but with the great tech support I did not need to be. This is a easy device to use but I needed some help with my 8 MM tapes.  Tyler the support person helped me answered every question and did not make me feel stupid.  They are Johnny on the spot with each question I had.  I was treated with respect and I really appreciated that.  Now I can save our home movies.  Great converter!
5,Very easy-to-use method for digitizing VHS tapes (and anything else you can play through a VCR or DVD player).  Some small degradation of quality (as expected).  Flexible enough to break up a long VHS tape into two or more smaller MP4 files OR combine several small VHS tapes into a single large MP4 file (read the instructions!).  Does audio as well as video.  I use a 32 GB "Ultra Plus" SD card - the 32 GB is more than needed (you can transfer to a laptop and start with an empty SD card every few 30-min VHS tapes) but the "Ultra Plus" = 130 MB/s write speed which is advisable.  Good system and way cheaper than sending several dozen 30-min VHS tapes to a commercial digitizer."
5,I was using to preserve my families home videos for over 30 years. Has been doing a wonderful job!
2,I bought two of these hoping I could record from both VHS and Hi8mm video machines.  The unit is very easy to use.  Easy setup and easy to start recording.  Unfortunately that is where it ends.  I have 5 different VHS/DVD players and 4 different 8mm players.  I used both the Y/R/W video plugs and the S-Video plug.  When the video recorded it was actually pretty good.  I was already in an MP4 format and very easy to copy to the computer.  However out of the 20+ different tapes I tried to copy only two were successful and they were very short videos.  The others were all over the place.  Sometimes it would record for about 2 minutes then just stop.  Other times it would be very shaky and glitchy.  There was always a small distorted line across the bottom of the video.  These lines did not show up on the recording that was playing on my monitor just on the actual transferred video.  After numerous attempts with both units on multiple machines I have given up.  I am returning these.
5,Ok...honestly I have been trying to digitize my 30 year old Sony Hi-8 videos for 30 year.  Over 100 tapes and I did it painlessly with this device.  The process was easy; plug in the cables (I used the s-video) cable and audio cables rewind tapes press play on Handycam hit record button on this device.  When finished I exported to a 5TB drive formatted for my Mac and edited the videos in Final Cut.  Thank you for making such a great device!!!
5,It worked better than I expected it to simple to operate
5,I have already recommended this to a couple of my friends that had previously checked out legacy box and just thought they were too expensive.  This is a much more economical method to get everything transferred into a digital format.  I especially like that it runs off of the red yellow and white cables so it can do more than just VHS.A VHS tape has been transferring into about a 2 gig MP4 file.  So you can put several tapes onto a 16 gig thumb drive.
5,This is a great tool for transferring VHS tapes to digital format. I was able to easily plug it into my VCR play the tape to the record on to the ClearClick and then transfer the data to my computer. Saved some old family footage and high school video tapes that were on their last leg. Video quality is decent but will depend on the shape of your VHS tape mini VHS etc. But recommended for preserving your old footage.
3,The ClearClick Digital Converter 2.0 is not a bad concept but manufacturing quality is lacking.The Negative:LOW Quality SD slot: is...well completely unusable. Card sticks I was lucky to get mine out but it never registeredLOW Quality USB PORT: I got it to work but you feel like you will break it each time you insert a USB stickOLDER DISK FORMAT: FAT32 disk formatting...is no longer a choice on most PC's. (Not available on WIN 8 & 10 PC's)  However use the ClearClick Digital Converter to format.QUIRKY MENU Layout on the converter: Eventually you get it set up though.THE POSITIVEIt works recording to a MP4 file which is compact and works pretty much everywhereComposite recording worksS-Video recording works.SUMMARYEven thought the SD slot not functional and the USB port is sticky -  it's working -  I'm keeping it for now. I purchased via PRIME so thankfully there's a few days to try it out
5,Very easy to use. Work excellent for me.
5,Easy to use. I converted many video cassettes to MP4. Now I convert all DVDs to MP4. Working great.Didn’t need tech support just turned it on connected the cable and USB Thumb drive and video played on the tiny screen.Was initially concerned after reading some of the reviews but didn’t have any issue. The original video cassettes were PAL. Very happy with the purchase. The quality is the same as the video cassettes.
5,This was quite easy to use converting videos from VHS VHS-C MiniDV and some other tape formats -- as long as you have the player device.  Put in a fast SD card play the video push a button... the video file is saved to the SD card.  Push the button to stop.  All done.  Now you can use or edit the files on the SD card.  Lots of other features I didn't need to use.
5,This is a great gadget to convert old vhs tapes. Pretty simple to hook up. It’s nice to have the screen so you can see what’s playing if you want to check it. And you don’t need a computer or laptop to save too it has a sd card slot to save automatically to.
4,Can you put a price on your home videos being transferred. No you cannot. I bought this to record HI8 video tapes and it works fantastically. At first glance the unboxing experience felt cheap but the system itself feels nice in the hand and it works great. I haven't had any issues.
4,Simple and easy to use but I found that even if you use the suggested flash drive it will not record every thing you set to record it will show an error when you go back to watch what you have recorded and I have yet to get it recognize a SD card to record on but what it does record it will enhance the picture. That’s the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 3
5,Simple to use.  I transferred 20 compact vhs to a usb drive worked perfectly.
4,Gift for my Mom. She has started recording her precious memories from VHS and camcorder tape to SD card. She has commented several times about the ease of use. She is able to view what is being recorded directly on the device without needing a computer. We recommend this product.
4,Pretty solid little transfer box - the viewscreen is useful as are the multiple ports (USB HDMI RCA S-Video etc).  Recording's a simple enough process once you get the VCR programmed and everything plugged in the right ports.  Software exports to mp4 which is easy enough to edit with OpenShot or similar freeware.  4/5 stars due to necessarily needing a power outlet to run from and because the software likes to stop recording on its own when reaching glitch/stop/transfer points on the VHS (which leads to an incomplete video file that's unreadable which in turn means having to re-record that portion of the tape).
5,This is the BEST way to transfer video from tape to thumb drive I have EVER seen! The instructions are vague but when you figure it out it works perfectly.  I had to figure out why I kept getting a .bmp file on the thumb drive when I was looking for a .mp4 file.  Then I figured out i was using the wrong record button.  I was taking a snapshot instead of recording video.
5,Easy to use all you need is patience and time.
4,Great product . I used it to record digital 8 tapes and vhs tapes. My only problem was sometimes "mostly on vhs " it would not record good . It would start flickering  black and shake. I would check the tape on a TV and it would look fine. So it had something to do with the product
5,No editing features with a 2 hour limit but it's been working great for converting videos from our 1980s vhs tapes to MP4 files. The hardest and most time-consuming part is figuring out what's even on my old many unmarked vhs tapes so I can break them up into separate MP4 files.While I find dvdflick the easiest program to burn dvds from the MP4s in Windows 10 I'm still searching for an easy to use free program to lighten up some videos before burning those dvds. For now I'm just concentrating on the conversions. If worst comes to worst I'll let the grandkids figure out how to lighten some up.
5,This was one of the rare purchases where the product was exactly as I was hoping for based on the description.  It's super easy to set up and ant the transfer quality is much better than I would have expected coming from 10 year old VHS tapes.  I have no sync issues like some users reported; I am using a Sandisk Cruzer Glide 64GB USB stick.Totally worth the money and I was able to free up tons or cabinet space too by throwing out all the VHS tapes after I converted them.
5,Wow! I could not be more satisfied with this purchase! I already had the VHS player and this Clear Choice Digital Converter has allowed me to easily create digital files on my memory stick to preserve my home movies forever.  All you need is the player a memory stick or card and this box!  No other software or a computer is needed for the conversion.  I am so happy to have found this converter!!!!
1,I have a family member that was interested in converting their collection of VHS tapes into digital media.  While not the most technically adept they could navigate the menus and options provided to record media onto the SD card.  The video capture process is simple enough select your video source (RCA/S-Video) and where the file is to be saved (SD-Card USB).  Output files were playable by the default windows 10 media player without issue.  Overall the process to capture video was as advertised.However;The one major issue we had was specific and persisted across several VCR's across RCA and S-Video.  What was happening is that seemingly at random the device would capture a frame at a very noticeable offset which would cause jittering on playback.  We tried different VCR's thinking it could be an issue with the device capturing the video while the VCR adjusted tracking then borrowed a VCR with S-Video output with the same result.  Going to the website to check the firmware version our device shipped with was an absolute joke.  You had to contact support for them to tell you if you had the most recent firmware.  After being unable to reach anyone at support we ultimately returned the product.It's unfortunate as the process is very plain and simple for those who may not have a PC or don't wish to deal with capture software.  I surmise that our issue was something software related and most people may not ever experience it.  As such mileage may vary.
4,Just did one test so far with an old mini camera.  All the computer linked devices I tried were terrible on Win10.  This dispenses with the computer and at least eliminates a major source of problems.  So far it appears to work well.
5,There's two good ways to convert VHS to digital:This is the tool if you want to create digital files to upload directly (social media) and burn onto a disc later.Very easy to use / self explanatory.If you want the VHS tape to go directly onto a DVD disc get a VCR/DVD-R combo unit instead of this unit.
5,I separated sections of video events so now each has their own file. The conversion takes up very little space on a thumb drive. I have converted 22 VHS tapes and 7 JVC Mini tapes and only used half of a 128gb memory stick. Loaded these to one drive or can load to YT for family to watch. Love it!
5,This works as described. Overall it has met my expectations. I’m merely using it to transfer videos. I haven’t tried the automatic piece yet so my only “complaint” would be that I’m watching and doing it manually but I also get to watch our family videos. I do with the screen was a bit larger because of that but I would recommend and buy this again!
5,I used this yesterday for the first time - to copy VHS home movies to a USB. The device is very easy to use. We copied multiple videos from a VHS machine to a USB and hooked up to the TV using an HDMI cable so we could easily see what was being copied (nice added feature!). I am thrilled to have this device! Simple. Effective. Yeah!
4,I’ve used this device to successfully digitize about 40 hours of old home videos. The quality renders very well at what appears to be the original quality of the tape. My only complaint is that the audio can be very quiet on the recordings. I have seen this specific complaint in other reviews so I believe that it’s an issue with the product not the user improperly using the product. Overall I would definitely recommend this product.
5,I like this product. It moves my videos over and it’s very easy to use. My only complaint is that I wish it had an input that I could use for videos that are already on a computer but need to be converted to a different format. This unit only has the RCA inputs which I can’t use to connect with my computer.
4,Used this device to convert VHS tape to digital flash drive. It works really well. Simple to use.
5,It worked out of the box. I am very satisfied.Originally I tried to buy a converter  that requires a PC with a particular Graphic card but it did not work.This product does not need a computer. It needs either VCR for big VHS cassettes or Camcorder for 8mm cassettes.You connect VCR or camcorder to the Digital Converter (cable is included) start your video  and click the Rec/Stop button.That's it.
2,Converter did not work with a single AV output from my Sharp camera.  I had to buy s $300. used digital 8 mm Sony with composite outputs to use the converter.  It worked well with my VCR/VHS tapes because the VCR had composite output ports. Given that well over 1/2 of the tapes I am converting are 8mm this was a great disappointment; not to mention the time and expense of discovering the problem and remedying it.
5,Converted all home VHS VHS-C and Hi-8 Tapes to MP4 digital format.  You do need a way to play the tapes with output connections and you do need a memory card or USB stick (I used a 128GB USB Flash Drive) but this was so simple to use.  Power on/off Record on/off and Pause recording button if you want to move to omit part of your original tape.  Screen allows for preview without a screen.  I recorded Hi-8 videos directly from the camera output.  I verified MP4 recordings as I went along and we have watched a number of family videos over the Holidays.  Success.
5,We were clearing out my stepmother's house and ran into several caches of VHS tapes. They were moments away from going into the dumpster when I volunteered to take care of them. What a treasure trove of old memories. I won't say it worked flawlessly as I found the record button to be finicky but it was worth every penny.
5,This is a LIFESAVER!!! I tried two different solutions that plugged into my computer and both had terrible quality.  THIS DEVICE IS WORTH EVERY PENNY. It’s well built has loads of options and the video converting to digital could not be any simpler.  This saved countless hours of hole videos that would otherwise be lost at some point.  Super happy with my purchase.  🤘🏼
4,Purchased 12/2020. Checked firmware mine is updated. If your VCR tape has a considerable break or blip in it the unit will stop recording even if the timer or auto detection is NOT turned on. Minor but a nuisance nonetheless.
5,I absolutely love this handy little recorder! Hours of precious home movies on VHS were at risk of being lost forever due to disintegration. Now all I have to do is pop in a flash drive and attach the appropriate audio/video cord turn on the power and begin to record. The audio and video appears on the display. So simple! I recommend this to anyone who wants to preserve their memories.
5,I bought a cheaper version which was poor quality and also stopped working after doing only a few tapes. This was worth it. The HD quality is great. Glad I spent a little extra money. It's so simple too. Plug the converter in attach the provided cables and your own thumb drive and it allows you to preview record with one button and also screenshot.
5,I was a little nervous after reading the reviews however my experience was excellent. I followed all their recommendations on getting the best jump drive and the hook up. It was easy to use and did a very good job especially since my tapes were 30 years old! I have gone through about 20 tapes so far with about 30 more to go. Very happy!
5,Just WHAT do you do with 100s of family videos?  Buy this that's what you do.  I set this up as the output to my VCR and just played the videos (with my own thumbdrive).  It encodes as an .mp4.  Copied onto my computer hard drive and now I have a digital record of those 'precious' moments from decades ago.  Great investment.
5,I have already captured 30 gigabytes of video.  Only slip up was not formatting my flash drive before I did my first video.  It is very simple to do on the device.  Highly recommend this for anyone especially people like me who are not technical specialist who wants to save home VHS tapes.  Make sure you have a working VHS player and don't worry if the VHS player doesn't display well on your new model TV because it will display well on the device.
5,I purchased this to transfer the tons of old memories I had on VHS.  Simple operation allowed me to digitize both self made and old VHS movies I have owned for years.
5,In the age of "Home Delivery" you always brace yourself to be disappointed. This item did not have many reviews but the ones it did have (3) were all good. The item was easier to use than expected. Set up was fast and efficient. An added bonus I did'nt realize was that you can stop the recording anytime and the unit makes a separate mp4 file. This is great for separating things like my daughters wedding flicks from camping trips with my g-kids which are on the same medium.
5,I bought this to transfer VHS to digital before it was lost forever. I digitized movies of my wife children family and vacation adventures. The Digital Converter was simple to use and performed exactly as advertised. It helped me complete the task I had put off for way too long. Thank you for your Digital Converter.
5,Simple to use and the results so far have been stellar. Image sound quality and ease of use are all of the benefits I have enjoyed but the biggie for me is it bypasses the need for a computer until I'm ready to upload the digital file. I haven't required any tech support.
5,works
5,We are getting rid of all our VHS tapes before they fail and want to save space but want to preserve what's on them. This does an excellent job of copying the low resolution tapes.
3,No easy to use. Very finicky. I can transfer a couple of videos and then I constantly have to reformat the sd card. When starting to record video you are supposed to press the red/stop button. Many times it doesn't work and you have to shut down and restart or try reformatting the sd card. You are supposed to start by pressing the rec/stop button but many times it just takes screen shot after screen shot before the recording. starts. All in all it does the job but it can be very time consuming and frustrating.
5,I really liked this product!!  I purchased a cheaper conversion kit but that was difficult to use and transfer videos to digital.  This product was extremely easy to use and after receiving it yesterday I've already transferred a video.  I definitely recommend this product if you want to transfer your old VHS tapes to digital with no hassle.  5 stars from me.....
5,I've tried 3 other VHS to digital converters with extreme disappointment when used with Windows 10.  Even Roxio choked and was frustrating.  I like this converter because you can use it without a computer it stores directly to a thumb drive and it stops recording when the video signal stops.  It was costly but it was well worth the price in exchange for success and no frustration!
5,I like the easy setup.  It's nice to have a small screen to view the video you're downloading. I think the volume could have been much better.
3,Anyone know why this is? There is wavy lines in the video when I record. You know when you film the screen with your phone and it has those lines? Same thing with many parts of the clips I recorded from this device.  This was amazing and easy to use. The quality was a little higher than other devices I've tested I just can't stand those wavy lines that randomly show up...
5,I had dozens of VHS tapes that i needed to put onto my computer to send out to family.  my computer was to old to capture them using Pinnacle Dazzle.  I found this and thought it was cheaper then a new computer.  i was totally amazed at the ease and quality.
5,Couldn't be happier with this purchase.  I kind of took a chance on this item because I had trouble with the first Gen model.  They improved it tremendously and I was able to convert 40 VHS tapes to digital with absolutely no problems.  I would recommend this item for sure.
5,I love it I had no problem with itIt transferred my movie with no problems  the sound is just right for me. I love it…
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Finally I found a solution for transferring some 8mm tapes I have from 2004 to digital. I've tried PC capture cards and ran into so many problems especially poor video quality. This thing couldn't be more simple to use and the video quality is excellent. This is definitely worth the investment as you'll save a ton of time.
5,The device itself is well made and easy to use.  The MP4s it creates are very good quality.  I was not sure of the Codec used to create the MP4 so I emailed Support.  I received a reply 3 minutes later!  BTW it used AVC codec which is the same as h.264.  State of the art!
5,This product has been great so far. I have already converted 9 family videos to USB (a mix of VHS and VHS-C) it would have cost more than $150 to convert this far. I bought a used VCR from GoodWill plugged in and pushed record. Picture quality is clear. We even hooked it up to our smart TV so we could watch the videos on a bigger screen as it recorded. Worth it!
5,So far so good! It works great. It even has volume!
5,I heard about this thing on a Youtube review and it seemed like exactly what I needed. After picking up a used VCR on ebay I put this thing to the test and started converting hours and hours of childhood VHS tapes. The whole process was super easy. What I liked the most was that you can review what's on your tape on the built in screen. Having it save to an SD card was also a huge plus.
4,I’ve worked on transferring my vcr collection for a long time.  Computer programs are difficult to work with. Technology is finally here. Copy vcr to flash drive and good to go.
5,Works perfectly without issue! A fantastic product that produced excellent videos and saved us a lot of worry about shipping irreplaceable videos for conversion.  The video file sizes are big but not enormous and clearly they have done a great job balancing file size vs. image quality. Excellent easy to use device.
5,I like this product.  It does exactly as it's advertised.  I've been converting old tapes.  It's east to use.  Why bother writing a review when AMAZON is going to reject this review?  Amazon keeps rejecting my G rated reviews.  I have no idea why.  I like this product.
5,I love it and thank you!
5,I had some old video tapes that I wanted to get onto my computer for editing and this device was easy to use straightforward in operation. I used a Sandisk Extreme Plus memory card and the transfer was flawless. My only problem was some of the tapes were old so the quality had deteriorated.
5,This product works exactly as advertised.  Simple to use. I was able to transfer videos off of VHS tapes to digital format.
5,Very impressed with this converter so far.  It is easy to use and does exactly what it should do. Definitely recommend it for getting tapes to MP4 files.  From my experience don't bother with the $15-$30 adapters for the PC.  Their video breaks up constantly loses sync and the sound capture almost never works.  Definitely a case of you get what you pay for.
4,Recorder 6 home movies so far from Hi-8 Video Camera the  Digital Converter 2.0 product works as described. Easy to operate. no recording issues. Recording clarity is as expect from old 8mm video.
1,I was so excited about this product. Plug play and avoid going through my computer. I was way ***way off***. Apparently if one is an Mac computer person this product requires several steps in order to get it to properly work. And while the customer support is quick to respond to inquiries they are also quick to remind you that you are an idiot. I emailed them looking for support after already having issues with the RCA jack recordings. I was sent an S-video converter by the company to fix the first issue which was jumpy video. Okay fine that worked and I was ready to begin my journey of digitizing all my VHS tapes. Then the jump drive would not format properly and after several tries of following their own tutorial the device just stopped recognizing my thumb drive all together. So I emailed again stating this was my last attempt to remedy the situation before I decided to return the product. They responded in kind by stating "we know the ultimate resolve is a return we do not need to be reminded of that." Well as a reminder anyway I have returned this item and leaving a terrible review. As someone with 30 years of video experience one would think that I could get this item to work with ease...this is by far one of the worst pieces of AV equipment I have ever worked with. DO NOT BELIEVE THE HYPE IS A SEQUEL.
5,Amazing and does exactly as advertised. I converted around 30 old VHS tapes to mp4 files (some as long as 2 hours!). I did need an old VCR to play the tape obviously but running the output through this device captured the video perfectly. Definitely would recommend and gave this 5 stars only because I couldn't give it 6.
5,This product worked as advertised and was very easy to set up. Transferred home videos from my Canon Optura 20 mini dv camcorder to a flash drive and it worked like a charm! The only thing I would change is to add the ability to change the auto stop time as sometimes my 60 min minidvs go a minute or so over 60 min somehow. If I could change the auto stop time to 65 minutes it would be perfect!
5,I was worried about what sort of job this little device could do going directly to a USB thumb drive rather than maybe a full 7200 RPM external drive or perhaps directly to a computer but it did a great job.  Got twenty years worth of videos converted in just a few weeks.  Much cheaper than sending them off to a service.
5,I found it easy to use and worked without any problems.  Picture quality is so so but I think that will be the case with any analog video to digital conversion.  I used the Clear Click with my Sony Hi-8 video camera and a couple of VHS tapes/VCR.  The Clear Click allows the use of a memory stick or SD card.  I used a memory stick.
5,Excellent.  Good mp4 results.  Very easy to use.  I cannot imagine it being much better.  Screen size good.  Pause function very useful.  1gb thumb drive will hold 25 minutes of video.  It did not seem to format the 1tb thumb drive correctly.
4,Used S-Video in and RCA plug analog sound out (S-Video doesn't support sound). Delivered decent image from VHS tapes. Had to increase sound volume using a 3rd party video editor. 2 GB per 1 hour of video. So a modest size SD card is enough to record a number of videos. Both SD card and USB drive support limited to 128 GB so don't expect to get a lot more recording space from a large USB drive.
5,I don't usually write reviews so impressed with this product I just had to. About 30 home videos from as long as 28 years ago made into video files to send to my kids for Christmas. Worked perfectly and easily. A lifetime of memories ... And I can stop worrying about the tapes getting too old to play any longer. :) Would highly recommend.
2,I was so excited to get this today and try it out so I could watch all my old 8mm tapes.  I would give it 5 stars as everything was going perfectly today and I just loved how easy it was to use!  After watching tapes for 2 hours it suddenly powered off.  I decided to just walk away and let it rest some (I wasn't sure if I over used it after 2 hours but watching my old tapes were fun)  I was also recording the video to a SD-Card as I was viewing it.  Anyway I came back and the converter would not power up.  I switched outlets just incase that was the problem but it would not power up.  Couldn't believe it - did I get a lemon?  I went back to watch what I had at least put on the SDCard but only one out of 2 mp4 files I captured would play.  The other capture said it was corrupt.  So I am returning this one for a replacement and fingers crossed the new one will work correctly.  I will update!
5,This is awesome! I've spent that past few weeks transferring hundreds of VHS Mini DV DVD and random crap to external hard drives. This is super easy and the quality is great! If you're someone like me who has boxes upon boxes of video memories that need to be saved and you don't mind spending some money then you should absolutely buy one of these.
5,Got this to record from VCR so I can transfer to DVD without tying up my computer during capture. Paired with a 128gb class 10 SD card this has been working great. Some menu differences from the manual but nothing major. Wish the automatic cutoff times were more granular (more choices) or at least had a 30min option. All in all a good acquisition.
3,Good quality video but loses sync causing dropouts everytime camera making recording was bumped.  If sync would hold I would give 5 stars.  Color & resolution is the best of any conversion scheme I have tried.  I contacted tech support & they declare that "video (I sent them sample) it good" and that's that.  My monitoring "old-fashioned" TV does not show these dropouts so I know the tape is pristine & player is good.
5,Worked exactly as I hoped. Was able to convert VHS tapes over to digital files. I was always hesitant to spend the time and effort going from VHS to DVD thinking that will soon be an extinct format so this was the technology I was hoping I could get my hands on!
4,good product
5,Very simple to use. Works great.
5,Ease of use of outstanding. I record directly onto a flash drive without running through a separate computer. I'm pleased.
5,Easy to use.  It is a little over priced but makes the transfer of my old Hi8 and VHS home videos to USB stick easy.  I think there is a size limit of the USB drive you can use.  I then was able to view videos on my phone or tv.
5,I'm so happy to have found this! Now all our old videos and hi8 tapes can be digitized and saved before they deteriorate. Very simple to operate and I can't wait to watch all our home movies again and get them saved.
4,So far no complaints just working fine great product.
5,easy to use not great quality but ok for just to capture memories
5,This converter is easy to set up and use. Can save all my old vhs
5,I'm not tech savvy so I was afraid that this might be to complicated for me to use. The gadget is so user friendly. Straight and to the point.  I was afraid it wouldn't work with my barely functioning VHS player but it did. The quality of the end  result is good. It exceeded my expectations.
5,This device is pretty easy to use had it up and running in minutes. Bought it for an older relative who is not to tech savvy she was able to understand it and has been using it with no problems. You just connect this to your VCR your VCR does not even need to be connected to a television.
5,I am a low tech person and Tyler support department lead was great.  He helped me to understand how to record the movie and was very patient with me.  I really appreciate it.  Now I have movies which I treasured I could play on my PC.  Many thanks Tyler.
3,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                             This was the quality. No matter how much we tried we couldn't get rid of the lower lines double vision. Not worth digitizing old movies with the lower quality. If they came out with this fixed this would be a really great product. No lag good audio and so quick and easy! But again. Not worth it. I'd rather go through the trouble of recording through my computer and have better quality.
5,Works great simple easy to download to a thumb drive.Good way to turn VHS to digital.I'm happy with it.
5,Video and audio excellent...so easy to use
5,I am always skeptical when I see "plug and play" but this box gets it done. I have been a video professional for 40 years and if this unit holds up I will be thrilled. I have hours and hours of VHS Beta and DVD that I need to get to digital media. This will save me thousand in transfer cost. The Mp4 's are solid and play in quicktime no problem. I highly recommend this unit. Having the ability to monitor video and audio steals the deal. Thanks
4,Very easy to use. It connected to my 8mm camcorder with the supplied RCA - 3 prong cable.  I was successful in digitizing only a part of the tape that I wanted so I am encouraged that editing is possible.  The quality of the recording was acceptable on a film produced in 1987. I used a USB thumb drive for the transfer. I would recommend this unit.
5,Super easy to use! Saved me hundreds of dollars by not using a service. I hooked it up on the counter and converted a couple of tapes each night. They saved as separate mp4 files that I was able to rename and sort.
5,I was going to spend a couple hundred bucks by sending my old home movie video tapes to Legacy Box or a similar company to digitize when I saw this. It is extremely easy to use and I have had no problems. Simply connect an RCA cable to the outputs of a VCR to the inputs of this unit hit record and DONE! I did read some bad reviews I assume maybe there are some bad units out there i didnt get one of those.
5,ClearClick is very easy to use and I've converted several of our family camcorder tapes to digital files. In fact I have saved a lot of money using this device instead of a service (e.g. Legacy Box). The device has simple instructions and a decent viewing screen. I am very pleased with how quickly you can transfer old tapes to digital files that are shareable with family.
5,I tried multiple products and software to convert my old VHS tapes and this one definitely works the best. My first transfer had flickering but tech support suggested using an S Video cable and that did fix the problem.  Tech support was very fast and helpful.
5,Decided to organize our old VCR Tapes. Ordered this  digital converter after looking at the reviews. It works well and is pretty intuitive to use. Its taking days to get through the pile of tapes but it’s worth it.  It takes 2 hrs to convert a 120 minute tape but luckily most tapes are only partial.
4,fast
4,When I first hooked this up I only got a white screen. It did nothing. I called Amazon who was unable to contact the seller but gave me email info for seller. The seller took a couple of days to email me but then sent a replacement. And a return label. The replacement unit works! So far so good.
5,This was super easy to hook up to video camera and/or VHS (I tried both). Was able to transfer all my old VHS-C tapes to an SD card (which I then put on my computer and made DVDs. The best part or function was being able to edit all of my tapes.
5,I have converted about 25 8mm tapes so far and it's done a very good job at the conversion and quality.  I have connected it using S-Video and Audio cables.  You need to change the input using the menu/settings to use S-Video and it's not automatic.  After that it was smooth sailing.  I have been using Quicktime to further cut (Trim) the video into individual videos so they can be viewed more quickly.
5,At first I was having great difficulty with the picture quality but the issue was RF noise coming from AM radio towers near our house. I bought some faraday fabric and wrapped it around the VHS unit and instantly this Digital VHS converter started working perfectly. It's very plug and play easy.
5,This is a simple and straightforward device and I have been digitizing my VHS tapes. You just need to add a USB storage drive (at least 16 GB) and press the "record button". As simple as that. The picture quality has been great so far.
5,I absolutely love this item.  I haven't had any issues.  Like the feature of being able to set the time limit for recording to usb.  Would recommend getting the 128gb flash drive.  This allows more video content to be recorded from your video source.
5,This thing works great used it to digitize several videos (from a DVR cable box and make clips from DVDs to use in school). Make sure you have a memory stick with enough space to save recordings.
1,I bought this to convert some old home videos but once it’s plugged in it keeps turning on and off I’ve tried everything I can think of to resolve the issue but nothing has worked if someone can contact me with a solution however I will change my review
5,Transferred tapes from 20 years ago pretty easy once you get the hang of it
4,Easy to use.
5,just what I needed for 8mm transfer I was able to put all my 8mm tapes on a USB an plug an play on my smart t.v
4,works read the instructions first a couple of times seems to work on my19 year old VHS C tapes the transfers came out good better than I expected.
3,This product seemed to be a pretty good solution for converting old VHS tape into digital format. And it did its job pretty good. Except S-video input produce only black-white image. If you not planning to use S-video input - this is perfect device. Otherwise select something also. I believe this issue may be related to NTFS vs. PAL standards. As this unit was manufactured in China for European market.
5,This product works great and records VHS video easily from a VCR. I would highly recommend this product to convert those old VHS tapes to digital files.The only issue I ran into was the device would restart when rewinding or fast-forwarding the VCR while it is plugged into the device. Other than that its great!
5,If you want a converter that does the job and does not tie up your computer this is the one for you.  I have converted VHS HI 8 and DV video and the converter worked perfectly.  It is easy to use and reliable.
5,I had tried various other ways to convert old VHS to digital including software costing as much as this did but nothing has worked as easily or seamlessly as this did.  You plug it in stick in an SD card press record and walk away. Perfect.
5,Did exactly what it said it would do. Description spot on!  Converted a stack of VHS quickly and easily.  A simple and economical way to convert all those boxes of family VHS tapes before the decay due to age.
5,Loving my ClearClick. Very easy to use. .MP4 format only. SVideo capability. Transferring videos as old as 1992. Can now view my transfers digitally on my Mac iPhone and IPad. Very satisfied and easy to set up.
5,Real easy to use. Was able to transfer my videos to digital files. The quality of the picture is the same as the quality of the VHS tapes. The product did what I needed it to do.
3,It mostly delivers on its promise: fast simple transfer of old analog videos. The only thing I really don’t like is that the resulting videos are rather dark. I could bring them into some video software to adjust and re-render but that would defeat the whole simplicity of this product. So it’s fine. It pretty much does what I need which is to preserve my old VHS garbage.
5,I used the SD card and a Phillips VHS player.  This device was perfect to digitize the old tapes.  Does what it says it will do saves a lot of time and money and speed up my project dramatically!  I highly recommend this!
4,Did not work with SD card and downloading to my iMac. Tech support was insufficient. Then I used my RAV Power/Lighting flash drive for viewing/transferring to my iPhone and it worked great. Awesome quality from my old 20 years plus video tapes.
5,Very easy to set up and use. Picture quality on the 2 inch by 3 inch screen  was good enough to see most details. One touch of a button starts recording. A press of the button captures a screen shot. Great product.
2,The product is easy to use and convenient however  I did side by side transfers of the same VHS and 8mm footage using ClearClick  and VidBox.  The transfers using ClearClick looked OK as I wasn't expecting much but the audio sounded as if it was put through a weird noise reduction filter.  However the transfers using VidBox had instantly noticeable and surprisingly sharper video and no problems with the audio.  VidBox was far cheaper as well.
1,I used this product several times and now it no longer responds to any of the button functions. The device just turns on and off. Very dissatisfied for the quality vs price. Unfortunately I did not use this device for the first month of purchase. Is it designed to just work a few times then go into a broken mode?????
4,It was very easy to learn and it had good picture quality.
5,I edit video and had tried another product (cheaper one) and was mega disappointed. Decided on this one and it's amazing. So easy to use quality is great. I was able to record and share old  8Hi footage from over 20 years ago and convert.Worth every penny.
5,I am definitely not a tech person but this was extremely easy to use.  My biggest hurdle was figuring out the correct connection between the devices once that was done easy as can be.  I have already filled 2 thumb drives.  Also worth noting that the files were easy to open on my computer.  I have not tried on a TV.
5,This thing is awesome! I've transferred a number of VHS tapes and they look fantastic. Make sure to get a usb 3.0 thumb drive otherwise you will have stuttering. Thanks for keeping my memories alive
5,I’m extremely happy with this! I’ve transferred at least 40 home videos already and it’s made the family very happy to see them again!
3,Hoped to save old VCR videos. Nope!
5,I was able to successfully digitize more than 100 Mini DV tapes and dozens of VCR Tapes. No Problems whatsoever
4,Worked as expected. Pleased with function. Converted all tapes to SD cards! Very pleased!
2,Would have liked to send it back but feel like I waited too long.  Worked many hours transferring VHS.... then when we sat down to watch it (just recently) the picture was jerking around. Have not had time to try and figure out what went wrong.
5,Used this to copy VHS tapes to my computer. I got good video and audio synchronisation that I didn't get with the cheaper $15 USB converter. It is worth the extra cost.
5,Easy to use
4,So far great product. I had some old DVCassette tapes from my camcorder. I  was able to transfer them to a thumb drive.About 2.4 GB file from a 90 minute tape. It is very simple to use. I am very pleased with my purchase.
4,It was rather concise and Amazon rejected it.  So here it is again with the same content but no details.  Great device.  Works fine.  Documentation and Technical Support - not good.
5,I am very happy with my purchase. Simple and intuitive operation with a well written manual. Does a great job digitizing my family’s VHS tapes. I would recommend this device to anyone wanting a simple and reliable method of capturing video.
3,This purchase is still sitting with me unused. Looks like I need to buy some cables or adaptors. My Bluray player has only an HDMI output whereas this ClearClick has only RCA cables. So I am looking for some way to connect so that my transfers can be successful. So I am kind of neutral at this stage.
5,I was able to save videos of memories onto YouTube and Vimeo of Family  moments I thought were lost in time.  Perfect device for sharing moments from the past into the present.  Best gift of 2020 and beyond.
4,Did a good job recording but slight pause in Vedic being copied can cause you to loose the entire recording.
3,The item works but if you use the old audio & video connectors that come with old VCRs the picture is not as good as using an S video cable.  Also if you have a tape that is over 2 hours you need a minimum 32GB flashdrive or it will not fit everything.  The sound seems a little lower when it is transferred onto the flash drive even if the unit is on maximum.  However overall it stills serves the purpose of transferring old VCR recordings to a flash drive.
5,This is a great product. I just transferred about 60 hours of VHS VHS-C and mini DV footages to MP4 files in two 512 GB flash drives.
5,Very simple to use and does exactly what I needed it to doThe timer is a nice featureIt takes a lot of time to do all the tape transfers but definitely worth it
5,I am very happy with this gadget. It has easily transferred my VHS tapes to Digital. I did have to buy a bigger storage device for the movies - a jump drive was not enough for what I had.  I didn't give stars for the tech support because I haven't had to use them.  well worth the money for me
5,This is a very awesome captured device. When I recorded my VHS tapes they came out just right. I highly recommend anyone who's interested re-capturing their old videos and want them put to your computer this is the perfect video converter you definitely ought to buy.
5,Had a problem with using the wrong cord and was not getting sound.  Keith with Support helped me figure out what was going on.  He even gave me the link to get the correct cord.  Thank You Keith.  I love this ClearClick.
5,Worked exactly as advertised.  Very old 8mm video tapes transferred smoothly.
4,The SD card slot was upside down. The device work as expected with no problems.
3,I  converted many VHS tapes to digital using this product. Was very happy with the ease of use and the video results. Unfortunately when I play it back on my computer often the audio is not in sync with the video. The audit lags.
5,I'm so happy that i purchased this instead of the other items that you can just plug into your computer.  The monitor allowed me to see what I was transferring and edit out parts I did not want by pausing the device.  The audio is very low when you are transferring the video but sound is normal when you play back the digital copy.  Love it!
5,No problems at all. Easy to use just plug and play.  I recorded from a DVD player Hi-8 camcorder and VCR.  No problems yet.
5,Great product! Definitely recommend toanyone interested in converting Hi-8 tapes to MP4. Very easy to use! You will be pleasedWith this product & no I wasn’t paid to write this review.
1,Unfortunately I did not open this right away when purchased if so when it broke before I used It I may have gotten money back! Went to plug it in (without any excessive force whatsoever) AND THE MICRO USB JACK PUSHED AWAY FROM THE CIRCUIT BOARD INSTANTLY!!! solders were terribly done on the crucial charging port.dont buy
5,Lived up to its billing.  Easy to use and was able to digitize all my old family video cassettes in a couple of days.
5,easy way to digitize anything that outputs rca jacks. worked great and the only thing I would add would be an hdmi in to digitize new devices. Otherwise this fit my need to digitize my old vhs tapes.
5,Great product works as advertised. It was so easy to use and produced great digital copies of all my analog VHS and Sony hi-8 tape .
5,Easy to use. I liked that no computer was required. It took me a while to get my very old VHS equipment working again. Of course that has nothing to do with ClearClick Video to Digital Converter's ability to successfully convert the analog output to digital.
5,Great product.  Easy to use and great quality.  If you have old VHS tapes don’t hesitate to get this product. Money well spent.
3,its ok and works well but is time consumption
5,I bought this with low expectations but after using it I am so impressed! Very easy to use and the video quality turned out better than I expected also! Would definitely recommend!
5,I recently purchased this item to convert very old videos from a camcorder onto flash drive.  Took me a bit to figure it out but am extremely pleased with the result.
5,A little expensive but Easy to use and simple to setuo. Glad I bought the product. Have converted several ours onto a flash drive from vhs and 8mm tapes from 1987. Minimal babysitting required.
5,Perfect for pass music from old  format to today’s one
5,Very easy to use with vcr and video camera.  Picture quality is as good as original source using rca or s video cords.  I'd buy it again!!
4,Easy to use and works good.
5,Fantastic device! Easy transfers and great quality.  The relief of knowing my older videos and memories are safe and eternal is comforting.
5,Works great just like it says just hook it up to a vcrI haven’t decided yet but I’m sure it will be fine
2,I thought this was the answer to my 30+ yr. old videos to be put on something I could edit and watch on my TV. I bought a $20 "stick" that didn't hold much so I'd need a couple of hundred dollars worth to start. I don't think you can watch on your TV? JUST THE LITTLE SCREEN IN THE PICTURE?? I could be wrong!? I'm not good with technology. 😭 😭 😭
5,Product is doing what I bought it for. Like that it is small self contained and easy to use. I would buy it again.
5,Easy setup. Watched suggested video and bought the USB they recommended. Have started converting my old VHs to mp4. It is so neat to see the files and share them :)
5,Legacy box quoted me $1700. Easy to use at a fraction of the cost. Neighbors borrowed it as well. Any media can be duplicated.
3,Quality of version 2.0 which I bought recently is less than the previous version although as mentioned in the specifications it coverts to more quality. The outcome of new version unfortunately is too much REDDISH which needs to work on correcting the colors of the whole the project. The previous version was much better in colors quality. I hope you have solutions for this issue. Regards.
3,Item works fine using a USB drive could not use or test with a SD Card as doesn't fit without forcing it in the slot area and I didn't want to take chance of card getting stuck or damaged.  Works okay if you don't mind the recorded footage being darker.  I felt it was a bit darker than I wish for but could be me being picky.  Clarity of recorded foot is fine.  Price feel is worth it.
5,I have only used it twice and it did what they said it would do.  So far no problems.
5,Quick tech support working fine after firmware update. Not the best but it did as it suppose to do.
5,Great little machine. As long as your vcr and video tape is in good working order the picture quality is excellent.
5,Easy to use and works great.  Picture quality is as good as the tape is.  My VHS tapes are 30 years old and look good.
3,There with some audio syncing issue using the micro SD card. But when I use the USB I did not have any issue.
5,TERRIFIC!!There is nothing else out there better than this device.Dont think twice. I finally saved all my very old vhs tapes using this easy to use device.THANK YOU. THANK. YOU. THANK YOU
5,Working great and easy to use! I'm using with the S-Video connection and a USB stick. Videos play just fine on my Windows 10 PC using Media Player and VLC.
5,So far I'm loving this device. I was a little leery about purchasing it because I; but it's performing like a champ. The picture quality and ease of use are great.
4,The device is very compact. It took a few attempts to get the hang of using it but once I got it it was easy to use and the results good.
4,It really worked great.
5,Excelente practico y a buen precio!
5,Being able to save my childhood memories along with my deceased parents memories. From VHS to a USB Stick and into google cloud. Priceless!
5,I have some old tapes from 2002 that were left untouched for 18 years until now. This converter brought back those precious memories I will be forever grateful.
5,This product did exactly what it said it would do. I liked it much better that the tape to DVD combo players.
5,Amazing how much video can be stored on a card
4,Keeps producing corrupted files.CLEARCLICK SENT ME A FIRMWARE UPDATE.  WORKS PERFECTLY.
1,This only partially worked at any given time. Never could get audio even though it appeared to be recording.  Tech support responded quickly with a couple of possible solutions but after trying everything I never could transfer a single tape.  Would’ve returned it but missed the return window due to traveling a lot for my job.  Will be sending all of my tapes to iMemories to transfer to DVD’s now unfortunately.  Very disappointed with this product and am sorry I spent so much money on it thinking it would actually work.
5,I have converted around 25 home videos so far with this. Everything has worked perfectly. This is very easy to use.
5,This product does exactly what it advertises and is relatively easy to use. The only issue I had to begin with was it wouldn't record directly onto my external hard drive so I had to use a flash drive put it onto my computer and then onto my hard drive. Other then that it has worked flawlessly!
5,I just got this in set it up and started recording from my Sony Camcorder. It was easy and I am so happy with it. I don't have any negative comments at this time and will update if something comes up.
4,picture quality is not great but it allowed me to make digital copies of some instructional VHS tape that are no longer available....
5,Love it quickly converted all my Hi8 tapes to digital.
5,So far this product is everything I hoped for.  Had some issues with Tech but that was resolved.
4,Device very easy to set up. Works straight out of package e does exactly what's supposed to do. May be it could come bundled with a basic editing tool (software). Overall is very well worth the price.
5,Worked well but make sure your flash drive is formated correctly.  Doesn't like exFat.
2,When it works its great but half of everything you record is not playable.  The MP4 file is un readable and from what I can tell its completely random when this works and doesn't.  Super frustrating!
5,Love this. It met all my expectations. I also bought one for my brother and he is thrilled!
5,picture quality is as good as the medium you are using...I am using my clear click to transfer vhs tapes of family videos to thumb drives...it is very easy to use.
5,It’s been so easy to record my vhs tapes to a flash drive. I’m so pleased!
5,It works very good!!
4,It's very time consuming but does a good job.
5,This is a great tool for converting old recordings to digital. So far so good
1,Based on the positive reviews here for this I decided to give it a shot.  I made sure to purchase the fastest MicroSD card (Sandisk Class 10 - 170mb/s) to prevent issues with recording.  However successful output was hit or miss.  It would record flawlessly for 1 hour and the ouput MP4 was perfectly intact and playable.  The very next attempt it would run for 10 min and then just stop for some unknown reason (thus damaging the output file).I tried recording in shorter time lengths (30 mins or less) unplugging the device off for 15 min sometimes it worked other times same issue where it would just stop recording (and damage the output MP4 file).  No luck with re-formatting the SD card or trying different SD cards same mixed results.  After a week of literally babysitting this device and countless re-attempts at recording the same video over and over I just threw in the towel.This device is out of stock so a replacement item was not an option for me.  With such a poor reliability experience I cannot recommend this to anyone.  Save yourself time and look for a better alternative.
1,Given what this product cost I didn't expect the mp4 output to be so bad. When compared to the VHS tape playing in the VCR that I used when converting the video stream the mp4 was somewhat washed out. The colors were much less vibrant and the whole thing was perhaps a bit "foggy". Ok so it's not a thousand dollar professional converter and some image degradation is to be expected but....What really put me off was the jitter / shudder in the converted video that seemed to pulse every couple of seconds. This thing is going to be returned.
1,Spent HOURS converting VHS tapes to this device.  Upon review of the files only 20% were readable the rest were corrupted.  As an IT professional I attempted all the established methods to resolve the issues e.g. checked for updates (no true functionality on the device itself); formatted SD cards between attempts; used different types of SD cards; used different MP4 playback software; turned it off and on (homage to the IT Crowd); etc.  Nothing resolved the issues...this device is buggy and unreliable...but...it has such great potential !!!  It needs better software; a method to save files as different extension types e.g. .avi .mp4 etc.BTW:  You can tell it's not totally "developed" as it has ports (USB) that are unusable.
5,If you want to convert your tapes to digital this is the only way to go! Price was good and quality is excellent!
5,It is easy to use.  I am digitizing VHS videos.
5,Very easy to set up. Records from dvd or vhs...saves to mp4.
5,We have enjoyed using this. It was easy to set up and we like that you don't need to take up time on your tv or computer because of the screen and memory card slots.
5,Super easy to use and finally found a cost effective way to get all those memories off the camcorder tapes.
5,copied one tape so far and no problems.  Easy to use and works as advertised.
5,Plugged my RCA cables into it and started recording to a memory card. Works great and super easy to use!
5,Worked great to convert some video tapes to digital files.  Easy to operate and produced good quality files.
5,I love it. Works great changing my old tapes into digital movies.
5,Very easy connecting to camera and start the transfer.  Could start one and still do something else.
5,Made transferring my old vhs tapes to digital so easy.
1,I really wanted to like this because I wanted to move some of my videotapes onto a thumb drive. The first time I used it shut off and I had to turn it back on and I took the thumb drive out to see if it taped anything and it only taped maybe a minute or less.  Then I decided to keep it plugged in for a couple of hours to see if maybe it needed to charge. After I did that I went through the process again and it shut off in less than five minutes. I am returning this because it is not doing what it is supposed  to do.
5,I'm really glad I purchased this product. I'm very happy and I recommend this product.the video transformed to a digital files looks better than I expected for a 25 year old vhs-c tape.
5,Works great. Converted some camcorder tapes and some off of old vhs. Great for my image  / video archives.
3,Couldn’t get it to work after following directions.  Could be my non techiness and not the item.  Have given up for now but will try again!
5,This worked perfect for the job I got it for. Converted some family VHS tapes over to mp4 files. Even converted some dvds over to files so the could be stored on flashdrives. Made it easier to take the flashdrive around on trips rather than a bunch of dvds.
5,Works well no technical issues. Creates MP4s- wuld be nice if created .avi but given ease of use and reliability its a great product. Helped be get all those old analogue memories digitzed.
5,The instruction booklet is very easy to read.  I was able to transfer a video without any issue.  The video and audio transfer was great.  I am very happy with this purchase.
5,I've tried converting videos before with other products but this by far is the easiest. Simple hook up and operation. For the money you would have to spend to pay someone to convert videos this product pays for itself. I highly recommend ClearClick.
3,Does what it says just not with great quality. Tried to use it for recording tv programming. The video colors look all washed out. For an over $100 device I expected better. Free phone video recording apps look much better. Tried using the highest quality SD card I could find. No Difference. May be okay for copying VHS But nothing more.
5,It's done a great job and it is making a great present for my parents.  Easy to use
3,Video is jumpy when my orginal is not. Picture on my camera is beautiful and recordings are jumpy and choppy.. check the connections and upgraded my cables. Does not make good copies.
5,Excellent device. No problems. Copied all my old VHS tapes. Very happy with it
5,very user friendly
5,I didn’t even know this type of device was available to consumer.Transferred 25 year old Super 8 handycam cassettes easily onto a 64 gb flash drive.Much easier to provide family members with copies of videos we all had quite frankly forgotten about.
5,need to purchase a flash drive but the plug it ni records directly on to flash drive. It's that easy.
5,Excellent product. Easy to use and very reasonable price.
5,Easy to use.
5,Easy to use well made and fastBetter than others I tried
5,I love this device. It works so well!
5,Picture quality is great in transferring and the smallness of the unit is nice.
5,Very convenient product to use and works perfectly everytime. Great picture and recordings.
2,This product worked fantastic for recording from old home video VHS and VHS-C.  My major issue is it has rendered my SD entirely unusable.  The second time I recorded the device asked to format my SD card for its purposes.  Since then the card has been locked in write-only mode and none of the 3 major methods (CMD Regedit physical switch) listed anywhere on the internet can fix it.  If I had know this I would have used a cheaper card I didn't need for my own camera.
3,It's easy to use good video quality but the longer the video the more out of sync the audio.
2,Worked surprisingly easy. On a couple of transfers were unreadable but all others so far are good quality. The process is simple and effective. Much better than tying up a computer for hours on end.  UPDATED REVIEW 12/6/19: Audio sync failure makes finished transfer hard to watch. I found the length had little to do whether audio sync was lost or not. It varies in distance from the visual. Sometimes sync was lost a few minutes into the video and others no loss. It's a 50/50 problem. Even in editing it is an enormous problem to sync as the audio varies from a few frames to 45 frames. Meaning once you get the sync lined up on one section it won't be a few minutes later. There must be better options for conversion out there.
5,Worked as expected..  moved over 30 gb of home movies to a single thumbdrive.
5,Extremely easy to use! Refreshing change from the old days of analog to digital.
5,This small digital converter is working perfectly as I expected.
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I had my fingers crossed for this device because I have hundreds of hours of footage to convert and I like the idea of bypassing the computer. While I didn't experience the audio/video sync issues that others have commented on or the failed recording during blank tape sections the recorded copy does have an increased 'warm' hue compared to the original tape. While that can easily be adjusted in an editor if needed the major issue is the video file is filled with what I call jitters or jumping of the images that are NOT part of the original footage. Since the device setting options are limited I see no way to attempt to fix this issue on my end.
5,This little unit does a really nice job of converting tapes. I like that I don't need an external monitor making it very portable.
5,Easy to use. Reasonable quality. Recover and preserve old vcr and 8mm video tapes. LED screen very helpful.
3,The unit is extremely easy to use however it tends to be overdriven on the color saturation which produces a darker pictures than I would like. There are no adjustments for this problem.
3,Audio is tinny mono bad quality and has sync issues with video. Not super impressed. Gave three stars because it's easy to use and the video quality is great (of course it's coming from a VCR so how good can it really be?). Very disappointed with the audio.
5,This converter is "soooo" easy to use.  Just set it up and plug in a thumb drive or scan disc press play and record.  Enjoy and preserve those memories for another generation.
5,This product worked without a glitch.  This is the easiest way to transfer old tape based video to digital.  Other options I tried would not work with Windows 10.  This makes your OS version irrelevant.
5,Did what it said it would do!  Easy to use.  Converted old old camcorder tapes to MP4 very well and also converted an exercise dvd to mp4 so I could have on my phone instead of lugging a DVD player around.
5,ClearClick digital converter was easy to hook up and use and worked great
5,Backed up scores of 8mm tapes.Works like a charm.
5,20 years later I am transferring old mini 8 cassettes to my hard drive. If you follow instructions it is very easy to use. Very happy with product.Wasn't the cheapest I found but well worth the cost.
5,Just what I was looking for so I don’t have to buy special programs or wires to connect to my computer.
5,Very easy to use. Picture quality will be as good as your tapes.
5,This is a well thought out design for making digital copies of VHS tapes. I recommend it highly
1,I bought this digital converter and it arrived today. I plugged it in to my old Sony video 8 XR SteadyShot Handycam vision CCD-TRV25 NTSC.I was able to record videos from my old Sony 8mm camcorder to the SD card inserted in this ClearClick converter.As I was recording I was watching the video running on my old Sony camcorder and at the same time I was watching the same video running on this ClearClick converter. The video on the Sony camcorder was smooth while on the ClearClick converter was very flickering.After finishing recording I took out the SD card from the ClearClick converter and inserted it in my computer. The video was just a constant flickering absolutely unbearable to watch. Seemed like it was constantly skipping frames.The SD card used is Sandisk Extreme 32 V30 U3 A1.Is there something that I am doing wrong? Is my Sony 8mm camcorder too old for this ClearClick?
5,I’m converting mini DV and old hi-8 tapes to digital and this thing is great!  Ridiculously easy to use. No issues whatsoever.  Love it!
5,Easy to transfer home movies and I'm not exactly electronically gifted.
5,Exactly what I was looking for. Thanks!
5,Product is as advertised and works great so far. Very happy
5,East setup and video capture works I used SD card and Flash Drive will try xternal hard drive next
5,Awesome!!! I am so thankful I got this to transform my home movies
5,Records on both sim card or thumb drive.  Converting VHS and 8mm tape to digital.  Does a great job.
5,I liked the ease of use as well as the quality I got from it.
5,This little device is for sure worth the money.  All I had to do was plug in the Audio and Video cables to the VHS player outputs plug in a memory stick and go.  Easily creates MP4 videos from my old tapes.  the display on the unit is a really good feature.
5,Great little machine!  It did everything I hoped it would!
5,Great product does what it says & that too perfectly.It’s a great device to preserve old memories into Digital Format.
5,This little converter works great!  It is very easy to set up even for a tech-challenged old lady!  Also I had a question for tech support who promptly replied and even followed-up to be sure the issue was resolved...great customer service!  Five stars all around!
5,Well worth the money to save old videos
5,This really makes it easy to digitize my collection of obscure VHS videos.
5,Haven't had any issue with this product easy to use.
5,Bought this for my mom to record all the old vhs to flash drive. She has loved rewatching all the old memories and now we have them all in one place.
3,It will stop transfering when it hits a  extended pause/transition between videos on a tape and if this occurs the file will not be playable.  Customer service tried to help but said I would just have to stop it before it stopped itself but I wanted something to hit record and leave.
5,Easy out of the box conversion for old tapes. Excellent product!
5,The product was exactly as described. Easy to use and reliable.Shipping was fast.Thanks.
5,This works like a charm!
1,It just does not work period. Every scan disc when transferring states that the file won't play or corrupted. After spending money on several different scan discs it still does not work. Tried to transfer to three different laptops and it won't play or work. Why buy a protection plan? They give you the run around amazon then they say they will connect you with the seller you explain everything put it in writing then they give you the run around. Not happy with the service or this product. Waste of money and time trying to get someone to help. Don't buy it or the protection plan. Why should you? I asked for them to send me another one nothing.
5,Love it love it backed up my home movies and took a nap while it worked
5,Works good just slow
5,Very easy to set up.  With HDMI output you can play saved movies onto your TV.  I love the auto stop feature that lets you set how Ling it will record and stop automatically.
5,So easy convenient and small. Excellent!
5,Works great simple to use!!
2,I used it for the first time today after having bought it over a month ago. It’s easy to use but I only used it for 10 minutes after which a loud high pitched noise was coming from it. I turned off the device but the noise remained. I then pulled the plug out of my surge protector/power strip and then the noise went away. Plugged it back in and the noise didn’t come back but maybe it will if I use it again. In case the power supply to this device is defective I decided to not risk it.
5,Works as described
5,Have been using this to digitize my VHS tapes. Have converted some old ones and sent to family.Works great!Only wish the sound was louder on the device but other than that works good.
5,Worked like a dream to transfer video cassettes to digital. Tyler in Tech Support is AWESOME!!!
5,Very simple to use no software to download is what caught my attention. So far it works great. I highly recommend this item
5,This device is everything they said it is.  It makes converting VHS to digital super simple.  I'm so happy I spent the extra money to buy this outstanding unit. Couldn't be happier with it.  5 Stars!
5,Excelente producto
5,This product is so easy to use.  It is literally plug and play!  I am very happy with the purchase!
1,I only have A RICOH camcorder and it plays on the RCA inlets of my 4k TV. So I figured no problem I will be able to use this easy as pie.  It recorded nice for 20 minutes and then scrambled the rest of the 1 hr video.I called their customer service and their only thought was some camcorders give weaker sending signals and to try a S-video cable. That is what I was using to get the picture I got.Thank God for Amazon great return policy.Don't buy this item if you have a RICOH camcorder or any lower brand camcorder.They don't warn you about this on their advertisement.
5,I had to transfer a bunch of old VHS tapes. This is the greatest gadget to come along in years. Makes makes transferring really easy. Find of the year.
5,This thing is awesome and if you have a lot of tapes make it easy! A little pricey but worth it!
3,When it came time to play the videos I saved on my computer it played some files and didn't play others. It has something to do with the format. And I think it's way over-priced especially for something that doesn't fully do as advertised.
5,Works as advertised.
4,Easy to use
5,This product is frankly what I have been waiting for for some time. This 2.0 version does mp4!! No computer needed!Sophisticated menu. Several storage options Very very exciting.
5,It was so easy to use and set up. To think this small little box can transfer all this video on a USB thumb drive without a computer! Awesome!
5,Excellent product
5,Works exactly as advertised.
5,nice size
5,Your old memories preserved. Works well and simple to use.
5,Works as advertised!  I recommend this device.
5,Transfer you video to a USB driveWorks greatYou can’t edit it but the transfer is easy put it on set the timer come back it’s done
5,This thing could not be any simpler to use. Can 100% recommend.
5,We've been converting all our VCR's to iCloud services and this converter has been very helpful in the process!  Easy to use and reliable!
5,Live saving quality device. Helped me with my online teaching
5,Easy to use and made my project simple and fast!
5,Awesome device. Easy setup and easy to use.
5,I like it very nice and useful..
5,works as advertised... even able to edit on windows video player
3,Easy to use capture quality is not as good as a $15 usb dongle.
1,So the product works and the picture quality is great but if you have a Mac computer it’s nothing but trouble and isn’t worth the money. If you plan on storing your home videos on a thumb drive be prepared to have to reformat it every time you plug it into your computer and then back into the clear click. I had to record the same video several times before I realized I would have to have a different storage option. I would have just returned it but I missed the window. I also contacted customer service several times but would just get a regurgitated version of the manual which wasn’t helpful as I had done all the same steps several times. Not worth the money...keep looking IMO
5,Really enjoy using this device -- easy to use and works great.
5,Met my needs.  Captured video stored  to 64gb SanDisk Cruz.  Transferred to Samsung 9+ via DEX station.Nice to have: auto clip end based on no sound or noise
5,Awesome productits works as intended toand easy to use.Satisfied with my purchasethanks!😁
2,The device is simple to use. But does NOT work with Apple devices.  Easy to set up and use but does not work with an Ipad or MacBook Pro!!!  I’ve spent hours transferring videos that are repeatedly deleted.  I’ve worked with their tech support team who does deserve 5 starts.  They’ve tried to help but there is NO solution.  Days of my life wasted trying to do what should be a very simple procedure.  Very disappointed.
5,I like this device.Work well. Easy to operate.
5,Great device!Easy to use. It just works.
5,Perfect order.  Perfect delivery.  Perfect functionality.
5,Exactly what I wanted. Works great.
2,Quality of image is great sound as well but after 30 minutes of recording the video starts looking with some jumps and pixels. Not recommended if you want to record more than 30 mins in a single event.I tried high speed usb different cables different VCrs and nothing worked. I ended up returning the device so disappointed.
5,Works as advertised super easy to use.
4,Great 👍👌
5,Easy to use
3,As advertised
5,I love this product. I’ve been converting movies like crazy.
5,A good device for conversion
5,Very useful for analog to digital conversion of old video tapes.
5,Awesome and easy
4,Worked as advertised
5,Convert to mp4 and save it to microSD. It is easy to use.
5,It a great editing tool!!!
2,Ordered this to transfer my Hi8mm tapes to digital video files on my computer.  Setup is super simple and no computer or software required. You transfer to a flash drive. Although very simple to use I found the video transfer wasn't that clear color was offand the video fluttered. I purchase an Elgato video capture. It hooks up to the computer and you need to download software but it worked as good as could be. I am using this and returned the Clearclick.
5,Exactly as advertised. Easy to use and worked perfectly.
1,I was really hoping this would be a workhorse for transferring out of my VCR letting a tape run and then walking away for an hour. Instead it's incredibly finicky and everytime there is a jump or a hiccup in the tape the file *may* save...or it may not! Who knows?On top of that when I compared the recording out of my DV camera into this to the recording out of my DV camera straight into my laptop with a firewire I could see the colors are way off oversaturated and unpleasant.Thinking of tossing this one on the techpile.
5,Great Item
5,Easy setup and transfer. Works exactly as the description states.
2,Shipped in 2021 with 2019 firmware. Can't download the new firmware from seller website... you have to wait for their support team to respond to an email. Not a good experience. Attempted to update firmware and the screen went permanently black. Device is unusable. A lot of wasted time and will have to return.
5,Works great!
5,Donno about some of the other reviews. Easy to figure out. And works like a charm.
5,USED TO RECORD ALL Y VCR OLD VIDEOS
1,Doesn’t work.  I purchased brand new 128 usb 3 Sandisk and it doesn’t work.  I found (like other reviews here) the video files it creates aren’t accessible with a Mac.  I also found that my brand new usb drive would run out of memory after 3mins of supposedly recording.  The instructions explain how to format etc which I did no luck.Returning for a refund.  Isn’t this supposed to be easy and work?
1,I wanted to transfer VHS to digital to store in the cloud so the rest of my family could see our old videos.  Worked fine for two VHS tapes to thumb drive transfers.  Then it stopped working.  I spent probably 4 hours trying to determine if it was the VHS player the thumb drives or the converter itself.  I emailed three times to their support folks and finally they sent me a patch which I downloaded and put into the converter.  It didn't work!  And now they won't answer my emails.  At this point I have been f---ing around with the machine for about six hours and I'm pissed.  Maybe they could have loaded the patch onto the machine BEFORE they sent it out.
1,DO NOT BUY!!!I'm returning my replacement unit sent to me because the SD slot is physically built to small. On both my original purchase and the replacement unit my SanDisk 64GB and Lexar 128GB both get stuck in the slot before even "clicking" in place. When trying to push the card in further to click and eject the card the card just gets further stuck in the unit. The paper clip in the photo points to where the SD card is stuck.Also the unit glitches and stutters the playback via recording from the RCA cables from a VHS VCR. I've tested three different VCRS connected directly to my TV and there is NO PROBLEM in playback of the same VHS tape. Stuttering only happens when viewed and recorded on this unit.I would give the unit ZERO STARS if possible because it ABSOLUTELY DOES NOT WORK as advertised!!!
5,Works great for me.
5,Worked as expected
5,recording time on a 128 GB is about 2 days .  Easy to use
5,This item worked exactly as described. Highly recommend it.
3,I received the product and it was very good and easy to use
5,Pretty nice. Actually works. Needed to copy MiniDV video format. Did what I needed to do.
5,This item is great glad to be able to put videos on thumb drive
5,Excellent product easy to use.  transferred great memories.
5,Great!
5,So easy to use.  So great.
5,Does what it says.
5,Worked right out do the box and in minutes I had my old 8mm tapes onto a USB and playing on my computer.
1,Picked it up on July 4th.Set it up with video. It powers on and then promptly powers off and no amount of pressing the power button and it refuses to power back on. Probably the most useless device I have ever gotten. I'm not sure about all the positive reviews but I received a lemon. Going to return it with a full refund. Don't you guys test your products before putting them up for sale. This was a complete waste of my time :(
5,so easy and simple yet produces great quality.
2,how come when I record it there is no sound coming out....maybe the speaker on the record is broken just zigzag sound anyone know how to fix it......today is my 3rd day of using it....
2,The product overall is good but unfortunately the AV input part was not working and has to use S-video so if your device dose have the output then you wont be able to use the device.
5,Great.
1,We bought this thinking we could save some money as we have 20+ VHS tapes to convert. We never could get it to work properly. Very glitchy transfer and poor picture quality. We returned it.
5,Great product excellent features and price is just right for electronic consumers.
1,Audio and Video won't sync up. Almost makes it completely useless.2 out of 5 stars
1,When I ordered this converter a couple weeks ago it had a 5-star rating.  That rating is now lower and I understand why.  Amazon's tech support worked with me was unable to get the device to work and concluded I had received a defective unit.  Amazon's support was great and a replacement has been shipped.  Would add the enclosed manual is poorly written and the device is not as intuitive as it could be.  Will update this review after receiving replacement unit.  Received the replacement and it too was defective although it had a different problem.  Returning 2nd defective device for credit.  Hope to find a product that will do this intended job but will not be bothered with a ClearClick product again.
5,Amazing and excellent product!  So easy to use!
5,Easy to use! True plug and play! Use it to format storage card or usb stick before recording.
5,Good item
5,Easy to use and did a good job
5,Easy to use. Converted all my VHS tapes to a SD card
5,Great productIt saved me lots of work and now I can pass my records to the future
5,Very easy to use and was delivered in one day
1,This works great about 80% of the time but when it fails it fails spectacularly. When I'm trying to transfer VHS tapes using this if there is any gaps in the recordings (think home video gaps when recording) it will stop recording. Not only does it stop recording but whatever was previously recorded on it either on USB or SD card will become currupt and won't play.This has auto record features where you can set specific recording time and it will stop after that time so I'm not sure why it tries to stop itself when video isn't detected. If I want it to record for 60 minutes just record for 60 minutes regardless of if you think there is video or not.
5,It seems that I had to set the date and time function and after that everything worked fine.
5,Muy fácil de usar y funciona super
5,Works Well
5,plugged device in my VHS and hit record. Copied to a flash drive that simple.
1,Rejected every USB drive and card that I tried. Don’t waste your money.
3,Manual indicates exFAT formatted storage is fine but only MS-DOS (FAT) format with Master Boot Record scheme works.
5,Transferred old home videos to dvds
5,This unit is soooooo easy use I was really surprised.
5,No issues
5,Works great and very easy to use.
5,This is a handy gadget
5,Very good product fast shipping
1,It did not work. It would record for very short snippets of time and then it would stop recording even though the video was still playing on the screen. I tried different videos and different settings but i couldn’t get it to work correctly. Then on the third day if trying to use it it stopped working completely. I was so disappointed! I was really looking forward to making copies of my home videos so I would have a spare copy for safe- keeping and be able to watch them on my computer.
5,Works great.  It eliminates the need for a computer.
1,I used other products to convert and this was of much lower quality than the other.  It’s easy to use but be prepared to get a video without much detail or clarity.  Not worth it if I want to keep precious memories
2,I thought this would work but the quality is not good.  I tried several tapes..and they all had a redish tint.  The results shown are inputting into my computer vs using the converter.  It's a shame because it's pretty user friendly and could be great if it worked.
1,Wouldn't sync to my video
5,Works great so far
2,It would not work for my camera needs to  convert 8m to digital.
2,It may be a good product but I just couldn't get it to work for me. It kept stopping recording with any short break in the video. My old video recorder left a gap in the recording when you paused the camera. I had to return it.
5,Easy to use.
5,Works no issues
1,VHS is 4:3. This device takes that 4:3 input and converts it into 3:2 for some reason destroying the image. Because it was such an expensive purchase I manage to make use of it with video conversion software on my computer that can revert the aspect ratio to 4:3 (extremely tedious and lengthy process).
1,I just wanted to be able to convert my old VHS tapes but was met with a blue screen. I tried the RCA outlet provided but with no results. I thought maybe the connection was wrong so I switched a few plugs (to no avail). I even thought I might have to purchase outlets since my old VCR functions with orange/yellow outlets that is until I tried to connect the device to my new TV through its HDMI cable....only to receive an unresponsive black screen. It was a bummer to say the least.
5,Great!
1,What they don’t tell you is that the image quality is HORRIBLE. It makes everything grainy and a dark yellowish green tint like a poorly lit redcam. If you care about preserving the quality of your footage this is not for you I got a refund.
2,Can't get it to work
5,Works great!
1,When I tried recording an old vhs camcorder tape the Clear Click converter displayed the video on its screen but kept saying "no live signal." It would only take screen shots not video even when I made sure it was in video "mode." Disappointing.
1,Such a simple task and it can't do it. When trying to record the any video it just does this weird skipping thing tried a different player different cables different tapes all with the same results. I'm not gonna have my home videos look like crap because of incomitance. We all deserve better and it's starting to get real annoying that amazon is allowing such crap on their website.
1,It can be plugged in turned on and basic information can be set but it and the new Emerson VCR we bought won't communicate when properly connected so this item doesn't provide sufficient information to the VCR electronics for it to run. There is a rather painful workaround e.g.  splice and solder coax cables together so the VCR can communicate with the TV electronics and play. If you don't know how to solder DON'T BUY THIS DEVISE!!!!
1,Be prepared for broken and unusable files (i.e. the photo posted in my review). The reason this is particularly infuriating is this process takes hours and hours of just letting the tapes play only to find out that the machine automatically stopped recording (even after ensuring that the auto-stop recording turned off) and to find that non of what i had "recorded" was usable. The concept is great however the end result is unusable. Still have yet to hear back from manufacture.
1,As stated by another review the sd card slot is too small! My SD card is stuck in the slot and cannot be removed. So upset. Video quality was also shaky in transfer but not on tape or camcorder. Very disappointed will try and return. Do not buy do not use an sd card if you do.
1,It doesn't work most of the time. Lots of time wasted with this product. It either doesn't sinq video with audio or corrupts the video. I really wanted this to work very disappointed.
2,The video quality is less than desireable. Images are not clear. The recording comes out a lot darker than the original.
5,Works great
1,Garbage quality just take it to a professional
1,The clearclick video to DVD was not what I was really looking for. Am sure it's a good item but I was more interested in buying a vcr that records vhs to dvd and that is what I ended up buying.
1,Do you like the color orange? If so this product is for you. If you like your videos to have a normal picture then don't bother with this. Almost all my videos turned out with an orange hue. This is a shame since the interface was easy. Wasted my money on this product.
1,I really wanted this seemingly simple product to work for transferring my old home videos from tape to digital.  I followed the directions and used the recommended SD card.  The digitized video kept coming out very jerky - unusable.  I returned the unit and bought a $30 USB video capture device which works fine.
1,I tried by using many different techniques but nothing worked. Tech support was good they send me replacement equipment but nothing worked. It recorded for about 3 seconds then then turned off. I am sorry I wish it worked but didn't.
1,At least this shows the vcr input as a decent image on its screen but sd cards it records rarely will be readable on my MacBook Air usb C input.  It also stops recording when there is a break in the vcr signal and doesn’t restart when the vcr signal resumes.
1,It arrived in an open manufactures box the screen protector had been removed and replace with fingerprints on it. I order a new one not used! Just wasted my time!
4,This device deserves credit for completing the longstanding chore of preserving slowly-decaying family camcorder tapes that I'd put off digitizing for years. After considering cheaper solutions that use a desktop or laptop computer as part of the conversion process I decided to go with a dedicated device and in general it worked reliably. A few caveats:  1. The documentation is incomplete about how to format your SD card or USB flash memory stick on a Mac though technically any Mac should be able to read a card or drive formatted on the conversion device itself. But for me the device's formatting command didn't work at all so I had to format these media on a Mac before they could be properly used by the device. ClearClick tech support was prompt and courteous in their reply but initially said my SD card and USB flash memory stick were out of spec for their device and suggested that I buy new ones of a brand and type that they recommended. In what must have been the most uninformed or deliberately obtuse technical opinion I've ever gotten their tech support actually claimed--and continued to argue HARD over multiple interactions--that microSD cards in an adapter are somehow technically inferior to full-size SD cards and that I would have to buy a new one of the latter! I argued with them on this point until they finally (almost in passing) led me to the right formatting solution by suggesting the Master Boot Record (MBR) scheme for the FAT32 format I'd been using on my media after after ordinary formatting (with the GUID scheme) failed. When both my microSD card (in adapter) and USB flash drive formatted with FAT/MBR worked on the device and I asked why their documentation didn't include that tip they claimed that Apple's Disk Utility no longer offers the MBR formatting scheme which--again--betrayed either ignorance (every recent version of Disk Utility includes that option) or the deliberate propagation of incorrect information. Again I can't fault tech support for their responsiveness or courtesy but delivering easily fact-checked wrong advice with a strangely glib (and totally undeserved) air of self-confidence is odd and unhelpful.  2. The UI of the device is simple and crude and mostly what you'd expect from cheap imported electronics. It gets the job done but takes some time and practice to learn its various modes and menus. I was particularly mystified by the way the file system lists captured videos in reverse chronological order as you cycle through them in playback mode. Say you have three total recordings. The newest recording appears numbered as 01/03 while the oldest shows as 03/03 on the list.  3. The more I captured the more recording quality seemed to degrade until I was noticing dropped frames and random visual glitches--despite the video showing as very smooth in the camcorder viewfinder. And when I hooked it up to the front-panel inputs of my DVD/VCR deck I could see on the TV that the camcorder was putting out a nice picture. On a lark I then ran some cables from the composite outputs of the DVD/VCR into the converter and that (oddly) maintained the smoothed-out video quality with no degradation of detail or color. I have no idea why adding a component between the camcorder and converter device would improve video quality but it does.  4. Be aware that the converter offers stereo inputs and no way to "bridge" the two electronically so if your original analog output includes only mono audio get a dual-RCA (female) to single-RCA (male) adapter so you'll get (mono) audio out of both channels on the converted video.
1,Formatted on Mac computer as detailed by manufacturer but the clearclick unit does not read the drive?? asks to format it. PAIN if you have a mac
2,Did not do nothing it said it would do. In plain words it does not work.
1,This product does not work as described I will return it to the seller
2,acceptable picture quality if head of vcr not clean it stop recording not support  NTSC System
1,This didn't work for me at all. It couldn't find a live signal a majority of the time and when it did the transfer was jumpy and blurry. I returned it and will look into something else.
1,Piece of Junk . Was able to record 1 home video ... then no morevideo ( audio only )  Email support only . Waste of Money  ....
1,Item was sent broken. Had a broken and cracked screen and it does not work.  The product looked like it was used and put back out for purchased without looking at contents. VERY VERY VERY UPSET!!!
1,awful do not buy
1,Super easy to use. Would be great if it worked all the time. Says it’s recording when it is not. Bummer that I am outside my return window.
1,I’ve received two of these in this past week. The both have had cracked screens. The format in which they record only works 50% of the time.
1,I purchased ClearClick Video Digital and it never worked it didn't turn on at all. The company's tech support was not of much help I returned the item.
1,Very good
1,Looked like a good idea if only it had worked! Wasted a lot of time trying before sending back.
1,It was worthless I couln't record from vcr complete videos and couldn't move to my computer.
1,USED IT ONCE AND IT CORRUPTED EVERYTHING ! DO NOT BUY
1,2nd one replaced first does not work for long
1,The produced video was too dark
1,Audio was not good when I recorded a tape!
1,Corrupts sd cards
1,Did not do what it was supposed to
1,Did not work with our camera
1,not turn on
3,recording short videos is fine. longer videos the video file will be corrupted when i try to open it on my computer. i don't know how to fix it. ive had to re-record so many videos because of the file being corrupted. very annoying.
5,I had one of my VHS tapes converted by a professional company and it came back with streaks so I researched video-to-digital converters for hours and hours and decided upon this device based on the good reviews and what appeared to be ease-of-use.  My son bought it for me for Christmas.  It is extremely easy to use with a big viewing screen.  Many of my VHS tapes have TV shows taped between family footage so this device makes it so easy to stop and start the recording to cut unwanted footage out.  I use this with a thumb drive and then transfer to my computer.  The quality is as good as the original VHS tape.  I am beyond happy with the Video 2 Digital 2.0
1,I hadn't used this for several months after I got it. It doesn't really work at all like the directions say. It is nearly impossible to get the device to show on my computer (a Mac pro) after recording from my VHS player. It gets hung up in Mode and Menu and reset does no good. The SD files are missing when it does show up on the computer screen. Yet the recordings will still play on the device. The instructions don't cover the problems. I would say that if you have an earlier version the best thing to do is to find out from them what they will do to replace it with one that works.
2,Even when auto stop is disabled the device breaks up the recorded video into different approximately 2 hour segmented files. So an 8 hour vhs tape will have 4 different 2 hour files. I don’t like that but even that isn’t that much of a deal breaker. The thing that tips this into being a massive pain in the neck is that after the first 2 hour file the proceeding recorded files for the same recording will have horrendous audio syncing problems. For 150$ I shouldn’t have to deal with that.
5,This unit is easy to use and does not require a computer so you can record/copy anywhere. And the tech service from Tyler has been the fastest and easiest tech service I have ever had. Very happy with this purchase.
1,Excited to convert super8 tapes to digital but did not work on my old worn out laptop(faulty USB ports) so a few months later I purchased a new laptop and the ClearClick device worked fine.... except the color kept changing back and forth. 10+ emails back later after trying all their "fixes"  I'm wondering why this company doesn't just replace their faulty product. It's a $40 item and I'd gladly send the bad one back!Their Lead Support person Tyler did nothing to satisfy a paying customer. Should have bought the better known nameRoxio instead !!
5,Worked perfectly for converting old VHS movies. The preview window was a great feature to make sure the tapes were still in viewable condition. I was able to save instead of waste time with a few.A word of caution though...it will NOT improve the quality of your videos. It was a little jarring to see the end product on modern technology. But I will say this I was able to covert a certain sci fi classic that has been added to and manipulated over the past decades to its original state. That’s worth the price alone.
5,I liked this so much I immediately ordered another! Reflashable firmware holds the promise of the product getting better! I have high end video cameras that I want a variable resolution mp4 that I can review or transfer to their computer. The 4 gig file limit is not an issue if you have an editing system or Premiere. They say they're working on a NTFS compatible file system too. Only small issue is that the SD card fits snug and is hard to swap. Will be trying usb which wont have this issue. I hope they upgrade it  to format and support file systems bigger than 128 GB...
5,Did my research bought this to convert our home videos on VHS. It is so easy with the same quality as watching on the vcr. Definitely worth the price.
1,I was happy with the first use of this item until it started to shut off on its own and it also would not render right and you would get the error message a have put on this review. They also don't give you a way to check the updates to the unit and or give much support and info with the product. I would not recommend this product until this is fixed.
3,It's pretty much plug and play.I was using a software and AV to my laptop. That was a pain.  Updating codec etc. I didn't want to corrupt my OS.Picture is average.  I have DV tapes being transferred.  The picture looks more crisp on the monitor and camcorder.  I saved to a SD card.  I wonder if the HD version would be better but it cost more.The ClearClick box is not very sturdy.  The slot for the SD card is avg.  Build quality does the duty but doesn't provide confidence for long term use.**The buttons are not consistent. Sometimes you have to push the button for longer periods than other times. Sometimes you have to push the power button several times for it to come on. Same issues for the menu mode button. It's annoying!Bottom line plug n play.  Easy to use.
5,This product has been awesome. I unfortunately had issues with both of my camcorders so while the converter couldn't solve for that once I got those working it's been easy to convert the analog tapes to digital. The customer service has also gone above and beyond in terms of helping me figure out what cables I needed to use what I should order given I didn't have some of them and how to use them once received. I really can't speak highly enough of their customer service. The only issues I've had with the converter itself I attribute to tapes being old. It cannot solve for camcorder issues or tapes that have aged poorly or have damage to them - if your equipment and tapes are in good condition though it should work like a charm. The auto shutoff feature is set up to turn off at 60 minutes 90 minutes etc. so it's not "fully" automatic as I have found each of my tapes have a minute or two additional to them; I just set a timer and come back to it if I'm not actively watching the content. I've been working for about a month and a half to convert a bunch of old camcorder tapes and am very excited to be able to have them stored all in one place and easily accessible. Definitely recommend.
5,Dead simple usage great product! I'm using it with a 256 GB Samsung USB 3.1 flash drive and it's literally as simple as plugging the flash drive into the unit plugging the RCA component cables from the VCR (or other video source) to the unit turning both on and hitting play on the VCR and record on the unit! The resulting files are an exact copy of what you would see from the source material so if your VHS tapes are crap the resulting files will look the same. I'd say the best thing about this is that it doesn't require a computer or even a TV I run Linux and most recording programs are for Windows so I thought that was going to be an issue but this completely sidesteps that issue.
5,I am converting all my videos from when my children were first born and growing up. The tape I am currently doing is over 30 years old. The picture is crisp and clear. Gorgeous. Sound quality is excellent The Clear Click is simple to set up and easy to use. We haven't viewed these videos in dozens of years. I am putting these together as a Christmas  gift for my wife and children. I can only say this product is awesome.  No need for customer support so I can't comment on that. I highly recommend this product.
5,I tried several other converters that fell apart or just didn't work but this ClearClick Video to Digital Converter 2.0 (Second Generation) worked perfectly and is very user friendly. At first I had a problem with the picture jumping on the device and on my computer but I contacted the tech support late in the day not expecting to hear from them till the following day. They got back to me within minutes! They are incredibly helpful and had the easiest fix which was an S cable. When I got the cable that indeed was the fix. No more jumps! I have converted about 65 tapes and it's still working great. This converter is more expensive but compared to other options it's well worth the cost and has paid for itself considering I could have paid $1000 or more to have somebody else transfer them.  If you're on the fence don't give it another thought. Go for it and enjoy the memories!
5,I’ve tried about every converter out there.. combinations of hardware and software trying to convert about 40 old VHS tapes I had. After searching and spending hundreds of hours playing with different variations and software options I decided to finally give this a try.This is extremely easy to set up within minutes I was transferring to digital. The picture quality and sound is identical to the tape and the file size is reasonable (about 2 gigs per hour).I wish I had found this solution first would have saved me so much time.
5,This unit works great!!!  I've digitized all of our old VHS tapes.  A 15gb flash drive will hold 4 hours of video tape.  This device is so simple to use just plug in 3 wire video/audio cable flash drive and go. Start saving those memories.  Best Amazon buy this year.
5,This tool is so shockingly simple and robust; it is all about signal sent to unit; I’ve a good VCR and when tape is in good condition picture is excellent...2 year warranty to boot - very satisfied...!
5,Super easy to use works perfect. No issues at all. Currently coping all my kids videos from vhs. Flawless every time.
5,This gizmo works really well for converting analog video to  MP4. I love the simplicity of just inserting an SD card to capture the video.
5,I've tried several different products to digitize my 8mm and VSH tapes and this is the most simple and seems to "just work."  Only had it a few days but so far I've done 11 8mm tapes and the only thing it takes is the time to play the video.  Works great and doesn't tie my computer up for hours at a time.
5,good product...
5,Buen producto
5,Easy to use. .  Great memories copying video
5,works great and easy to use
5,Great 👍👍👍
5,Easy to use.
5,Very easy to use.  I’m saving all my old videos.
5,Love it
5,Could not ask for more. This thing records like a champ!
5,I like it it works super well the only thing I would add to a more modern one is that it has an HDMI INPUT
5,So easy to use!!!
5,so far so good. solves a challenge I have been putting off for years!
3,Didn’t work out for me  return process was easy ! Thank you.
5,This little gem is saving memories for my family.  This is a simple device.  Yellow red white plug-ins go into the VHS player and this device.  Add mini USB power cable and turn device on.  Add a thumb drive. Press play on VHS player and...choose when you want to start the copy.  In the case of old full length films just turn on the recording after all the ads.  The screen will show where the film is.  The audio is just strong enough to let you know where the story is going.  Stay close by to turn off the recording at the end.  Plug the thumb drive into your computer and rename the file to the film's name.USB storage device selection:  I got nine movies on the USB that came with the device.  But I needed more space!So I bought a $30 three way thumb drive that will hold 1 TB and has excellent video capability.Now I can let go of the bulky VHS.  (I may take pics or scan the boxes before they are gone.)I am so happy.
5,Product worked as stated. I was able to plug in my VCR plug in Clear Click insert tape and record. Instructions were helpful also. I used a flash drive and was able to play the movies on my TV by just inserting the flash drive and playing like any other movie. Picture and sound is nice.
5,Purchased this item at a discount as "Used" and it performs as indicated. I recommend buying from this company. Thanks for a great product.
5,Very useful and easy to navigate! I transfer all my old minidv movies!
5,This is a great product if you are looking to digitize your tapes easily! would reccomend
5,It works perfect! Simple to use! I’ve tried several recorders that are similar but this takes the brass ring! It records perfectly and easily transfers images right to your usb! I love it
5,Save tons of money doing it myself
1,No lo he utilizado. Estoy organizando material.
5,Simple and easy to use.  Takes longer to upload than it does to convert.
5,Allowed me to transfer a bunch of home videos for my dads birthday. Now we can continue to convert more with our old tapes! This was the perfect gift and so easy to use thank you!
5,I found this device to be the final perfect solution for transferring VHS to digital from old Sony Handycam camcorder back in the 1990s... I had tried Software and a cable combination- that did not work.This device is so easy to use does not require any extra software and if you read the instructions and have the right flash drive to record to you will have success. You could use an external hard drive but you might have to program it to MS-FAT in your Disk Utility app on your computer to make it work.So far I have successfully transferred large portions of 10 VHS tapes to the SD back up and then was able to place them in a folder on my MBP 2016 computer. When the rest of the VHS tape collection is completed all the digital videos will be transferred to 2 other flash drives for my client's family members...Considering the age of the camera and the tapes (which were kept well protected in a box under a bed) the final results are amazing. Make sure you use a tape cleaner (I bought a "Dry" cleaner) before playing any VHS tapes if you haven't used your player for a while. If you have kept your tapes in a cold musty environment they may have gotten moldy or deteriorated faster then if kept in a dry place.A few tips: take your time with the setup and don't pretend you know everything. I am quite savvy and still had to go through a learning process. (No offense made or intended for sharing this.)Be sure when you attach your cables they are in the right slots. I have a Panasonic Omnivision VCR and the connection slots are not color coded because of age.So I had to make sure I read the directions correctly and attach the white connector cable to the Audio output and the yellow connector cable to the video output... that left the red connector unattached. Your VCR player may have all three outputs instead two and that is when you would use the third for the red cable... do not use the input slots at all on the player... However make sure all three color connectors are inserted onto the converter as instructed.Also it is really really important to ONLY USE a Sandisk Extreme Pro flash drive ... I tried others and they did NOT work. I had a 128 gig and it worked quite well. Be sure to keep your oily grubby dirt laden fingers off the little metal connectors or it could mess up the recordings. When inserting and removing the flash drive be careful... haste makes waste as the old saying goes...Enjoy your new Video2Digital Converter... I am and my client are extremely thankful that really old memories can still come back to life. PS: I was NOT paid to make this review and if I have any updates I will share them.... thanks for reading my review....
5,Works great!! Exactly what we needed to transfer our home movies! No tricky software to work around either!
5,Works awesome
5,I have about 120 hours of hi-8 cassette recordings from my adult children’s childhoods . Using this to make digital copies on usbs to give each of the 3 of them a keepsake before I kick off. Digitizing these through a service would have been prohibitively expensive.
5,Perfect ... No nonsense ... Easy..  does exactly what your trying to do without all that computer crap
5,This device does the job.  Plug it in hit REC and old VHS tapes become digitized.  No issues with the conversion quality either.  Glad I purchased this - my old memories are now preserved!
5,The picture quality is surprisingly good given the age of my tapes and I am very happy with this little device.  I am saving myself hundreds of dollars digitizing tapes with it!
5,quick to select the video to record
2,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 I wanted to use this to record live feed through my VX2000 I didn't realize it needs to be plugged in to turn on (i assumed it had a battery) and the quality is worse than that of a early 2000's cell phone very blotchy and distorted not like normal VX tape footage. The SD card is very difficult to pull out even with fingernails and every time its reinserted it requires a format.vid of room is example of recorded live feed.
5,If you have old video tapes and you want to convert them to digital easily then this is what you need. It`s very easy to use small & compact and no computer is needed! Well worth the money! Highly Recommended!
3,Didn’t work well. Sound was often off with video or not recorded at all
5,This thing is great zipping right through my old VHS tapes now. I've been recording straight to a SD card placed into the slot in the unit record several tapes in a row then offload to my PC. Only drawback is the SD card slot is the basic push in and then push in again to 'release'... but when loaded in it is then 'flush' with the converter on the side. To then push in again to eject requires your fingernail pretty much there is no indentation to allow your finger 'tip' to press the card in to release.
5,I am amazed at how easy this is to set up and use. We had a much older VHS-DVD converter that just doesn't compare to this.  Converting directly to mp4 format makes it much easier to share clips with family and friends and there appears to be no degradation of quality. Wholeheartedly recommend.
5,Wonderful video converter. I've converted vote VHS videos and DVD with it. The quality and ease of use are wonderful. They are easy to load to my laptop after converted. I really give this product a 10!
5,This converter works great. Easy to use. I transferred my VHS tapes to digital with no problem.  I would buy again.
5,Converted all my vcr tapes to my external hard drive.
5,High recommend this for anyone wanting to convert their video tapes to digital videos. It worked perfectly and very simple to use.
5,This is night and day for me comparing to that trash Roxio which has software required you needed to plug it into the computer and doesn't always work.ClearClick is its own system that does not need to be plugged into the computer or have software download which saves the headache and time. It works immediately without fail unlike Roxio.Putting in a USB drive or SD card is simple. When it's done recording and you transfer the video files to the computer it is flawless.
5,I have used this for several 8mm and DV tapes so far.  It works like a charm capturing and digitizing all my videos from 30 years ago. I still have many to go through and can't wait to continue.  This is the best device I have tried. Well worth the cost. I highly recommend this product.
5,ExcellentI copied a large number of old videos it's really cool and worth the money for itI recommend it for those interested in old memories
5,Have been looking for a device to transfer all of my home video tapes to digital format. Although this is a little bit more money than I wanted to spend it did a good job at capturing my home videos. The quality of course will be dependent upon your original tapes. A couple times I had a fuzzy picture and the device couldn’t tell there was video coming through so it detects the video stream. Like the auto stop feature when I don’t want to sit and have to watch each video for 2 hours. Overall very satisfied with my purchase and would recommend to others. I don’t think any device is perfect but this one did a great job for us and not much effort.
5,works well on transfering videos to sd card
4,You definitely need to use a SanDisk brand card… once I figured this out the device worked like a charm.  I was able to put a 2 hour 30 year old video on the card with plenty of space for more ….
5,Love this item! Easy to use so glad I purchased
5,I have VHS tapes over 35 years old and wanted to digitize them before they deteriorated. I've tried several other cheaper solutions that required interfacing with a computer and always had trouble with compatibility and software issues. This device is worth every penny. So far I've digitized over 20 hours of tapes and the results are excellent. The device has a bit of a personality. To turn it on you hold the power button down a couple of seconds and after you release it it takes about another second for the screen to light up so be patient with it. I also use the HDMI interface to connect it to a Samsung TV. It takes about another 2-3 seconds to recognize the TV. Two or three times I turned the unit on and saw the screen that you see in the attached photo. I don't know why it did this but it's only happened a couple of times.  I have the unit plugged into a power strip so I turned the power strip on and off and then it worked fine. This is very minor so that's why I still gave the unit a rating of 5 stars. My VCR is a Hitachi FX665. I follow the recommendation of other reviewers and hit PLAY on the VCR first and then RECORD on the unit. At the end I stop the tape first and then stop RECORD on the unit. If I miss the end and the tape starts rewinding automatically that doesn't create any problems. I just stop RECORD on the unit. However the "blue screen" that shows when rewinding is also recorded so I edit that part out. You can also "trim" it out with Quicktime. For storage I use an SD chip (Sandisk Extreme PRO 128GB 170MB/s). The unit will not record without the chip inserted. Some reviewers mentioned that it is hard to insert the chip into the unit's SD slot. It does have to go in a bit but I have no problem using my thumbnail. You can also use the edge of a credit card. There is an audible "click" when it's in far enough. The picture quality is at least as good as the original video. I have no problem with the unit heating up even when digitizing three 120-minute tapes in a day. I love the fact that the digitized file is in the standard mp4 format. I process the file on a MacBook Air with the M1 chip. I use Apple's SD chip dongle to transfer the file from the unit to the computer. It works perfectly. I sometimes edit the file using Camtasia 2021 which is also worth every cent. I have over a 100 tapes to digitize so the VCR heads will need to be cleaned regularly. You can still get VHS head cleaning cassettes on Amazon for about $12. They're good for 30 cleanings. I'm grateful to finally have a reliable and high-quality conversion system to digitize my family videos which are among my most valued possessions.
5,Seems to be working great so far!It definitely works better than the last product I bought for video conversions. It's really simple to use. Just plug it in to the VCR then plug in a flash drive and start recording. It's that simple.
5,Transfer old tapes to USB.  Easy to hook up intuitive to use.  Does a very good job transferring to the SD card but I had trouble writing to a USB stick.  Picture quality is that of the old analog reader this device doesn't harm it further.
5,User friendly ! A great item to have to save some old videos
4,If you reformat an SDXC card using your Mac make sure you use the MS DOSFAT32 with Master Boot Record and it should work fine. It did for me. BUT If you insert a brand new SDXC card into the ClearClick it will ask you to reformat it using the ClearClick itself which will cause your SDXC card to be unreadable by Macs.
5,I am very pleased with this product. I purchased this to transfer old family videos from VHS to digital and this gadget does the trick. Super simple to set up and easy to use. I’ve transferred 3 full VHS tapes with no issue. It has made my family so happy to be able to watch these videos without the hassle of dealing with the VHS tapes. The video and sound work well on the device. This gets the job done.
5,So far great..ive copied a couple of tv shows and it came out great. Very easy to operate..
5,Mine works great and is exactly as described!When I originally I received my ClearClick Video to Digital Converter 2.0 (Second Generation) device I tested it out immediately but turned out the unit I received was defective. However the seller replaced it immediately within just a few days with absolutely no hassle Great service!The ClearClick Video to Digital Converter 2.0 (Second Generation) device has almost 3K reviews with a 4.5 rating with mostly good reviews so the chances of receiving a defective unit is extremely rare!.Refer to the troubleshooting section  of the instruction manual like i did  if you are having problems with the video recording. For most cases the answers will be found there.My situation was unique and after I reviewed the troubleshooting section here is how I was able to determine my unit needed to be replaced:(NOTE #1 - As soon as you turn ON the "ClearClick (2.0) device” you will see the numbers at the top of the display start to count. That is normal and has nothing to do with the recording. The counter will not appear on the recording and only displays how long the device has been " ON". The counter always resets when you turn it back on again).(NOTE #2: If you do not have a camcorder which records the audio in stereo you will need an adapter "RCA Male to Female Stereo Audio Y Adapter Cable" to go from your camcorder's single audio jack to the "Clear Click (2.0) device" red and white jacks. This adapter is inexpensive and readily available on Amazon. It comes in 3ft or 6ft lengths but use the 3ft if you can).(NOTE #3: The "ClearClick (2.0)" device does not record "video white-noise" or " video-static"  which is the random dot pixel or snow pattern you see when you play the videotape that shows before and after the recording. When you press play on your camcorder or VCR have your finger on the "ClearClick (2.0) device" record-button" to start it AS SOON AS you see the video start playing on the screen and press the record button again to end the recording as soon as  the video ends).(NOTE #4: Remember that VHS VHS-C and 8mm Camcorder Videotapes (Betamax also) did not have the same quality as we have with today's hand-held video-recorders or smartphones so the quality of the MP4 video that is recorded from your VCR or camcorder into your ClearClick(2.0) device  is the is the same quality that you would see when you had watched the video tape on your TV).(1) While I was dubbing my camcorder video tapes the video playing on my ClearClick (2.0) device screen was playing jittery and jumpy but the video showing in my camcorder's viewfinder/eyepiece was playing 100% perfectly.(2) I checked all the AV cable connections and my ClearClick (2.0) device settings; tried to record the video again and still had the same problem.(3) I then played the video and viewed it again in the camcorder viewfinder/eyepiece but instead of plugging the AV cables into my ClearClick (2.0) device i plugged them into my TV directly and the video also played 100% prefect - just like it did  in the camcorder viewfinder/eyepiece.(4) I referred to the instructions manual and reviewed the troubleshooting section which does address jittery video issues but because the video played perfect in Both my camcorder viewfinder/eyepiece and on my TV this told me my ClearClick (2.0) device must be defective.(5) When I tested my replacement ClearClick(2.0) device and after copying 10 videos so far everything has worked perfectly ever since.The instruction manual is easy to understand. The video on the ClearClick website was very easy to follow-along with and was a good companion to the instruction manual.Watching the video you can simply pause or move the "slider" back or forward to different parts of the video to re-watch. I watched the entire video again and marked down the times of the "key features" of  How-to's I my want re-watch and refer-to again later.*** MENU Settings I use ****(A) Video Size Aspect Ratio: As per page 11 of the instruction manual "how to st the Video Size Aspect ratio" for Camcorder video tapes (using the included AV red white and yellow cables) the resolution comes already set for (defaults to) 720 x 480 . But when I played the video all the people looked shorter and wider and heads were slightly elongated sideways (oval shaped). So I changed the Menu setting to 4x3 and copied the same video again (it was a short video but you can just record a few minutes of the same video to test it). When I compared the 2 recordings the 4x3 version actually looked perfect.I did this for a few other other camcorder video tapes and 4x3 was perfect for each. This setting is saved when the ClearClick(2.0) device is turned off.(B) System Date and Time: This setting does not get saved when you turn off the ClearClick(2.0) device. This is used to identify the date/time that the MP4 file was created. You will need to re-enter the date and time every time you turn the ClearClick (2.0) device on if you want to use it.(C) MENU Options:* System Date/Time Setting (Must always be reset when you turn on the Device)* Time Watermark: (I have not used this option but if you 'check the box' to 'turn on"  the Time watermark  the date and time will be permanently  recorded and visible when it plays and may not save when you  turn off the Device).* Signal loss detection: (I haven't had a need to use this option yet).* Auto-stop recording: (I haven't had a need to use this option yet).* Video Size Default Storage Device: comes set for SD. If you are using a USB thumb drive (the maximum  size you can use is 128 GB ... refer to the ClearClick recommendation in the description) you must  manually change it to USB and this must be changed back to  USB each time you turn on the Device.* Schedule Recording: (I haven't had a need to use this option yet).* Restore factory settings: (I haven't had a need to use this option yet).* Firmware Upgrade: (I haven't needed to do this yet which is basically the Device's "operating system").*  i Firmware version: (this is not a setting and just displays the current version of the Device Firmware)The copying process from Videotape to MP4 with the  ClearClick(2.0) device will be alot of fun to do!
5,Super simple to use.  Just plug in and push play on the VCR then Record on the ClearClick Video to Digital Converter device.  I recorded directly to an SD card.  No complaints.
4,Overall I was happy with this item.  It does the job it is supposed to and I was able to transfer my Hi-8 tapes to a digital format without too much hassle.  The quality is a little off especially on images more in the distance which is unfortunate but the sound came out very good.
5,It works great
5,This product is so easy to use! I can now watch and share my kids growing up with the whole family. In just a few weekends I have converted most of our tapes to digital video files. This thing was a great purchase.
5,This was easy to use. Used it for converting Hi-8 tapes from camera to digital. Did not take up a computer to do the work. Went straight to SD card.
5,Although expensive at first it was much cheaper than paying to have 15 VHS and 8 VHS-C converted to digital at $15 each. It worked flawlessly to finally convert old family movies that I've been procrastinating on for years. Maybe they were a little darker than original but I wasn't concerned with the highest quality possible - they are ancient VHS tapes after all. I feel lucky they even still played. It recorded roughly 1GB per hour of tape. Just make sure to use a good quality Class 10 SD card (or use USB Drive) - mine is a 128 Gb Sandisk Extreme. I see others complaining about the SD slot - IDK maybe it could be better but I have no issue using my very short thumb nail to push it in/out.Tip: I haven't owned a VHS player in years so I picked one up at a thrift store for 7 bucks :) And then ran a head cleaner a couple times.
5,Over 20 years ago I was converting VHS tapes to digital on my desktop PC with a capture card.  The capture card moved from old PC to new PC over the years.  As PC buses changed the capture card would no longer fit and the OS on the old PCs became obsolete.  Now I just have a relatively high-powered laptop.I found a cache of old VHS tapes which I wanted to rip to digital and bought one of those USB VHS-to-digital devices.  It didn't meet my expectations and I spent hours trying to get it to work.  I returned it.This ClearClick was extremely easy to set up and connect to a VCR.  I capture to a Sandisk USB stick and it works very well.  The digitized version is indistinguishable from playing the tapes to a TV.  Very happy with it.I suppose if I had to point out things I don't like about it here they are:1)  It has a 4GB file size limit probably due to the USB stick being FAT32.  I came close to that limit with a 3.6GB file ripped from a full 2 hour tape.  Not really a problem though.2) It is limited to SD (standard definition) resolution so I won't be ripping any homemade DVDs I have but then I have other ways to rip DVDs.3) In the Menu there is an option to upgrade the firmware.  However I could not find anywhere on the Clearclick site to download firmware.  I did not contact their tech support since I haven't encountered any problems.That's it.  So far I've ripped 10 tapes in 4 days containing about 16 hours of content and I have not encountered any real issues.  I would recommend this to anybody wanting to rip VHS to digital.
4,Tech support was excellent! Ensure fully required media (USB or SD Card) prior to starting the process.
4,To convert old family films
5,Very easy to use.
5,This is my third transfer gadget.  The first two caused many curse words and frustration - over 15 years.  Gave up. This is a winner.  Versatile.  Just buy it.  Does just what you want.  Uploaded about 25 hours of old family videos to Youtube unlisted slick as a whistle.
5,Estoy rescatando mis cintas antiguas y ahora las tengo en mi PC... Excelente!!!
5,I recommend this.  I used it to convert a number of old VHS tapes to digital.  I had to fuss with it a bit to get my procedure streamlined.  I got a 64GB Flash Drive which was too big; each tape only used between 3 and 4 GB.  I understood I had to watch and keep an eye on it while converting so as to stop it at the end of the material on the tape but failed to catch it a couple times AND it seemed to stop converting "nothing/blank" once it got to the point the tape had nothing recorded on it.
5,This might be my first-ever review of a product I purchased on Amazon. I'm sort of at the point where I assume the stuff I buy on here is going to be really hit or miss; I've definitely gotten some off-brand items that were way below my expectations so I was wary purchasing this digital converter.I have to say I was truly pleasantly surprised at how easy and consistently reliable this was to use! Literally right out of the box I didn't even have to read the instructions. Plugged it into the wall outlet had my video gear ready to go plugged it into the converter and hit record and voila!They must have patched the issues others had because I did not have to format my flash drive for my MacBook Air iMac or my iPhone. It was plug-and-play and the videos worked immediately without a problem.One thing I noticed and I'm not sure if it's my gear or the converter is that there was a *slight* audio delay on the videos. It was slight enough that I had to double check when I was looking at them in Final Cut Pro and I was able to fix it with editing software but something to keep in mind if you plan on using the device with no edits.For those who are curious I found that each hour of video equated to roughly 2gb of space when using the max resolution settings so plan accordingly (this file size got much bigger when I exported them out in HD in Final Cut Pro but the original files were that size. I was converting 8mm cassettes from the 80s and 90s if that's helpful). I bought a 512 gb flash drive for my project and it was more than sufficient.All in all great product and I'm very happy with it. My relatives are thrilled to have 20+ years of footage available digitally and I'm now getting requests from others to do their videos next :)
4,It works but the picture and sound jump every 10 seconds or so. Its not a big deal I guess but it did happen on all 4 of the videos I ripped.
5,Very easy to use specially when you have hundreds if movies to convert.
5,It works with a minimum of fuss.
5,Honestly I can’t believe how easy this is to use. It is as simple as putting a tape in to a VCR pushing play and then record on the device. It breaks each video up into a separate file and it is done.If I would have sent out all of my old VhS-C tapes It would have cost over $1000 to have them converted. With this I was able to do it in my living room for nothing.  The picture quality is an exact replication of whatever is on the input material. I am beyond pleased with this device
5,This came with clear English instructions and a link to a video (go to their website; the link to video in the instructions is wrong).Really easy to get up and running.  The digital copy on the flash drive looks great!I highly recommend this product.Update: Does home movies great. Cannot copy a copy protected movie.  Their tech wrote to me "Yes copy protected videos cause all sorts of random errors from changing how the video displays to a lack of an audio signal."It should be disclosed on Amazon website.A response to a question there says your device does work with copy protected movies.
5,Works great
5,This product worked well right out of the box. Hooked it up and was copying VCR tapes to a USB stick in minutes. I like that you can also view and hear your tape as you are copying it.
3,was easy to use  and was a lot of fun.
5,This little device does all it's designed to do and does it very well.  Their tech support answered a couple of questions on Friday and Saturday evenings which was very unexpected.  It was customer service "Above and Beyond".What more can I say?
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Easy to capture from RCA AV to MP4 fileOne click your job easy doneEvery 1:30 hours takes 2.4GbyetIf you have converter on laptop you can convert it to MOV which the exported MOV file size will be 1Gb only for every 1:30hoursPerfect choice 👍
5,This product is so easy to use. I bought another one to have at work. I’ve been waiting forever to find something to convert our school’s old sports tapes to digital. This works like a dream! Record & upload to YouTube for everyone to enjoy.
5,What an excellent Product... easy to use and converts as intended to.
5,I waited to write a review on this item until I used it several times.  I can't believe how easy it is to use and the quality of the picture is way beyond my expectation.  I did not rate the Tech Support because I have not had the need to use it.  I bought a cheaper transfer unit and the quality of video was horrible.  This is definitely worth the extra money!  Only thing that I would improve is -- it has an automatic cut off time for recording if you wanted to use it however the first increment is 1 hour.  I have a lot of 30 minute tapes so I need to set a timer to be sure to go down and manually stop the recording.  Other than that the best investment I made all year!
5,Easy to use  When the time comes to backup old video from camcorders that used tapes (VHS HI-8 …) this device provides the perfect solution.  Download the videos from your camcorder before it’s dies leaving you no way to view old family videos onto a USB thumb drive or SD Card for safe keeping.  The only drawback to this method is that the recorder can only record in real-time. No fast copy feature.  At least the recorder provides a stop timer function so that you can set the recording time and walkway versus having to sit and watch hours of old videos unless you are in to that.
4,Just started using this product.  So far so good.  Converts directly to a USB that I can transfer to disk computer or cloud.
5,I have used this a few times and so far so good!  It is easy to use and comes with clear and detailed instructions.  The video quality is great and it the output is an mp4 file.  I have been transferring videos for many years using a device that connects to a computer and uses computer software - but that would tie up my computer for hours and use up a decent amount of space on the hard drive.  This standalone device is a real pleasure to use - I wish I would've known about it sooner.
5,Like many people who lived through the 80's and 90's we have hundreds of VHS tapes just sitting around collecting dust!  I've wanted to digitize them for years but the companies who could do it were just too expensive!  I found this product and decided to give it a try.  I'm very glad I did!  It was so easy to set up (the hardest part was finding an VCR that actually worked!!)  If I can do it anyone can!!  I have already transferred over 25 tapes and I've only been using it for less than a week!  My adult kids came over last Friday for dinner and we played videos from their childhood!  They're all getting a jump drive full of their childhood memories for Christmas!  It works GREAT!  Get this if you have tapes laying around and use it!  I would set it up behind my desk at work and let them play and record onto a jump drive and then during my lunch time I transferred them from the jump drive to my laptop.  SO EASY!  And so much fun to see the clothes hair styles and body sizes (!) from so many years ago as well as the precious memories of those who have passed away...hearing their voices and seeing them again just takes me back!  So in conclusion GET THIS!  And NO I have not been compensated in any way for this review!  I just LOVE this product!!
5,Absolute perfection once you figure how to use it. It's not that hard just a little confusing but it does work.UPDATE: I bought it in November 2020 keeps working like new October 2021
5,It was ok. I’m sure I was just miss informed
4,So I have been using this for the past 8 hours now and it works great! I have been using it for a VHS recorder so I don't know anything about the DVD aspect of it which I'm guessing is the same.The ONLY CON I have is that the recorder will be laggy and buffer the video quality. IT IS NOT THE VHS TAPE. I know the manual says that "It may be the VHS tape" but it's not. 80% of the time no problem with the video. But the other 20% it will buffer the video. So fair warning on that.You can mute the device and the audio will be completely fine while recording.
5,I was able to convert my VHS and Hi8 tapes to digital. I did have some audio problems with one of my Hi8 tapes. It made a high pitched sound when I plug in the RCA audio cables. It is great having all these memories now digitized and they transferred to my iPhone and iPad so I can play them back on those devices.I given five stars because of the ease and preservation aspects. When you see old sporting events shows and movies they aren’t necessarily the same visual quality we now get with HD Blu-ray or 4K. But that is all tolerable when you see family fiends and “eek” yourself on those old formats.Overall I am very pleased and glad I was able to convert these memories and preserve them.
5,It does just what it states and I am able to share and copy my old videos for family view!! It is Wonderful!!!
5,This is a great device. I love that it works without a computer. I just hook it up to my vcr and it transfers in real time right to the SD card.
5,This works.  Worth it
5,If you want to transfer family VHS tapes to DVD this is the easiest solution we have seen. You need a VHS player which isn't easy to get anymore but if you have one just attach the device and follow the directions. The video will transfer to a thumb drive (not included.) You can then plug the thumb drive into your computer and write the video to your DVD. (If you don't have a DVD reader/writer in your tower or laptop you will need one. My husband and I both have them. External drives are easy to find and to use.)
5,I bought this to convert Hi8 camcorder tapes to digital so we could review our family history. It is easy to hook this unit to my camcorder and easy to transfer the data onto an SD card And then it's easy to put the SD card into my computer and save the resulting files. Next I'll be trying the same process to save the videos I shot with my old VHS camcorder.The seller sent the unit quickly and it arrived on time and in great condition. I'm very pleased with my purchase!
5,We have VHS tapes from 1987 while we were in Virginia.  I wanted a way to preserve them other than a CD.  We have a VHS player/CD recorder that works great but I wanted something that I could take with me to my mother's house.  This took the VHS tapes and recorded them perfectly and installed them on a USB 32 G memory stick.  I love the fact it not only records but has playback and the ability to by HDMI cable play on your television.  I love the fact it also can hook up to the RCA cable for better quality videos.  The ability to use the S-Video cable is great but I noticed the loss of color.  This is an awesome device and I just love it!
5,Seem to work fine on the one VHS tape I copied. Fairly easy to set up.
5,I transferred all 50 of my mini dv tapes to usb without a single problem. I am not very computer literate butall went very well. I had done a lot of research and I'm so happy I found this product. And no I'm not an employee of the company!
2,This was quite an expensive experiment. For those who are not so tech savvy don't want to spend time in front of a video editing program and have shot there videos in either 3:2 or 4:3 format I guess this is the easiest way to archive precious family memories. I have still my old Sony Digital8 camera which had allowed to shoot in 16:9 but this device only allows 3:2 or 4:3 capturing so the videos will be "squashed". Now you can manually change the aspect ratio in a video editing program or when you use VLC player on a PC you can change the aspect ratio for playing to 16:9 but that's all not the ideal solution after spending this money. I may go back to firewire before the tapes "die"...
4,The device does what it is supposed to do and captures video and audio to make good MP4 files using the normal (yellow) video input.However the S-VHS facility is poor. The picture is a bit wobbly and the left 3 - 4% is distorted. The distortion is present in the digital file. This has been verified by connection to other equipment with a S-VHS output so it is disappointing.
5,Súper fácil de usar !! Estoy pasando todos mis dvd de grabaciones de tv  cámara 8 mm y mini dvd vhs en fin estoy muy contento
5,This product did exactly what I wanted I have heaps to copy and enjoy seeing the video on the small screen easy as able to walk away and let it do its thing. Service great and when I emailed I received replies.....yeah
5,Easy to use good quality conversions and very affordable price tag. Highly recommend this one!
1,It is not the original one it is the copy of the Chinese version it is counterfeit do not BUY IT
5,Excelente funciónamiento hasta el momento me parece un buen producto
5,I am now able to retrieve footage from old mini DV tapes
5,I had a large number of VHS tapes with personal videos on them and despaired that the quality was diminishing every day and I wanted to transfer them to computer to keep them as pristine as possible and to make it so much easier to access them.  This device has been a godsend and I've been able to transfer so many of my VHS videos to my PC and still have some way to go.  I haven't used all the options (like auto shutoff) but I just set it recording and leave it.  The quality is as good as the tape will allow but I at least  I have some level of copy  on my computer which is all I want to put my mind at ease.
1,I really wish I had read the reviews more in depth before purchasing this item. Straight out of the box there were issues with the USB compatibility but in ClearClick's defence they gave me a workaround for this that worked.That's where the one star comes from.The rest of my experience has been appalling. The device literally doesn't even do what it is advertised to do. If you plug your RCA directly into the ClearClick device your video will 100% of the time come through jittery and shaky and there is nothing you can do about it. It is a complete and utter waste of money.You'd get better quality video filming your camcorders LCD display with your iPhone.And what is ClearClick's response to this?"We are aware of the issue and working on it apparently if you use an S-Video converter it helps but this special converter also has to have RCA audio cords and we can't send you one if you live outside of the US and even if you live in the US this is something we are still working on and haven't confirmed will work"This is all not to mention the fact that the actual video quality/exposure comes through dark and below grade on this device.I have no idea how they have ANY good reviews whatsoever. Every bad review I have now read hits the nail on the head.Even worse I am ineligible for a refund because I stupidly trusted the product and threw the box out before taking off on an overseas trip to finally use it.No accountability from the company for selling a dodgy product that doesn't do what it is advertising it does.Do not waste your money on a subpar and borderline useless piece of equipment. Avoid at all costs.
5,Había buscado un equipo similar para convertir mis videos antiguos a formato digital incluso para respaldarlos pero no lo había logrado con productos más económicos.Este equipo me pareció un poco caro al principio pero después de ver su uso tan sencillo y práctico y principalmente al checar los resultados de calidad sin duda considero que es la mejor compra que pude haber hecho solo me arrepiento de no haberlo hecho antes...Quisiera ponerles más de 5 estrellas pero al no ser posible lo dejo en 5 estrellas.1000% recomendable!
5,En el pasado compré una "capturadora" de USB... Pero no funcionó como debía aparte necesitas tener un programa que capture bien (ya no existe casi ninguno y los que hay son del año de la canica) así que finalmente decidí comprar esta capturadora... Y MIS RESPETOS.Al principio me dolió el codo por el precio pero vale completamente la pena! Ya he digitalizado varios VHS y VHS-C y puedo decir con toda seguridad que es la opción que buscas.Es fácil de usar en el instructivo te guían a un video de YouTube que te enseña paso a paso como empezarla a usar. En cuestión de 10 minutos ya sabes todo lo que tienes que saber y estás listo para empezar a capturar tus videos.Algo muy bueno es que aquí no requieres de una PC. Literalmente todo lo puedes trabajar en dónde esté tu reproductor. Yo lo que hago es poner a digitalizar algún video en lo que trabajo en mi oficina.Es una maravilla es un producto maso menos del tamaño de un celular de los grandes.Si quieres digitalizar y no sabes la opción correcta créeme que es esta. Aunque sea mucho más caro que otras opciones es una excelente opción. Mis respetos para la marca.
5,This product is very easy to use!You don’t need a Masters in Electronics to run it!
4,So far so good
5,1- compatible with PAL/NTSC automatically2- works on many old devices such as VHS/Betamax/old camcorders using super8mm cassettes3- price is not bad4- doesn't pull alot of power i use a small power bank keeps it powered all day5- can record on SD or any USB device.
5,Easy to use have looked for years to find a easy way to transfer videos to sd cards and usb this does it all fantastic
5,Works great
5,Me encanto muy fácil de usar. He estado usándolo para pasar mis vhs a digital así como también grabar algunos programas de tele!Aunque el precio es un poco alto bien vale la pena!
