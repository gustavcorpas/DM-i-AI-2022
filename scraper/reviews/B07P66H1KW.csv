5,Final found a fit and no tucking required. Very comfortable very quiet. Now just need to change the battery to connect to Bluetooth (YouTube video available). Still works with aux cable.  The aux cord adapter to use with cell phone is great.
5,They are comfortable and fit perfectly can’t go wrong with these I have them on two setts of headphones that I use daily
5,Update :Giving them the extra star the sound quality is great and the replacement pads are comfortable wearing for extended periods of time.Original review:So far so good the pads were easy enough to replace with clear instructions. Though getting the previous adhesive off of the headphones was a little time consuming. The sound quality is amazing and they are comfortable to wear for longer periods of time. Definitely worth buying the replacement pads then spending more money on a new set of headphones.
5,Worked for me. My headphones look brand new! They are comfortable. I'll be back to let you guys know how long they last
5,Easy to install with clear instructions and all parts needed to replace padding
5,I’m so happy I decided to buy these replacement ear pads. My Beats Solo3 are old and I watched videos before removing the worn and peeling ear pads. I didn’t want to break them but it was so easy to replace. Now my Beats look brand new again. 10/10 recommend
5,Works great noise cancelation is still there and they look great. Still uncomfortable just like the original ones so they’re basically identical.
5,I was able to change out the earpads easily enough and the pads are softer than the regular which I liked.
5,Easy to replace and headphones are like new now!
5,The replacement cushions fit great can’t even tell they were replaced. Fell like the original
5,It was easy to use and my headphones look new
5,Looked up YouTube tutorials how to install.Comfort 100Look 100Noise canceling 100 :)Would def buy
5,Perfect for and made my beats new again
5,Excellent product. Better than previous replacement which did not stay on well and were thinner.
5,They make my headphones look as good as new definitely worth the price & easy to assemble just follow the instructions that comes with it. Did not need extra tools the ones provided works just fine. Apple would have charged $100+.
5,Perfect replacement for the original
5,Before finding the replacements for my Beats I was considering just buying new ones. Then I found the replacement pads and they work great!  The same as if I never replaced them.  I’m so happy I bought these!  Comfort ✔️ Noise canceling ✔️ Easy to install ✔️
5,Easy install decent quality great fit. We will see what the durability is like. Old ones were peeling and leaving blue all over my skin.
5,Great replacement piece
5,Working as expected. When installing go easy on the removal of the old cushions. The old cushions sit on prongs that hold the cushions together. If you pull too hard these will break off. Instructions don't tell you this. But definitely would buy again. They work just like new.
5,I bought Solo Beats for my boyfriend a few years ago and the earpads were starting to come apart recently. We brought them into the Apple store to see if they could replace the pads but were told they could only sell us an entirely new pair. Since we were not down to pay several hundred dollars for what SHOULD be an easy fix I perused Amazon to see if I could replace them myself. These earpads came fast the directions were simple and now these beats look good as new!
5,Worked well fit well.
4,Easy to install. A little firm for my tastes but that's a personal thing. I can recommend this product
5,It was very easy to install
5,This was well thought out and painless to install. They are slightly greyer than the original beats pads but it is extremely comfortable. Just make sure to align it properly on the one side that has a dent for the audio cord. I use my headphones every day on the peloton bike so the peeling happens quickly for me. I had purchased a silicone cover which had been very helpful. I would not hesitate to buy this again.
5,Not compatible
5,A bit bummed that Dre beats don’t sell the pads solo but saw this and gave it a try. My Dre beats look new and clean!
4,Great product a bit hard to keep the sticky part connected to the headphone
5,I have a pair of Beats Solos that I found out are Limited Edition for the Japan Market from 2017. They are rare in US Worth ~$500. The earcovers were torn up. Now they look brand new. Where did I get them? My son found them in a dumpster at an upscale So Calif apartment complex! People just toss their belongings when they move! He's found 3 flat-screen TVs. Clothing from Noracoa H&M etc unworn with tags. Hi end sneakers. Several high end vacuum cleaners. And best of all...a trash bag full of weed. There is a dispensary nearby. I'd tell you where it is but of course I'd have to kill you.
5,Replaced my deteriorating ear pieces on my Beats headphones. Amazing. I watched a You Tube video and just followed the instructions
