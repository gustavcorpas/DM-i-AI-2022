5,I really like the size of the light many of them were only 12 inches the 14 inches is much better and comparable in price as well.  I like that it has an actual plug and not just a usb.  I like that the camera holder can be removed so that it does not get in the way when using the light for make up.  Some the phone holder was just stuck there in the middle even when you did not need it and it was in the way.  The bottom has pretty wide legs when open which makes it very sturdy but it does take up more room than similar products but the sturdiness makes up for it some of the ones with smaller legs were very tipsy and you felt like they would fall over.  I also like that the is a good height some I looked at were shorter.  I like that the light is adjustable so you can angle it however you need too.  The brightness of the light is great as well as the fact that it comes with a remote control.  Overall I would purchase again and tell others about this light.
5,Great product. I take hundreds of pictures a month for an online reselling business and use the light to achieve proper lighting. My work space is in my basement which has some shadows and odd lighting. This 14" ring light makes it easy for my camera to focus and get clear crisp pictures of the items I sell. It helps eliminate shadows and provides a nice natural light. It was very easy to assemble and I've had zero complications with it's use.
5,As a therapist and having to do telehealth sessions from home I learned pretty quickly that I was needing additional lighting due certain rooms in my home not providing enough natural light.  I’ve never owned a ring LED light before and while researching what’s out there I came across this.  This is a very nice LED light and the tripod comes with is very nice and easy to use.  The full height of the tripod is also very tall which is also nice if you need the extra height for lighting.  I haven’t used the cell-phone holder in the middle of the tripod yet because I haven’t needed to.  For the price of this product it’s very reasonable and the quality is very good.  The different lighting settings to choose from are also very nice.  Overall I’d highly recommend this product for anyone considering on getting an LED ring light but not wanting to overspend for one.
4,Huh. I mean. If you are a beginner and are looking at this because you want to film top down videos and use this as an overhead light with this being your only light source….I mean - my suggestion is yeah you can buy it with the intent of seeing if this may be something you’ll stick with and want to continue doing.But the ring is a little too small. I think 18” would be better and while there are multiple settings for tone and brightness - it really still isn’t bright enough (blinding if you look at it! But I mean for videos) and it looks cheap on camera.Additionally I would not say it’s a great idea to put your phone in the phone holder at this angle. It kind of weighs it down. Also it’s not super sturdy. Like it would shake if anything bumped it.I’m going to have to think about if I want to keep it. For this purpose I would say it’s useful to get started but you’re going to want to invest in something better as soon as you can. With that is the $30+ worth the trial period? That I don’t know. It’s up to you.
5,After many tries at getting a ring light with a camera holder that fit my needs I am happy to say this is the one! It's easy to use (no explanation needed) and has so many light settings that I can use it any time of day in any room. And the base is so steady. I really thought this one was going to tip over a lot with my kids constantly walking by it but it's so steady it doesn't even wobble. I love it.
5,I haven’t used this too many times yet but so far so great! I love how big the light ring is & the tripod it sits on is very sturdy (much sturdier than my last Amazon selfie light)
5,I love this light from Sensyne.  We currently have a ring light in our house but not like this one.  I didn't even know they made the circumference in this diameter.  The massive size of the ring provides a ton of extra light for creating videos in highly low-lit areas.  The light is sturdy and very durable.  I am a pretty tall guy so I love the fact the light can extend to an extra height.  I am extremely happy with my purchase.
5,It’s very nice big and bright. I really like the 14” except for the controls being located at the bottom of the ring making it taller. It would of been great if it had option to plug in usb to be portable to use without outlet like the 12”. Otherwise it’s a perfect ring light for zoom videos work from home in a dark area. I haven’t really used the remote to know how it works.
5,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                 Proper illumination is one of the most important factors for enhancing video recording or selfies along with the quality of your camera. If you’re looking to produce professional content like videos and interviews it also makes sense to get a tripod stand in order to keep the video steady.This is an excellent ring light for all your photo and video content and comes with 10 dimmable lighting options. The manufacturer mentions that this device offers three color/light modes namely cold natural and warm light for optimum illumination. The color temperature of this product ranges between 3000K-6000K.This ring light doesn’t have a battery of its own. This means it will require a power socket nearby while a power adapter cable is provided with the ring light to get you started. Despite the lack of an onboard battery the manufacturer offers a Bluetooth remote with this dimmable ring light allowing you to take pictures or record videos from a distance of up to 30 feet.The tripod stand is made using aluminum alloy and can extend from 16.5 inches to 50 inches seamlessly thus giving you more freedom with regard to height as well as suitable camera angles. As for the cell phone holder the company mentions that this ring light can carry almost any modern-day phone including the latest crop of iPhones and Samsung Galaxy flagships.Overall this is a great ring light especially at this price point.
5,For the last couple of years I have been using my soft boxes as lighting sources. I wish I had bought this ring light earlier. It’s very convenient and easy to use. Also I love the quality of the accessories that comes with it (Bluetooth shutter controller & phone holder). Last year I bought a shutter from Amazon for $10 and I’m also using my apple watch for the same purpose. Surprisingly the shutter controller that comes with the ring light is way more responsive than both and there is no delay. The phone holder rotates 360 and has a microphone mount on it.
5,I have ordered this product couple months back and I feel this is the best one you could get in the budget.

She uses this to take selfies and fun pictures with her friends. This ring light in specific is fabulous for holding her phone too. It has a great attachment to place the phone in and securely hold it. It has grips in it to ensure that the phone won’t fall out. The light is great it has a power area and a separate wall plug so it can be plugged and unplugged as needed. It supply’s a great source of light for her. I know she absolutely loves having this in her room and her friends love it too. She gets so many compliments on the pictures she takes with this light! I’m so happy with this purchase and the price I paid for this. This has been a fabulous addition to my daughters room and I would highly recommend it for anyone even as a gift!
5,Firstly very well built and easy to assemble! The light has several settings and covers very nicely. Its fully extended size counting tripod is up to my shoulder and im 5'7". Long cord and shutter remote make it very user friendly. Only downfall is chunky plug which is a small price tbh. Id highly recommend especially at the price! No more darn videos and photos on my social media projects so excited. Company is amazing and I will seek them firstly always!
5,Amazing product. The bluetooth is great and the stand is tall. I definitely recommend this amazing product
5,Awesome product
5,The sensyne ring light is great for anyone looking to create content on your phone. The 14 inch ring light is very bright and the color temperature range allows you to have great lighting in any setting. The adjustability of the height and angle of the phone makes it very versatile for creating any content for any platform. It also comes with a very useful and easy to connect wireless remote!
