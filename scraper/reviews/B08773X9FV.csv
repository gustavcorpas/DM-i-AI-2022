5,I'm surprised at how well this little thing works.  I mostly listen to podcasts in my work van(with half the speakers blown out) so I can't speak to music quality but it sounds very clear for my uses.  It was easy to set up and I've stuck with the same station for a while now after a bit of trial and error.  I've taken many calls in my van and they've had no problem hearing me through this adapter.  It also connects to my phone automatically with only the occasional hiccup.  I wish I had gotten one of these years ago.
4,I would definitely recommend this product. I just bought an older car (2005) and it doesn’t have Bluetooth. I was pretty bummed about that at first because I drive quite a bit for work and I love to listen to podcasts. I bought this not expecting much. It works great though!  The sound it good. We had to fidget with it a little bit for the most part it was easy to install. The phone portion of it doesn’t work at all though. So if that’s what you need this isn’t the product for you.
4,Good product I’m using it on a motorcycle and it doesn’t fit quite snug enough over time it falls out while I’m on the road.
4,It works as described but the station has static not sure if that’s on my end or the device.
5,I have not been able to get it to work
5,Love it!
5,C Charger Compatibility port plus universal usb charging port! Easy to use instant connection!
5,Great hack for older vehicles.  Mic quality is ok ish but ability to BT music or podcasts works perfectly!
5,Easy to install easy to adjust and my daughter really likes the different colors.
5,My car came with a different one and that one wouldn't stay connected or on which sucks. I found this one and let me tell ya this one is awesome. You can change the color of the light on it and the sound is crystal clear and it stay connected and everything. Best buy I have made so far!
5,Works great in my old truck
5,It works great and I'm extremely happy with having my music!
5,Bought this Bluetooth adapter for my boat. Super easy to use and worked great. I also like that I can still charge my phone at the same time.  It's also cool to see the Voltage coming out of the battery as well.
5,I absolutely love this transmitter! I bought a new car that didn’t have Bluetooth and would have been a pain to put in a new stereo with this I can listen to music via Bluetooth easily change songs and take phone calls! I’m so impressed with how amazing it is!!!
5,It has helped me to be able to use my existing radio for a while. Easy to use once u find the right station. Love it.
5,Excellent item!!!
5,There are 1000 of these to choose from on Amazon and every one of them has mixed reviews. I finally pulled the trigger on this one. It literally works perfectly. If I had to find something to complain about I would say that my voice quality on the other end of the call could probably be a little better. But I don't seem to have any issues with it. I also would've liked to be able to pair to two different phones  depending on who's driving. Other then that it's worked flawless since the day I got it. You can't go wrong with this one! Good luck!
5,Works great for older car to add blue tooth.
4,The hardest part is finding an open FM frequently in my metropolitan area to avoid interference with existing broadcasts. Odds are that on long trips while driving from town to town the frequently will have to be readjusted to another open frequency. Aside from that I’d does work as described.
4,I have a old car and the CD thing no longer worked and I wanted to play songs from my phone. I got this device and it works!!! I only took one star off because it doesn’t work quiet well with the hands free phone answering feature. Which it’s fine with me. I mainly wanted to use it for my music. Easy set up and if you get the right radio station the sound is pretty clear.
5,I change vehicles everyday. Easy to plug in and set up. Less than 2 minutes to set it up. The type a and type c chargers in the front work flawlessly. The type a port on the side charges at a lower amperage that doesn’t work well with newer phones. Press and hold the orange button on the side to have the device put on a light show. Calls come through clear. Works best if the cigarette lighter port is more in the center of the vehicle. There is no loss of volume through the device when transmitting over the FM band. I like the idea that the volume can be controlled from the device as well as from your head unit.
5,Pretty easy to connect to car radio and personal phone. Good sound quality once you figure out the best balance between the device and phone.
4,It’s a great transmitter I recommend.
5,This product worked great my wife can now answer and talk on her phone  through the radio. I ordered 2 more for other vehicles without an accessory port.
5,Works great
5,I ordered this because my motorcycle does not have Bluetooth and I cannot be any more happier for the price. I cannot control songs from The handlebar controls however the volume does work and it is crystal clear even in the worst of areas where I cannot pick up a radio station. If your phone has service you are good to go!
5,Use in car for Bluetooth radio and calls. Sounds the same on my radio. When I get a call or make a call I just do it without having to switch modes or anything. It's automatic and goes straight back to radio as soon as call ends. No issues with it the person hearing me clear either. Love it
3,This adapter has adequate Bluetooth connectivity for it's price. There is no ability to power on or of without turning off your car or unplugging the adapter (stone age !) The so called volume control only gates what your phone sends it does not enhance the volume. There is no obvious channel control for the FM transmitter. So you can't choose the FM channel best for your area.
5,Works.
5,La carga rápida funciona bien. Sólo tarda un poco al enceder el vehículo no se conecta al Bluetooth inmediatamente.Además le falta el color naranja.
4,It works jut that not expected the unit to be losing connection to my phone wile driving listening to music or making a phone call the sound on the radio is good just i can not rely on it to make good Phone calls...Sorry.
4,The only not good thing is the sound a little not good when I play my song and it goes high volume but overall will be fine when it on low volume. And other thing is not good is that TF  card will disconnect some time but I can unplug and plug-in again to fix it.
5,This product is amazing! It lways connects right away and the sound is crystal clear. I highly recommend this to anyone looking into buying a car transmitter.
5,It work on my 04 toyota rav4 ! cell phone work great!
5,works very good
5,TerribleUnderpowered
5,Me agrado todo fácil de conectar sonido perfecto muy bonito diseño.
2,It was decent at first after a few uses I hear this high pitched sound coming from it. I wonder if it’s just mine or if others had this problem. Otherwise it’s easy to use and connect and it’s looks cool.
5,Mui fácil de usar
3,Everyone complains about not being able to hear me. Even Siri has problems which makes navigating in the car kinda weak. Looking back I wish I had gotten a different one one
4,Le entra interferencia
2,Cuando se sintoniza la emisora tiene un ruido molesto de fondo como estática no funciona bien con las llamadas la persona no me escucha cuando le llamo
4,Works great!
2,I had it for a week and decided to return it for a different brand due to its battery-sucking abilities I could not shut my car off with it plugged in. Also trying to speak to someone through it was horrible no one could hear me. The Bluetooth capabilities are good though. You would be better off with an aux cord or a different device.
2,It’s good for playing local fm channels but worse while playing with your Bluetooth connection to the phone too much background noise kinda rainy.
1,Likely my fault for not appreciating this product. I didn't know the features I wanted and got this on sale. Downsides: 1) You have to search using Google or another online search for an open channel then pair this to your radio. Thus someone has to find the channel first on a separate device and if you are moving that  may require two people (driver should not be distracted with a search). While this works when you are parked finding an unused station while going in and out of many radio station signal areas is difficult without a built-in search feature like my other FM bluetooth transmitter 2) Directions indicate using the "FM Transmitter answer key" to pair but if you look at the pictorial there is no "FM Transmitter answer key".  There is a "Multi-functional key" which I have to assume is the "FM Transmitter answer key". 3) The size is a bit awkward.
5,Works great now I can listen to music in the car from my phone and receive calls without holding my phone. Only gave 4 stars due to there is some static but not alot. Would recommend.
5,The product is amazing now I can listen music or pods cast from my phone on my car. The device besides working perfectly it’s very cute. I got so many compliments and also shared the links with some friends.
3,Easy to connect easy to use but the sound quality is not good tried listening to it on both my cars it doesn’t sound good good thing it came with usb c port that’s all I use it for now a car charger
4,The device is good for when you dont have Bluetooth. But when plugged in & paired with the phone it has a static noise
5,Toyota 2005. It was static at first but only because I didn’t have it on a clean radio station. I love it now and it sounds great. Doesn’t come with directions I had to watch review videos.
3,It's ok
3,Sounds quality is fuzzy and the neck on the item could be a little longer. Otherwise it works fine. Bluetooth seems to work pretty well.
1,When I first got this it worked great. A little fm static but better than regular FM. It was a little quirky to set up. Connected to my phone well so I could listen to music and answer my phone hands free. But after about 3 months it got harder and harder to hear the music. I was cranking the bluetooth device and my car stereo  way way up. Instead of music I was hearing FM static. Sounded like I was a long distance from the radio transmitter. I tried changing FM channel. Same issue. Went back to aux cable.  In the end it was a waste of money and time.
5,Good sound quality and design.
3,Spent hours getting it to connect to ANY radio frequency. It did once and lost connection since it would drain my car battery leaving it plugged in. Once it lost connection to a station it would not reconnect with my sound in my phone even though I was on obviously paired with Bluetooth. Too much hassle so I returned. Not for me. I purchased another so far so good not the same hassle at all.
1,Super easy to use and to connect however the sound quality is really poor. I tried it in both of my cars and the sound is fuzzy with constant static and I need to max out the car volume to listen in a decent volume level while in Bluetooth so I can't really adjust the volume because it is always set in 100% and everyone complains about not being able to hear me when I make calls however I can hear them very well... So the calls sound works perfect on my side but on the other side they can't hear me and music volume is not so good.
3,I bought it due to the micro usb c port and a continuous voltage readout. It's a good product until you receive calls. Mine had microphone issues
5,I can listen to my music choices that I love most
3,Me gusta que se conecta superapido y sostiene la conectividad en comparación a otros que he usado. Pero en el fondo se oye un pitido que me molesta
5,Fue muy fácil de instalar y tiene buena calidad en el sonido .
5,Works very well. Highly recommend buying it.
5,Está súper bien y bueno
5,Me gusta todo es práctico y lindo
5,Para el precio no se puede pedir más .
5,Use the product i y car.  Excellent choice.
5,Works great!
3,The clarity is not that good it got 3 stars mostly because of the other things it does.
5,I tried this type of transmitter a few years ago and was not impressed. This time around was wonderful. Plug and play- sound was excellent. It even tracks your car’s battery voltage on its screen. I’m using YouTube music thru my smartphone and it’s just great.
5,Works perfect sounds quality is great and the colors match my dash backlight
1,No one could hear me in the other end of the phone. Very poor microphone. If you're not making calls or worked fine.
1,The head was too big to plug into most of the 12-volt plugs in my car. When I found one in the back seat that would work. It went to a frequency that my radio would not tune to. I couldn't get it to go to another frequency. It went to 104.4 and the frequency 104.5 is a radio station. My car would tune to 104.3 and jump 104.4 right to 104.5.Revise: Product return accepted seller was very understanding. This product was just not a good fit for me but seller was very helpful.
5,My car
1,Returned due to poor sound quality and difficulty to pair with phone.
5,Was looking for a Bluetooth FM and this one works perfect!
5,Excelente calidad de audio  fácil de activar
3,Al bajar el volumen se escucha interferencia
5,Love this item! Very good quality..
5,Un producto excelente. Cumple con lo que dice. Funciona a la perfeccion!
1,Nunca pude hacer funcionar
1,It doesn’t work
1,Finally got it to connect to my phone but they hear me but I can’t hear them. Difficult to figure out. Another waste of money
1,This transmitter was awful.  The sound was a very poor quality with constant static.
5,Working really good
2,Ruidoso
1,Could hardly hear the music
1,It works but the sound quality is horrendous.
1,Like the led colors. Does not play loud at all
1,Connected easy but doesn’t come in clear
1,Calidad de sonido y poco volumen 😕😕
1,Not sure
2,Still works... But parts of it fell off within a month.
4,Instructions are a little unclear about exactly how you daily into the vacant station but once you are get that you are golden... Love the sound quality and phone connects immediately.
3,It’s fine but it’s not loud enough for ME connects great has a small staticky sound but it’s probably just the station it’s connected to
5,Easy to install I did it within 3mins. Love it
4,I like the looks setting it up was easy and it’s so nice to have in my patrol car so now I can listen to my tunes while cruising the streets. On the downside if you turn the volume way up on this unit sound quality goes to crap. So I found a good balance is to set the volume to 50% on here 100% on my iPhone and leave them there. Than just use the radio volume in my car to actually do volume adjustments. If it’s maxed out on the transmitter you get a lot of grainy feedback. However the annoying thing is now my phone is constantly notifying me that my “volume is set to a dangerous level” and keeps cutting the volume to 50% and it’s rather annoying
5,Works great and connects right away once paired.
5,This FM transmitter is very easy to connect without issues. It also has a screen display that easily tells you which station to connect. I like how it has USB charging connection too! The sound quality is better than expected definitely a must for older cars like mine!
5,Gift for 15th will see soon for my son brithday!
5,Work good
4,Took a minute to figure out a d there us some statid sometimes but I love this thing.
5,With one of our vehicles the power doesn't go to the cigarette lighter while it's off so it's not a problem but our older vehicle will continue to run off the battery. So this problem won't be an issue for everyone. Still we like to put it out of sight to deter burglars anyway.I also like that you can jump tracks adjust the volume and answer the phone with the buttons. And the fact that you can get a phone charger (not included) and plug it into it helps too so not only does it NOT use your phone's battery while it plays but it actually charges it.The stereo is a little quieter using this but it gets loud enough for our needs.Tip: set one of your car's radio stations to the frequency of your transmitter so you don't have to spin or repeatedly click the tuner anytime you switch between car radio and the transmitter.We love this thing and bought one for each vehicle.
5,It as he wanted.
5,Muy suave y fácil de usar
5,Excelente producto el unico detalle siento que se escucha un poco bajo en mi carro pero se escucha muy bien
3,Like how easy it is to connect to but hate the static especially when it's raining out side. There is only one channel that is not occupied and that is 89.9
5,Happy this works well with my old car.
5,I like the quality of sound.
4,I like it and worth the cost.
1,This item drained my battery after traveling 30 minutes and I was stranded when I arrived and then try to start it again and it wouldn’t.
5,Easy to set up. Easy to use. Calls that come through are clear and people on the other end can hear me perfectly. I ordered one for my car for a road trip and my husband liked it so much I bought one for his car too. Music is crystal clear and I love the light feature. It adds some fun light to your car! The charger ports are fast charge and I love that is has 2usb ports and a c-usb port. Everyone can use the charger and having 3 ports is a blessing. Highly recommend!!!!
5,Best of its type and I’ve bought them all!
5,Very nicely built. Lights are a good touch. Works as advertised.
5,Si fue mas de lo que esperaba muy bueno y economico
5,It works great love the different color options but my car the charger port is kinda under the dash under the radio which makes it very difficult I should have thought this purchase through more throughly.
5,Perfecto! Compatible. No es muy complicado para conectar y las llamadas se escuchan bien. La música también. Gracias por ayudarnos a evitar accidentes !!
